We report on the core aspects of our value creation process on the basis of our comprehensive materiality analysis.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nThe combined non-financial declaration for Deutsche Börse Group and the parent Deutsche Börse AG meets the requirements of sections 289b–e and 315b–c HGB and Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and the European Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (in the following EU Taxonomy). For the mandatory disclosure on our business model and the involvement of company management we refer to the chapters [\"Deutsche Börse: Fundamental information](#page-19-0) about the Group\" and [\"Strategy](#page-21-0)  and steering [parameters\".](#page-21-0) \n\nIn terms of the materiality analysis, description of management approaches and selected KPI the combined non-financial declaration follows the GRI (2021) standards. A detailed overview of all GRI indicators (GRI index) is available on our homepage. Further detailed information that is referenced in this report does not form part of the combined management report itself unless explicitly stated. To the extent that no explicit statements are made for the parent company, qualitative information within the meaning of the combined management report applies equally to Deutsche Börse Group and the parent company Deutsche Börse AG. In some cases, quantitative details concerning the parent entity and subsidiaries consolidated for the first time are disclosed separately.\n\nIn the course of our materiality analysis we continuously determine and evaluate the expectations and requirements of relevant internal and external\n\nstakeholders. In the year 2023 we surveyed several internal stakeholders in order to validate the results from 2021. This did not give rise to any changes.\n\n# ESG governance\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nSustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche Börse Group. It is therefore an essential element of corporate governance at the level of both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sustainability matters at Deutsche Börse Group. It was supported in the reporting year by the interdisciplinary Group Sustainability Board, which is chaired by the CFO. The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It deals with company initiatives relating to environmental, social and governance topics (ESG). This includes advising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate planning and controlling. The Group Sustainability Board has been replaced by the Group Sustainability Committee as of 1 January 2024. The Group Sustainability Committee is the new central management unit for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and supports and advises the Executive Board on all aspects of sustainability. The Group Sustainability Committee is intended to ensure the implementation of effective ESG practices in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-44-0\"></span>Image /page/44/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In addition to embedding ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this way, it is particularly important for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board committees, especially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination Committee. Current, relevant sustainability aspects also form part of the training programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and are dealt with in workshops and seminars.\n\n# ESG targets\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe following non-financial performance indicators have been identified as relevant for management and are divided according to the outcome dimensions of our value creation process, employees, customers and markets and social environment (see Corporate purpose and [value creation](#page-20-0) process):\n\n#### Non-financial key performance indicators\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n| Key performance<br>indicators            | Targets          | Actuals 2023    |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Employees                                |                  |                 |\n| Employee satisfaction1                   | >71.5%           | 73%             |\n| Share of women in leadership positions2  | >23%             | 23%             |\n| Customer and markets                     |                  |                 |\n| System availability (customer-facing IT) | >99.5%           | >99.9%          |\n| Social environment                       |                  |                 |\n| ESG ratings                              | >90th percentile | 98th percentile |\n\n1) Result without SimCorp\n\n2) Group target for senior management\n\nEmployees: We use two key performance indicators for measuring employeerelated factors: The first indicator is used to measure employee satisfaction on an annual basis and to take action based on the results.

For this reason we have an active People strategy, promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and systematically measure how attractive we are as an employer.\n\n# People strategy\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nWorking in its four strategic dimensions (Attract, Develop, Engage, Lead), our People strategy aims to attract the best talents, to develop them, to enable them to engage effectively and to continue their personal and professional development. These four dimensions form the foundation for four multi-year initiatives. With these initiatives we want to create a flexible, sustainable working environment that offers our employees excellent working conditions.\n\nWe successfully put our hybrid working model into practice in the framework of Trust@Work. With this hybrid working model that spans teams and projects we create the conditions for effective cooperation and focus particularly on important moments at work, mental health and well-being. This process is backed up by DigitizeHR, an initiative to fully digitise our operating HR processes and provide actionable analytics. MissionGrow! is our initiative for improving development opportunities for our employees. We have revised our career model to increase transparency, offer equality of opportunity and create a culture of continuous feedback. Based on the results of our People Survey 2021 and 2022, the first improvements have been implemented and additional focus areas for the WorkFlows initiative defined, in order to make Groupwide corporate processes more efficient and user-friendly as well as to implement dedicated measures based on notable results. The initiatives were launched in 2020 for a period of three years. Most of the milestones have been reached, and the remaining topics were transferred to the line organisation as part of continuous improvement.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/46/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In this spirit, we are continuously working on the implementation of our talent attraction strategy by considering the market situation and adjust it accordingly. Our strategy conveys the message that with us new talents become part of an international team that drives positive change and is characterised by curiosity and an open mind. We welcome people from all different origins, age groups and personal backgrounds, and want to give them the opportunity to grow with us. We achieve this via a number of employee development programmes. Internal training courses – on cloud technology, digital infrastructure and agile development methods, for example – are the logical continuation of these programmes and form the basis for structured retraining and further training. They are supplemented by mentoring programmes and personality-related training courses; on communication, taking responsibility or becoming a team player, for instance.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nWe expanded our existing range of development programmes in 2023. In particular we introduced activities for a structured programme intended to increase mobility between countries, locations and legal entities. In addition, we continued the LightUp! events for managers that were launched the previous year, which focus on refreshing competences and on expectations of modern managers. Taken as a whole, these formats strengthen our people development offering.\n\nFurther information about participation by employees and managers in training and development measures can be found [in the table \"Key](#page-50-0) data on Deutsche Börse Group's workforce as of 31 December 2023\".\n\nIn our annual staff survey, the People Survey, which also deals with subjects such as pervading strategy and teamwork, we got very satisfying marks for our attractiveness as an employer (82 per cent approval). The largely positive feedback underlines how Deutsche Börse Group stands for a working environment which makes it easy for staff to reconcile their career and their private life, with flexible models for working hours, allowances for childcare, part-time degree courses and part-time work. We also measure the average value of the two topics Strategic Alignment & Organisational Framework and Team Effectiveness & Collaboration annually. Our goal is to achieve an average value of more than 71.5 per cent in both topics. In 2023 we achieved a value of 73.0 per cent (without SimCorp). The following graph \"Results of our annual People Survey [2023\" shows what employees think](#page-47-0) about the subjects of understanding strategy and teamwork.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-47-0\"></span>Image /page/47/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The second chart, titled \"Team Effectiveness & Collaboration\", shows the distribution of responses with 3 negative (2022: 8 negative), 11 neutral (2022: 11 neutral), and 81 positive (2022: 81 positive).\n\n# Promotion of diversity and inclusion\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nDeutsche Börse Group operates around the world. At our 56 locations around the world we have over 14,000 employees from the most diverse cultural backgrounds. Our diversity is not only apparent in the origins of our employees, however, but also in the breadth of professional expertise and the many other differences that make up each individual personality in our team.\n\nWe are convinced that this diversity is decisive for our global success. We see the wealth of individual characteristics and strengths as the key to fulfilling our corporate purpose. For this reason, we strive to create an inclusive working environment in which everyone feels welcome and where they feel comfortable about contributing their ideas.\n\nWe are a signatory of th[e \"Diversity Charter\"](https://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/en/) and [\"Women's Empowerment](https://www.weps.org/)  [Principles](https://www.weps.org/) (WEPs)\" and acknowledge our corporate social responsibility as expressed in the Code of Conduct that applies throughout the Group. A public Diversity, Equity & Inclusion statement, in which we express our appreciation of all present and future employees and a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion policy constitute further elements of our diverse and inclusive working environment. We were also certified as a Fair Pay Analyst in 2023 for our successful endeavours to pay our staff regardless of their gender.\n\nWe do not tolerate any discrimination, whether on the grounds of age, gender, physical or health disability, sexual orientation and identity, ethnic origin or belief and irrespective of whether behaviour among employees or the placing of orders with third parties is concerned. We have therefore implemented processes designed to take equal treatment into consideration in the selection of staff and enable the Group to take prompt action whenever discrimination is suspected. Relevant cases were reported in 2023 either by our whistleblower system, to the respective Line Management or directly to the local Human Resources Department. All relevant cases requiring further remedial actions have\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The members of our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion council represent our global workforce and our different minorities; they inform and advise the Executive Board on initiatives and act as trusted third parties and personal contacts for the employees. The council strives to ensure that our everyday workspace continues to be a place where everyone feels appreciated and gets the opportunities they deserve. We also introduced the function of Chief Sustainability and Chief Diversity Officer in our Group in 2023, who is responsible for our diversity, equity and inclusion endeavours. The responsibilities of this dual role complement one another and underline the priority that we at Deutsche Börse Group give to all dimensions of environmental, social and governance policy. It remains a particular aspiration for us to increase the proportion of women at the management level. Our various programmes for promoting talent, and so also for qualifying women for management positions, contribute to the long-term advancement of women. In addition to our programmes, other measures include focused succession planning, as well as internal and external mentoring and training programmes. Exchanges among female colleagues are encouraged by an internal women's network. We provided special support for applicants and our employees directly and indirectly affected by the military conflict in Ukraine. We are also committed to providing better opportunities for underprivileged people through dedicated programmes. For details regarding targets for female quotas, please refer to the section entitled [\"Corporate governance statement](#page-111-0) – target figures for the proportion of [female executives beneath the](#page-111-0) Executive Board\" and th[e \"Com](#page-88-0)parison [with the forecast for](#page-88-0) 2023\".\n\nThe results of our staff survey on diversity, equity and inclusion confirm that our employees feel that they are welcome here with us (90 per cent positive) and that they are treated fairly and respectfully by their managers (94 per cent positive), regardless of their ethnic origins, their gender or their cultural background. This positive feedback reaffirms our intention to keep expanding our programme for diversity, equity and inclusion, in the spirit of creating a fully inclusive working environment.\n\n# Staff developments\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, Deutsche Börse Group employed a total of 14,502 staff (women: 5,836; men: 8,643; other: 23; 31 December 2022: 11,078), drawn from 131 nationalities at 56 locations worldwide.

Our products and services contribute to increase transparency for market participants and to enable them to price in and integrate market developments, changes and transformations. In this way, we enable our customers and market participants to make better-informed decisions.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n# System stability and availability\n\nThe availability of our customer-facing trading systems is an important indicator of the overall quality that we achieve when developing and operating our systems. Deutsche Börse AG operates its trading systems for the cash and derivatives markets as redundant server installations, distributed across two geographically separated, secure data centres. Should a trading system fail, it would be operated from the second data centre. Together with clients, Deutsche Börse successfully simulated this scenario again in 2023 – as well as the impact of local disruptions – within the scope of the FIA Test (the annual disaster recovery exercise conducted by the Futures Industry Association). This kind of disaster recovery test was also carried out after every larger software release. Other disruptions, such as technology malfunctions at individual workstations or personnel failures, were also tested.\n\nOur multiple testing of software, its verified roll-out and the seamless monitoring of servers, networks and applications has brought availability up to over 99.9 per cent in the reporting year. The plan is to introduce further technical measures to gain greater independence from providers of critical infrastructure technologies.\n\n# Information security\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nSecurity in all its facets has a high priority and is a strong focus of our Group. This does not just involve ensuring the availability of all services, but also the confidentiality of all information and the integrity of data. The range of threats increased again in 2023, not least due to geopolitical challenges and additional conflicts. Deutsche Börse Group is faced with the reality that cyber threats continuously adopt the latest technologies and so develop at high speed, and we adapt our systems and processes accordingly. Global regulation also continues to develop in order to meet the challenges. Deutsche Börse Group uses an extensive framework of policies and processes, supplemented by specific controls and technical abilities based on the international security standard ISO/IEC 27001.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group invests continuously in new security solutions, processes and projects, in order to address effectively the growing number of threats with state-of-the-art security technologies. Security measures are implemented at several levels (defence-in-depth), to reduce the risk of security incidents from individual error sources. To strengthen abilities to defend and protect against cyber-attacks, regular improvements are made to cyber-analysis, cyber-security automation, identification and prevention of attacks, vulnerability management, penetration testing and professional \"white hat\" attacks on the Group's own IT.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-53-0\"></span>Image /page/53/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

A key building block is the networking and reconnaissance of attack vectors in order to counter them without delay. This takes place via both digital interfaces and intensive exchanges as a member of national associations (Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics, CSSA), trade associations (World Federation of Exchanges, GLEX) and international networks (Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, FS-ISAC and the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative, CIISI-EU) which contribute significantly towards a forward-looking stance vis-à-vis cyber threats, and the development of strategies to fend off such threats. Furthermore, we are a member of the ECB's Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European financial infrastructures (ECRB) and are in close contact with the DAX40 CERT/CISO working group and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe information security function checks that the information security and information security risk management requirements are adhered to; it also monitors the systemic integration of, and compliance with, security policies in the context of product and application development. We operate a situation centre (Cyber Emergency Response Team, CERT) to detect and assess threats from cybercrime at an early stage, and coordinate risk mitigation measures in cooperation with the business units. The security of Deutsche Börse Group is also defined via its ecosystem of suppliers and outsourcing partners, which are integrated into the security concept. These partners are also benchmarked against Group requirements and integrated into the risk assessment.\n\nThe effectiveness of physical security is also permanently reviewed, with similar assessments and measures. A new security system was implemented in the offices at the individual locations around the world in 2023.\n\nFor a description of the risks in connection with information security we refer to the section in the chapt[er \"Risk report\".](#page-63-0) \n\n# ESG products\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe Deutsche Börse Group can increase its information transparency for investors, founders, asset managers and market participants, but also for external observers, by including ESG aspects in its product portfolio – be it by integrating ESG ratings, data and/or analysis, or by reporting data on trading volumes for securities, derivatives, renewable energies and/or commodities. For an overview of our ESG products, we refer to the GRI [index.](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/responsibility/sustainability/esg-reporting-ratings/gri) \n\n# Compliance\n\nResponsible business operations imply adherence to laws and regulations; they are also based on the principle of integrity and ethically irreproachable conduct at all times. We have implemented a compliance management system (CMS), which aims to prevent misconduct and avoid liability and reputational risks for the Deutsche Börse Group, its legal representatives, executives and staff. Beyond business-related and regulatory compliance requirements, the focus is on continuously strengthening compliance awareness throughout the Group.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

It is communicated to all employees in the Group and is available on the internet and intranet sites. Our code of business conduct summarises our core values and principles, which are intended to act as support for decision-making and enforce market integrity, transparency, efficiency and security. As a member of the AG Global Compact, Deutsche Börse AG is also committed to its principles, notably to support human and labour rights, to protect the environment and to work against corruption in all its forms, which includes extortion and bribery.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nObjectivity and integrity are the guiding principles for employees of Deutsche Börse Group. Our management is fully aware of their function as role models and the importance of the \"tone from the top\", which makes it possible to draw the attention of every individual employee towards managing compliance risks, both within the Group and among market participants. In order to sustainably anchor these guiding principles, and to prevent the Group and its staff from legal sanctions and reputational damage, Group Compliance has implemented risk-based compliance and preventive measures.\n\n## Compliance management system\n\nAn effective compliance management system (CMS) constitutes an indispensable element of good corporate governance. The Group Compliance function manages the CMS as a second line of defence function and ensures compliance with legislation, regulations and internal rules, and promotes best practice within the Group. In addition, the Group Compliance function monitors, controls and implements risk-based measures to mitigate risks with negative impacts (e.g. direct or indirect financial losses, regulatory penalties or reputational damage). On this basis the CMS provides the foundation for sustainable risk transparency; specifically, it facilitates the reduction of compliance risks in the areas of money laundering/terrorism financing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest and insider trading, as well as monitoring of requirements concerning financial sanctions and embargoes.\n\nThe appropriateness and effectiveness of the CMS are evaluated at least once a year on the basis of the individual CMS elements. The results are then presented to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG. The CMS elements particularly comprise:\n\n- Compliance risk analyses Identified and assessed risks provide the basis for determining the scope and focus of compliance activities and the management of the compliance risk profile.\n- Policies Compliance requirements that are regularly updated in accordance with applicable legislation, regulations and defined compliance targets.\n- Controls Regular and ad hoc controls are carried out to detect any compliance deficits.\n- Training Creation of a compliance mindset and appreciation by means of compliance training.\n- Reporting Regular and ad hoc reporting to the relevant stakeholders.\n- Internal & external audits Independent and objective review of the CMS in terms of its suitability and effectiveness, and identification of improvement potential.\n- Ongoing development of the CMS Projects and internal initiatives for the continuous development of the CMS.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

When determining the focus and improvements of the CMS, we are guided by applicable prudential legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as by the recommendations of internationally accepted standards. Based on these standards, Group Compliance identifies fields of action and measures to continuously adapt the CMS to changing requirements.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n# Compliance organisational structure\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG. Compliance reporting comprises the relevant compliance risks in the context of the compliance mandate, as well as other compliancerelevant information and activities.\n\nThe Group Compliance Committee is an interdisciplinary committee at management level that aims to support and advise the respective Executive Boards and Compliance functions within Deutsche Börse Group on compliance topics. Committee members are the senior managers of the business units, the Chief Compliance Officers and representatives of the relevant control functions for the Group as a whole.\n\nIn the context of the current geopolitical events and the resulting potential economic and political consequences, Deutsche Börse continues to analyse which risks could have an impact in the individual business areas and which measures need to be taken and implemented.\n\n## Data protection/protection of personal data\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nData protection serves to protect the personal data of individuals. It aims to protect the privacy of employees and customers, but also of third parties, such as service providers. To guarantee data protection, personal data may only be processed on the basis of a corresponding justification and in compliance with the principles of data protection.\n\nWe again took steps to comply with data protection legislation in 2023, particularly in terms of appropriate and transparent processing of personal data, and continuously developed our processes. The Executive Board appointed a data protection officer years ago and established the Group data protection function, which helps to ensure compliance with the data protection framework, itself based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation. It also drives the sustained development of a data protection culture in Deutsche Börse Group, which takes current commercial requirements and legislative changes into account by means of training courses and awareness activities.\n\nThe Group data protection function assumes the role of data protection officer for Group companies, insofar as this is required by law and it has been given the mandate as a central function. In this regard, the data protection function in-forms and advises the individual legal entities on data protection requirements. The data protection function also serves as a contact for data protection authorities, and supports the business units in their assessments of the data protection risks.\n\nThe data protection function's framework, as a second line of defence, is incorporated into the structure of our compliance safeguards. The data protection officers inform the respective Executive Boards annually and in an eventrelated manner on the status of data protection within the company and the measures to expand the data protection framework.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-56-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n[Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-26-0)\n\n#### Non-financial declaration\n\n[ESG governance](#page-43-0)\n\n[ESG targets](#page-44-0) \n\n[Employees](#page-45-0) \n\n[Customers and markets](#page-52-0) \n\n#### Social environment\n\n[EU Taxonomy](#page-58-0)\n\n[Risk report](#page-63-0) \n\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Key figures: corruption and data protection\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n|                                                                                             |   | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|-------|-------|\n| Corruption                                                                                  |   |       |       |\n| Prosecuted corruption cases                                                                 |   | 0     | 0     |\n| Percentage of business units for which measures have been taken to address corruption risks | % | 100   | 100   |\n| Number of employees who were trained in ABC measures (anti-bribery and corruption)1,2       |   | 8,181 | 1,563 |\n| Data protection                                                                             |   |       |       |\n| Number of justified customer complaints relating to data protection                         |   | 0     | 0     |\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n1) Employees of Deutsche Börse Group must repeat the web-based ABC training every two years. The training was revised in 2023, which is why the number of participants is significantly higher than in 2022. 2) The information is based on the employees that are connected to the central HR system. Group companies that are not connected to the HR system carry out compliance training on their own responsibility and not via the Group function.\n\n# Social environment\n\nOur value creation also goes far beyond the areas of direct concern to us as a company. Accordingly, for example, the environment, human rights issues in the supply chain or participation in financial centre initiatives fall within our focus.\n\n# Environment\n\nWe endeavour to contribute to the Paris Climate Agreement with our business activities. In 2023, we have adapted our climate targets in line with current market standards towards a long-term climate strategy. This comprises nearterm targets by 2030 and a net-zero target by 2045:\n\n# Near-term targets:\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n- Scope 1 & 2: Deutsche Börse aims to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by 2030 from a 2022 base year\n- Scope 3: Deutsche Börse targets to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, business travel and employee commuting by 42% by 2030 from a 2022 base year\n- Scope 3 Supplier Engagement: Deutsche Börse aims that 87% of its suppliers, as measured by its emissions of purchased goods and services and capital goods, will have science-based targets by 2028\n\n# Net-zero target:\n\n Scope 1, 2 & 3: Deutsche Börse strives to reduce its absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% by 2045, from a 2022 base year\n\nThese targets are to be validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in the first quarter of 2024. To achieve our targets, we will develop a transition plan in 2024, which will contain dedicated emission reduction measures.\n\nWe provide our stakeholders with transparent information about our environmental performance in our annual GRI Index. Last year we also published a progress report on the basis of the TCFD recommendations. This report summarises the information about how we deal with climate risks and opportunities and our science-based targets.

At the same time, we permanently and systematically seek dialogue with our internal and external stakeholders and thus determine the focus topics of our work. To do so we use investor days, employee and customer surveys, discussions with rating agencies and society at large, involvement in various initiatives and our regular materiality analysis, in which we ask our stakeholders about our company and our impact on society and the economy. Regarding the initiatives that we support, we refer to ou[r homepage.](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/responsibility/sustainability/materiality-analysis) \n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n# ESG ratings\n\nWe use this external validation of our own ESG efforts through ESG ratings to continuously improve and sharpen our ESG profile. Insights from the ESG rating processes were also factored into our materiality analysis. The following rating agencies measure the sustainability performance of Deutsche Börse AG every year and play a particularly important role for us:\n\n#### ESG Ratings\n\n| Rating<br>agency | Rating |      |\n|------------------|--------|------|\n|                  | 2023   | 2022 |\n| S&P              | 70     | 79   |\n| Sustainalytics   | 83     | 82   |\n| MSCI             | AAA    | AAA  |\n\n# Human rights\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nOur management approach for a Group-wide commitment to sustainability includes respect for human rights both in the supply chain and within the company. We have therefore published a Deutsche Börse Group Statement on Human Rights. It relates to Deutsche Börse AG and its subsidiaries and covers our relationships with employees, suppliers and customers. For this purpose, Deutsche Börse AG and centrally-serviced Group companies require their suppliers to comply with ethical standards of conduct in their dealings with employees, suppliers, customer and other third parties. This takes place in accordance with our Code of conduct for suppliers, the Code of business conduct and the policy statement on the human rights strategy of Deutsche Börse AG in accordance with section 6 (2) Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG).\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>Image /page/58/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that categorises economic activities as environmentally sustainable in terms of the following six environmental objectives:\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n- Climate change mitigation\n- Climate change adaptation\n- Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n- Transition to a circular economy\n- Pollution prevention and control\n- Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nArticle 8 of the EU Taxonomy defines the disclosure requirements for the proportion of turnover, capital and operating expenditure derived from and related to environmentally sustainable economic activities as well as energy production from nuclear energy and fossil gas.\n\n# Principles for determining the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible environmentally sustainable economic activities\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe Taxonomy-eligible turnover is divided by the Group's total turnover to determine the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible turnover. The denominator is based on sales in accordance with IAS 1.82(a) as presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For further details, please refer to [note 4, table \"Composition](#page-145-0) of our net revenues\" (Part 1-2)\"), column \"Net revenues 2023\").\n\nFor financial year 2023 we have not identified any Taxonomy-eligible turnover within the scope of application of the delegated acts.\n\n# Capital and operating expenditure\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe proportion of Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure (CapEx) is determined by dividing the Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure by total additions to intangible and tangible assets. For further details, se[e note 10, table \"Intangible](#page-155-0)  [assets\" a](#page-155-0)nd note [11, table \"Property, plant](#page-162-0) and equipment (incl. right-of-use [assets\\)\", lines](#page-162-0) \"Additions\".\n\nLikewise, to determine the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure (OpEx), the Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure is divided by the Group's total operating expenditure. For further details, see note [6, table](#page-148-0)  \"Composition of other [operating expenses\".](#page-148-0) \n\nFor financial year 2023 we have not identified any Taxonomy-eligible capital or operating expenditure within the scope of application of the delegated acts.\n\nEnergy production from nuclear energy and fossil gas\n\nFor financial year 2023 we have not identified any economic activities at Deutsche Börse Group involving energy production from nuclear energy and fossil gas.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In key aspects its risk profile therefore represents risks at the level of its subsidiaries, which include providers of strictly regulated financial market infrastructure. Risk at Deutsche Börse Group is expressed in terms of required economic capital (REC), which is calculated on the basis of assumptions. Required economic capital as at 31 December 2023 amounted to €1,619 million (2022: €1,754 million). It is covered by a risk-bearing capacity, derived from shareholders' equity, of €8,898 million (2022: €7,742 million). The risks of Deutsche Börse Group are therefore covered by its risk-bearing capacity. Looking at the Group companies it can be said that DBG has a conservative risk profile and that it monitors and limits risks closely.\n\nThe required economic capital is made up of operational risks, financial risks (including credit and market risks), business risks and pension risks. The following chart shows the specific breakdown of risks as at 31 December 2023:\n\nImage /page/63/Figure/23 description: The image is a donut chart showing the distribution of different types of risks. The chart includes the following categories: Pension risk (5%), Market risk (9%), Credit risk (28%), and Operational risks (58%). The values associated with each risk are: Pension risk (86, +57 year on year), Market risk (143, +29 year on year), Credit risk (457, +27 year on year), and Operational risks (933, -248 year on year).\n\nThere have been no material changes in the DBG risk profile compared to the previous year. The reduction of the required economic capital is partly due to a revision of scenarios at Clearstream Securities Services (€-81 million) and for non-banks. Including Crypto Finance in full caused credit risk to increase by €27 million and market price risk by €10 million. Methodological changes resulted in an increase of €57 million in the pension risk.\n\n",

We delivered very good figures and significantly exceeded the targets that we set at the beginning of the year. And with the decisions taken as part of Horizon 2026, the most recent update to our strategy, we have created a strong basis from which to develop in the years ahead.\n\nThe world in 2023 was dominated by Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine, the terrorist attack on Israel and the military response to it, the immeasurable suffering on both sides, and not least by a resurgence of populist politics and extremist tendencies in many democracies around the world. For the market participants that operate in this world, we at Deutsche Börse Group are not only a pillar of stability, but also an engine of change. Because we create trust in the markets of today and tomorrow, and we enable innovation through investment by creating access to capital markets.\n\nDespite this environment, the price fluctuations on the securities markets organised by us were lower last year than they have been for a long time: they were down by more than a third on the previous year, as measured by the VSTOXX® index. In the past, this would necessarily have resulted in lower revenues and profits for us, but that is no longer the case today. And that is not only good news for our workforce, but also – and especially – for you, our shareholders.\n\nHow did this development come about? We have consistently increased the share of our recurring income in recent years, taking it to 63 per cent last year. This is an achievement I am proud of, and on behalf of the entire Executive Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the employees of Deutsche Börse sincerely for their dedication.\n\nIn particular, I would like to express my gratitude for the success we had in initiating and completing the biggest transaction in our company's history by taking over the global software business SimCorp last year. It contributed 5 percentage points to our net revenue growth. This is almost one third of our total growth in net revenue. And with an increase of 17 per cent overall in 2023, this growth was gratifyingly strong.\n\nThe increase was also driven by organic growth with a strong secular – which means long-term – component. Here we reported an increase of 5 per cent. This secular growth was particularly marked in energy trading, where we gained additional market share and new customers. Then there were the strong tailwinds from rising interest rates. They benefit interest rate derivatives, but above all our net interest income. A total of 7 percentage points of our growth was due to these cyclical influences.\n\nSince we had our costs under control at the same time, despite higher capital expenditure, our pre-tax profits – or EBITDA – rose sharply by 17 per cent, the same amount as net revenues.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/0 description: The image shows a row of five gray circular buttons. The first button contains a house icon, the second button contains a magnifying glass icon, the third button contains a left-pointing arrow with a line, the fourth button contains a left-pointing arrow, and the fifth button contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### [Letter from the CEO](#page-2-0)\n\n[The Executive Board](#page-4-0) [The Supervisory Board](#page-5-0)\n\n[Report of the Supervisory Board](#page-6-0)\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nIn the course of the latest update to our strategy in the context of Horizon 2026, we have modernised our dividend policy. We have adjusted the range within which we distribute a dividend, which is now set at 30 to 40 per cent of profits. This leads on seamlessly from our performance in recent years and takes the further expected significant profit growth into account. And for the first time, we are also promising you that the dividend per share will go up every year. So for 2023, we are proposing a dividend of €3.80 per share. This is 6 per cent more than in the previous year and represents around 40 per cent of our profits. Share buybacks are now also part of our capital allocation strategy again. We already started in early 2024 and will be returning the record sum of €1 billion to you this year: €700 million via the dividend and €300 million via share buybacks.\n\nWhat else is coming up in 2024? We expect our net revenues to go up to more than €5.6 billion. And our forecast for EBITDA is more than €3.2 billion. This already includes the possibility of moderate interest rate cuts by central banks.\n\nFurther sustainable growth is now on the horizon. Our new Horizon 2026 strategy consists of three elements. First: we are banking on strong organic growth of 10 per cent per year; of which 7 per cent p.a. will come from our existing businesses, and our acquisition of SimCorp has already contributed another 3 per cent p.a. on average. Second: we have created a new segment: Investment Management Solutions (IMS). This comprises the software and analytics business of SimCorp and Axioma, as well as the index, data and sustainability business of ISS STOXX. IMS is our new strategic cornerstone, with great potential for organic growth and strong recurring revenues. It enables us to address the buy side, i.e. institutional investors, as direct customers. This is a market with above-average, secular growth. Third: we are expanding our digital platforms for existing and new asset classes. The partnership with Google Cloud that we also initiated last year plays a crucial role here.\n\nI am certain that with this strategy, Deutsche Börse is well equipped for more successful years of strong growth. We know where we want to go. And I promise you this on behalf of the entire Executive Board – we will not be resting on our past successes.\n\nYours,\n\nhuodel haius\n\nTheodor Weimer Chief Executive Officer\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>Image /page/4/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The first was to provide intensive support for the development of the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. Secondly, we were involved at an early stage in the full acquisition of SimCorp A/S (SimCorp) by Deutsche Börse AG, provided regular advice on the transaction and approved it. SimCorp provides integrated investment management solutions for the financial industry. Together, the merged businesses of SimCorp, Axioma, Inc. (Axioma) and ISS STOXX form the new Investment Management Solutions segment – a key step in the implementation of the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. Thirdly, we prepared the CEO succession and other important personnel decisions within the Supervisory Board. In Stephan Leithner, we have found a convincing successor for Theodor Weimer, whose appointment expires at the end of 2024. By this time, Mr Weimer will have reached the age of 65.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG dealt in depth and regularly with the company's position, prospects and fundamental strategic options. The Supervisory Board was also involved in an advisory capacity in Deutsche Börse Group's activities to buy and sell companies and parts thereof. We performed the tasks assigned to us by law and the company's Articles of Association and bylaws. We have advised the Executive Board regularly on its management of the company and monitored its work. We were involved in all decisions of fundamental importance.\n\nWe continued our overarching work on environmental, social and governance matters (ESG). In the reporting year, we concentrated on the social aspects of ESG.\n\nOur work in 2023 was dominated by a difficult ongoing geopolitical situation. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine continued into its third year and\n\nthe attack on Israel by the terrorist organisation Hamas was followed by intensive military operations and armed conflicts. This is accompanied by ongoing uncertainty about future inflation rates worldwide and slow economic growth, particularly in industrialised countries. Our global economic and financial system therefore remains faced with great challenges.\n\nAt our meetings, the Executive Board provided us with comprehensive and timely information in accordance with the legal requirements. The high frequency of plenary and committee meetings and workshops ensured an intensive exchange of information between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. In addition, the CEO kept the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously and regularly informed concerning the current developments affecting the company's business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions and the long-term outlook and discussed these issues with him.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meetings in 2023 were held at the company's headquarters and in Cork, Ireland. In the reporting year, we held a total of seven plenary meetings, including one extraordinary meeting on the planned takeover of SimCorp. Five workshops also took place as part of the regular training and professional development measures for the Supervisory and Executive Boards, focusing on the Horizon 2026 strategy process (March), cybersecurity and current threats (March), strengthening the German and European capital markets and the role of Deutsche Börse Group (June), sustainability regulations and their implementation (September) and the future world of work, concentrating on the labour markets for IT and financial services (September). In another workshop we dealt with the subject of artificial intelligence (December). The workshops were carried out by internal and external experts.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The Executive Board consulted the Supervisory Board at an early stage about the development of the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. This defines the strategic framework for Deutsche Börse Group until 2026 and also includes an updated climate strategy. We advised the Executive Board on all relevant aspects of the strategy. For details on the Group Horizon 2026 strategy, please refer to the \"Strategy and steering [parameters\"](#page-21-0) section in the combined [management](#page-16-0) report.\n\nAnother core element of our Supervisory Board work in the reporting year was the strategic expansion and reinforcement of our pre-trading business. Deutsche Börse AG acquired all the shares in the Danish company SimCorp, having successfully completed a public takeover offer. SimCorp is an international software company that provides integrated front-to-back investment management solutions for asset managers and other buy-side businesses. The business of the newly acquired SimCorp was merged with the data and analytics business of Axioma. The businesses of ISS, Inc. and STOXX Ltd. were also merged. A new segment, Investment Management Solutions, was created for the SimCorp, Axioma and ISS STOXX businesses in order to reflect the size and strategic importance of the pre-trading unit. At the Supervisory Board, we accompanied these structural changes and the expansion of our business and approved the necessary measures.\n\nAnother key focus of our Supervisory Board activities was the careful and early preparation of the upcoming change at the head of the Executive Board. With Stephan Leithner, we were able to ensure a convincing succession for Theodor Weimer. He will take up office on 1 October 2024. Mr Leithner and Mr Weimer will each exercise the function of Co-CEO until Mr Weimer's\n\nscheduled departure at the end of 2024. The Supervisory Board has thus created the conditions for an orderly change of leadership at an early stage.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would expressly like to thank Theodor Weimer, who took office at the beginning of 2018. He initially made a significant contribution to stabilising Deutsche Börse AG and from then on decisively and actively drove forward the strategic development of Deutsche Börse Group. Under his leadership, Deutsche Börse Group has grown steadily and sustainably and has seen extremely positive economic development.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also dealt with its future composition in the reporting year. Representatives of shareholders and employees will be elected for a period of office of three years in 2024. Please refer to the [\"Personnel](#page-15-0) matters\" section for details.\n\nIn the field of information technology, we discussed the partnership with a well-known global provider of cloud infrastructure and the main projects to develop the digital settlement platform D7 and an exchange for digital assets. Artificial intelligence and other new technologies, and the opportunities they represent for Deutsche Börse Group, were another key area of our work in this field. In view of their great importance for the Group and the infrastructure services it provides to financial and capital markets, we again discussed the subjects of information security and cyber resilience in depth.\n\nOne overarching focal area of our work was again the discussion of different topics relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. We discussed the updated climate strategy in detail, which is integrated into the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. The Supervisory Board also examined in detail sustainability regulations and reporting and their implementation at Deutsche Börse Group. Furthermore, we gained an overview of the future world of work in the areas of information technology and financial services, which are important for us. Sustainability targets also play an important role in the system\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

In the context of the financial statements, we adopted the 2022 remuneration report, which was approved by a majority of 91.69 per cent of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2023. The Supervisory Board also supported the Executive Board's proposal to hold the Annual General Meeting online in the reporting year. This was based, in particular, on the experience of online Annual General Meetings held by Deutsche Börse AG in prior years and the concrete form of the online Annual General Meeting as defined in the new legislation governing stock corporations. Based on the positive experience of online general meetings to date, the amended company's Articles of Association, which have been approved by the 2023 Annual General Meeting, enable a corresponding decision to be taken for the Annual General Meetings in the next two years.\n\nIn the reporting year, we again dealt with various legal matters, such as the current status of litigation and legal proceedings involving Clearstream Banking S.A. in the USA and Luxembourg, and the ongoing investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne regarding the conception and settlement implementation of securities transactions by market participants over the dividend date (cum-ex transactions). Market participants used such transactions to make unjustified tax refund claims. In this context, the Supervisory Board also dealt with investigations into such transactions by the stock exchange regulator in the German state of Hesse.\n\nOther important litigation and legal proceedings concerning Deutsche Börse Group were also a key aspect of our work on the Supervisory Board. The efficiency, suitability and effectiveness of the internal control system and the handling of findings by internal control functions as well as external auditors and regulatory authorities were another important area of our work.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board Chair held meetings with institutional investors and proxy advisers in November and December 2023 to discuss current governance topics affecting the Supervisory Board. These meetings focused on\n\nthe Supervisory Board's work in the reporting year, the outlook for 2024, the upcoming personnel decisions for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, as well as a proposed increase in Supervisory Board remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board Chair summarised his dialogue with investors in the plenary meetings and the meetings of the Nomination Committee.\n\nOur plenary meetings and workshops during the reporting period focused particularly on the following issues:\n\nAt our ordinary meeting on 8 February 2023, the Executive Board reported in a regular cycle on the status of the cross-divisional client relationship management. We also discussed the preliminary result for the 2022 financial year and the Executive Board's dividend proposal for 2022. After in-depth discussion, we set the amount of the variable remuneration for the Executive Board for 2022. We also adopted the 2022 corporate governance statement and approved the Executive Board's resolution to hold the 2023 Annual General Meeting in a new online format. The Executive Board informed us in detail about succession planning for the senior management level, the targets set and achieved in terms of gender diversity, and the steps taken to build a global pool of female talent. A status report was also given on the current status of the public takeover offer for the Danish software company SimCorp, and the further measures to build a new Investment Management Solutions segment including ISS, STOXX and Qontigo. The Executive Board also informed us about the structure of the partnership with a well-known global provider of cloud infrastructure. We also adopted measures following the effectiveness review in 2022.\n\nAt the ordinary meeting on 9 March 2023, the Executive Board again informed us at length and in detail about the planned voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp and the further measures to build a new Investment Management Solutions segment including ISS, STOXX and Qontigo.

We discussed the financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG for 2022, the consolidated financial statements for 2022 and the 2022 remuneration report in the presence of the auditors. We approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2022 and the 2022 remuneration report, having carried our own detailed examination, in line with the recommendation of the Audit Committee, which had previously carried out an in-depth preparatory examination of the documents. The meeting also gave us the opportunity to discuss matters with the auditors without the presence of the Executive Board. In addition to the Supervisory Board report for 2022, we also adopted the agenda for the 2023 Annual General Meeting and elected Barbara Lambert as the deputy chair of the meeting. Furthermore, we examined in detail the results of the review of the appropriateness of Executive Board remuneration that is carried out with external support every two years, and adapted the base salary and target remuneration for the Executive Board as from 1 June 2023, as well as the pension agreement with Heike Eckert. The Executive Board informed us of the personnel situation in Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nA strategy workshop also took place on 9 March 2023, in which the Executive Board presented the baseline for the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026, and explained the strategy process and timetable.\n\nIn an IT workshop on 9 March 2023, we also dealt with the topic of cybersecurity and had the current overall threat level explained to us from the perspective of the federal government.\n\nIn an extraordinary meeting on 25 April 2023, we approved the announcement of the voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp and the other transaction steps to create an Investment Management Solutions segment.\n\nAt our ordinary meeting on 16 May 2023, we discussed the upcoming Annual General Meeting with the Executive Board.\n\nThe ordinary meeting on 21 June 2023 was held at one of Deutsche Börse Group international offices again for the first time since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the meeting in Cork, Ireland, we examined in detail and discussed the Horizon 2026 Group strategy devised by the Executive Board. The Strategy and Sustainability Committee had previously discussed the new Group strategy and the updated climate strategy in detail. The Executive Board also informed us about the status of various legal matters, including the current status of the litigation and legal proceedings involving Clearstream Banking S.A. in the USA and Luxembourg, and a hearing by the Hesse Exchange Supervisory Authority on establishing the risk management system for the stock market operations of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. We also discussed the investigations by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne into security transactions by market participants over the dividend date (cum-ex transactions). The Executive Board also notified us of the status of a project to optimise internal processes.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

We dealt particularly with the current requirements for sustainability reporting and the implementation of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act at Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nIn another workshop on human resources on 27 September 2023, we explored how the world of work would look in future and found out about current and future developments on the national and global labour market for IT and financial services.\n\nIn the ordinary meeting on 28 September 2023, the Executive Board informed us about the result of the voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp, the further steps towards a complete acquisition of the company, its subsequent delisting and the planned integration steps. The Executive Board also explained the status of the transaction steps to create an Investment Management Solutions segment. We dealt with the effectiveness review to be carried out in the reporting year and with the forthcoming Supervisory Board elections in 2024. Ahead of these elections and the annual suitability review, we reviewed and specified the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board as scheduled. Finally, the Executive Board presented an overarching Group programme to address the regulatory findings in the field of information technology.\n\nIn an IT workshop for the Supervisory Board on 7 December 2023, we dealt extensively with the fundamentals, current developments and use cases of artificial intelligence, in order to provide a basis for the further discussions of this topic planned for 2024.\n\nIn the ordinary meeting on 7 December 2023, we adopted the budget for 2024 and set the Executive Board targets for the 2024 financial year. The Executive Board informed us about the results of the annual employee survey, the implementation status of the personnel strategy and the revisions that had been made to the strategy for 2024. We gained an impression of the performance of recently acquired companies and equity investments and the investments made in the context of Deutsche Börse Group's corporate venturing activities. We discussed and adopted the results of our annual effectiveness review in accordance with section D.12 of the German Corporate Governance Code, the annual suitability assessment of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, as well as the upcoming year's training plan for the Supervisory Board. We also adopted the declaration of conformity in accordance with section 161 Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act) for the 2023 financial year, which can be viewed [at www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/declaration-of-conformity) > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Declaration of Conformity. Furthermore, we resolved to propose an adjustment to Supervisory Board remuneration at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The Executive Board informed us of the current status concerning the Investment Management Solutions segment.\n\nMartin Jetter, the Supervisory Board Chair, presented the agenda before each Supervisory Board meeting and informed the Supervisory Board about current matters. Theodor Weimer, the CEO, also informed us about the current developments affecting the company's business and significant transactions at the start of every meeting. At the end of each meeting the Supervisory Board members talked openly and extensively among themselves, without Executive Board members, about the meeting itself and general topics. A similar discussion also took place at the Supervisory Board meeting on 8 March 2024 in which we approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023, and which was also attended by the auditors. From 2021 onwards, the members of the Audit Committee have had regular talks with the external auditors without the Executive Board members.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The committees are responsible primarily for preparing the decisions to be taken by, and topics to be discussed in, the plenary meetings.

The individual committee chairs reported in detail to the plenary meetings on the work performed by their committees. The Chair of the Supervisory Board chairs the Nomination Committee, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, the Chairman's Committee and the Mediation Committee.

Pursuant to section 31(3) MitbestG, it submits proposals to the Supervisory Board for the appointment or dismissal of Executive Board members when a two-thirds majority has not been reached. The Mediation Committee only convenes as required. There was no need for the Mediation Committee to hold a meeting during the year under review.\n\n# Audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, based in Frankfurt am Main, (PwC) audited the annual financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG, the consolidated financial statements and the integrated combined management report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, together with the accounting system, and issued an unqualified audit opinion. The condensed financial statements and interim management report contained in the half-yearly financial report for the first six months of 2023 were reviewed by PwC. The documents relating to the financial statements and the reports by PwC were submitted to us for inspection and examination in good time. The auditors responsible were Marc Billeb and Michael Rönnberg. The auditors attended the relevant meetings of the Audit Committee and the meeting of the full Supervisory Board to discuss the financial statements – in all cases, also without the Executive Board members, they reported on the key results of their audit. In particular, they explained the net assets, financial position and result of operations of the company and the Group and were available to provide further information. They had regular exchanges with the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Audit as well as the Risk Committee, also outside the meetings. The audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report and non-financial declaration did not give rise to any objections. No facts were identified in the course of the audit that would indicate an inaccuracy in the declaration of conformity pursuant to section 161 AktG declared by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, for which an obligation of the auditor to notify the Chair of the Audit Committee had been agreed. There were also no objections raised as a result of the nonmandatory audit of the form and content of the remuneration report. The Supervisory Board discussed the services provided by PwC on a regular basis in addition to their statutory auditing services. There were no grounds for suspecting that the auditor's independence might be impaired.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>Image /page/15/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

It is satisfied that the reports meet the statutory requirements under sections 317 and 321 HGB, in particular. The committee reported to the Supervisory Board on its examination and recommended that it approve the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur own examination – during a plenary meeting – of the 2023 annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and the integrated combined management report did not lead to any objections. We therefore approved the result of the audit. We approved the annual financial statements prepared by the Executive Board and the consolidated financial statements at our meeting on 8 March 2024, in line with the Audit Committee's recommendation. As a result, the annual financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG have been adopted. The Audit Committee discussed the Executive Board's proposal for the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus (Bilanzgewinn) with the Executive Board. The discussion covered company liquidity, its financial planning and shareholders' interests. Following this discussion and its own examination, the Audit Committee concurred with the Executive Board's proposal for the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus. After examining this ourselves, the plenary meeting of the Supervisory Board also approved the Executive Board's proposal.\n\n# Personnel matters\n\nThere were no personnel changes in the Supervisory Board during the reporting period. Michael Rüdiger decided not to stand again for election to the Supervisory Board. He will therefore leave the board when his term of office ends at the close of the Annual General Meeting in 2024. The Supervisory Board discussed his succession in the reporting year and will propose Sigrid Kozmiensky for election by the Annual General Meeting in 2024.\n\nNo personnel changes were made with regard to the Executive Board in 2023.\n\n# Dealing with conflicts of interest\n\nIn order to rule out in advance even the impression that their personal interests might affect their work and decisions in the Supervisory Board, all Supervisory Board members disclose to the Chair of the Supervisory Board, without delay, any conflict of interests, particularly those that may arise due to an advisory function or decision-making role at customers, suppliers, lenders or other business partners. One Supervisory Board member did not take part in discussions or decisions on the subject of cum-ex transactions in order to avoid any potential conflict of interest. With regard to another potential conflict of interest in view of his roles as Supervisory Board Chair of BlackRock Asset Management Deutschland AG and Chair of the Board of Directors of BlackRock Asset Management Schweiz AG, Michael Rüdiger did not take part in discussions or decisions in the Supervisory Board on the acquisition of SimCorp. Lagebericht Abschluss\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees for their great commitment and good work in 2023, which remained challenging due to the ongoing geopolitical situation and its economic effects. die gute Arbeit im Jahr 2020, das aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie überaus herausfordernd war.\n\nFrankfurt/Main, 8 March 2024 for the Supervisory Board\n\nMartin Fye\n\nMartin Jetter Chair of the Supervisory Board\n\nVorsitzender des Aufsichtsrats\n\n12\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-16-0\"></span>Combined management report\n\nNettoerlöswachstum\n\n+XX%\n\nCAGR 2019–2022\n\n- 18 [Deutsche Börse:](#page-17-0)  [Fundamental information about](#page-17-0)  [the Group](#page-17-0)\n- 22 [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n- 27 [Economic situation](#page-26-0)\n- [44 Non-financial](#page-43-0) declaration\n- 64 [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- 83 [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- 88 [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- 90 [Report on post-balance sheet](#page-89-0)  date [events](#page-89-0)\n- 91 [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- 115 [Deutsche Börse AG](#page-114-0)  [\\(notes based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- 120 [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/12 description: The image is an abstract design featuring a blue background with a grid-like pattern.

On the left side of the diagram are the input factors, which include intellectual capital, human capital, financial capital, and partnerships. These input factors feed into the business model, which is represented by the Deutsche Borse Group logo. On the right side of the diagram are the outcome dimensions, which include economic position, employees, customers and markets, and social environment.\n\nAccording to the terminology used by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), we essentially need four capitals (input factors) to implement our business model. We deploy these capitals within a binding regulatory\n\nframework: intellectual capital, human capital, financial capital and partnerships. They enable us to create value with our business model. The impact that we have with our business model can be thought of in the following four outcome dimensions:\n\nEconomic situation: As a fast-growing company we create financial value, substance and returns on which our investors, employees, customers and society can build.\n\nEmployees: As an employer, we take wide-ranging measures to enable our employees to fully realize their development potential. We also work to boost the satisfaction of our employees and their loyalty to our Group. All this helps to build our employer brand, which is the main reason why talented people choose us.\n\nCustomers and markets: Our products and services contribute to increase transparency for market participants and to enable them to price in and integrate market developments, changes and transformations. In this way we enable our customers and market participants to make better-informed decisions.\n\nSocial environment: Our value creation also goes far beyond the areas of direct concern to us as a company. We thus focus on the environment and human rights aspects of our supply chain and are involved in initiatives to strengthen the local financial industry.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-21-0\"></span>Image /page/21/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

As a fully integrated end-to-end provider we offer our customers a broad value chain with innovative solutions.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nThe market environment in which we operate is very dynamic. This applies not only to the markets themselves, which we organise and operate via our platforms. Our competitive environment as a market infrastructure operator is also permanently in flux. The provider landscape has consolidated drastically in the past decades, which has strengthened the remaining operators of market infrastructure and enabled them to extend their business in various directions. New business activities and new customer groups beyond the core business have moved to the foreground. Today, market infrastructure providers not only service the sell-side, like banks and financial service providers, but rather have extended and diversified their customer target group.\n\nWe too have continued to expand our market leadership in the European Union as a fully integrated end-to-end provider in the financial markets. By this gradual expansion of our business model we are now also able to cater to the buy-side as a new customer group. Our broad value chain now includes solutions for investment management, trading and clearing through to securities services. We have achieved this by both organic growth and targeted acquisitions. We see ourselves as a hybrid of technology company and financial services provider, with a value chain that has a high degree of integration and diversification. As a result, our business model is characterised by great scalability, a low risk profile and low capital intensity, with a high affinity for technology at the same time. This is not only a unique sales proposition in international competition, but also forms the basis for attractive growth opportunities and also makes our business model more robust and resilient to market fluctuations or secular shifts.\n\nAll this has enabled us to exceed the financial targets we set ourselves as part of our Strategy Compass 2023. We achieved the original guidance for 2023 back in 2022. And we revised the 2023 targets upwards several times during the course of the year.\n\n#### Target achievement Compass 2023\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n| Key performance<br>indicators                                            | Target Compass<br>2023 | Target achieve-<br>ment 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Net revenue                                                              | ~€4.3 billion          | €5,076.6 million             |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation<br>(EBITDA) | ~€2.5 billion          | €2,944.3 million             |\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

It defines the strategic direction and financial targets for the years ahead through to 2026 and thus secures our outstanding market position and continued viability. The core of Horizon 2026 is the business strategy that we have mapped out comprehensively and in detail at a Group and segment level. The relevant strategic aspects of human resources, information technology, environment, social and governance, and particularly climate action, are integral parts of our business strategy. Further information on these topics can be found in the chapter [\"Non-financial declaration\".](#page-43-0) The relevant financial strategy for our Group is reflected in the adjusted framework for capital allocation. It backs up our business strategy and forms the basis for our further corporate growth.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Strategy and steering parameters\n\nIn our strategy we make a fundamental distinction between organic growth, generated from existing operations, and inorganic growth by means of focused acquisitions to expand or deepen our value chain. Organic growth consists mainly of secular initiatives such as product innovation, additional market share or new customer gains, as well as cyclical growth due to interest rate effects or higher trading volumes due to market fluctuations.\n\nOur growth course as defined in Horizon 2026 is built on three strategic pillars.\n\n- Strong organic growth: As in the past, organic growth forms the foundation for Horizon 2026. We benefit from long-term industry trends in attractive markets and strive for profitable organic growth of around 7 per cent per year on average. Secular growth is intended to account for by far the largest share of this.\n- Investment Management Solutions: With the acquisition of SimCorp we complement our former activities in the area of data and analytics with a holistic offering for institutional investors by pooling end-to-end solutions for investment management and high-quality data in a new segment. In addition, we expect the acquisition of SimCorp completed in 2023 to deliver an average of around 3 per cent inorganic growth per year, and so increase the share of recurring revenue.\n- Digital leadership: We intend to keep expanding our leading role in the digitalisation of assets. With D7 we already operate in the Securities Services segment one of the leading digital infrastructures globally in the post-trade area with more than 7,000 digital issuances. Cloud technologies and artificial intelligence also help us to increase our effectiveness and efficiency, and to open up new business areas at the same time.\n\nDeutsche Börse is aiming for overall growth in net revenue of 10 per cent p.a. on average until 2026. The reference year for this is 2022. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) should increase to an average of 11 per cent p.a. Earnings per share before the effects of purchase price allocations (cash EPS) should increase over the same period by an average of 11 per cent a year.\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n#### [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-26-0)\n\n- [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)\n- [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Overwiew of targets \"Horizon 2026\" targets\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n| in €                                                                       | Basis 2022  | Targets of<br>\"Horizon 2026' |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| Net revenue                                                                | 4.3 billion | ~ 10 % CAGR                  |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisa-<br>tion (EBITDA) | 2.5 billion | ~ 11 % CAGR                  |\n| Cash EPS                                                                   | 8.61        | ~ 11 % CAGR                  |\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Strategy and steering parameters\n\nTo achieve these targets, we are addressing the following market trends in our four operating segments.\n\n Investment Management Solutions: The increasing importance of the buyside in financial markets and the outsourcing of investment operations to central service providers, as well as higher demand for index-driven investments, ESG services and reliable data\n\n- Trading & Clearing: The shift from OTC to on-exchange trading, greater use of fixed income products in response to restrictive monetary policies, increasing demand for repo products and rising demand for digital assets\n- Fund Services: The trend towards outsourcing of fund distribution operations to boost efficiency and the increasing demand for fund data services and analytics\n- Securities Services: The strong increase in outstanding debt and rising demand for repo products and financing solutions via the capital markets as a result of the returning strong positive interest rates\n\nAdditional cyclical growth components may include higher market volatility in the Trading & Clearing segment, as well as higher long-term interest rates in Fund Services and Securities Services. In addition, targeted acquisitions may also contribute to future growth if they are strategically and financially attractive.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Growth

\"Horizon 2026\"\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nWe review our organic growth initiatives continuously. We capitalize particularly on the expansion in secular growth markets and asset classes. At the same time we always focus on the needs of our customers and technological advances. Key initiatives and growth drivers are also described in more detail in the \"Report on [opportunities\"](#page-82-0) section.\n\nCombined management report Strategy and steering parameters\n\nThe \"Report on expected [developments\" se](#page-87-0)ction describes expected developments in the 2024 financial year.\n\nAdditionally, the remuneration system for the Executive Board and executive staff has also created a number of incentives for growth in the individual business divisions. Th[e \"Remuneration report\"](#page-249-0) provides a detailed description of all targets.\n\n# Financial steering parameters\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe most important key performance indicators to manage of our economic situation are net revenue and EBITDA, since these are vital for the successful execution of our growth strategy and set incentives for profitable growth. The basis is net revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements. This consists of sales revenue, plus net treasury income from banking business and similar business, plus other operating income, less volume-related costs. One of the most important pillars of the corporate strategy, in addition to absolute growth, is the profitability of this growth. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and as such is a gauge of our operative earning power. It is a common indicator for measuring profitability. Another key financial control criterion is earnings per share before purchase price allocations (Cash EPS), since all profit and loss effects are reflected in this indicator, and it can therefore be used to measure the successful implementation of the growth strategy.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-26-0\"></span>Image /page/26/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

We increased our net revenue significantly again in 2023. We benefited from both organic growth and the acquisition of SimCorp.\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nIn the following section we look at the macroeconomic and sector-specific environment, the course of business, our earnings, the development of profitability and other financial performance indicators.\n\n# Macroeconomic and sector-specific environment\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nSecular growth factors and M&A are a core element of our strategy. We can plan them, manage them and adjust them to external circumstances. Our business performance is also influenced by macroeconomic and sector-specific factors that are beyond our direct control, however.\n\nIn 2023 these included:\n\n- Persistently high inflation, which did fall over the course of the year, but remained significantly above the central banks' target rates\n- The resulting ongoing restrictive monetary policy of central banks in the USA and Europe, and their insistence that this policy will be pursued until inflation rates approach the desired level\n- The insolvency of some US banks in mid-March and the consolidation on the Swiss banking market\n- Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine and the related sanctions and effects on global supply chains and energy supply\n- The Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 and the resulting new escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East since then\n\nIn its January 2024 estimate, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted slower global economic growth of 3.1 per cent for 2023 (2022: +3.5 per cent). It expects the euro area to grow by 0.5 per cent (2022: +3.5 per cent) and for the economy in Germany to even contract by 0.3 per cent (2022: +1.8 per cent).\n\n# Business developments\n\nThe 2023 financial year was dominated by the activities of central banks to combat high inflation rates. Inflation declined over the course of the year in both the USA and Europe, but rates were still too high, making a looser monetary policy impossible.\n\nThe ECB raised its deposit rate in several stages, most recently to 4.00 per cent in September, while the Federal Reserve increased its target range for the federal funds rate to 5.25-5.50 per cent in July and has left it at this level since. Both central banks said that any change in their restrictive monetary policies depended on the future development of key economic indicators. Higher interest rates mean on the one hand that we profit from higher net interest income in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments. At the same time there were phases in which higher interest rates increased market participants' hedging requirements and led to greater trading activity in fixed income products in the Trading & Clearing business. Central banks' withdrawal from the money market also caused higher demand for repo products. In the commodities business, trading activity returned to the power markets, with\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Image /page/27/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

This was the result of lower and more stable power prices, which reduced the margin requirements.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nVolatility on stock markets, as measured by the VSTOXX, was significantly lower than the previous year. Higher trading volumes were only seen briefly in March following the insolvency of several US banks and the consolidation on the Swiss banking market. The VSTOXX stood at an average of 18 points, which was 35 per cent lower than the average for the previous year. Trading activity in securities and equity index derivatives in the Trading & Clearing unit was correspondingly lower.\n\n# Results of operations\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the results of operations in financial year 2023 were affected significantly by both secular and cyclical growth factors. The biggest driver of year-on-year net revenue growth in the Group was a sharp rise in interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic, combined with only a moderate decline in cash deposits from our customers in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments, resulting in very strong growth in net interest income. Higher interest rates and a downwards trend in the money supply had a positive impact on the use of interest rate derivatives and repo products in the financial derivatives business within the Trading & Clearing segment. In this context the rise in the outstanding notional volume of centrally cleared overthe-counter (OTC) traded and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives had a positive influence on net revenue. In addition, lower margin requirements as a result of reduced volatility on power and gas markets, and new customer gains, increased trading volumes for power derivatives in the commodities business in the Trading & Clearing segment, which was in turn reflected in higher net revenue. The Investment Management Solutions segment profited from both continuous product demand in Governance Solutions, Corporate Solutions and ESG, and from contract renewals with customers in the Analytics business. The acquisition of SimCorp, which was fully consolidated into the\n\nGroup in the fourth quarter, also made a decisive contribution to M&A growth in this segment. In contrast to the previous year, which saw a positive one-off effect of €63 million in total in net revenue, there were no significant non-recurring effects on the revenue side in the reporting year.\n\nOur net revenue therefore increased to €5,076.6 million in the financial year 2023 (2022: €4,337.6 million). The net revenue increase of 17 per cent consisted partly of 5 per cent secular growth, which came largely from new customer gains and gains in market share, the expansion of customer relationships and product innovations. Cyclical growth effects accounted for a further 7 per cent. The global increase in interest rates deserves particular mention. Another 5 per cent comes from M&A growth in connection with the acquisition of SimCorp.\n\nOperating costs rose by 16 per cent to €–2,118.3 million in financial year 2023 (2022: €–1,822.2 million). Around 5 per cent resulted from organic cost growth, which also includes an increase in the headcount compared with the previous year, inflation effects and investments in secular growth measures. 10 per cent of the increase is due to the SimCorp acquisition effect, related transaction costs of €22 million and the costs of realising potential synergies in the new Investment Management Solutions segment of €56 million.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The result from financial investments, which is included in EBITDA, came to €–14.0 million (2022: €10.2 million). In the course of the purchase of minority interests in ISS and the bundling of expertise in our Investment Management Solutions segment, one-off adjustments to the valuation of a contingent purchase price component resulted in losses of €9 million. The decline was also due to valuation effects from minority interests.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nAmortisation, depreciation and impairment losses came to €418.4 million (2022: €355.6 million). The change stems mainly from purchase price allocations for the acquisition of SimCorp in the Investment Management Solutions segment, as well as a €25 million write-down on intangible assets at Crypto Finance AG in the Trading & Clearing segment.\n\nOur Group's financial result of €–74.1 million (2022: €–63.5 million) was mainly determined by the issue of new corporate bonds with medium and long maturities, and short-term debt instruments for a total volume of €4 billion to finance the acquisition of SimCorp. The Group's tax ratio of around 27 per cent was slightly higher than the previous year.\n\nOverall, the net profit for financial year 2023 attributable to Deutsche Börse Group shareholders was €1,724.0 million (2022: €1,494.4 million), which represents a year-on-year increase of 15 per cent. Undiluted earnings per share were €9.35 (2022: €8.14) for an average of 185.1 million shares. Earnings per share before purchase price allocations (cash EPS) stood at €9.98 (2022: €8.61).\n\nNet profit for the period attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to €72.8 million (2022: €68.8 million) and comprised mainly earnings attributable to non-controlling shareholders of EEX and ISS STOXX.\n\n# Comparison of results of operations with the forecast for 2023\n\nFor financial year 2023 we originally forecast an increase in net revenue to within a range of €4.5-4.7 billion. We increased this forecast several times over the course of the financial year, and at the time the results of the third quarter were published we were predicting net revenue, now including SimCorp, of around €5.0 billion. In line with our strategy we also anticipated an increase in secular net revenue growth of at least 5 per cent. Given the very good cyclical performance in financial year 2022, which was characterised by much higher market volatility and a global rise in interest rates, we assumed that the cyclical net revenue contribution in 2023 would be lower, or even negative. However, as inflation rates increased significantly in both the USA and Europe, the central banks moved to intervene quickly, resulting in another significant interest rate hike. Net interest income from the banking business rose accordingly in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments to a total of €702.4 million (2022: €260.0 million). In addition, the acquisition of SimCorp, which was not included in the original forecast for 2023, contributed another €198.0 million to the Group's net revenue. With net revenue of €5,076.6 million we therefore significantly exceeded our original forecast. Net revenue growth of 17 per cent includes 5 per cent secular growth. This means we also delivered on our forecast for secular net revenue growth.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Over the course of the financial year this forecast was also raised, to around €2.9 billion. Our operating costs were mainly affected by the acquisition of SimCorp and went up by 16 per cent. They include both transaction expenses and the costs to achieve potential synergies in the new Investment Management Solutions segment totalling €79 million. Despite this, EBITDA rose by 17 per cent to €2,944.3 million and so was at the upper end of our forecast.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n#### Comparison forecast 2023 with financial year 2023\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n|                                                              | Forecast 2023 €bn | Actual 2023 €m |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Net revenue                                                  | ~5.01             | 5,076.6        |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation | ~2.92             | 2,944.3        |\n\n1) Originally €4.5–4.7 billion (guidance raised over the course of the financial year) 2) Originally ~€2.6–2.8 billion (guidance raised over the course of the financial year)\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\n# Comparison of financial position with the forecast for 2023\n\nAs part of the ongoing development of our capital management we adjusted the relevant rating ratios in 2023 (see \"Capital [management\" s](#page-37-0)ection). As expected, our ratio of net debt to EBITDA of 2.19 at year-end was just below the new maximum figure of 2.25 for rating purposes, due to the acquisition of SimCorp. The ratio of free funds from operations to net debt of 36 per cent was slightly below the now minimum target of 40 per cent, as expected, which was also due to temporarily higher borrowing for the SimCorp transaction. The cash flow from operating activities was again significantly positive. Based on a dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting of €3.80 per share, the distribution quota of 40 per cent is within the range of 30 to 40 per cent communicated as part of our redeveloped capital management. The dividend of €3.60 proposed the previous year was paid as planned in May. The cash flow from operating activities was significantly positive. Investment in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of €264.0 million was not completely in line with the budget of €300 million.\n\n# Development of profitability\n\nDeutsche Börse Group's return on shareholders' equity expresses the ratio of net income after taxes to average equity available to the Group during the course of 2023. In the reporting year, it was at 19.5 per cent (2022: 18.8 per cent).\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

It is divided into the Software Solutions and the ESG & Index units.\n\nIn the Software Solutions unit we report on the activities of SimCorp, which now also includes the analytics business of Axioma. SimCorp is a renowned provider of investment management software and offers a market-leading frontto-back investment management platform. As a Software-as-a-Service-(SaaS) and Business-Process-as-a-Service-(BPaaS) player for global asset owners, asset managers and asset servicers, our open platform provides both flexibility and operating efficiency for our customers in all asset classes. In today's fastmoving markets the top priority is also a comprehensive and agile approach to portfolio and risk management. For this reason we have bundled the portfolio construction and risk management solutions from Axioma (Analytics) with our investment management platform. By combining our strengths we can make\n\nmore effective use of our respective assets and resources and offer our customers even more added value. Net revenue in this unit is made up of licensing, update and service revenue for on-premise and SaaS solutions, as well as revenue from the analytics business. Revenue from professional services activities is recognised under Other.\n\nIn the ESG & Index unit we report on both the ESG and Index business generated by our ISS STOXX subsidiary. Under the umbrella of ISS STOXX are the STOXX Index business (also comprising STOXX® and DAX® indices) as well as the four existing business units of ISS: ISS Governance, ISS ESG, ISS Corporate Solutions and ISS Market Intelligence. The combination of robust and diverse ESG and governance datasets from ISS with the all-round expertise of STOXX in producing benchmarks and customer-specific indices, as well as in index production and settlement, enables ISS STOXX to operate effectively on a global basis. Net revenue in this business is made up of ETF, exchange and other licence revenue. While ETF licence revenue depends on the volume invested in exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) based on STOXX® and DAX®, exchange licence revenue are derived mainly from the volume traded in index derivatives on STOXX and DAX indices on Eurex. By licensing sustainable index solutions that mirror the entire index product portfolio, we contribute to the ESG trend. Net revenue at ISS is made up of ESG revenue, which comprises corporate and governance solutions, ESG data, research and ESG ratings. Market intelligence activities are presented under Other.\n\nIn the financial year the Software Solutions unit of the segment profited particularly from higher net revenue thanks to new customer gains and contract renewals by existing customers, which are mainly linked to the timing of transactions. This relates both to the performance in the existing analytics business and to that of SimCorp. Net revenue from SimCorp was consolidated for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was somewhat above our original expectations due to a higher number of new contracts for software solutions. As a result of the acquisition, the segment costs were driven largely by the related transaction costs of €22 million and the costs of €56 million for realising\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>Image /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The corporate solutions offered by ISS for companies also continued to experience interest. Compared with the previous year, the exchange rate effects of a weaker US dollar on average had a slightly negative impact on net revenue.\n\nIn the Index business, lower trading activity in equity index derivatives on our derivatives exchange Eurex had an impact on Index net revenue. It declined year on year by 10 per cent. By contrast, the trend towards exchange-traded index funds and correspondingly higher investment volumes support business with ETF licences. It increased by 5 per cent compared with the previous year. Net revenue in the Index unit was therefore slightly up on the previous year. However, Index net revenue the previous year included a one-off, volumebased licence fee reimbursement of €19 million from the Trading & Clearing segment.\n\n# Trading & Clearing segment\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n#### Key indicators Trading & Clearing segment\n\n| in €m                    | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Net revenue              | 2,262.8 | 2,187.1 | 3 %    |\n| Financial<br>derivatives | 1,264.3 | 1,234.4 | 2 %    |\n| Equities                 | 471.0   | 509.0   | − 7 %  |\n| Interest<br>rates        | 397.1   | 367.9   | 8 %    |\n| Margin<br>fees           | 91.0    | 117.6   | − 23 % |\n| Other                    | 305.2   | 239.9   | 27 %   |\n| Commodities              | 565.0   | 475.5   | 19 %   |\n| Power                    | 241.5   | 183.3   | 32 %   |\n| Gas                      | 101.7   | 89.2    | 14 %   |\n| Other                    | 221.8   | 203.0   | 9 %    |\n| Cash equities            | 293.9   | 344.4   | − 15 % |\n| Trading                  | 126.5   | 176.2   | − 28 % |\n| Other                    | 167.4   | 168.2   | − 0 %  |\n| Foreign<br>exchange      | 139.6   | 132.8   | 5 %    |\n| Operating<br>costs       | − 914.6 | − 876.3 | 4 %    |\n| EBITDA                   | 1,349.4 | 1,330.8 | 1 %    |\n\nThe Trading & Clearing segment comprises four asset classes: financial derivatives, commodities, cash equities and foreign exchange. In the financial derivatives asset class, we report on the performance in the financial derivatives trading and clearing business at Eurex exchange. Performance is driven mainly by the trading activities of institutional investors and other professional market participants and depends, to a large extent, on our clients' hedging needs and market volatility. Revenue is also generated from marketing data and managing collateral.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The EEX Group operates marketplaces and clearing houses for energy and commodity products, connecting more than 800 participants around the world. The product portfolio comprises contracts on power, environmental, freight and agricultural products. The EEX Group's most important revenue drivers are the power spot and derivatives markets, and the gas markets. These include products such as green power derivatives, emissions trading and certificates of origin.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe cash equities asset class shows the development of our trading venues in the cash market (Xetra® and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange). Besides trading and clearing services income, revenue stems from the ongoing listing of companies' securities and exchange admissions, the marketing of trading data, infrastructure services and from services provided to partner exchanges.\n\nThe segment also includes the foreign exchange asset class, which reports on business performance on the trading platforms operated by our subsidiary 360T. Net revenue is generated mainly by the trading activities of institutional investors, banks and internationally active companies.\n\nUncertainty among market participants declined noticeably year on year in 2023, which was reflected in lower volatility on equities and commodities markets. Market volatility on stock markets, as measured by the VSTOXX, fell by 35 per cent. Hedging requirements fell as a result, and so trading activities in equity index derivatives were down by 9 per cent in the Financial derivatives unit. It was offset by an increase of 6 per cent in trading with interest rate derivatives due to higher interest rates. Changes in the interest rate environment also had a positive impact on the outstanding notional volume of over-the-counter (OTC) and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives in central clearing, which were up year on year by 19 per cent. Combined with the central banks' more restrictive monetary policy, repo transactions in the Financial derivatives, Other unit in particular saw strong demand from market participants and contributed €86 million to net revenue (2022: €51 million).\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty concerning the security of European gas and broader energy supplies dominated the financial year 2022, but the gas and power markets were calmer in the reporting period. Prices of the respective reference products for power and gas in the Commodities unit therefore fell significantly from their record highs in 2022. This reduced the margin required for trading in derivatives substantially, which had a distinctly positive effect on the futures markets. The trading volume in power derivatives climbed year on year by 38 per cent and in gas derivatives by 18 per cent. The unit also profited from new customer gains, which stemmed partly from the fact that centrally cleared offerings are highly competitive compared with the OTC market. Commodities, Other, reported a higher net revenue contribution from collateral management fees resulting from the significant increase in interest rates in both Europe and the USA.\n\nAs with our European competitors, in addition to a decline in market volatility, the high interest rate environment also weighed on equity trading in Cash equities. It was only towards the end of the year that key indices like the DAX picked up sharply, reaching all-time highs in some cases. This was only partly able to offset a general decline in the order book volume of 31 per cent, however. Xetra's market share as the reference market for trading in DAX shares was again over 60 per cent, as in the previous year.\n\nIn Foreign exchange we increased the average daily trading volume on our platform by 6 per cent in the reporting year, despite lower volatility in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Net revenue in this unit performed correspondingly well.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n#### Economic situation\n\n[Macroeconomic and sector-specific](#page-26-0) \n\nenvironment\n\nBusiness developments\n\n#### [Results of operations](#page-27-0)\n\n[Financial position](#page-35-0) \n\n[Net assets](#page-39-0) \n\n- [Overall assessment of the economic](#page-41-0)  position by the Executive Board [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)\n- [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Fund Services segment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n#### Key indicators Fund Services segment\n\n| in €m             | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Net revenue       | 439.9   | 375.9   | 17 %   |\n| Fund settlement   | 213.9   | 211.5   | 1 %    |\n| Fund distribution | 85.3    | 89.7    | - 5 %  |\n| Other             | 140.7   | 74.7    | 88 %   |\n| Operating costs   | - 209.8 | - 171.5 | 22 %   |\n| EBITDA            | 226.7   | 203.8   | 11 %   |\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe Fund Services segment pools order routing and settlement activity and custody volumes of mutual, exchange-traded, and alternative funds processed by Clearstream in the fund processing unit. Clients can settle and manage their entire fund portfolio across all asset classes on the Vestima® fund processing platform. The fund distribution business consists of the distribution platform at Clearstream Fund Centre. Fund Services therefore offers one of the leading fund services platforms in the European market for distribution partners, banks, asset managers and fund providers. Net revenue in this segment is largely a function of the volume and value of assets under custody and the number of orders and settlements processed. In addition, Other net revenue in the Fund Services segment includes the net interest income from the fund settlement business and net revenue from fund data management, which largely stems from the acquisition of Kneip S.A.\n\nThe financial year 2023 was challenging for the European fund industry. On the one hand, fund prices profited from higher European equities indices than in the previous year. On the other hand, higher interest rates resulted in outflows from actively managed funds. On balance, the value of assets under custody was roughly the same as the previous year. The market environment also had a slightly negative impact on the number of securities settled. Net revenue from fund settlement was therefore only slightly up on the previous year.\n\nThe fund distribution business was also faced with the same market trends described above in the financial year. New customer wins and the transfer of new customer portfolios could not fully make up for a slight decline in average fund distribution assets. Net revenue in this unit fell slightly year on year as a result.\n\nIn April 2023 we announced that Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. had received its own banking licence in Luxembourg and so was independent in the market, but will remain closely linked with Clearstream's national and international central depositories (CSD, ICSD) in order to exploit synergies between the units for the benefit of our customers. Due to the increased independence of our fund services business from the securities business, the relevant portion of the net interest income from banking business of €57 million was reclassified from Securities Services to Fund Services (Other). At the same time, the separation resulted in a transfer of net revenue of €16 million from Fund Services to Securities Services (Custody, Settlement and Other).\n\nOther net revenue also includes the fund data business of Kneip, which was consolidated in the second quarter 2022.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n### [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n#### Economic situation\n\n[Macroeconomic and sector-specific](#page-26-0) \n\nenvironment\n\nBusiness developments\n\n#### [Results of operations](#page-27-0)\n\n[Financial position](#page-35-0) \n\n[Net assets](#page-39-0) \n\n- [Overall assessment of the economic](#page-41-0)  position by the Executive Board\n- [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)\n- [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Securities Services segment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n#### Key indicators Securities Services segment\n\n| in €m                                     | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Net revenue                               | 1,510.7 | 1,122.9 | 35 %   |\n| Custody                                   | 615.1   | 585.0   | 5 %    |\n| Settlement                                | 114.4   | 104.8   | 9 %    |\n| Net interest income from banking business | 645.5   | 260.0   | 148 %  |\n| Other                                     | 135.7   | 173.11  | – 22 % |\n| Operating costs                           | – 412.8 | – 391.2 | 6 %    |\n| EBITDA                                    | 1,092.2 | 729.5   | 50 %   |\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n1) The deconsolidation of REGIS-TR was completed on 31 March 2022 and includes a disposal gain of €50 million.\n\nOur settlement and custody activities are reported under the Securities Services segment. In providing the post-trade infrastructure for Eurobonds and other securities markets, our subsidiary Clearstream is responsible for the issuance, settlement, management, and custody of securities from 60 domestic markets worldwide, plus the international market. Net revenue in this segment is driven mainly by the volume and value of assets under custody, which determine the custody fees. The settlement business depends primarily on the number of settlement transactions processed by Clearstream via stock exchanges as well as over-the-counter (OTC). The segment also includes net interest income from banking business, which represents a significant portion of the segment's net revenue due to the steep rise in global interest rates.\n\nNet revenue in the Securities Services segment was affected most in 2023 by the monetary policy measures taken by central banks around the world in response to higher inflation. Net interest income from banking business, which in the Securities Services segment stems from cash deposits by our clients, profited significantly from higher base rates in both the USA and Europe. The volume of cash balances fell by 6 per cent, by contrast, which indicates more active liquidity management by our customers. Since the first quarter of 2023 around €90 million of the net interest income from banking business has been segregated as assets under sanctions held by us, of which €14 million relates to prior periods. This is therefore not shown in net revenue. When the fund business was spun out of Clearstream, the relevant portion of net interest income from banking business and other effects were reclassified from Securities Services to Fund Services (Other), as described in the Fund Services segment.\n\nOngoing high issuance by companies and the public sector, as well as the general increase in share prices as a result of buoyant markets, led to growth of 6 per cent in assets under custody in 2023. The principal contribution came from the year-on-year change in the volumes of debt instruments held by our national and international central securities depositories (CSD, ICSD). These also rose by 6 per cent on average. The custody unit also reports on collateral management and the securities lending business. A more restrictive monetary policy and higher interest rates caused a significant increase of 14 per cent in outstanding volume compared with the previous year. The securities settlement business also saw solid growth of 6 per cent in the financial year. The key driver in this area was an increase in the settlement of OTC securities.\n\nNet revenue the previous year included a disposal gain of some €50 million from the sale of our stake in the European transaction register REGIS-TR. This was recognised in Other net revenue.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>Image /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

Change in other cash and bank balances was affected by cash used for acquisitions, as well as cash outflows from operating activities.\n\nCash flow from operating activities was €2,482.5 million (2022:\n\n€2,141.6 million) before changes in CCP positions on the reporting date and was made up primarily of net income for the period of €1,796.8 million (2022: €1,563.2 million) and from changes in working capital.\n\nCash outflows for investing activities amounted to €3,997.2 million in 2023 (2022: €1,406.5 million) and were largely driven by the acquisition of SimCorp and fluctuations between short and long-term investments of customer funds. The acquisition of SimCorp led to a cash outflow of €3,887.3 million. Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of €264.0 million (2022: €323.5 million) was slightly below the planning framework of around €300 million and related primarily to IT and growth investments.\n\nCash inflow from financing activities was €2,206.9 million (2022: cash outflow of €951.1 million) and in addition to the dividend payment for the 2022 financial year of €661.5 million (2022: dividend for the 2021 financial year of €587.6 million), included three bonds with a nominal volume of €3,000.0 million to finance the SimCorp acquisition.\n\nCash flow for 2023, which is the sum of all inflows and outflows of cash from operating, investing and financing activities, came to €845.2 million (2022: €126.0 million) and was dominated by cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe positive cash flow from operating activities, sufficient credit lines and our flexible management and planning system meant that we were again adequately supplied with liquidity in 2023.\n\nFor further details of cash flow, see the consolidated [cash flow statement](#page-128-0) and note 21 to the consolidated [financial statements.](#page-207-0)\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

We are aiming to maintain our strong rating at Group level, which was changed to AA- after the SimCorp takeover. Furthermore, we endeavour to maintain the strong AA credit ratings of our subsidiaries Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG, in order to ensure their long-term success in securities settlement and custody. The activities of our Eurex Clearing AG subsidiary also require strong credit quality.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nTo keep these good credit ratings we aim for the following relevant key performance indicators going forward:\n\n- Net debt to EBITDA ratio: no more than 2.25\n- Free funds from operations (FFO) to net debt: at least 40 per cent\n- Interest cover ratio: at least 14\n- Tangible equity (for Clearstream Banking S.A.): at least €1,100 m\n\nWe follow the methodology of S&P Global Ratings closely when calculating these ratios.\n\n- To determine EBITDA for rating purposes, reported EBITDA is adjusted by the result from financial investments, as well as by unfunded pension obligations. EBITDA for rating purposes in 2023 was €2,970 million.\n- FFO for rating purposes is calculated by deducting interest and tax payments from EBITDA for rating purposes. FFO for rating purposes in 2023 was €2,307 million.\n- The Group's net debt for rating purposes is reconciled by first deducting 50 per cent of the hybrid bond, as well as the surplus cash as at the reporting date, from gross debt (i.e. from interest-bearing liabilities). Liabilities from operating leases and unfunded pension obligations are then added. Net debt for rating purposes in 2023 was €6,493 million.\n\n Interest expenses for rating purposes are calculated on the basis of interest expenses for financing, less interest expenses of Group entities which are also financial institutions. These include Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG. Interest expenses which are not related to our financing are not included in the calculation of interest expenses. Only 50 per cent of the hybrid bonds are counted towards interest expenses. Interest expenses for rating purposes in 2023 came to €86 million.\n\nThe following table \"Relevant parameters\" illustrates our calculation methodology and shows the values for the reporting year.\n\n#### Relevant parameters\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n|                                                                        |    | Target figures | 2023  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|----------------|-------|\n| Net debt / EBITDA                                                      |    | ≤ 2.25         | 2.19  |\n| Free funds from operations (FFO) / net debt                            | %  | ≥ 40           | 36    |\n| Interest coverage ratio                                                |    | ≥ 14           | 35    |\n| Tangible equity of Clearstream Banking S.A.

To ensure the transparency of the key performance indicators, we report them based on the current reporting period.\n\n# Dividends and share buy-backs\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nWe aim to distribute dividends equivalent to between 30 and 40 per cent of net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders. Within this range, we manage the actual payout ratio mainly in relation to our business performance and based on continuity considerations. In addition, we plan to invest the remaining available funds primarily in our external development. Should the Group not be able to invest these funds, additional distributions, particularly in the form of share buy-backs, would be another possible use for them.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting we will be proposing to pay a dividend of €3.80 per no-par value share for the financial year 2023 (2022: €3.60). This dividend is equivalent to a distribution ratio of 40 per cent of net profit for the period attributable our shareholders. Given 185.1 million no-par shares bearing dividend rights, this would result in a total dividend payment of €703.4 million (2022: €661.6 million). The number of shares with dividend rights is produced by deducting 4.9 million treasury shares from our ordinary share capital of 190.0 million shares.\n\nIn November 2023 we announced a share buy-back programme for 2024 on the basis of the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2019. Company shares are to be bought back for a total cost of up to €300.0 million (without incidental expenses) in the period to 3 May 2024.\n\n# Credit ratings\n\n#### Credit ratings\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n|                              | Long-term | Short-term |\n|------------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Deutsche<br>Börse<br>AG      |           |            |\n| S&P<br>Global<br>Ratings     | AA–       | A–1+       |\n| Clearstream<br>Banking S.A.  |           |            |\n| Fitch Ratings                | AA        | F1+        |\n| S&P<br>Global<br>Ratings     | AA        | A–1+       |\n| Clearstream<br>Banking<br>AG |           |            |\n| S&P<br>Global<br>Ratings     | AA        | A–1+       |\n\nOur credit quality is reviewed regularly by S&P Global Ratings, while Clearstream Banking S.A. is rated by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings, and Clearstream Banking AG by S&P Global Ratings.\n\nOn 21 December 2023, Fitch Ratings affirmed the AA credit rating of Clearstream Banking S.A. with a stable outlook.

After the transaction and the related additional borrowing were completed on 20 September 2023 it then downgraded the credit rating from AA to AA-, also as expected. This did not affect the credit ratings for Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. S&P Global Ratings confirmed its AA- credit rating for Deutsche Börse AG and its AA credit rating for Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. on 29 January 2024. Deutsche Börse AG's rating reflects the assumption that the Group will continue its growth strategy. Clearstream Banking S.A.'s rating reflects its strong risk management, minimal debt levels and strong position on the international capital markets – especially through its international custody and transaction business.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\n# Net assets\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nSignificant changes to net assets are described below.

The increase in non-current assets resulted mainly from the SimCorp acquisition, which is reflected in higher intangible assets, and from exchange rate-related fluctuations in goodwill. The decline in current assets was particularly due to the volatility of restricted bank balances and financial instruments of the central counterparties at the reporting date.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nGroup equity rose by 11 per cent compared with the previous year. This was due mainly to the net profit for the reporting year 2023, less the dividend payment for the previous financial year 2022.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group invested a total of €264.0 million in the reporting year (2022: €323.5 million) in intangible assets and property plant and equipment (capital expenditure, CapEx), mainly in connection with IT and growth investments.\n\n# Working capital\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nWorking capital comprises current assets less current liabilities, excluding technical closing-date items. Current assets, excluding technical closing-date items, amounted to €2,298.9 million (2022: €2,588.6 million). As Deutsche Börse Group collects fees for most of its services on a monthly basis, the trade receivables of €1,832.2 million included in current assets as at 31 December 2023 were relatively low compared with net revenue (31 December 2022: €2,289.2 million). The decline in trade receivables was particularly due to open items as at the reporting date from the market volatility of the sports markets within EEX Group, which were offset by a decline in trade payables at the same time. The current liabilities of the Group, excluding technical closingdate items, amounted to €2,312.6 million (2022: €2,763.3 million, excluding technical closing-date items). For this reason the Group had slightly negative working capital of €13.8 million at year-end (2022: negative working capital of €174.7 million).\n\n# Technical closing-date items\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe \"financial instruments of the central counterparties\" item relates to the function performed by Eurex Clearing AG, European Commodity Clearing AG as well as Nodal Clear, LLC. Since they act as the central counterparties for Deutsche Börse Group's various markets, their financial instruments are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value. The financial instruments of the central counterparties are described in detail in the section \"Risk [report\" o](#page-63-0)f the combined management report and i[n notes](#page-163-0) 12 and [24](#page-211-0) to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nMarket participants linked to the Group's clearing houses partly provide collateral in the form of cash deposits, which are subject to daily adjustments. The cash deposits are generally invested on a secured basis overnight by the central counterparties and reported in the balance sheet under \"restricted bank balances\". The total value of cash deposits at the reporting dates relevant for the reporting period (31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December) varied between €46.8 billion and €58.9 billion (2022: €53.4 billion and €119.5 billion).\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-41-0\"></span>Image /page/41/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The resulting rapid interest rate rises boosted market participants' need for hedging with interest rate derivatives, but also had a significantly positive effect on growth in net interest income from banking business in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments. Fears of recession and uncertainty concerning the future direction of interest rates subdued share trading and also led to outflows from fund assets under management. It was only as inflation rates began to recede sustainably and with the prospect of an end to further interest rate increases that equity indices picked up again strongly in the fourth quarter of 2023. Compared with the record highs in 2022, price volatility and the related volumes of capital committed to power and gas markets declined significantly. Trading activity rose accordingly, particularly in power derivatives. With net revenue of €5,076.6 million, we achieved year-on-year growth of 17 per cent for the Group, which was above our expectations. Of the total, 5 per cent is due to secular growth and 7 per cent to cyclical growth effects. The acquisition of SimCorp, which was consolidated in the Group for the first time in the fourth quarter of the financial year, contributed another 5 per cent from M&A growth. The increase in costs was also mostly related to the acquisition of SimCorp, and included extraordinary transaction expenses and the costs of realising potential synergies (costs to achieve) in the new Investment Management Solutions segment totalling €79 million. Earnings before interest, taxes,\n\ndepreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased year on year by 17 per cent to €2,944.3 million, which was slightly higher than our expectations in view of the effects mentioned above. Additional borrowing to finance the acquisition also affected the financial result, which changed accordingly to €74.0 million.\n\nOn this basis we consider that Deutsche Börse Group's financial position remained very solid during the reporting period. As in prior years we reported strong cash flow from operating activities. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA, which is important for the credit rating, came to 2.19 and was thus below the now applicable limit of 2.25.\n\nAs in recent years, we are again offering shareholders a higher dividend for the 2023 financial year. The proposed dividend is €3.80 (2022: €3.60), representing a year-on-year increase of 6 per cent. We also decided in 2023 to carry out a share buyback programme with a volume of €300 million, which began on 2 January 2024 and should be completed by 3 May 2024 at the latest. The proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit reflects treasury shares held directly or indirectly by the company that do not carry dividend rights under section 71b Aktiengesetz (AktG, the German Stock Corporation Act). The number of shares carrying dividend rights can change until the Annual General Meeting through the repurchase or sale of further treasury shares. In this case, with a dividend of €3.80 per eligible share, an amended resolution for the appropriation of distributable profit will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-64-0\"></span>Image /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

DBAG itself is not a bank and has not been classified as a financial holding company by the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, so it is not itself subject to supervision as a bank. DBAG aligns its risk management with the standards for companies, and parts of the standards for banks are applied if they are appropriate. In view of their economic importance we particularly discuss the banks in our Group, namely Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. and Eurex Clearing AG. Further details are also provided for European Commodity Clearing AG as a central counterparty (CCP) according to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).\n\n# Material developments compared with the previous year\n\nClearstream Fund Centre S.A., a separate legal entity, was established at the beginning of 2023 for the fund business of Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG. This is a subsidiary of DBAG. Business activities in the fund business are reported in the Fund Services segment. Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. is a bank and must meet CRR requirements in this respect. It is also regulated under MiFID, and one of its main purposes is to support customers to meet their regulatory fund requirements in accordance with MiFID.\n\nDBAG acquired 100 per cent of the shares in SimCorp A/S in late October after a public takeover offer. The risks related to the acquisition of SimCorp have been examined and as at 31 December 2023 it was found that it does not materially change the overall risk profile of Deutsche Börse Group. The current integration of Axioma with SimCorp entails an increased operational risk in connection with the successful completion of the integration project.\n\nClearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. have to meet combined capital requirements (Complementary Approach Ratio) as from April 2023. These result from the capital requirements of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR, for details see \"Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\").\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. remained affected in 2023 by Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which required a considerable amount of management attention. Developments continue to be monitored closely in order to analyse the various impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war. The main focus was on adapting processes and controls to the countermeasures that Russia has taken in response to western sanctions. Clearstream Banking S.A. started to reduce its customer relations to Russian state actors massively following the first invasion of Ukraine in 2014.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG meet the CRR requirements and also the capital requirements of European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Clearstream companies must also comply with the Minimum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL). The central securities depositories Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. are also subject to the Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR). For details see the section \"Regulatory [capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\".](#page-76-0) \n\nEurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG are authorised as central coun-terparties (CCPs) and are subject to the requirements of EMIR and the Recovery and Resolution of Central Counterparties (CCP RR) regime. By contrast, recovery and resolution plans for the Clearstream companies and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. are ensured by their compliance with the EU Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD).\n\nIn addition to the European requirements, there are national requirements of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) issued by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin), requirements of the German Banking Act as well as the circular 12/552 issued by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Luxembourg (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, CSSF) to be mentioned.\n\nOther subsidiaries have different licences to provide services in the financial industry, which means they too are governed by extensive statutory requirements, including for risk management. Clearstream Banking AG maintains a central register within the meaning of the Electronic Securities Act (eWPG), for example. Eurex Repo GmbH and 360 Treasury Systems AG are also subject to specific provisions applicable to investment firms. Nodal Clear, LLC is a Derivatives Clearing Organisation (DCO) subject to regulation by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Crypto Finance AG is authorised to operate a securities business under Article 41 of the Swiss Financial Institution Act (FINIG), whereas Crypto Finance (Asset Management) AG is authorised as an asset manager for collective investment schemes under the Swiss Collective Investment Scheme Act (KAG). Both are subject to supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Our recently acquired subsidiary SimCorp is basically a non-regulated company. It was subject to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) only because it was listed on the stock exchange. It was delisted from Nasdaq Copenhagen on 30 October 2023 following the takeover by Deutsche Börse AG. With the delisting SimCorp is no longer subject to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-66-0\"></span>Image /page/66/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

We provide the infrastructure for dependable and secure capital markets and are involved constructively in its regulation. We align our risk management approach with our business model and our corporate strategy.\n\nOur risk management approach is based on the following principles: risk limitation, implementation of the business strategy in line with the risk appetite, and a reasonable relationship between risk and return.\n\nIn the course of growth by the business segments (e.g. organic growth, M&A activities, extension of the leading position in digital platforms for existing and new asset classes), risk management supports implementation of the strategy in line with the risk appetite by identifying risks, communicating clearly, limiting risks and monitoring. The aim is make well-founded strategic decisions within the boundaries of the defined risk appetite. Embedded cross-cutting risks such as ESG risks are also considered.\n\nWe aim to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return. Internal risk management is based on the Group-wide detection and management of risk, [see the chart \"Interlocking](#page-67-0) business strategy and risk management strategy\".\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>Image /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

For the banks that are the focus of the following comments – particularly including Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A. Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. and Eurex Clearing AG – and the securities firms - in the Group, this is supplemented by the normative perspective, which is discussed in more detail in the section \"Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios (normative perspective)\". The value at risk (VaR) model is the main tool for quantifying risks. The purpose of the VaR model is to determine the amount of economic capital – given a confidence interval of 99.9 per cent defined ex ante – required to cover very unlikely but possible losses incurred within twelve months. Moreover, we carry out stress tests in order to simulate extreme, yet plausible, events and their impact upon the Group's risk-bearing capacity. Complementary risk metrics have been established as an additional approach to risk monitoring, which serve as an early warning system for in-house risks. These risk metrics are based on operational risks (including IT and security risks, potential losses), credit, liquidity and business risks, as well as the indicators defined for recovery plans.\n\nStress tests are carried out in order to simulate separately and in aggregate extreme but plausible events for all material types of risk. They simulate the occurrence of extreme losses or the accumulation of large losses within a single year. Both hypothetical and historical scenarios are used and calculated for the banks and securities firms in the Group. Reverse stress tests are also carried out. They calculate which loss scenarios or liquidity squeezes would have to materialise for the risk-bearing capacity to be exceeded from a capital or liquidity perspective. Additional adverse scenarios are simulated for the relevant supervisory perspective (normative perspective) by the banks and securities firms. The recovery plans for the banks include additional recovery stress tests.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>Image /page/68/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

To this end, the Group continuously reviews internal events with regard to their risk properties, whilst also considering regional as well as global developments. We are thus able to recognise and analyse existing risks; at the same time, it is able to swiftly and adequately respond to emerging risks, as well as to changes in the market or in the business environment.\n\nRisk metrics are used to quantify the most important internal risks against set limits. These supplement the risk quantification from the economic perspective and serve to monitor management indicators other than the capital requirement, and non-quantifiable risks. Any under- or overshoot of the defined limits serves as an early warning signal, which is reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. Furthermore, any such breach immediately triggers the necessary analysis and risk mitigation processes.\n\nOur risk management approach also includes a sustainable, long-term component. In addition to the current existing risks, additional risks are also considered over a horizon of twelve months. For this purpose, we have developed socalled risk maps tailored specifically for expected or upcoming regulatory requirements and IT and information security risks. In addition, other operational, business and financial risks are also assessed beyond a twelve-month period. The risk maps categorise risks according to their probability of occurrence, and their potential financial impact, and show how the results relate to environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects.\n\n# Economic and normative perspective\n\nThe economic perspective assesses risk positions arising from business operations. The normative perspective includes inputs from regulatory models. The economic perspective is used to derive the minimum required economic capital (REC), so that our risk-bearing capacity based on the statistical model applied is not exhausted more than once in 1,000 years.\n\nFrom a normative perspective, regulatory capital requirements are the relevant management metrics. This means that risk management aims to meet the regulatory capital requirements for the banks and regulated securities companies in the Group. The economic and normative perspectives are used for risk management. The aim is therefore not only to meet the regulatory capital requirements, but also to ensure financial stability by means of the additional economic approach.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-69-0\"></span>Image /page/69/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

By contrast, Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG determine their economic risk-bearing capacity on the basis of their regulatory capital (for details, see the section \"Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\").\n\nThe risk management function measures the amount of economic capital regularly and compares this with the risk-bearing capacity to produce a management indicator. The regulated entities also use the normative perspective. The economic capital for the banks includes Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. and Eurex Clearing AG. The following entities in particular are not banks: Deutsche Börse AG, Eurex Frankfurt AG (including Eurex Repo GmbH), European Energy Exchange AG (including ECC and Nodal), 360T Group, the entities in the Investment Management segment (Qontigo, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), Axioma) and Crypto Finance AG.

Existing risks have been classified. ESG risks have been analysed and quantified in this context as far as possible. In the course of this analysis the effects of ES-G risks were classified as immaterial and no new risks were identified.\n\nWe measure the availability of the systems as an important risk indicator. As an international exchange operator and innovative provider of market infrastructure, state-of-the-art IT is of the utmost importance for the Group to ensure that it can deliver its services smoothly and continuously. Special IT risk indicators for system availability have been defined in accordance with a defined risk appetite, to monitor the uptime and performance of the main IT systems in all units and business segments and to ensure that they remain within the defined parameters. Yellow and red limits are defined for this purpose, to enable the timely and transparent escalation and reporting of breaches to senior management. Since availability risk is the biggest operational risk for the Group, it is the subject of regular testing. This simulates the impact of a failure of our own systems or those of suppliers.\n\nRisks can also arise if a service provided to a customer is inadequate and leads to complaints or legal disputes. For example, errors in the settlement of securities transactions due to product or process deficiencies or faulty manual input. The related processes are tested at least annually. Other sources of errors may lie with suppliers or defective products. We register complaints and formal objections as a key indicator of deficient processing risk.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

These can occur if Deutsche Börse Group breaches laws or other stipulations, enters into inadequate contractual agreements or fails to monitor and observe the case law to a sufficient degree. Legal risks also include losses due to fraud and labour law issues.\n\nFurthermore, losses resulting from insufficient anti-money-laundering controls, violations of competition law or of banking secrecy are included. Such risks can also arise if government sanctions are not observed, e.g. in case of conflicting requirements of different states, or in the event of breaches of other national or international regulations.\n\nWe take specific organisational measures to mitigate operational risks. Among them are emergency plans, measures to ensure information security and the physical safety of employees and buildings, insurance coverage, as well as compliance regulations and procedures. Comments on compliance requirements can be found in the sectio[n \"Compliance\".](#page-53-0) \n\n# Contingency plans\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nIt is vital for our Group to be able to provide our products and services with the greatest possible reliability, in order to retain the trust of customers and markets, and to meet our contractual obligations. We have to maintain our business operations and take precautions against failures. If our core processes and resources are not available, this represents not only a substantial risk for the entire Group but also even a potential systemic risk for the financial markets in general. A system of contingency plans has therefore been established throughout the Group (Business Continuity Management System, BCMS). This\n\ncovers all processes designed to ensure continuity of operations in the event of an emergency and reduces unavailability risk. Measures include precautions relating to all material resources (staff, systems, workspace, suppliers), including the redundant design of essential IT systems and the technical infrastructure, as well as emergency measures designed to mitigate the unavailability of staff or workspaces in core functions.\n\nOur Group has introduced and tested a management process for emergencies that enables us to respond quickly and in a coordinated manner. This is intended to minimise the effects on business processes and on the market and to enable a quick return to regular operations. All business units have appointed emergency managers to act as central contacts and take responsibility during emergencies. The emergency managers inform the Executive Board or raise the alarm with them in the case of severe incidents. If the incident escalates, the Executive Board member responsible acts as the crisis manager or delegates this role. Our emergency plans are tested regularly by rehearsing critical situations as realistically as possible. Such tests are generally carried out unannounced.\n\n# Information security\n\nAs digitalisation advances, the financial sector as a whole continues its technological development, which increases the risks of cyber-attacks. Attacks on company IT systems and on financial infrastructure are increasing worldwide and the Federal Office for IT Security (BSI) estimates the threat is greater than ever. Attacks with malware or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks represent major dangers, for instance.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>Image /page/72/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Security solutions are continuously refined and monitored by an independent control function with a link to operational risk management.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\n# Physical security\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nPhysical security is a high priority for us due to continuously changing global security risks and threats. Deutsche Börse AG has developed an integral risk management process to protect the company, its employees and values from internal and external attacks and threats – in a proactive as well as reactive manner. Analysts continuously assess the security situation at our locations and on business trips, and are in close contact with national and international authorities (Federal Criminal Police Office – BKA, Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution – BfV, etc.), security service providers, and security departments of other companies. Multi-level security processes and controls ensure physical security at our locations. Physical access to buildings and values is monitored permanently; it is based on the access principle of \"least privilege\" (need-to-have basis).\n\n# Insurance contracts\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nOperational risks that we do not wish to bear ourselves are transferred to insurance companies, if this is possible at a reasonable price. All insurance contracts are reviewed individually and regularly to identify potential for optimisation.\n\n# Financial risk\n\nWe divide financial risk into credit, market price and liquidity risks.\n\n| Credit risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Market risk                                                                                       | Liquidity risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ■ For collateralised and uncollateral-<br>alised customer credits<br>■ For collateralised and uncollateral-<br>alised cash investments<br>■ In securities lending<br>■ Participation in default fund<br>■ Outstanding liabilities | ■ For securities<br>■ For pension provisions<br>■ In case of balance-sheet<br>currency mismatches | ■ For collateralised and uncollateral-<br>ised customer credits<br>■ For collateralised and uncollateral-<br>ised cash investments<br>■ For exposures towards other<br>market infrastructures<br>■ In securities lending<br>■ For repayments of customer<br>deposits |\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-73-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n### Risk report\n\n[Risk profile Deutsche Börse Group](#page-63-0) [Regulatory classification](#page-64-0)  [Goals and principles of risk management](#page-66-0)  [Risk management approach](#page-67-0)  [Economic and normative perspective](#page-68-0)  [Risk-bearing capacity from an economic](#page-69-0) \n\n### perspective\n\n[Organisational structure and reporting](#page-77-0)  lines for risk management [Centrally coordinated risk management](#page-79-0)  process [Overall assessment of the risk situation](#page-81-0)  by the Executive Board [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0) [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0) Deutsche Börse AG [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0) [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Credit risk\n\nsory Board\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nCredit risk and counterparty default risk describe the danger that one of our counterparties might not settle its liabilities, or not settle them in full. The Group's credit risks result from the specific business models of our subsidiaries and DBAG's treasury investments.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nVarious risk metrics are used to measure and manage the credit risk of our subsidiaries. To derive the credit risk, the required economic risk capital is measured using Monte Carlo simulations and regulatory capital requirements as well as stress tests are used. Among other things the indicators include the extent to which individual clients make use of their credit facility and the concentration of credit. The measurement criteria also include the credit rating of the counterparties and the collateral provided. Reverse stress tests for banks show how many clients would have to default for the losses to exceed the riskbearing capacity.\n\nBoth Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG extend credit to their customers to make securities settlement more efficient. This lending business may give rise to short-term receivables from counterparties of several billion euros, but differs fundamentally from the traditional bank lending business and the associated risk profile. Credit risk can also arise from cash investments, which are the responsibility of the Treasury function. Treasury invests both the company's own funds and those that our customers deposit with Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG; the funds are mostly invested on a secured basis.\n\nFinally, there may be short-term unsecured credit balances at correspondence banks in the course of securities settlement. To manage and monitor the counterparty risk in the Group, the credit score of potential customers and counterparties to an investment is assessed before our subsidiaries enter into business relations.\n\nOur subsidiaries define safety margins for the collateral depending on the risk involved and review them continuously. We reduce our risk when investing funds belonging to Group companies and client deposits by distributing investments across multiple counterparties, all with a high credit quality, and by investing funds primarily in the short term and in secured form if possible. Investment limits are established for each counterparty on the basis of at least annual credit checks and using ad hoc analyses, as necessary.\n\nIn accordance with their terms and conditions, Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG only enter into transactions with their clearing members. Clearing mainly relates to defined securities, rights and derivatives that are traded on specific stock exchanges. Eurex Clearing AG also offers this service for over-the-counter (OTC) products such as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. It acts as a central counterparty between the business parties. It reduces the resulting credit risk by offsetting receivables and by requiring clearing members to post collateral. These processes are part of an EMIR-compliant security system, which the central counterparties in the Group have implemented.\n\nThis backup system consists of different levels that prevent one or even several customer defaults from affecting the functioning of the central counterparties. As a first step, each clearing member must demonstrate a minimum amount of liable capital or, in the case of funds, assets under management. The second stage requires the daily provision of collateral in the form of money or creditworthy and liquid securities (margins), which, at the request of the central counterparties, must be supplemented or even replaced by customers during the day if securities no longer meet the high quality requirements. It should be noted that the underlying risk measurement already factors in changes in prices and positions over the course of the day. In the third stage, all clearing participants are obliged to pay additional collateral into a default fund on a pro rata basis according to their individual risk profile.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

A maximum of €600 million is available, from which own equity payments can already be used on a pro rata basis in the security scheme described above. Third parties have no rights under this comfort letter. The contribution from Eurex Clearing AG to the overall payment waterfall in the event of a liquidation is €200 million. Before the collateral in the default fund is used, European Commodity Clearing AG provides prefinanced allocated own funds of €35 million. If all these funds are not sufficient, European Community Clearing AG can call up additional contributions to the default fund from non-defaulting clearing participants up to three times within 90 days. Before doing so, European Commodity Clearing AG must provide additional prefinanced allocated own funds of €15 million.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nIn addition, Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG can use the facilities of the Deutsche Bundesbank and so hold most of the customer funds without any default risk. Investment losses on currencies for which Eurex Clearing AG or European Commodity Clearing AG have no access to the respective central banks, and therefore invest with commercial banks, will be borne, on a pro rata basis, by Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG and by those clearing members active in the currency where losses were incurred. The maximum amount payable by Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG is capped at €50 million for Eurex Clearing AG and €15 million for European Commodity Clearing AG.\n\nAs with Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG, Treasury also invests its own funds and client deposits for Eurex Clearing AG; here too, most of the investments are secured. To date, no default by one of our customers with a secured credit line has resulted in a financial loss for us.\n\n# Market risk\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nMarket risk include risks of an adverse development of interest rates, exchange rates or other market prices, which may occur when investing own or customer funds, on open risk positions in foreign currencies or on pension liabilities. We measure these risks using Monte Carlo simulations based on historical price data, as well as corresponding stress tests. Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. measures market risks based on historical developments in interest rates, exchange rates and other market prices, and with additional stress tests. To minimise foreign currency risks, we avoid open currency positions whenever possible. Market risk exposure only results from relatively small open foreign currency positions.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used across the Group solely for hedging purposes. This relates to interest rate or currency swaps, for instance, which are used as part of a conservative investment policy for Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG, or futures to reduce the market risk of existing positions at Crypto Finance AG.\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

We also reduced the risk of extreme losses by deciding to invest the bulk of the CTA on the basis of a value preservation mechanism.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nWe did not sustain any significant losses from market price risks in 2023.\n\n# Liquidity risk\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nLiquidity risk arises if a Group company is unable to meet its upcoming payment obligations in time and in full or if it can only do so at a higher refinancing cost.\n\nLiquidity risks arise primarily at our subsidiaries Eurex Clearing AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., since these are credit institutions. Furthermore, liquidity risks arise at European Commodity Clearing AG as it is classified as a credit institution under the German Banking Act.\n\nShort-term operating liquidity is mainly covered internally, by retaining earnings. The aim is to hold sufficient liquidity to be able to meet all our obligations as they fall due. An intra-group cash pool is used to pool surplus cash from our subsidiaries with Deutsche Börse AG, as far as regulatory and legal provisions allow. Liquid funds are invested on a short-term basis to ensure that they are available. Short-term investments are also largely secured by liquid bonds from first-class issuers. In addition, we have access to short-term external sources of financing, such as agreed credit lines with individual commercial banks or consortia, and a commercial paper programme.\n\nIn recent years, we have used our access to the capital markets to issue corporate bonds in order to meet our structural financing needs.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group's liquidity risk management objective is two-fold: we aim to cover short-term liquidity needs while safeguarding the long-term financing of our Group and thereby reducing liquidity risks.\n\nFor the early identification of risk, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG calculate daily the liquidity requirement using various stress tests that would occur in the event of client defaults. The companies hold sufficient liquidity to cover the requirement as determined by these calculations. Furthermore, potential risks that are identified in the course of stress tests are analysed, and corresponding risk-reduction measures initiated.\n\nAggregated across all currencies, the companies always had sufficient liquidity to cover their actual liquidity needs in 2023.\n\nLiquidity risks are not quantified in the REC (see note 24 to the consolidated [financial statements\\).](#page-211-0) \n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n#### Risk report\n\n[Risk profile Deutsche Börse Group](#page-63-0) [Regulatory classification](#page-64-0)  [Goals and principles of risk management](#page-66-0)  [Risk management approach](#page-67-0)  [Economic and normative perspective](#page-68-0)  [Risk-bearing capacity from an economic](#page-69-0) \n\n# perspective\n\n[Organisational structure and reporting](#page-77-0)  lines for risk management [Centrally coordinated risk management](#page-79-0)  process [Overall assessment of the risk situation](#page-81-0)  by the Executive Board [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0) [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0) Deutsche Börse AG [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n# [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Pension risk\n\nsory Board\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nPensions for past and present employees are managed in a variety of pension funds. Pension risk is the risk of rising costs from the current measurement of pension provisions due to higher life expectancies, salary increases and higher inflation rates. It is calculated with the support of actuaries during the first quarter of the financial year. The methods used to measure pension risk were modified in 2023 which led to an increase of €57 million in the pension risk.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\n# Business risk\n\nBusiness risk is the unexpected residual loss which arises when the Earnings at Risk exceed the anticipated net income after tax, which can be due to the competitive environment (e.g. customer behaviour, investment failure, industry trend), macro-economic and geopolitical developments or erroneous strategic management decisions. Factors influencing this residual loss could be lower revenues or higher costs than planned. Business risk is reported when the calculated value at risk is higher than the budgeted net income for the next four quarters. This approach is based on the use of historic actuals as well as anticipated data and the expenses and income actually reported. Since historic actuals are not yet available for Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., an approach based on business risk scenarios is used there. Business risks are continuously monitored by the business units. There was no disclosable business risk for the Group on the basis of the simulation model as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regularly considers whether to classify Deutsche Börse AG as a financial holding company. It has currently come to the conclusion that Deutsche Börse AG is not a financial holding company. Classification as a financial holding company could have an impact on our capital requirements.\n\n# Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios (normative perspective)\n\nOperational risk, credit risk and market risk are used to determine the capital requirements from a normative perspective. Regulatory capital requirements are not determined for Deutsche Börse Group, but separately for each regulated entity. However, the risk profile from a normative perspective is comparable to the risk profile derived from economic capital. Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG used the standard approach for analysing and evaluating credit and market risk. The institutions have adopted different approaches regarding operational risk: Clearstream uses the considerably more complex Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) in all business units, which has been approved and is regularly audited by BaFin. In contrast, Eurex Clearing AG, European Commodity Clearing AG and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. employ the basic indicator approach in order to calculate regulatory capital requirements.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>Image /page/77/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

For this reason, the regulatory capital equivalent to the subscribed capital of €25.0 million was not taken into account for regulatory purposes as at 31 December 2022. Eurex Frankfurt AG also contributed capital of €50 million to Eurex Clearing AG as at 25 September 2023.\n\nIn February and March 2023, Clearstream Banking AG carried out two capital increases for a total of €110.0 million. The reason for strengthening its capital base was primarily a change in the interpretation of the CRR and CSDR capital requirements by the supervisory authority, resulting in both requirements being applied cumulatively. The reduction in equity at Clearstream Holding AG is due to the new legal entity Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. Own funds decreased mainly due to the carve-out of Clear-stream Fund Centre Holding and its subgroup.\n\nClearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. have Minimum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities, MREL, which were met at all times. The Minimum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) result from the recovery and resolution planning for the Clearstream entities as well as Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. on compliance with the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG as central depositories are subject to the capital requirements of CSDR, whereas Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG as central counterparties are subject to the specific capital requirements of EMIR, which were met at all times in the reporting year. As of April 2023, Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. must meet the combined capital requirements (complementary approach ratio) defined in CRR and CSDR. They have satisfied the complementary approach ratio since it came into effect.\n\n# Organisational structure and reporting lines for risk management\n\n# Organisational structure and reporting lines\n\nOur risk management approach applies to the entire Deutsche Börse Group. Risk management functions, processes and responsibilities are binding for all our employees and organisational units.

In [addition, regular training sessions are held that](#page-78-0) were developed to strengthen the risk culture of all employees.

Risks are continuously analysed, evaluated and reported: once a month or as needed to the Executive Board, four times a year to the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board and once a year to the Supervisory Board. Likewise, the CRO reports to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of the risk management system on an annual basis. This system ensures that the responsible bodies can check whether the defined risk limits are complied with.\n\nOur subsidiaries act in the same way, always ensuring that they meet the requirements of the Group. In particular, they adhere to the risk appetite framework allocated to them by Deutsche Börse Group. The banks and European Commodity Clearing AG have independent executive boards and supervisory boards. The relevant supervisory boards and their committees are involved in the process. The same applies to the executive boards and the corresponding risk management functions. Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., European Commodity Clearing AG and Eurex Clearing AG implement the risk management approach with specific features derived for their own businesses. They equally use metrics and reporting formats adjusted to the overarching Group structure. As a rule, the management of the respective subsidiary is responsible for structuring the risk management approach and for compliance with the relevant legal requirements.\n\n# Centrally coordinated risk management process\n\nOur risk management is implemented in a five-stage, centrally coordinated process. All potential losses should be identified in a timely manner, centrally recorded and, whenever possible quantitatively measured. Measures for managing them are to be recommended as necessary and their implementation ensured (see chart \"Five-stage risk management process\"). A further component of our risk management approach is the three lines of defence (3LoD) model, which is established at Deutsche Börse AG and at the banks and securities companies in our Group. This model defines a clear segregation of functions and responsibilities between the operating business units (first line of defence), risk management (second line of defence) and internal audit (third line of defence).\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/19 description: The image shows a diagram of risk management responsibilities. The diagram is divided into three sections: Executive Board, Chief Risk Officer/Group Risk Management, and Business areas. The Executive Board is responsible for the risk management approach and appetite. The Chief Risk Officer/Group Risk Management is responsible for continuous monitoring and management of the risk profile throughout the risk management process, assessing, and monitoring and reporting. The Business areas are responsible for identifying, notifying, and controlling.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-80-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n#### Risk report\n\n[Risk profile Deutsche Börse Group](#page-63-0) [Regulatory classification](#page-64-0)  [Goals and principles of risk management](#page-66-0)  [Risk management approach](#page-67-0)  [Economic and normative perspective](#page-68-0)  [Risk-bearing capacity from an economic](#page-69-0)  perspective [Organisational structure and reporting](#page-77-0)  lines for risk management [Centrally coordinated risk management](#page-79-0) \n\n#### process\n\n[Overall assessment of the risk situation](#page-81-0)  by the Executive Board [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0) [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0) Deutsche Börse AG\n\n[\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0) [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nThe first stage identifies the risks and the possible causes of losses or operational malfunctions. In the second stage, the business areas (first line of defence) regularly – or immediately, in urgent cases – report the risks that they have identified and quantified. The report goes to the risk management function (part of the second line of defence), which evaluates the potential threat in a third stage. In the fourth stage the business units manage the risks by avoiding, mitigating or transferring them, or by actively accepting them. The fifth and final stage involves monitoring different risk metrics and, where necessary, informing the responsible Executive Board members and committees of significant risks, their assessment and possible emergency measures. In addition to its regular reports, the CRO division compiles ad hoc reports for the Executive and Supervisory Boards. The risk management functions at Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Funds Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG submit reports to the respective executive boards and supervisory boards. The internal audit function (third line of defence) is an independent function and monitors both the business units and the risk management functions.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\n# Structure of the internal control system\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nDeutsche Börse has a Group-wide internal control system (ICS) that defines a framework with minimum requirements for all entities in the Group. The framework provides the basis for the risk-based implementation of the ICS. It supports the effective and efficient implementation and operation of the ICS regardless of the degree of regulation, or the size of the entity, for example.\n\nThe ICS helps to manage risks and particularly covers risks at the process level. This entails defining rules for the uniform recording and assessment of process risks, in aggregate and at the individual risk level. It should be emphasised that both financial and non-financial effects are taken into account when assessing the materiality of risks. A control cycle carried out at least once a year defines minimum requirements for continuous improvements and ICS reporting. This also includes an assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the measures taken by the business units as the first line of defence.\n\nA particular emphasis in the ICS implementation is on steps to manage material risks in connection with financial and non-financial reporting.\n\nThe central unit Financial Accounting and Controlling (FA&C), which reports directly to the CFO, and decentralised units working to standards defined by FA&C are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with the statutory requirements. Group Tax is responsible for determining tax items. The relevant department heads are responsible for the related processes, including effective security and control measures. The aim is to ensure that risks relating to the accounting process are identified early on, so that remedial action can be taken in good time.\n\nFA&C provides the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements with accounting guidelines that are intended to support consistent and correct accounting across the Group. Moreover, we continuously monitor and analyse changes in the accounting environment and adjust our processes accordingly.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>Image /page/81/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Incompatible tasks – such as modifying master data on the one hand and issuing payment instructions on the other – are strictly segregated at a functional level. An independent control unit grants individual employees access rights to the accounting system and continuously monitors these permissions using a so-called incompatibility matrix.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nSubsidiaries of Deutsche Börse Group maintain and consolidate their general ledgers in the same system. Accounting data from other companies is uploaded for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe processes, systems and controls described above aim to provide reasonable assurance that our accounting system complies with the applicable principles and laws. In addition, Compliance and Internal Audit act as a further line of defence, performing risk-based, process-independent controls on whether the ICS is appropriate and effective.\n\nThe accounting-based internal control system (ICS) was strengthened and expanded in 2023. A Control Over Financial Reporting (COFR) policy was introduced and adopted by all the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements. The COFR policy is intended to manage the risks associated with financial reporting across the Group, deliver end-to-end transparency in the financial processes and ensure the reliability of financial reporting. FA&C has provided a standardised process catalogue for accounting processes, including standardised risk-control matrices and documentation requirements. Compliance is regularly monitored by FA&C. These measures are to be strengthened and expanded again in 2024.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Audit Committee established by the Supervisory Board receive regular reports on the effectiveness of the ICS with respect to the financial reporting process.\n\n# Overall assessment of the risk situation by the Executive Board\n\n# Summary\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe risk profile of Deutsche Börse Group did not change significantly in the 2023 financial year. All known impacts of the geopolitical and macroeconomic developments were actively managed within the Group and potential new risks were analysed on an ongoing basis. The aggregate total risk of Deutsche Börse Group comprising all risk types (operational, financial, pension and business risk) was always matched by sufficient covered funds. Group risk management and the internal control system (ICS) were further strengthened and expanded in 2023, as described above. No significant change in the risk situation of the Group has been identified by the Executive Board at the present time.\n\n# Outlook\n\nDeutsche Börse Group continually assesses its risk situation. From stress tests, the economic capital requirements as calculated and based on the risk management system, Deutsche Börse AG's Executive Board concludes that the available risk coverage amount and liquidity are sufficient. There is currently no indication that the risk coverage amount has to be adjusted for 2024. Furthermore, it cannot identify any risk that would endanger the Group's existence as a going concern. Group risk management and the internal control system (ICS) are to be strengthened and expanded further in 2024. SimCorp will also be fully included in the measurement of economic capital. In addition, the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) across the Group for aspects relevant to risk management will be driven forward.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-82-0\"></span>Image /page/82/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

We pursue both organic growth and focused M&A activities.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n# Organisation of opportunities management\n\nCombined management report Report on opportunities\n\nWe evaluate the organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the individual business areas continuously, i.e. over the course of the year. With our opportunity management, we can identify, evaluate and seize opportunities for the Group as early as possible – and turn them into business successes. At Group level these opportunities are systematically assessed as part of the annual budgeting process and strategic reviews. The process begins with a careful analysis of the market environment, which considers both what the customer wants, as well as market developments, competitors and regulatory changes. Ideas for growth initiatives are developed further using uniform, Group-wide templates and subjected to a profitability analysis. On this basis, our Executive Board decides which initiatives are to be implemented.\n\nIn the course of preparing our Horizon 2026 strategy we validated our opportunities again and adjusted them accordingly.\n\n# Organic growth opportunities\n\nWe have a very broad portfolio of products and services with which we cover all areas of a market infrastructure provider's value chain. In order to maintain and expand this position we are pursuing a growth strategy called Horizon 2026 (see section \"Strategy and steering [parameters\"\\).](#page-21-0) We are focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities. These consist largely of secular opportunities that we can influence ourselves. Secular opportunities arise for example as a result of regulatory changes, new client requirements such as the growing demand for exchange-traded solutions to previously over-the-counter (OTC) transactions or from the trend to allocate an increasing portion of assets to passive investment strategies (e.g. ETFs). There are also cyclical opportunities that are beyond our direct control and result from changes in the macroeconomic environment. Apart from that, we see long-term growth opportunities resulting from the technological transformation. With the help of distributed ledger technology, public cloud solutions for operating IT infrastructure and artificial intelligence, we not only want to become efficient in our existing business, but also see opportunities for new products and services related to digital assets, for example.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

With the merger of SimCorp and Axioma we have created an end-to-end offering along the entire process chain for institutional investors. This also enables us to realise revenue and cost synergies. It opens up significant, sustainable and long-term growth opportunities and enables us to diversify our business and further increase the proportion of our recurring revenue.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nOne-stop shop for global indices and data (combination of ISS and STOXX): Our objective in the index business is to give the already established European index provider STOXX an even more global profile, in order to develop and market other indices worldwide. By combining our index provider STOXX with the ESG and data business of ISS we have created the foundation for offering our customers an integrated range of indices and ESG data. This gives us an advantage over our global competitors and helps us to give new and existing customers the best possible service. In addition, Deutsche Börse's index business will continue to take advantage of the structural trend towards passive investment products (ETFs). An increasing number of private clients and asset managers now follow this trend; not only are the costs lower, but many active investment strategies have been returning under-average performance. We are also realising revenue and cost synergies by merging ISS and STOXX under joint management.\n\n### Trading & Clearing\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nNew interest rate derivatives: Higher interest rates and wider fluctuations in expectations on future rates increase demand for interest rate products as investments and speculative opportunities, and to hedge interest rate risks. To support this, we use our leading position in long-term interest rate derivatives in order to win short-term business in interest rate derivatives for our platforms too. Customers profit from efficiencies in margin requirements if they pool their short-term interest rate business as well as their long-term interest rate business on our platforms. We offer an additional incentive by expanding our partnership programme, which enables market participants to share in our economic success.\n\nClearing of OTC derivatives: We have used political and regulatory developments, along with our expertise in building liquid markets, and expanded our market share in the clearing of OTC derivatives to around 20 per cent in recent years. In the years ahead we want to profit from overall market growth and increase our market share at the same time. To achieve these goals we use our improved risk model and efficiencies in cross-margining, i.e. offsetting margins for OTC trades with those for exchange-traded business. The current obligation being discussed by the EU supervisory authorities to use an active cross-margining account within the EU could also contribute to gaining additional market share.\n\nRising demand for repo products: The retreat by central banks from the money market and higher interest rates have caused demand for secured money market products to rise. We anticipate that we will profit from overall market growth and win new customers for our products at the same time.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span>Image /page/84/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row. From left to right, the buttons contain the following symbols: a house, a magnifying glass, a left-pointing arrow with a line at the end, a left-pointing triangle, and a right-pointing triangle.\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)  [Risk report](#page-63-0) \n\n#### Report on opportunities\n\n[Organisation of opportunities management](#page-82-0) Organic growth opportunities\n\n#### Cyclical opportunities\n\n[Technological opportunities](#page-85-0)  [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0) Deutsche Börse AG [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n[Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nNew equities and equity index derivatives: In addition to a broad range of established international benchmark products, we have introduced a large number of new products in recent years, such as MSCI, total return, dividend and ESG derivatives. These new products reflect changes in customer preferences and regulatory requirements, and we therefore expect to see further significant growth here in the years ahead.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Report on opportunities\n\nRising demand for power derivatives: The increasing share of renewable energies in the energy mix causes wider price fluctuations on European power markets. At the same time, industries with high energy requirements are obliged to include future energy costs in their calculations well in advance when pricing their final products. Their hedging requirement and demand for power derivatives is correspondingly high. Liquidity in the European power markets operated by us is now high, which has attracted new market participants, such as algorithmic and quant traders. They have no physical need, but use power as an asset class for trading. We want to use this momentum to increase liquidity on our platforms even further and open up new customer groups.\n\nTokenisation: We are at the beginning of a new technology and digital assets will increase the range of investable and tradable instruments significantly. With the Digital Asset Business Platform we want to make tokenised assets fungible for institutional customers and profit from this trend over the long term.\n\n#### Fund Services\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n#### Cross-border settlement and distribution of investment funds:\n\nOur clients can use Clearstream's settlement, custody and distribution services for their entire fund portfolio – covering traditional investment funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as well as hedge funds. Given that supervisory authorities are also calling for more efficient settlement and custody solutions in order to guarantee maximum security for client assets under custody, we expect to acquire additional client portfolios in the future by means of outsourcing agreements. We are also continuously expanding our range of products\n\nand services. So, for example, we have significantly expanded our range of fund services to include the management of distribution agreements, as well as data compilation through acquisitions.\n\n### Securities Services\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nExpand fixed-income securities services: With new offerings for our customers in the Securities Services segment we intend to use our presence and range in fixed-income securities services in a more normal interest rate environment. This includes expanding the repo and securities lending business. Both products are currently seeing stronger demand due to central banks' withdrawal from the money market and increased demand for high-quality collateral.\n\nDigital value chain in custody: Clearstream customers can already issue assets the same-day in a digital value chain via our D7 platform. We want to build on this success and enable our customers to manage and settle positions and accounts digitally in future – and to do so for all their asset classes. In addition to economies of scale and cost savings, we anticipate further long-term growth from a larger number of transactions.\n\n# Cyclical opportunities\n\nIn addition to secular growth opportunities, we have cyclical opportunities, for instance as a result of macroeconomic developments or unexpected market events. We do not have any direct control over these cyclical opportunities, but they do have the potential to increase our net revenue significantly. They include high trading volumes on our markets, on the one hand, which could be caused by a change in interest rate expectations or global events. On the other we benefit from rising interest rates, because they increase the net interest income we receive on cash balances.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-85-0\"></span>Image /page/85/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

They include cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT). These technologies can help to harmonise markets, open up new business potential, boost efficiency and reduce risks. We continuously and systematically observe and evaluate new technological developments and trends in terms of their impact and importance for our business model and our processes. Together with external partners we deliberately build and extend our expertise in selected technological areas.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n# Cloud\n\nWe work continuously to migrate our services and processes to the cloud and to optimise them. In addition to the flexible use of computing capacities, this has other advantages for us. For instance, the introduction of new functionalities and updating of existing software might be tested faster and better by clients in the cloud. This makes our processes significantly more agile, as new releases can be introduced at more frequent intervals, allowing us to respond better to clients' requirements.\n\nWe have been following a hybrid multi-cloud strategy with great success for years. Via agreements with leading international cloud providers we have already positioned ourselves at the summit of cloud use in the European financial services sector. In addition, on 9 February 2023, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google Cloud. It is intended to cover 10 years and allows us to profit from the technical performance and robust security mechanisms of a respected cloud provider.\n\nAs part of our partnership with Google Cloud we are concentrating on four areas:\n\n1. Increase cloud use: we are planning to move up to 70 per cent of the processes within our Group to the cloud. The migration is planned for completion by late 2026 and will comprise both cloud-to-cloud migrations and on-premise-to-cloud migrations. We are also working with other cloud providers in addition to Google.\n\n2. Data mesh: We are developing a data mesh that enables the shared use of data across different data storage devices and companies within the Group. Building on this, the aim is to create a market place where we can make data and analytics products and services available to external customers.\n\n3. Digital Assets Business Platform: We are planning to build an ecosystem for digital assets that is operated on the basis of an institutional value chain, using native digital infrastructure components in the cloud. The platform would conform to recognised standards in the finance industry and service a variety of asset classes and use cases on and off the blockchain.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Digital Securities Platform D7: D7 is our contribution to a European ecosystem for digital assets. With D7 we want to enable market participants the settlement of their digital assets on an institutionalised platform. This will drive digitisation and efficiency in post-trading and create a next-generation digital securities platform. The aim is to digitise the entire value chain from issuance to administration, repayment and archival. It will make it possible to create, record, settle and manage digital securities and digital assets in centralised and decentralised ledgers.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Report on opportunities\n\n# Distributed ledger technology (DLT)\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents another technological opportunity. It is sometimes considered a disruptive technology, and at present, the financial services sector is increasingly exploring its opportunities. Thanks to its decentralised nature, it facilitates direct interaction between participants, thus offering the potential for simplifying complex processes. The challenge in the financial industry is to make use of distributed ledger technology while meeting high security standards and taking risk limitation and cost efficiency aspects into account.\n\nAs an established provider of market infrastructure with an integrated value chain, we are in a good position to exploit the potential of distributed ledger technology. Our experience of applicable industry standards and legal and regulatory requirements is a decisive advantage here.\n\n# Artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nWell-known use cases have increasingly brought artificial intelligence into the public eye. As a provider of market infrastructure in the financial industry we are particularly evaluating artificial intelligence from the perspective of efficiency gains and scalability across the Group. Artificial intelligence is already being used in initial applications – for our customers (OSCAR collateral management, settlement prediction tool) and for our employees (chatbots). We always keep an eye on technological and regulatory developments, in order to evaluate and implement the best new use cases for artificial intelligence. To do so we make use of both internal and external know-how, in the context of strategic partnerships for instance.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-87-0\"></span>Image /page/87/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

In the long term we intend to continue consistently on our growth path, in order to make Deutsche Börse Group the preferred global market infrastructure provider.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe forecast describes Deutsche Börse Group's expected performance for the 2024 financial year. It contains statements and information on events in the future and is based on the company's expectations and assumptions at the time of publication of this corporate report. In turn, these are subject to known and unknown opportunities, risks and uncertainties. Numerous factors, many of which are outside the company's control, influence the Group's success, its business strategy and its financial results. Should opportunities, risks or uncertainties materialise, or should one of the assumptions made turn out to be incorrect, the Group's actual performance could deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations and assumptions contained in the forward-looking statements and information contained in this forecast.\n\n# Developments in the operating environment\n\n# Macroeconomic environment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nGlobal economic growth slowed again over the course of 2023, as a result of much more restrictive monetary policies by central banks. The escalation of the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East in the second halfyear also caused uncertainty among market participants. We expect the economic situation to remain tense in 2024 due to high interest rates. Interest rate cuts by central banks following further falls in inflation could have a positive impact on the economic environment, on the one hand. On the other, a\n\nsharper decline in economic growth than expected or a recession could lead to uncertainty among market participants.\n\n# Future development of results of operations\n\nFor the year 2024 we are expect revenue to increase again to more than €5.6 billion. In addition to organic growth on the basis of our secular growth opportunities, the consolidation of SimCorp will make a significant contribution. We are also currently anticipating slight secular headwinds if central banks should reduce their base rates. If market volatility goes up or interest rates stay at least at their current level, this would have a positive effect. In terms of operating costs we are planning an increase for investment in our organic growth opportunities, and the additional contribution from SimCorp. On this basis we anticipate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of more than €3.2 billion in 2024.\n\n#### Forecast for results of operations 2024\n\n|                                                                       | Basis 2023<br>€m | Forecast 2024<br>€bn |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Net revenue                                                           | 5,076.6          | >5.6                 |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) | 2,944.3          | >3.2                 |\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-88-0\"></span>Image /page/88/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

As far as the forecast development of non-financial performance indicators for 2024 is concerned, system availability was brought back into line with the high targets by means of additional back-up measures, which became part of everyday operations. We therefore expect that the system availability of customer facing IT will remain high in the forecast period.\n\nBeing an attractive employer is important for our sustained success. We want to attract top talents and retain them for the long term. The measures described in the chapte[r \"Employees\"](#page-45-0) have put us in a good position and we are confident that we can maintain or improve on our employee satisfaction of more than 71.5 per cent.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's Executive Board has defined target quotas for women on the two management levels beneath the Executive Board, in accordance with section 76 (4) of the AktG, in each case referring to Deutsche Börse AG. By 31 December 2024, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and second management levels beneath the Executive Board is planned to reach 15 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. Moreover, on a global Group level the Executive Board has adopted a voluntary commitment to increase the share of women holding upper management positions to 24 per cent by the end of 2024, and of women holding lower management positions to 33 per cent during the same period. We have extended the scope of our voluntary commitment over and above the legal requirements.\n\nThe assessment of independent ESG rating agencies is an important benchmark for our ESG efforts. We continuously analyse our performance and take action accordingly. Over the forecast period we expect that we will be able to maintain our good position above the 90th percentile of the ESG ratings.\n\n#### Targets of non-financial KPI for 2024\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n|                                           | Based on 2023   | Target for 2024  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| System availability of customer-facing IT | >99.9 %         | >99.5 %          |\n| Employee satisfaction                     | 73 %            | >71.5 %          |\n| Share of women in leadership positions1   | 23 %            | >24 %            |\n| ESG ratings                               | 98th percentile | >90th percentile |\n\n1) Group target for senior management.\n\n# Future development of the Group's financial position\n\nWe expect that cash flow from operating activities, which is our primary source of financing, will remain significantly positive in future. We expect that three significant factors will influence changes in liquidity in the forecast period: firstly, we plan to invest around €350 million in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at Group level. These investments will serve primarily to develop new products and services in our growth areas and to enhance existing ones. We also launched a share buy-back programme with a volume of €300 million in January 2024. In May 2024 we will propose a dividend of €3.80 per share to the Annual General Meeting. This would represent a cash outflow of about €703.4 million. Apart from the above, we did not expect any other material factors to impact the Group's liquidity at the time the combined management report was prepared. As in previous years, we assume that we will have a sound liquidity base in the forecast period due to positive cash flow from operating activities, adequate credit lines (for details see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements), and [our flexible management and](#page-211-0) planning systems.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-89-0\"></span>Image /page/89/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In future we will aim to distribute dividends equivalent to 30-40 per cent of the net profit for the period attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche Börse AG. The dividend per share is planned to increase going forward. In addition, available liquidity can be invested in the Group's further inorganic development, as in the past. In the event of any surplus liquidity, the company intends to supplement the dividend with share buy-backs.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Report on post-balance sheet\n\ndate events\n\nTo maintain its strong credit ratings at Group level, we aim for a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.25, and a ratio of free funds from operations to net debt of at least 40 per cent. Financing the takeover of SimCorp temporarily caused the ratio of free funds from operations to net debt to not fulfil the target at year-end 2023. We expect to be within the limit for this indicator again in 2024 thanks to positive cash flow from operating activities.\n\n# Overall assessment by the Executive Board\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nWe believe the Group remains very well positioned in terms of international competition, thanks to its broadly diversified offering along the securities trading value\n\nchain and its innovative strength. This being the case, we expect to see a positive trend in the results of operations over the long term. Our new corporate strategy and the resulting measures should further accelerate this growth. In this context the Group aims to become more agile and effective and sharpen its client focus, in order to become the global market infrastructure provider of choice, with a top ranking in all its business areas. Taking the conditions for organic growth into account, the Executive Board is planning an increase in net revenue to more than €5.6 billion in the forecast period. The Executive Board expects EBITDA to go up to more than €3.2 billion in the forecast period. Overall, on this basis the Executive Board assumes that cash flow from operating activities will be clearly positive and that, as in previous years, the liquidity base will be sound. The overall assessment by the Executive Board is valid as at the publication date for this combined management report.\n\n# Report on post-balance sheet date events\n\nThere were no significant events after the end of the reporting period.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-90-0\"></span>Image /page/90/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Recommendation D.4 GCGC states that the Supervisory Board shall form a Nomination Committee composed exclusively of shareholder representatives. In accordance with section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange Act, however, the Nomination Committee also assists the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG in selecting candidates for the Executive Board. As this task shall not be performed exclusively by shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board, and in line with the practice to date, the Nomination Committee also includes employee representatives.\n\n# Disclosures on suggestions of the GCGC\n\nThe GCGC consists of both recommendations (denoted in the text by the use of the word \"shall\"), which are reported in the Declaration of Conformity in accordance with section 161 AktG, and suggestions (denoted in the text by the use of the word \"should\").

Specifically, the main objectives of these principles for collaboration are to ensure responsibility, respect and mutual esteem. The Group also adheres to these principles when implementing its business model. Communications with clients, investors, employees and the general public are based on timely information and transparency. In addition to focusing on generating profit, Deutsche Börse Group's business is managed sustainably in accordance with recognised legal, social and ethical standards.\n\n## Code of business conduct\n\nActing responsibly means having values that are shared by all employees throughout the Group. Deutsche Börse AG therefore has a code of business conduct that is reviewed every year. This document, which is adopted by the Executive Board and applies throughout the Group, defines the foundations of key ethical and legal standards, including – but not limited to – the following topics:\n\n- Compliance with legislation and regulations; whistleblower system\n- Confidentiality and the handling of sensitive information\n- Conflicts of interest\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n- Prevention of insider trading and market manipulation; personal account dealings\n- Prevention of corruption\n- Risk management\n- Environmental awareness\n- Equal opportunities and protection against undesirable behaviour\n- Corporate responsibility; human rights; ethical conduct\n\nThe code of business conduct applies to members of the Executive Board, all other executives and all employees of Deutsche Börse Group. In addition to specifying concrete rules, the code of business conduct provides general guidance as to how employees can contribute to implementing the defined values in their everyday working life. The goals of the code of business conduct are to provide guidance on working together in the company on a day-to-day basis, to help resolve any conflicts and to resolve ethical and legal challenges. All newly hired employees receive the code of business conduct as part of their employment contract documentation. The code of business conduct is an integral part of the relationship between employer and employees at Deutsche Börse Group. Breaches may lead to disciplinary action.

The code of conduct for suppliers as applicable to Deutsche Börse AG and the central purchasing department requires suppliers, among other things, to respect human rights and environmental regulations and to comply with minimum standards in these areas. The minimum standards also incorporate the requirements of the German Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (Supply Chain Due Diligence Act) and the UK Modern Slavery Act. Service providers and suppliers must sign this code of conduct or enter into an equivalent voluntary commitment before they can do business with Deutsche Börse AG and the Group companies represented by the central purchasing department. The code of conduct for suppliers is reviewed regularly in the light of current developments and amended if necessary.

A key way in which we underscore the values we consider important for the Deutsche Börse Group is by joining initiatives and organisations that advocate generally accepted ethical standards. Relevant memberships are as follows:\n\nUN Global Compact [www.unglobalcompact.org: t](https://unglobalcompact.org/)his voluntary business initiative established by the United Nations aims to achieve a more sustainable and more equitable global economy. At the heart of the compact are ten principles covering the areas of human rights, labour, environment protection and anticorruption. Deutsche Börse Group has submitted annual communications on progress (COPs) on its implementation of the UN Global Compact since 2009. Charta der Vielfalt [www.charta-der-vielfalt.de:](https://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/en/) as a signatory to the Diversity Charter, the company has committed to acknowledging, respecting and promoting the diversity of its workforce, customers and business associates – irrespective of their age, gender, disability, race, religion, nationality, ethnic background, sexual orientation or identity.\n\nInternational Labour Organization [www.ilo.org: th](https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm)is UN agency is the international organisation responsible for drawing up and overseeing international labour standards. It brings together representatives of governments, employees and employers to promote the joint development of policies and programmes. Deutsche Börse Group has signed up to the ILO's labour standards and hence has agreed to abide by them.\n\n## Sustainability in corporate governance\n\nSustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche Börse Group. It is therefore an essential element of corporate governance at the level of both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sustainability matters at Deutsche Börse Group. It was supported in the reporting year by the interdisciplinary Group Sustainability Board, which is chaired by the CFO. The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It deals with company initiatives relating to environmental, social and governance topics (ESG). This includes advising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate planning and controlling. The Group Sustainability Board has been replaced by the Group Sustainability Committee as of 1 January 2024. The Group Sustainability Committee is the new central management unit for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and supports and advises the Executive Board on all aspects of sustainability. The Group Sustainability Committee is intended to ensure the implementation of effective ESG practices in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In addition to embedding ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this way, it is particularly important for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board committees, especially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination Committee. Current, relevant sustainability aspects also form part of the training programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and are dealt with in workshops and seminars.\n\nTo promote the sustainable development of the Deutsche Börse Group, ESG targets are an integral part of the remuneration system for the Executive Board. Details of the Executive Board remuneration system can be found in the [\"Remuneration report\".](#page-249-0) \n\nFurther information on this subject can be found online at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Responsibility [> Sustainability.

The Group has a number of rules and processes for this purpose. They comprise both statutory and internal rules that can be adapted specifically to individual industry segments. They include policies on whistleblowing, risk management and the internal control system.\n\n# Whistleblower system\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nDeutsche Börse Group plays an active role in the fight against breaches of rules and regulations. One example is Deutsche Börse Group's whistleblowing system, which provides a channel to report non-compliant behaviour. Deutsche Börse Group uses the Business Keeper Monitoring System (BKMS®), an online application that enables employees, clients and third parties to report matters that could be criminal offences and incidents of noncompliance by employees or third parties concerning the business of Deutsche Börse Group. Reports can be made in their own name or anonymously and can be made around the clock.\n\nFurther information regarding the whistleblower system can be found at [www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/our-company/contact/contact-for-whistleblowers) > Our Company > Contact > Whistleblower system.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Deutsche Börse Group's enterprise-wide control systems are embedded in an overarching framework. This comprises, among other things, the legal requirements, the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, international regulations and recommendations and other company-specific policies. The executives responsible for the different elements of the control system are in close contact with each other and with the Executive Board. Key aspects of its design and implementation are also reported regularly to the Supervisory Board or its committees. Equally, the Group has an enterprise-wide risk management system that covers and provides mandatory rules for functions, processes and responsibilities. The internal control system and risk management system also cover sustainability-related targets. Details of the internal control system and risk management at Deutsche Börse Group can be found in th[e \"Risk report\" s](#page-63-0)ection.\n\nFrom its examination of the internal control and risk management system and the reports of the Internal Audit function regarding its risk-oriented and process-independent controls conducted, the Executive Board does not have any indications which would result in reservations regarding the appropriateness and efficacy of the systems.\n\n# Working practices of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nAn important fundamental principle of the German Stock Corporation Act is the dual board system – which assigns separate, independent responsibilities to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. These responsibilities and their implementation at Deutsche Börse AG are set out in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nBoth boards perform their duties in the interests of the company and with the aim of achieving a sustainable, long-term increase in value. Their actions are based on the principle of responsible corporate governance. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG therefore work closely together in a spirit of mutual trust. The Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with comprehensive information on the company's and the Group's position and the course of business in a regular and timely manner. In addition, the Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly concerning issues relating to corporate planning, the risk situation and risk management, compliance and the company's control systems. The strategic orientation of the company is examined in detail and agreed upon with the Supervisory Board. Implementation of the relevant measures is discussed at regular intervals. The Chief Executive Officer reports to the Supervisory Board without undue delay, orally or in writing, on matters that are of special importance to the company.\n\nIn addition, the CEO keeps the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously and regularly informed of the current developments affecting the company's business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions and the long-term outlook and discusses these issues with him or her.

The Executive Board had six members in the reporting year. The main duties of the Executive Board include defining the Group's corporate goals and sustainable strategic orientation, managing and monitoring the operating units, as well as establishing and monitoring an efficient risk management system. The Executive Board is responsible for preparing the annual and consolidated financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG, as well as for producing financial information during the course of the year. In addition, it must ensure the company's compliance with legal requirements and official regulations.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are jointly responsible for all aspects of management. Irrespective of this collective responsibility, the individual members manage the company's business areas assigned to them in the Executive Board's schedule of responsibilities independently and are personally responsible for them. In addition to the business areas, the functional areas of responsibility are that of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Information Officer/Chief Operating Officer (CIO/COO) and Governance, People & Culture. The business areas cover the operating business units, such as the company's cash market activities, the derivatives business, the market data business, securities settlement and custody, collateral and liquidity management, fund distribution services as well as the Investment Management Solutions segment with offerings in the areas of indices, analytics, sustainability information (ESG) and software.

Among other things, these list issues that are reserved for the entire Executive Board, special measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board, other procedural details and the arrangements for passing resolutions. The Executive Board holds regular meetings. They are convened by the CEO, who coordinates the work of the Executive Board. Any Executive Board member can require a meeting to be convened. In accordance with its bylaws, the entire Executive Board normally takes decisions on the basis of resolutions passed by a simple majority of the members voting on them in each case. If a vote is tied, the CEO has the casting vote.\n\nMore information on the Executive Board, its composition, members' individual appointments and biographies can be found [at www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/executive-board) > Investor Relations> Corporate Governance > Executive Board.\n\n# Deutsche Börse AG's Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in its management of the company. This also covers sustainability matters. The Supervisory Board supports the Executive Board in significant business decisions and provides advice on strategically important issues. In the Rules of Procedures for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board has defined transactions of fundamental importance which require its approval. In addition, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing the members of the Executive Board, deciding on their total remuneration and examining Deutsche Börse AG's annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report.

In addition, extraordinary meetings are held as required. Executive Board members attend the meetings unless the Supervisory Board decides otherwise in any particular case. The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Executive Board. Exchanges also take place as necessary with the annual auditors. The committees also hold regular meetings. Unless mandatory statutory provisions or the articles of incorporation call for a different procedure, the Supervisory Board passes its resolutions by a simple majority. If a vote is tied, the Chair has the casting vote. Further details of how the Supervisory Board and its committees work are defined in particular in the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board, which can be downloaded [at www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/supervisory-board/rules-of-procedure) > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Supervisory Board > Rules of procedure.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews both the knowledge, skill and experience of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board as a whole and of their members regularly, at least once a year, and examines the structure, size, composition and performance of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. Its review is based on a catalogue of specific targets, including qualification requirements, which, in turn, are reviewed regularly by the Supervisory Board. As a result of this review the qualification matrix was amended in the reporting year to show the competences \"Strategy\" and \"Sustainability\" separately. In this way, the Supervisory Board has made the qualification matrix even more transparent. The Supervisory Board also regularly, at least once a year, reviews the effectiveness of its work, discusses opportunities for improvement and decides on suitable measures if necessary. The concrete targets are described in the chapter Targets for composition and [qualification requirements](#page-102-0) of the Supervisory Board\n\nand the [annual effectiveness review](#page-110-0) is described in the chapter Examination of the effectiveness of Supervisory Board work.\n\nThe Chair of the Supervisory Board consults, on a regular basis, with the shareholder and employee representatives on the Supervisory Board, also outside the meetings, and arranges talks to prepare for the Supervisory Board meetings as necessary. Separate pre-meetings of shareholder and employee representatives also take place regularly before the ordinary meetings of the full Supervisory Board.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-97-0\"></span>Image /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Additionally, the Supervisory Board has delegated individual decision-making powers to the committees, to the extent that this is legally permissible. The Supervisory Board had seven committees in the reporting period.

The targets include qualification requirements as well as diversity targets. Furthermore, members shall have sufficient time, as well as the personal integrity and suitability of character, to exercise their office. In addition, more than half the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be independent. The targets, including the qualification requirements, are reviewed by the Supervisory Board regularly, at least annually, and modified as necessary. The status of implementation can be seen in the qualification matrix at the end of this statement.\n\nIn the reporting year, the Supervisory Board reviewed the specific targets at the recommendation of the Nomination Committee and refined them, so that the competences \"Strategy\" and \"Sustainability\" are shown separately in the qualification matrix from this reporting year onwards. In this way, the Supervisory Board has made the qualification matrix even more transparent, and in particular it also shows in which ESG areas the respective Supervisory Board members have sustainability experience. The Supervisory Board, supported by the Nomination Committee, also examined the targets for the overall board and for the individual members and confirmed that they had been met.\n\n# Qualification requirements\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nGiven their knowledge, skills and professional experience, members of the Supervisory Board shall have the ability to perform the duties of a supervisory board member in a company with international business activities. The Supervisory Board has determined necessary basic competencies and particular competencies. The particular competences are derived from the business model, the corporate targets, as well as from specific regulations applicable to Deutsche Börse Group.\n\n# Basic competencies\n\nIdeally, each Supervisory Board member has the following basic competencies:\n\n- Understanding of business issues\n- Analytical and strategic skills\n- Understanding of the corporate governance system\n- Knowledge of the financial sector\n- Understanding of Deutsche Börse AG's activities\n- Understanding of Deutsche Börse Group's structure\n- Understanding of sustainability matters as relevant to Deutsche Börse AG\n- Understanding of the member's own position and responsibilities\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

At least two of its members should have sound knowledge, especially concerning the following topics:\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\n- Capital markets, business models of stock exchanges and data business\n- Clearing, settlement and custody business\n- Information technology and security, digitalisation\n- Strategy\n- Sustainability\n- Accounting, finance and audit\n- Risk management and compliance\n- Regulatory requirements, law\n\nThe current composition of the Supervisory Board fulfils these criteria concerning the qualification of its members. The requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the GCGC for professional knowledge of accounting and auditing in the Audit Committee are also met. Barbara Lambert, the Chair of the Audit Committee, has the necessary professional knowledge of both auditing and accounting. The same applies to Michael Rüdiger, a member of the Audit Committee, who also has the necessary specialist knowledge of both auditing and accounting.\n\nBarbara Lambert studied economics in Switzerland, where she also obtained her diploma as an auditor. As an active auditor of financial statements and banks over many years, she can draw on extensive experience of conducting and managing audit activities, particularly in the financial sector. She continues to update her auditing knowledge on a regular basis to this day. In addition to chairing the Audit Committee of Deutsche Börse AG, Barbara Lambert is a member or chair of the following audit and risk committees of boards of directors and supervisory boards: Implenia AG (since 2019), Synlab AG (since 2021, mandate will be resigned as of 31 March 2024), Merck KGaA (since\n\n2023) and of the two companies UBS Switzerland AG (since 2022) and Credit Suisse (Switzerland) AG (since 2023), which belong to the same group of companies. In these functions, she regularly attends the training sessions offered by the respective companies. Alongside her work on boards of directors and supervisory boards, Barbara Lambert is a member of many relevant professional associations and networks, such as the Swiss expert association for auditing, tax and trusts (EXPERTsuisse), where in 2007 she was also a member of the expert group for bank auditing, and the German Audit Committee Chair Network of the Audit Committee Institute e.V. Her membership of these associations and networks serves not only the professional exchange but also her further professional training.

The shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board therefore decided that at least half the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be independent. Supervisory Board members are considered to be independent within the meaning of C.6 GCGC if they are independent of the company and its Executive Board and independent of any controlling shareholder. In particular, Supervisory Board members are no longer to be considered independent if they have a personal or business relationship with the company or its Executive Board that may cause a substantial (and not merely temporary) conflict of interest. According to recommendation C.7 GCGC, more than half the shareholder representatives shall be independent of the company and the Executive Board.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nIn the opinion of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, all of them are independent.\n\n# Diversity concept for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe diversity concept for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, as adopted by the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 289f (2) no. 6 HGB, has the objective of ensuring a wide range of perspectives and experience through the composition of both bodies. The concept is implemented within the scope of selecting and appointing new Executive Board members or regarding proposals for election of new Supervisory Board members.\n\n# Flexible age limit and term of office\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe Supervisory Board considers the flexible age limit stipulated in its bylaws (generally 70 years) when nominating candidates for election by the Annual General Meeting. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board's bylaws provide for a general limitation to members' maximum term of office to twelve years, which the Supervisory Board shall also consider in its nominations of candidates to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe flexible age limit for members of the Executive Board provides for the term of office to expire at the end of the month during which a member reaches the age of 60 years. An Executive Board member may be reappointed for one year at a time from the month in which they reach the age of 60. The last period of office should, nevertheless, end at the close of the month in which the Executive Board member turns 65. When appointing members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board pursues the objective of achieving an optimal composition of the Executive Board from the company's perspective. In this context, experience and industry knowledge, as well as professional and personal qualifications, play a major role. Depending on the Executive Board position to be filled, it is not just the scope and depth of skills that is decisive, but also whether the specific skills are up to date. The flexible age limit has been deliberately worded to preserve the Supervisory Board's flexibility in taking decisions on appointments.\n\nAt present, no Executive Board member has passed the age limit of 65 years.\n\nTheodor Weimer's term of office as Chairman of Deutsche Börse AG's Executive Board runs until 31 December 2024.

Working at our company means collaborating with colleagues across over 56 locations from 131 nations. We are proud of the diverse cultural, professional and personal backgrounds of our colleagues around the globe. We are committed to maintaining, supporting and fostering the diverse and inclusive culture of Deutsche Börse AG across all diversity dimensions.\n\nRegulations require us to consider one aspect of this diversity in particular detail in this report: the share of women holding management positions.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG meets the statutory requirements for the proportion of women on the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. This applies particularly to the diversity requirements for the Executive Board that have been in force since 2021.\n\nSome 37.5 per cent of the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board are women and the Supervisory Board is determined to further increase this share.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also determined to increase the proportion of women on the Executive Board, taking the current appointments into consideration. Currently, there is one female member on the board.\n\nFuture personnel decisions will take this into account.\n\nIn detail: with regard to the Supervisory Board, the legally binding gender quota of 30 per cent in accordance with section 96 (2) AktG applies. In order to prevent any discrimination of either shareholder representatives or employee representatives, and in order to increase the planning security in the relevant election procedures, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have opposed the overall fulfilment of the quota in accordance with section 96 (2) sentence 2 AktG. Thus, the minimum quota of 30 per cent is to be complied with for each gender both with regard to the shareholder representatives and to the employee representatives. Based on the statutory calculation method, this means that at least two women and two men from both the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives must be on the Supervisory Board. There are currently six women on the Supervisory Board: three women among the shareholder representatives and three women among the employee representatives. The statutory gender quota is therefore fulfilled.\n\nA statutory minimum quota for the Executive Board was introduced in the Act to Extend and Amend the Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (FüPoG II) of 10 June 2021. Executive Boards of listed companies with more than three members must include at least one woman and one man (section 76 (3a) AktG). This statutory minimum participation requirement replaces the obligation of companies to set a legally non-binding target quota. Deutsche Börse AG meets these statutory requirements and reports on them in accordance with section 289f (2) No. 5a HGB.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n- Deutsche Börse: [Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)  [Risk report](#page-63-0)  [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0) [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# International profile\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board shall reflect the company's international activities. With Dr Andreas Gottschling, Shannon A. Johnston, Barbara Lambert, Charles Stonehill, Clara-Christina Streit and Chong Lee Tan, there are six shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board who are not, or not exclusively, German citizens. In addition, many of the members of the Supervisory Board have long-term professional experience in the international field or are working abroad on a permanent basis. The Supervisory Board will therefore continue to meet the objectives concerning its international composition.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nThe same applies to the Executive Board, where Stephan Leithner holds non-German citizenship, and whose members have gained long-standing international working experience as well.\n\n# Educational and professional background\n\nThe Supervisory Board has set itself the objective of considering an appropriate range of educational and professional backgrounds regarding its own composition, as well as regarding the composition of the Executive Board. In addition to possessing professional experience in the financial services industry, members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board also have a professional background in consultancy, the IT sector, auditing, administration and regulation. In terms of professional education, most members have business, economics or legal degrees, in addition to backgrounds in IT, engineering and other areas. Education and professional experience thus also contribute to fulfilling the previously mentioned qualification requirements for Supervisory Board members.\n\nThe composition of both Deutsche Börse AG's Supervisory Board and Executive Board is in line with the objectives stated above.\n\nThe following qualification matrix provides an overview of how the main targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board are met, and of the extent to which the particular competencies defined in the qualification requirements are present.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The Supervisory Board's Nomination Committee, whose responsibility it is to put forward suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for its proposals for election to the Annual General Meeting, has therefore dealt in detail with the election by the Annual General Meeting of the shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board in 2024. Michael Rüdiger has decided not to stand again for election to the Supervisory Board. In a resolution dated 6 February 2024, the shareholder representatives on the Nomination Committee proposed eight candidates for election as shareholder representatives by the Annual General Meeting. Seven of the eight proposed candidates are currently Supervisory Board members; one candidate has not been a member to date. The targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board and the qualification requirements were taken into account when selecting this candidate. To this end, the shareholder representatives on the\n\nNomination Committee began by drawing up a long list of suitable individuals. After interviewing the candidates on the long list, the shareholder representatives on the Nomination Committee agreed on a new candidate for the Supervisory Board elections in 2024. Information about all the candidates, including their CVs, will be sent with the invitation to the Annual General Meeting of Deutsche Börse AG to be held on 14 May 2024, and can also be viewed before the Annual General Meeting at www.deutsche-boerse.com/agm.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-110-0\"></span>Image /page/110/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Deutsche Börse AG follows recommendation D.11 GCGC and the guidelines of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on management bodies of market operators and data reporting services providers, and supports Supervisory Board members in this endeavour. For example, it organises targeted introductory events for new Supervisory Board members and workshops on selected strategy, sustainability and current issues or on topics of fundamental importance. In addition to a specific workshop on the Horizon 2026 strategy process, two technology workshops on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity were held in the reporting year. Another two workshops were held on sustainability topics, which dealt with sustainability regulation and the future world of work in sectors relevant to Deutsche Börse AG. One workshop took place on the role of Deutsche Börse Group in the capital markets. Deutsche Börse AG covers the costs of workshops and basic training organised by itself for new Supervisory Board members. They also comprise training events from the Qualified Supervisory Board educational programme that the company designed itself. Deutsche Börse AG also covers the costs of third-party training activities in individual cases. Further information about the Supervisory Board workshops can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\n# Examination of the effectiveness of Supervisory Board work\n\nDeutsche Börse AG regards regular reviews of the effectiveness of Supervisory Board work – in accordance with recommendation D.12 GCGC – as a key component of good corporate governance. The annual effectiveness review is supported by an external service provider every third year, most recently in 2022. The effectiveness review in 2023 took place internally in the third\n\nquarter by means of a structured questionnaire and covered the tasks and composition of the Supervisory Board, collaboration within the Supervisory Board and with the Executive Board, as well as Supervisory Board and committee meetings. In addition, topics relating to the discussion and working culture and how current matters are dealt with by the Supervisory Board were addressed. The review yielded positive results, both in terms of overall effectiveness as well as regarding the audited subject areas. The Supervisory Board discussed the suggestions for improvement that were made, such as giving greater weight to the perspectives of external stakeholders of Deutsche Börse Group and developing the opportunities for exchange within the Supervisory Board, and initiated steps to implement them.\n\n# Long-term succession planning for the Executive Board\n\nTogether with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board ensures that longterm succession planning takes place. For this purpose the Supervisory Board, or its Nomination Committee, regularly – at least once a year – concerns itself with potential candidates for the Executive Board. The Chair of the Executive Board is involved in these considerations, provided that the discussions do not refer to their own succession. The Supervisory Board prepares an applicant profile for vacant Executive Board positions. It takes care to ensure that the knowledge, expertise and experience of all Executive Board members is diverse and well balanced and adheres to the adopted diversity concept. Moreover, the Supervisory Board ensures it is informed regularly about the succession planning at the first level beneath the Executive Board, and provides advice to the Executive Board in this regard.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-111-0\"></span>Image /page/111/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

By 31 December 2023, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and second management levels beneath the Executive Board was planned to reach 15 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. As of 31 December 2023, the share of women holding positions on the first and second management levels beneath the Executive Board at Deutsche Börse AG in Germany was 15 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively.\n\nChanges at the second management level had an impact on the number of female executives and the achievement of the target percentage at this level.\n\nThe Deutsche Börse Group is highly international, which means that for the development of female managers and appointments to management positions the consideration of a cross-company and cross-country perspective plays an important role. In this context, the Executive Board had set a Group-wide target share of women holding upper management positions (first three management levels below the Executive Board) of 23 per cent by 31 December 2023, and of women holding lower management positions of 30 per cent during the same period. In fact, this voluntary commitment went further than the statutory obligation. Firstly, the target figures determined in this context relate to Deutsche Börse Group worldwide. Secondly, the definition of management levels/positions was expanded to include heads of teams, for example. On a global level, as at 31 December 2023, these quotas stood at 23 per cent for upper management levels and 33 per cent for lower management positions.\n\n# Shareholder representation, transparent reporting and communication\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Among other things, the AGM elects the shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board and decides on formal approval for the actions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. It also passes resolutions on the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus, capital measures, approval of intercompany agreements, amendments to the company's articles of incorporation, Supervisory Board remuneration, approval of the remuneration system for the Executive Board and the remuneration report, and the appointment of the auditors for the financial statements. Ordinary AGMs – at which the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board give an account for the past financial year – take place once a year.\n\nIn the spirit of good corporate governance, Deutsche Börse AG aims to make it as easy as possible for shareholders to exercise their shareholder rights and exchange views directly with one another.\n\nFor instance, Deutsche Börse AG shareholders may follow the AGM live over the internet and can be represented at the AGM by proxies nominated by Deutsche Börse AG, also by means of electronic communication. The proxies exercise voting rights solely in accordance with shareholders' instructions and can also be reached during the AGM. There is also a postal voting option, which includes electronic communication. When casting their vote, the shareholders have the choice of approving individual agenda items, rejecting them or abstaining.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

A more in-depth discussion takes place particularly if the results are not within the range expected by the Supervisory Board, so for example if the voting differs significantly from that of comparable companies on fundamentally comparable topics. This was not the case in the reporting year for the resolutions taken at the AGM, including the temporary authorisation to hold virtual AGMs.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nSection 118a (1) AktG establishes that a company's articles of incorporations may stipulate that the Annual General Meeting is to be held online, without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies, or may authorise the Executive Board to adopt the corresponding resolutions.\n\nIn the reporting year the Executive Board decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, on the basis of the transitional provisions of section 26n (1) of the Introductory Act to AktG that the AGM should take place online, without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies. Shareholders were able to follow the entire Annual General Meeting live online and exercise their voting rights, also via electronic communications, by means of postal voting or appointing the company proxies. They also had the opportunity to exercise their rights to speak and obtain information during the AGM by means of a video link, and to submit comments beforehand. Additionally, the company voluntarily published the speeches by the Chairs of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board ahead of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn the reporting year, the AGM of Deutsche Börse AG also decided to amend the company's articles of incorporation and authorise the Executive Board for a limited period of two years to hold the AGM virtually, without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies. For future AGMs, a decision will be taken individually, and taking the particular circumstances as well as the interests of the company and its shareholders into account, as to whether the AGM should be held virtually, and use made of the authorisation. Past experience, as well as the time and expense involved, may also be taken into\n\nconsideration. The Executive Board decided on this basis to hold the AGM virtually again in 2024.\n\nThe company currently intends to structure future virtual AGMs in a similar way to the ordinary Annual General Meeting in the reporting year. In particular, it intends to refrain from accepting and answering questions ahead of the AGM. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members will attend the venue in person for the virtual AGM 2024.\n\nTo maximise transparency and ensure equal access to information, Deutsche Börse AG's corporate communications generally follow the rule that all target groups should receive all relevant information simultaneously. Deutsche Börse AG's financial calendar informs shareholders, analysts, shareholders' associations, the media and interested members of the public of key events such as the date of the AGM, or publication dates for financial performance indicators.\n\nAd hoc disclosures, information on directors' dealings and voting rights notifications, corporate reports and interim reports, and company news can all be found on Deutsche Börse's websit[e www.deutsche-boerse.com.](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations) Deutsche Börse AG provides information about its annual and consolidated financial statements as well as interim reports in conference calls for analysts and investors. Furthermore, a regular investor day is held and Deutsche Börse continuously outlines its strategy and business developments to everyone who is interested, abiding by the principle that all target groups worldwide must be informed at the same time.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

Additional information is published in its half-yearly financial report and two quarterly statements. The annual financial statement documents and the annual report are published within 90 days of the end of the financial year (31 December); intra-year financial information (half-yearly financial report and quarterly statements) is made available within 45 days of the end of the relevant quarter or six-month period. Following preparations by the Audit Committee, the annual and consolidated financial statements are discussed by the entire Supervisory Board and with the external auditors, examined and then approved. The Executive Board discusses the half-yearly report and the quarterly statements for the first and third quarters with the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee prior to their publication. The half-yearly financial report is reviewed by the external auditors.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nFollowing the recommendation by the Supervisory Board, the Annual General Meeting 2023 again elected PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, (PwC) as the auditors for the annual and consolidated financial statements 2023 and for the auditor's review of the half-yearly financial report in the reporting year. PwC was also engaged to perform a review of the form and contents of the remuneration report during the 2023 financial year. The auditors responsible are Marc Billeb and Michael Rönnberg. They have both been responsible for the audit since 2021. The Supervisory Board's proposal was based on a corresponding recommendation by the Audit Committee, which had obtained the necessary statement of independence from PwC before the election. This states that there are no personal, business, financial or other relationships between the auditor, its governing bodies and audit managers, on the one hand, and the company and the members of its Executive and Supervisory Boards, on the other, that could give cause to doubt the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee checked that this continued to be the case during the reporting period. It also oversaw the financial reporting process in 2023. The Supervisory Board was informed in a timely manner of the committee's work and the insights gained; there were no material findings.

They are the underlying basis for the notes that follow.\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n# Business and operating environment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n# Business model and general position of the company\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nDeutsche Börse AG is the parent company of Deutsche Börse Group. The parent company's business activities include, first and foremost, the cash and derivatives markets, which are reflected in the Trading & Clearing segment. Deutsche Börse AG also operates essential parts of the Group's information technology. The performance of the Securities Services segment (formerly Clearstream) is primarily reflected in Deutsche Börse AG's business performance via the profit and loss transfer agreement with Clearstream Holding AG. The business and the operating environment of Deutsche Börse AG are largely the same as for the Group. They are described in the section \"Macroeconomic [and sector-specific environment\".](#page-26-0) \n\n# Deutsche Börse AG's course of business in the reporting period\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's sales revenue increased by 3.0 per cent in the 2023 financial year, which was in line with the company's expectations. By contrast, total costs (staff costs, amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment and other operating expenses) rose by 6.7 per cent. EBITDA was €2.7 billion in the 2023 financial year and so was significantly above the forecast for the 2023 financial year of €1.4 billion. Net profit was up by 142.1 per cent compared with the previous year. The financial year was mainly defined by the ongoing geopolitical situation and the resulting market risks, rising inflation and interest rate increases by the central banks. Volatility on stock markets was lower overall than in the previous year, however. The increase in net income is primarily due to non-recurring effects within the result from equity investments. This stems partly from the fact that for the first time profits were recognised at Clearstream Holding AG in the period in which they originated, and partly from reorganisation of Deutsche Börse AG's shareholdings. On the basis of these developments, the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG considers its performance in 2023 to be positive in context.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-115-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n[Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-16-0)\n\n[Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n[Risk report](#page-63-0) \n\n```\nReport on opportunities\n```\n[Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n\n[Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n\n[Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse AG\n\n[\\(notes based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n### [Business and operating environment](#page-114-0)\n\n# Results of operations of\n\n- Deutsche Börse AG [Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-116-0)  Assets of Deutsche Börse AG [Deutsche Börse AG employees](#page-117-0)\n- [Remuneration report of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-118-0) Corporate governance statement in\n- accordance with section 289f HGB\n- Opportunities and risks facing Deutsche\n- Börse AG\n- Report on expected developments for\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n#### Performance figures for Deutsche Börse AG\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n| in € m                                   | 2023    | 2022    | Change  |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Sales revenue                            | 1,697.4 | 1,647.9 | 3.0 %   |\n| Total costs                              | 1,280.7 | 1,199.8 | 6.7 %   |\n| Net<br>income from equity<br>investments | 1,764.0 | 524.2   | 236.5 % |\n| EBITDA                                   | 2,698.8 | 1,215.1 | 122.1 % |\n| Net profit<br>for the period             | 2,118.4 | 875.1   | 142.1 % |\n| Earnings per share (€)1                  | 11.44   | 4.76    | 140.3 % |\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n1) Calculation based on weighted average of shares outstanding\n\n# Results of operations of Deutsche Börse AG\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's sales revenue rose by 3.0 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to an increase in sales revenue of €22.9 million in the Trading & Clearing Segment. For more information on the development of the Trading & Clearing segment, please refer to the \"Trading [& Clearing segment\" s](#page-31-0)ection. The other segments mainly relate to the provision of central functions. By contrast, these segments have a material impact on the company's investment income. The breakdown of income by the company's individual segments is shown in the tabl[e \"Sales revenue by segment\".](#page-116-0) \n\nThe company's total costs were up 6.7 per cent year on year. For a breakdown, please refer to the tabl[e \"Overview](#page-116-0) of total costs\". Staff costs rose by 16.2 per cent year on year during the year under review, to €341.4 million. The increase in staff costs is mainly due to the larger number of employees following the opening of new offices in Czech Republic and Ireland. Amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment increased by 0.4 per cent in the year under review. Other operating expenses were up 4.0 per cent year on year. This stems from the opening of new offices and general price increases.\n\nThe result of equity investments at Deutsche Börse AG rose year on year by 236.5 per cent in 2023. It consisted partly of dividend income of €261.7 million (2022: €161.6 million) and income from the transfer of profits of €1,474.1 million (2022: €412.2 million). The higher income from profit transfers is due to the fact that for the first time profits were recognised in the year in which they originated at the level of Clearstream Holding AG and its net income for the year increased as a result. An internal reorganisation within Deutsche Börse Group, which included the contribution and the sale of the investment in ISS HoldCo Inc. to ISS STOXX GmbH and the transfer of the investment in Axioma Inc. to SimCorp A/S as a capital contribution, resulted in an overall positive effect of €26.8 million in financial year 2023. Impairment losses of €35.9 million were recognised on financial assets, along with writeups of €37.3 million.\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) went up by 122.1 per cent due to the effects mentioned above. Net income for the period amounted to €2,118.4 million, an increase of 142.1 per cent.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n[Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-16-0)\n\n[Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n[Risk report](#page-63-0) \n\n[Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n\n[Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n\n[Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n\n[Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse AG\n\n#### Deutsche Börse AG\n\n[\\(notes based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n[Business and operating environment](#page-114-0) [Results of operations of](#page-115-0) \n\n# Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG\n\nAssets of Deutsche Börse AG [Deutsche Börse AG employees](#page-117-0)  [Remuneration report of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-118-0) Corporate governance statement in accordance with section 289f HGB Opportunities and risks facing Deutsche Börse AG\n\nReport on expected developments for\n\nDeutsche Börse AG\n\n[Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Sales revenue by segment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n| in €m                                 | 2023    | 2022    | Change  |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Trading<br>& Clearing                 | 1,523.9 | 1,501.0 | 1.5 %   |\n| Securities Services                   | 107.8   | 116.3   | - 7.3 % |\n| Fund Services                         | 54.6    | 25.9    | 110.8 % |\n| Investment<br>Management<br>Solutions | 11.1    | 4,7     | 136.2 % |\n| Total                                 | 1,697.4 | 1,647.9 | 3.0 %   |\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement Consolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n### Overview of total costs\n\n| in €m                               | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Staff costs                         | 341.4   | 293.9   | 16.2 % |\n| Depreciation<br>and<br>amortisation | 73.9    | 73.6    | 0.4 %  |\n| Other operating expenses            | 865.4   | 832.3   | 4.0 %  |\n| Total                               | 1,280.7 | 1,199.8 | 6.7 %  |\n\n# Development of profitability\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's return on equity expresses the ratio of net income after taxes to average equity available to the company during the course of 2023. Return on equity rose from 21.9 per cent in 2022 to 49.1 per cent in the year under review. The increase is particularly due to the one-off effect of recognising profits in the year in which they originated at the level of Clearstream Holding AG for the first time.\n\n# Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to €150.4 million (2022: €442.0 million). This includes balances on current accounts, fixed-term deposits and other short-term investments, whereby the majority is held in cash.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG has external credit lines available of €600.0 million (2022: €600.0 million), which were unused as at 31 December 2023. Moreover, the company has a commercial paper programme in place, which allows for flexible and short-term financings of up to €2.5 billion, in various currencies. Commercial paper with a nominal value of €590.0 million (2022: €60.0 million) was in circulation at year-end.\n\nThrough a Group-wide cash-pooling system, Deutsche Börse AG ensures an optimum allocation of liquidity throughout Deutsche Börse Group; in this way, the parent entity makes sure that all subsidiaries are in a position to honour their payment obligations at all times.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG has issued ten corporate loans with a total nominal volume of €6.8 billion. For more details concerning these bonds, please refer to the [\"Financial position\" s](#page-35-0)ection.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, Deutsche Börse AG generated cash flow from operating activities of €832.1 million (2022: €1,209.4 million).\n\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to €–3,819.5 million (2022: €–392.5 million). The change is primarily due to the acquisition costs of €3.9 billion for SimCorp A/S.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse:\n\n- [Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-16-0)\n- [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)\n- [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse AG\n\n#### [\\(notes based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n```\nBusiness and operating environment\nResults of operations of\n```\n#### Deutsche Börse AG\n\n[Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-116-0) \n\n# Assets of Deutsche Börse AG\n\n- Deutsche Börse AG employees\n- [Remuneration report of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-118-0) Corporate governance statement in accordance with section 289f HGB\n- Opportunities and risks facing Deutsche\n- Börse AG\n- Report on expected developments for\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to €3,097.0 million in the year under review (2022: €–812.2 million).

At €12,522.3 million, most of the non-current assets consisted of shares in affiliated companies (2022: €8,024.7 million). The increase in financial year 2023 is primarily due to the acquisition of SimCorp A/S for €3.9 billion.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment totalled €37.6 million during the year under review (2022: €128.2 million) and were thus lower than in the previous year. Depreciation and amortisation in 2023 amounted to €73.9 million (2022: €73.6 million).\n\nReceivables from and liabilities to affiliated companies include invoices for intra-Group services and amounts invested by Deutsche Börse AG within the scope of cash-pooling arrangements. The receivables from affiliated companies relate to invoices for intra-Group services, but primarily to Clearstream Holding AG for the company's profit transfer of €1,474.1 million. Liabilities to affiliated companies resulted mainly from cash-pooling amounting to €1,025.0 million (2022: €1,199.6 million) and trade liabilities of €80.8 million (2022: €84.8 million).\n\nConcerning the change in treasury shares we refer to the more detailed comments in the notes to the financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG in accordance with Section 315 (2) sentence 2 HGB.\n\n# Deutsche Börse AG employees\n\nThe number of employees (as defined by HGB)1 at Deutsche Börse AG rose by 860 in the reporting year and totalled 2,570 as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 1,710). The average number of employees at Deutsche Börse AG in the 2023 financial year was 2,158 (2022: 1,701).\n\nDeutsche Börse AG has employees at eight locations around the world. Two offices were opened – in Czech Republic and Ireland – in 2023. During the 2023 financial year, 138 employees left Deutsche Börse AG, resulting in a staff turnover rate of 6 per cent. Deutsche Börse AG employees are 41 years old on average and have been with the company for an average of 8 years.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Employees do not include the company's legal representatives, apprentices and employees on parental leave.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-118-0\"></span>Image /page/118/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

There are no other classes of shares besides these ordinary shares.\n\nThe share capital has been contingently increased by up to €17.8 million by issuing up to 17.8 million no-par value registered shares (contingent capital 2019). The contingent capital increase will only be implemented to the extent that holders of convertible bonds or of warrants attaching to bonds with warrants issued by the company or by a Group company in the period until 7 May 2024 on the basis of the authorisation granted to the Executive Board by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 8 May 2019 on Item 8 (b) of the agenda exercise their conversion or option rights, that they meet their conversion or option obligations, or that shares are tendered, and no other means are used to settle such rights or obligations. More details can be found in Article 4 (7) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\nThe Executive Board is only aware of those restrictions on voting rights that arise from Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act). Those shares affected by section 136 AktG are therefore excluded from voting rights. Furthermore, shares held by Deutsche Börse AG as treasury shares are exempted from the exercise of any rights according to section 71b AktG.\n\nUnder the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG, German Securities Trading Act), any investor whose shareholding reaches, exceeds or falls below specified voting right thresholds as a result of purchase, sale or any other transaction is required to notify the company and Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin, German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority). The lowest threshold for this disclosure requirement is 3 per cent. Deutsche Börse AG is not aware of any direct or indirect equity interests in its capital exceeding 10 per cent of the voting rights.\n\nThere are no shares with special provisions granting the holder control rights.\n\nEmployees holding shares in Deutsche Börse AG exercise their rights in the same way as other shareholders in accordance with the statutory provisions and the Articles of Association.\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are appointed and dismissed in accordance with sections 84 and 85 AktG and with Article 6 of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG. Amendments to the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG are adopted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting in accordance with section 119 (1) No. 6 AktG. Under Article 12 (4) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG, the Supervisory Board has the power to make changes to the Articles of Association that relate to the wording only. In accordance with Article 18 (1) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG, resolutions of the Annual General Meeting are passed by a simple majority of the votes cast, unless otherwise required by the Aktiengesetz. Insofar as AktG additionally prescribes a majority of the share capital represented at the time of a resolution, a simple majority of the share capital represented is sufficient where this is legally permissible.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The exact content of this authorisation is derived from Article 4 (5) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\nSubject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is also authorised to increase the share capital by up to a total of €19.0 million on one or more occasions in the period up to 17 May 2027 by issuing new nopar value registered shares in exchange for cash and/or non-cash contributions (authorised capital IV). Shareholders must be granted pre-emptive rights unless the Executive Board makes use of the authorisation granted to it to exclude such rights, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board is authorised to exclude shareholders' pre-emptive rights for fractional amounts with the approval of the Supervisory Board. According to the authorisation, the Executive Board may only exclude shareholders' pre-emptive rights if the total number of shares that are issued during the term of authorisation and that exclude shareholders' pre-emptive rights does not exceed 10 per cent of the share capital.

However, the acquired shares, together with any treasury shares acquired for other reasons that are held by the company or attributed to it in accordance with sections 71a et seq. AktG, may at no time exceed 10 per cent of the company's share capital. The authorisation to acquire treasury shares is valid until 7 May 2024 and may be exercised by the company in full or in part on one or more occasions. However, it may also be exercised by dependent companies, by companies in which Deutsche Börse AG holds a majority interest or by third parties on its or their behalf. The Executive Board may elect to acquire the shares: (1) on the stock exchange; (2) via a public tender offer addressed to all shareholders or via a public request for offers of sale addressed to the company's shareholders; (3) by issuing tender rights to shareholders; or (4) using derivatives (put options, call options, forward purchases or a combination of put options, call options and forward purchases). The full and exact wording of the authorisation to acquire treasury shares, and particularly the permissible uses to which the shares may be put, can be found in items 6 and 7 of the agenda for the Annual General Meeting held on 8 May 2019.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Takeover-related disclosures\n\nThe following material agreements of the company are subject to a change-ofcontrol clause following a takeover bid:\n\n On 21 March 2023, Deutsche Börse AG and its subsidiary Clearstream Banking S.A. entered into a facility agreement with a banking syndicate for a working capital credit totalling up to €750.0 million. If there is a change of control, the credit relationship between Deutsche Börse AG and the lenders can be reviewed in negotiations within a period of no more than 60 days. In this process, each lender has the right, at its own discretion, to terminate its credit commitment and demand partial or full repayment of the amounts owing to it. A change of control occurs if Deutsche Börse AG no longer directly or indirectly holds the majority of Clearstream Banking S.A. or if a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires more than 50 per cent of the voting shares of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\n- Under the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €600.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2020/2047 (hybrid bond), and the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €500.0 million fixed-rated bond issue 2022/2048, Deutsche Börse AG has a termination right in the event of a change of control (as defined in the terms of the bond), which, if exercised, entitles Deutsche Börse AG to redeem the bonds at par, plus accrued interest. If Deutsche Börse AG does not exercise this termination right, the affected bonds' coupon will increase by an additional 500 basis points per annum. A change of control occurs if a person or a group of persons acting in concert, or third parties acting on their behalf, has or have acquired more than 50 per cent of the shares of Deutsche Börse AG or the number of Deutsche Börse AG shares required to exercise more than 50 per cent of the voting rights at Annual General Meetings of Deutsche Börse AG. In addition, the relevant bond terms require that the change of control must adversely affect the long-term rating given to Deutsche Börse AG by Moody's Investors Services, Inc., S&P Global Ratings or Fitch Ratings Limited. Further details can be found in the applicable bond terms.\n- According to the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €500.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2015/2025, the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €600.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2018/2028, the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €500.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2021/2026, the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €500.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2021/2031, the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €600.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2022/2032, the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €1,000.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2023/2026, the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €750.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2023/2029 and the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €1,250.0 million fixedrate bond issue 2023/2033, the holders of the respective bonds have a termination right in the event of a change of control (as defined in the terms of the bond). If these termination rights are exercised, the bonds are repayable at par plus any accrued interest.

Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are shown in millions of euros (€m). Due to rounding, actual amounts may differ from unrounded or disclosed figures.\n\nInformation about capital management, which is also part of these consolidated financial statements, is included in the chapte[r Regulatory capital re](#page-76-0)quirements [and regulatory](#page-76-0) capital ratios in th[e Risk report s](#page-63-0)ection in t[he com](#page-16-0)bined [management report.](#page-16-0)\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/133/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

Such disclosures are focused on applicable accounting options under IFRS. Deutsche Börse Group does not present the underlying published IFRS guidelines, unless this is considered crucial to enhance transparency. The annual financial statements of subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the Group-wide accounting policies based on IFRS that are described in the following. They were applied consistently to the periods shown.\n\nAssets and liabilities and items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and any mandatory disclosures are listed separately if they are material. We define as material a proportion of around 10 per cent of the relevant total.\n\nNew accounting standards – implemented in the year under review\n\nAll the mandatory standards and applications endorsed by the European Commission were applied by us in the reporting year 2023. They were not applied earlier than required.\n\n|                 |                                                                                                                      | Application<br>date | Effects   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| IAS 1           | Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Prac-<br>tice Statement 2 on materiality                                                | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IAS 8           | Clarification on how to better distin-<br>guish changes in accounting policy<br>from changes in accounting estimate  | 1 Jan 2023          | none      |\n| IAS 12          | Amendments with respect to deferred<br>tax relating to assets and liabilities aris-<br>ing from a single transaction | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IAS 12          | Amendments to the international tax re-<br>form – Pillar II model rules                                              | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IFRS 17         | Insurance contracts                                                                                                  | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IFRS 17, IFRS 9 | Initial application of IFRS 17 and<br>IFRS 9 – Comparative information                                               | 1 Jan 2023          | none      |\n\n#### The amendment to IAS 1 and IFRS Guidance document 2 on materiality\n\nThe amendment to IAS 1 supplements guidelines for determining disclosures on accounting methods in an entity's financial statements and explains , how an entity can identify material accounting policies. These amendments have no material effect on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n# The Amendments to Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\nThe amendment to IAS 12 (Income Taxes) relates to the recognition of deferred taxes in connection with transactions that give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences on first-time recognition. The amendment makes it clear that the non-recognition of deferred taxes when an asset or liability is recognised for the first time outside a business combination does not apply to these transactions.

The reform project known as Pillar II Model Rules pursues the goal of ensuring effective minimum taxation of profits of affected multinational corporations at 15 per cent per jurisdiction. The aim is to limit international tax competition and ensure fair and appropriate taxation.\n\nThe Pillar II Model Rules were published by the OECD in December 2021 and on 12 December 2022 the EU member states agreed on a directive for the effective minimum taxation of multinational corporations that has to be transposed into national law by 31 December 2023. The German parliament passed the Minimum Taxation Directive - Transposition Act on 10 December 2023 with effect for financial years starting on or after 01 January 2024; corresponding rules also apply in the great majority of jurisdictions outside the EU that are relevant for us.\n\nSince our subsidiaries and permanent establishments are predominantly domiciled in jurisdictions whose nominal tax rate is above the minimum tax rate of 15 per cent, we do not expect any material tax impact for 2024, the first year of application.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 12 provide for a temporary exemption from the obligation to recognise deferred taxes in connection with the introduction of the global minimum tax rate.\n\n### IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\"\n\nThe new accounting standard IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts) was published in May 2017 and replaces the IFRS 4 standard. Generally speaking, the new standard is not only relevant to insurance companies, but to all entities that issue insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. It is not relevant for accounting by the insured party, however. IFRS 17 aims for the consistent, rules-based accounting treatment of insurance contracts and provides for insurance liabilities to be measured at their current settlement value. Furthermore, the objective is to form a uniform basis regarding the recognition, measurement and presentation of insurance contracts, including the notes. The standard is applicable in the EU for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 The standard was endorsed by the EU on 23 November 2021. The revised version of IFRS 17 has no impact on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n## New accounting standards – not yet implemented\n\nThe IASB issued the following new or amended standards and interpretations, which were not applied in the consolidated financial statements, because endorsement by the EU was still pending or the application was not mandatory. The new or amended standards and interpretations must be applied for financial years beginning on or after the respective effective date. Even though early application may be permitted for some standards, Deutsche Börse Group does not usually use any early application options.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n[Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n#### Standard/Amendment/Interpretation\n\n|                  |                                                                                                                                                     | Application<br>date | Effect   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| IAS 1            | Amendments in classification of liabilities<br>as current or non-current and amend-<br>ments in the classification of liabilities<br>with covenants | 1 Jan 2024          | See note |\n| IAS 7 and IFRS 7 | Amendment to supplier finance arrange-<br>ments disclosure                                                                                          | 1 Jan 2024          | non      |\n| IAS 21           | Amendments affecting guideline IAS 21:<br>lack of exchangeability                                                                                   | 1 Jan 2025          | non      |\n| IFRS 16          | Amendments in the accounting for lease<br>liabilities in sale and leaseback transac-<br>tions on seller/lessee                                      | 1 Jan 2024          | See note |\n\n# The amendment to IAS 1 Amendments to the Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Amendments to the Classification of Liabilities with Covenants\n\nThe amendments relate to the classification of liabilities with covenants. The IASB clarified that covenants that have to be met before or on the reporting date may have an effect on classification as current or non-current. Covenants that only have to be met after the reporting date do not affect the classification, however. Rather than being considered as part of the classification, any such covenants should be disclosed in the notes. This is intended to enable users of financial statements to judge whether non-current liabilities could become due within twelve months. These amendments have no material effect on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n# Amendments to IFRS 16 concerning accounting by the seller-lessee for liabilities under sale and leaseback transactions.\n\nThe amendments relate to the measurement of lease liabilities under sale and leaseback transactions and require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in such a way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The new examples explain various different procedures, particularly for variable lease payments. The amendments are applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The IASB permits the amendments to be applied earlier, subject to an EU endorsement. These amendments are not expected to have an impact on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n# 02 Consolidation principles\n\nIntra-Group assets and liabilities are eliminated. Income arising from intra-Group transactions is netted against the corresponding expenses. Intercompany profits or losses arising from deliveries of intra-Group goods and services, as well as dividends distributed within the Group, are eliminated. Deferred taxes for consolidation adjustments are recognised where these are expected to reverse in subsequent years.\n\nInterests in equity attributable to non-controlling shareholders are presented under \"non-controlling interests\" within equity. Where these are classified as \"puttable instruments\", they are reported under \"liabilities\" at cost.\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n- [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n- the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n- [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Currency translation\n\nTransactions denominated in a currency other than a company's functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items in foreign currencies are measured at the exchange rate on the reporting date. Non-monetary balance sheet items recognised at historical cost are measured at the exchange rate on the transaction date. By contrast, non-monetary balance sheet items measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the valuation date. Exchange rate differences for monetary balance sheet items are recognised either as other operating income or expenses, or as the result of banking and similar business or as result from financial investments in the period in which they arise, unless the underlying transactions are hedged. In the case of equity instruments designated at FVOCI, the exchange rate differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nBalance sheet items of entities whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into the reporting currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated into euros at the spot rate and equity items at historical rates. The positions in the consolidated income statement are converted at average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in \"revaluation surplus\". Resulting exchange differences are recognised without effect on profit or loss in the revaluation reserve. When the relevant subsidiary is sold, these exchange rate differences are recognised in the net profit for the period in which the deconsolidation gain or loss is realised.\n\nThe following euro exchange rates of consequence to Deutsche Börse Group were applied:\n\n#### Exchange rates\n\n|                  |               | Average rate<br>2023 | Average rate<br>2022 | Closing price<br>as<br>at<br>31<br>Dec<br>2023 | Closing price<br>as<br>at 31<br>Dec<br>2022 |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Swiss francs     | CHF<br>(Fr.)  | 0.9736               | 1.0030               | 0.9306                                         | 0.9864                                      |\n| US dollars       | USD<br>(US\\$) | 1.0810               | 1.0524               | 1.1065                                         | 1.0671                                      |\n| Czech koruna     | CZK<br>(Kč)   | 24.0165              | 24.5458              | 24.6996                                        | 24.1469                                     |\n| Singapore dollar | SGD (S\\$)     | 1.4506               | 1.4491               | 1.4594                                         | 1.4309                                      |\n| British pound    | GBP<br>(£)    | 0.8712               | 0.8547               | 0.8683                                         | 0.8850                                      |\n| Danish kroner    | DKK<br>(dKr.) | 7.4493               | 7.4398               | 7.4542                                         | 7.4364                                      |\n\nAny goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising from initial consolidation are reported in the functional currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\n### Net investments in a foreign operation\n\nTranslation differences from a monetary item that is part of a net investment of Deutsche Börse Group in a foreign operation are initially recognised in the revaluation reserve and are reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement when the net investment is sold.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Deutsche Börse AG controls a company if it is exposed to variable returns resulting from its involvement with the company in question or has rights to such returns and is able to influence them by using its power over the company.\n\nInitial consolidation of subsidiaries in the course of business combinations uses the purchase method. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess of cost over the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the subsidiary's net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is reported in subsequent periods at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Non-controlling interests are measured at the acquisition date by the corresponding proportion of the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's equity interests in subsidiaries and associates included in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 are presented in the list of shareholdings i[n note](#page-230-0) 34.\n\n## Material acquisitions\n\n### Acquisition of SimCorp A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark (SimCorp)\n\nOn 22 September 2023 Deutsche Börse announced the final result of the public takeover offer for SimCorp A/S , Copenhagen, Denmark (SimCorp). Including the shares bought directly on the market, Deutsche Börse held more than 90 per cent of all SimCorp shares (not including treasury shares held by SimCorp).\n\nAfter the successful completion of the public takeover on Friday, 29 September 2023, Deutsche Börse AG exercised its right to acquire all the SimCorp shares from the remaining minority shareholders (Squeeze-out). Since 31 October 2023 Deutsche Börse AG holds 100 per cent of the outstanding shares in SimCorp.\n\nSimCorp and its subsidiaries have been fully consolidated in Deutsche Börse Group since 29 September 2023. The SimCorp business was allocated to the new Investment Management Solutions segment from the fourth quarter of 2023 onwards, where the activities of the previous Data & Analytics segment are also reported.\n\nInitial consolidation of SimCorp in the consolidated financial statements took place using the purchase method. Significant revenue and cost synergies are expected from the transaction, which are reflected in the goodwill resulting from the transaction.\n\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities of SimCorp are recognised at fair value on the acquisition date. Any excess of cost over the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the subsidiary's net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is reported in subsequent periods at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe purchase price allocation was based on a preliminary basis, as it was not yet possible to make a final determination, particularly with regards to taxes and intangible assets.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-138-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n- [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n- the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n| (SimCorp)                             |                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| in €m                                 | Preliminary goodwill calculation<br>29 Sep 2023 |\n| Consideration transferred             |                                                 |\n| Purchase price in cash                | 3,747.6                                         |\n| Financial liability1                  | 139.7                                           |\n| Total consideration                   | 3,887.3                                         |\n| Acquired assets and liabilities       |                                                 |\n| Customer relationships                | 848.7                                           |\n| Trade names                           | 359.3                                           |\n| Software                              | 423.1                                           |\n| Property, plant and equipment         | 37.1                                            |\n| Non-current contract assets           | 185.3                                           |\n| Other non-current assets              | 18.8                                            |\n| Deferred tax assets                   | 4.0                                             |\n| Current contract assets               | 86.1                                            |\n| Other current assets                  | 17.1                                            |\n| Trade receivables                     | 79.0                                            |\n| Acquired bank balances                | 54.8                                            |\n| Deferred tax liabilities              | – 390.2                                         |\n| Miscellaneous non-current liabilities | – 49.6                                          |\n| Contract liabilities                  | – 39.8                                          |\n| Miscellaneous current liabilities     | – 82.0                                          |\n| Total assets and liabilities acquired | 1,551.7                                         |\n\nGoodwill resulting from the business combination with SimCorp A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n1) At the acquisition date of 29 September 2023, there was still a financial liability for the planned squeezeout, which was completed on the balance sheet date of 31 December 2023.\n\nGoodwill (not tax-deductible) 2,335.6\n\nThe full consolidation of SimCorp resulted in an increase in net revenues of €198.0 million as well as in an increase in profit after tax of €12.3 million. If the company had been consolidated as at 1 January 2023, this would have resulted in an increase in net revenues of €544.1 million as well as in an decrease of profit after tax of €– 69.3 million, including the financing costs.\n\n# 03 Adjustments\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 Deutsche Börse Group made various changes in presentation and reclassifications in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The published figures as at 31 December 2022 have been adjusted accordingly. These are purely changes in presentation, which had no effect on net income for the period or total comprehensive income.\n\n# Adjustments relating to the SAP S/4 HANA transformation\n\nWe adjusted the structure of the consolidated statement of financial position when the new Group account structure was drawn up in the course of our SAP S/4 HANA transformation, because it is more transparent and logical to present all benefits to employees in separate balance sheet items, in order to emphasise the importance of these obligations. We also brought the presentation within Group equity into line with the current market standard, in order to make the financial information more comparable. The presentation of certain liabilities from clearing transactions was also sharpened.\n\n# Equity\n\n The currency translation reserve previously reported as part of retained earnings will henceforth be reported as part of the revaluation surplus. This resulted in a reclassification to equity of €–145.5 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €–352.1 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n# [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- The cumulative changes from the revaluation of defined benefit obligations are now reported as part of retained earnings and were previously part of the revaluation surplus. This resulted in a reclassification to equity of €–133.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €–36.3 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\t- Shares granted as part of stock option programmes and settled in equity instruments were not presented uniformly within equity hitherto. Certain programmes were previously presented within retained earnings and will now be presented on a uniform basis in the revaluation surplus. This resulted in a retrospective reclassification of €–3.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €–5.5 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWe have introduced a new non-current and current balance sheet item, \"Employee benefits\" [\\(see note](#page-187-0) 17) to pool pension obligations, other non-current employee benefits and non-current termination benefits. A reclassification from the previous item \"Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits\" of €149.0 million was made retrospectively as at 01 January 2022 and of €23.9 million as at 31 December 2022. Obligations from early retirement benefits, share-based payments and variable remuneration were also reclassified from other non-current provisions. This resulted in a retrospective reclassification of €14.8 million as at 01 January 2022 and of €95.9 million as at 31 December 2022. €30.6 million as at 1 January 2022, and €38.0 million as at 31 December 2022 was also reclassified retrospectively from other\n\ncurrent liabilities for holiday entitlements, flexitime and overtime credits to the new item \"Current employee benefits\". €186.9 million as at 1 January 2022 and €224.9 million as at 31 December 2022 was also reclassified retrospectively from other current provisions for share-based payment, bonus and severance payments.\n\n## Reclassification of clearing liabilities\n\nLiabilities in connection with the processing of clearing transactions that were settled in cash were previously presented in other current liabilities. This difference was identified in the course of the SAP S/4 HANA migration and they were reclassified to \"Other financial liabilities at amortised cost\". This resulted in a reclassification of €74.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €15.1 million as at 31 December 2022. The consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022 was restated accordingly.\n\n## Reclassifications of financial assets and liabilities under sanctions\n\nIn prior years, current financial assets and the corresponding current liabilities to which the Group had no access because of international sanctions were presented in the consolidated statement of financial position. The accounting treatment for these items was revised on the basis of a legal analysis. This reduced the financial assets and financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position by €188.0 million as at 1 January 2022 and by €203.8 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-140-0\"></span>Image /page/140/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

They particularly include performance obligations and methods of revenue recognition. Revenue is measured on the basis of the consideration agreed in a customer contract. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over goods or services to the customer. For information on contract assets and liabilities, se[e note](#page-181-0) 13.\n\n### Sales revenue\n\nWe report our sales revenue on the basis of our segment structure. Revenue recognition for the segments' main product lines, as broken down and reported by us, are described as follows:\n\n# Investment Management Solutions\n\nThe Group generates revenue from calculating and marketing indices, which financial market participants use as underlyings for financial instruments or as a benchmark for the performance of investments-. The index offering ranges from blue-chip to benchmark to strategy to sustainability to smart-beta indices. The recognition of revenue for index licences is based on fixed payments, variable payments (usage-based volumes; mostly assets under management) or a combination of the two. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance during the contract term. Revenue is revised when warranted by the circumstances. Increases and decreases in estimated revenue are reflected in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by the management. For two fee components (minimum fee and usage-based fee), a contract liability is recognised and reduced each month based on the usage that has been recognised each month.\n\nSoftware solutions offers its clients risk-analytics and portfolio-construction tools. Customers receive the right to use the intellectual property. The intellectual property licences are granted for software products, which are subsequently referred to as \"SaaS Front Office\" and \"SaaS Middle Office\"(Software as a Service). Revenue generated with SaaS Front Office fees is recognised at a specific point in time because all contractual obligations are fulfilled, and the customer obtains control of the asset as soon as the licence key is transferred to the customer. SaaS Middle Office fees are recognised over time, i.e. the contractual term. Fees are also charged for the maintenance and servicing (summarised as \"Maintenance\") of the software products, which are realised over the contract term. For this purpose, the transaction price for maintenance\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Additional costs are capitalised for multi-year contracts when initiating a contract.\n\nESG's product portfolio includes Corporate Solutions, ESG Analytics and Governance Solutions. Most of this revenue stems from fixed-term contracts and recurring services. Revenue is recognised on a pro rata basis over the term of the contracted services to customers. Fees are generally charged in advance, either before the licence starts or periodically over the term of the licence. Proxy voting services are provided at a specific point in time and revenue is recognised accordingly when the contractually agreed service is provided. Fees for exceeding the minimum volumes for proxy research and services in connection with the exercise of voting rights are also variable consideration. Since neither the volume that will be used nor the price of these services can be determined with reasonable certainty when the contract starts, the variable portion of the consideration can only be recognised when the transaction price can be determined. Consideration is generally due 30 days after the invoice date. Upon commencement of the contract, there is an expectation that the period between providing the service and receiving the consideration from the client will be no more than one year, so there is no significant financing component. For multi-year contracts, additional costs of obtaining a contract are capitalised.\n\nSimCorp primarily generates revenues in three categories: revenue from customers that operate and service their SimCorp solution on their own servers (on-premise), revenues from SaaS solutions, and professional services. The on-premise revenues come from licence fees, software updates and support services. The SaaS revenues come from fees for SaaS licences and SaaS services, which comprise services and software updates, operating services, including Platform-as-a-Service/hosting fees, and BPaaS fees (business processes as a service). Generally speaking, licence fees may stem from subscriptions or open-ended licensing agreements. Subscriptions entitle the customer to use the software for a particular period, whereas open-ended software licences give the customer the right to use the software for as long as the contract for software updates and support is in effect. Revenue from licences is recognised as soon as all the contractual obligations have been satisfied, i.e. the licence has been transferred to the customer and the customer has gained control over the software. Revenue for software updates and support is recognised on a linear basis of the term of the contract. SaaS services, which include infrastructure services, operating services, digital portal services, investment accounting services, investment operational services, data management services and regulatory reporting platform services, are recognised over the term of the contract. Fees for professional services result primarily from implementation; revenues are recognised on the basis of work completed for time and service contracts. Fixed fee agreements are recognised on the basis of percentage of completion, unless the customer is obliged to take delivery. Additional costs are capitalised for multi-year contracts when initiating a contract.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Revenue is also generated with clearing and settlement services for over-thecounter (OTC) transactions. This mainly comes in the form of booking and management fees. Fees, as well as any reductions are specified in price lists and circulars. Rebates depend mainly on monthly volumes or the monthly fulfilment of liquidity provisioning obligations in certain products or product groups.\n\nRevenue for transactions in listed derivatives is recognised as soon as contracts are matched/registered and there is no unfulfilled obligation towards the customer. In the case of OTC transactions, posting fees are recognised at novation on a monthly basis. These fees are recognised at a point in time. Fees for the administration of financial derivative positions are recognised over time as the service is provided until the transaction has been closed, terminated or has matured.\n\n#### Commodities\n\nIts product portfolio comprises contracts on power, natural gas and emission allowances, as well as freight rates and agricultural products. Revenue is generated primarily from fees that are charged for exchange trading and clearing of commodities products. Transaction fees are specified in the price list. Rebates are granted primarily in the form of monthly rebates for the provision of a certain volume or level of liquidity. These types of rebates are dependent upon the total monthly volume or the monthly fulfilment of certain liquidity provision obligations. Revenue for transactions is recognised as soon as contracts are matched/registered, i.e. there is no unfulfilled obligation towards the customer.\n\n### Cash equities\n\nContracts for trading and clearing of cash market products in securities are accounted for in the same way as described in the Financial derivatives section. As a general rule, securities intended for trading on the regulated market of Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) are subject to the admission and listing, or inclusion, resolved by FWB's Exchange Management. Deutsche Börse AG, as the operator of the public-sector exchange, charges fees for the admission, listing, inclusion and quotation of securities on the regulated market. Fees charged for the admission and inclusion of securities with definite maturities on the regulated market are realised using the projected useful lives of the underlying securities. Accordingly, the fees charged for the listing of securities on the regulated unofficial market are realised using the projected useful lives of the underlying securities. The method for measuring the percentage of completion of the performance obligation on the basis of projected useful lives is considered appropriate within the meaning of IFRS 15. Listing fees are levied for the activity of all bodies of FWB, which supervise the trading and the settlement of trades as well as ensure the proper functioning of all trading activities (permanent possibility to make use of exchange facilities). Listing fees are recurring fees, which are charged for a service that is delivered over time. Accordingly, revenue is realised on a pro-rata basis. Revenue from fees for listings on the regulated unofficial market is realised in a similar manner.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Foreign exchange\n\nIn the foreign exchange business, revenue is recognised for the entire trading process of foreign-exchange products and the commissions generated from this in the form of trading fees. Revenue is recognised when the contractually agreed service is provided to customers. The fees include discounts on a monthly basis. Such discounts are considered accordingly in the month in which the services are rendered and reduce the sales revenue of the respective period.\n\n# Fund Services\n\nThe Fund services segment provides services to standardise fund processing and to increase efficiency and safety in the investment fund sector. The services offered include order routing, settlement, asset management, custody services and distribution and placement of investments. Processing fees for fund custody and the management of distribution agreements are recognised over time. Transaction-related fees are recognised at the time the agreed service is provided. This occurs when instructions are received and the transactions are processed. The service has been fulfilled at this point in time. Revenue is recognised based on the price specified in the price list and reduced by the corresponding rebates.\n\n# Securities services\n\nThe Group generates revenues from infrastructure services and post-trading services, the settlement of securities transactions as well as the custody and administration of securities. The fees are calculated in accordance with the prices set in the price list as well as with any relevant discounts granted. Customers in the custody business receive the benefit from the service provided and consume it at the same time as the performance is fulfilled during the\n\ncontract period. Fees collected for administrative services, such as corporate events for securities, are recognised when the agreed service is provided to clients. This occurs when instructions are received and the transactions are processed. The service has been fulfilled at this point in time. In accordance with the general terms and conditions, customers authorise direct debiting and consequently no financing component has been identified.\n\n### Result of treasury activities in banking and similar business\n\nThe treasury result of banking and similar business stems mainly from investing surplus liquidity and from the fair value measurement of foreign exchange transactions. It also includes income from exchange rate differences resulting from finance instruments in the banking business. As a result of interest rate policies, we also generate interest income from customer balances held with us (in a negative interest rate environment). Furthermore, this item comprises interest payments made on customer balances (positive interest rate environment) as well as cash investments (negative interest rate environment) and fees for providing customer credit lines. Interest income and interest expenses are calculated, allocated and realised when due, with the applicable effective interest rate on a daily basis. In addition, impairment losses from financial instruments as well as income from the reduction of liabilities relating to the banking business are recognised in this item.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board\n\n### [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Other operating income\n\nOther operating income is income not directly attributable to our typical business model. Other operating income is usually realised when all opportunities and risks have been transferred. Other operating income comprises, for instance, income from subleasing property and income from agency agreements, as well as the reversal of impairments recognised on trade receivables. In addition, valuation effects, such as income from exchange rate differences from non-banking business, are reported under other operating income.\n\n### Volume-related costs\n\n.\n\nThe item \"volume-related costs\" consists of expenses directly related to revenue and which depend directly on the following factors:\n\n- the number of certain trading and settlement transactions,\n- the custody volume and volume of global securities financing,\n- the amount of purchased data,\n- the sales commissions to distribution parties for the distribution of capital investments,\n- revenue sharing agreements and maker-taker price models.\n\nVolume-related costs are not incurred if the corresponding revenue is no longer generated.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Composition of net revenue (part 1)\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>\n\n| Combined management report                                   |                                               | Sales revenue |         | Treasury result from banking<br>and similar business |       | Other operating income |        | Volume-related costs |           | Net revenue |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------|--------|----------------------|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| Consolidated financial statements/notes                      | in €m                                         | 2023          | 2022    | 2023                                                 | 2022  | 2023                   | 2022   | 2023                 | 2022      | 2023        | 2022    |\n| Consolidated income statement                                | Investment Management Solutions               |               |         |                                                      |       |                        |        |                      |           |             |         |\n| Consolidated statement of                                    | ESG & Index                                   | 613.2         | 616.7   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0.3                    | 0.9    | -47.2                | -41.3     | 566.3       | 576.3   |\n| comprehensive income                                         | Index                                         | 230.7         | 235.1   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0.3                    | 0.9    | -25.4                | -20.4     | 205.6       | 215.6   |\n| Consolidated balance sheet                                   | ESG                                           | 254.4         | 250.2   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0                      | 0      | -12.3                | -11.6     | 242.1       | 238.6   |\n| Consolidated cash flow statement                             | Other ESG & Index                             | 128.1         | 131.4   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0                      | 0      | -9.5                 | -9.3      | 118.6       | 122.1   |\n| Consolidated statement of changes in equity                  | SimCorp Axioma1                               | 330.3         | 93.4    | 0                                                    | 0     | 0.8                    | 0.6    | -34.2                | -18.6     | 296.9       | 75.4    |\n| Notes to the consolidated financial statements               | On-premises                                   | 126.7         | 0       | 0                                                    | 0     | 0                      | 0      | -0.1                 | 0         | 126.6       | 0       |\n| Notes on the consolidated income statement                   | SaaS (incl.

Interest income and expense are recognised using the effective interest method over the respective financial instrument's term to maturity. Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the income can be\n\nmeasured reliably. Interest expense is recognised in the period in which it is incurred. Measurement effects from interest rate derivatives, including interest rate hedges, are also shown in this item. The position also includes measurement effects from foreign exchange derivatives to the extent that they relate to treasury activities in the non-banking business.\n\n#### Composition of financial income\n\n1) The reclassification of fair value gains recognised in other comprehensive income in connection with interest rate hedges was reported under financial income in the previous year. Such interest rate hedges are concluded to hedge the cash flow risk arising from potential interest rate changes. In order to reflect this economic purpose more accurately, the resulting amount was adjusted retrospectively as at 31 December 2022 by €–4.8 million. This led to a reduction of €–4.8 million in financial income in the consolidated income statement as at 31 December 2022 and a corresponding reduction in financial expenses.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n- [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n- the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n| Composition of financial |  |  | expense |\n|--------------------------|--|--|---------|\n|--------------------------|--|--|---------|\n\n| in €m                                                                   | 2023  | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------|\n| Interest expense from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost2 | 79.5  | 48.5 |\n| Transaction cost of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost    | 7.1   | 1.4  |\n| Interest expense from financial assets measured at amortised cost       | 0.1   | 3.0  |\n| Interest expense from lease liabilities                                 | 8.1   | 6.7  |\n| Fair value loss from foreign currency derivatives                       | 0     | 9.5  |\n| Interest expense on taxes                                               | 7.7   | 15.8 |\n| Expense of the unwinding of the discount on pension provisions          | 2.7   | 1.8  |\n| Other interest expense and non-interest expense                         | 15.5  | 9.3  |\n| Total                                                                   | 120.6 | 96.4 |\n\n<sup>1)</sup> Previous year adjusted, [see note 3.](#page-138-0) \n\n2) This includes €7.8 million (2022: €4.8 million) time value gains from interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge cash flow risk from bond issues.\n\n# 09 Income taxes\n\nDeutsche Börse Group is subject to the tax laws of those countries in which it operates and generates income. If it is probable that the tax authorities will not accept the disclosed amounts or the legal assessments on which the Group's tax declarations are based (uncertain tax positions), tax liabilities are recognised based on the best possible estimate of expected cash outflows. Tax assets are recognised if it is considered almost certain that they will be realised. The recognition of uncertain tax positions is reassessed if there is a change in the underlying facts or their legal assessment (e.g. change in case law).\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the balance sheet liability approach. The deferred tax calculation is based on temporary differences\n\nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the IFRS financial statements and their tax base that will lead to a future tax liability or benefit when assets are used or sold or liabilities are settled. These differences are used to calculate deferred tax assets or liabilities. The deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are currently expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the unused tax loss and interest carryforwards only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities exists, and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\n#### Composition of tax expense\n\n| in €m                                              | 2023  | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Current income tax expense/(-income)               | 645.4 | 478.6  |\n| for the current year                               | 638.9 | 513.2  |\n| for previous years                                 | 6.5   | - 34.6 |\n| Deferred income tax expense/(-income)              | 9.5   | 64.7   |\n| due to temporary differences                       | 9.5   | - 7.4  |\n| due to tax loss and interest carryforwards         | 15.2  | 14.9   |\n| due to changes in tax legislation and/or tax rates | - 5.7 | 7.2    |\n| for previous years                                 | - 9.5 | 50.0   |\n| Total income tax expense                           | 654.9 | 543.3  |\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Allocation of income tax expense to Germany and foreign jurisdictions\n\n| in €m                                 | 2023   | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Current income tax expense/(-income)  | 645.4  | 478.6 |\n| Germany                               | 312.6  | 276.3 |\n| Foreign jurisdictions                 | 332.8  | 202.3 |\n| Deferred income tax expense/(-income) | 9.5    | 64.7  |\n| Germany                               | 19.7   | 62.3  |\n| Foreign jurisdictions                 | - 10.2 | 2.4   |\n| Total income tax expense              | 654.9  | 543.3 |\n\nTax rates of 27.4 to 31.9 per cent (2022: 27.4 to 31.9 per cent) were used in the reporting period to calculate income taxes for the German Group companies.

The useful life of internally developed software releases is generally assumed to be seven years; a useful life of ten years is used as the basis in the case of newly developed systems.\n\nPurchased software is generally amortised based on the projected useful life. The expected useful life is 3 to 7 years, depending on the individual purchase. The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at a minimum at the end of each financial year. If the expected useful life of an asset differs from previous estimates, the amortisation period is adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe other intangible assets were largely acquired within the context of business combinations and refer to exchange licences, trade names,customer relationships and order backlog. The acquisition costs correspond to the fair values as at the acquisition date. Depending on the relevant acquisition transaction, the expected useful life is 5 to 20 years for trade names with finite useful lives, 4 to 24 years for participants, customer relationships and order backlog, and 2 to 20 years for other miscellaneous intangible assets.\n\nStock exchange licences and certain trade names have an indefinite useful life. The intention is also to keep them as part of the general company strategy. Their useful lives are therefore assumed to be indefinite.\n\nIntangible assets are derecognised on disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected to flow from them.\n\n## Impairment tests\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an intangible asset may be impaired. If this is the case, the carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) to determine the amount of any potential impairment.\n\nValue in use is estimated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal, before taxes. For this purpose, discount rates are estimated based on the prevailing pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. If no recoverable amount can be determined for an asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset can be allocated is determined.\n\nIrrespective of any indications of impairment, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use must be tested for impairment at least once a year. Impairment tests on CGUs with allocated goodwill are carried out on 1 October every financial year. If the estimated recoverable amount of the asset or CGU is lower than the respective carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised and the net carrying amount of the asset or CGU, respectively, is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\n#### financial position\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nAt the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to the CGU, or groups of CGUs, that is/are expected to create synergies from the relevant acquisition. If changes arise in the structure of CGUs, for example through a new segmentation, goodwill is allocated taking into account the relative fair values of the newly defined CGUs. Irrespective of any indications of impairment, these items must be tested for impairment at least annually at the lowest level of impairment at which we monitor the respective goodwill. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU, or groups of CGUs, to which goodwill is allocated (including the carrying amount of that goodwill) is higher than the recoverable amount of this group of assets. The impairment loss is first allocated to the goodwill, then to the other assets in proportion to their carrying amounts.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the (groups of) CGUs was determined based on the fair value less costs to sell. The value in use was only determined if the fair value less costs to sell did not exceed the carrying amount. Given that no active market was available for the (groups of) CGUs, the determination of fair value less costs to sell was based on the discounted cash flow method (level 3 input factors). The detailed planning period generally covers a time period of five years; for (groups of) CGUs, which have been allocated an asset with an indefinite useful life, such time period ends in perpetuity. Individual costs of\n\ncapital are determined for each (group of) CGU(s), for the purpose of discounting projected cash flows. These capital costs are based on data incorporating beta factors, borrowing costs, as well as the capital structure of the respective peer group. Pricing, trading volumes, assets under custody, market share assumptions or general business development assumptions are based on past experience or market research. Other key assumptions are mainly based on external factors and generally correspond to internal management planning. Significant macroeconomic indicators include, for instance, equity index levels, volatility of equity indices, as well as interest rates, exchange rates, GDP growth, unemployment levels and government debt. When calculating value in use, the projections are adjusted for the effects of future restructurings and performance investments, if appropriate.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an impairment recognised for non-current assets in previous years (except goodwill) no longer applies. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased and the difference is recognised in profit or loss. The maximum amount of this reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have resulted if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous periods. Deutsche Börse Group does not reverse any goodwill impairments.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income

Development costs for internally developed intangible assets are only capitalised when the definition and recognition criteria for intangible assets according to IAS 38 are met and development costs can be separated from research costs.\n\nDevelopment costs that have to be capitalised include direct labour costs, costs of purchased services and workplace costs, including proportionate overheads that can be directly attributed to the preparation of the respective asset for use, such as costs for the infrastructure of software development.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/157/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons.

Interest expense that cannot be allocated directly to one of the development projects is recognised through profit or loss in the reporting period.\n\nTotal development costs in the reporting year 2023 came to €323.9 million (2022: €274.5 million), of which €201.5 million were capitalised (2022: €181.8 million).\n\nImpairment testing in 2023 revealed an impairment loss of €33.5 million (2022: €20.4 million), which is shown in the line item \"Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses\" and relates to the following assets:\n\n An extraordinary impairment test of Crypto Finance AG was performed as at 30 September 2023 because its performance was persistently under plan. This resulted in an impairment loss in the Trading & Clearing segment (recoverable amount: negative) of €24.6 million (customer relations €14.1 million, software €7.6 million and trade name €2.9 million).\n\n Impairment losses of €8.7 million were also recognised for internally developed software in the Securities Services segment and of €0.2 million in the Fund Services segment (recoverable amount: negative) in the fourth quarter of 2023. The reasons for the impairment were that existing functionalities were no longer used and that significant revenues can no longer be generated.\n\nThe change in the internal reporting structure related to the introduction of the new Investment Management Solutions segment (IMS) also caused (groups of) CGU to which goodwill had been allocated to be divided up. Deutsche Börse Group reallocated the corresponding carrying amounts based on the relative fair values. The goodwill, that was allocated to the former group of CGUs Qontigo was partially allocated to the group of CGUs ISS STOXX (80.7 per cent) as well as SimCorp Axioma (19.3 per cent) in the current financial year. The goodwill allocated to the CGU ISS was fully allocated to the group of CGUs ISS STOXX. The following tables show the new allocation of goodwill to the corresponding (group of) CGU and the changes over time:\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/158/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular icons in a horizontal row.

As a result, where applicable individual disclosures for the cost of capital parameters for the separate impairment tests included in the group of CGUs, are provided.\n\nEven in case of a reasonably possible change of one of the parameters, under the condition that all the other parameters remain constant, none of the abovementioned CGUs or groups of CGUs, with the exception of the SimCorp Axioma CGU, would be impaired.\n\nIn the annual impairment test the recoverable amount for the CGU SimCorp Axioma exceeded the carrying amount by €330.1 million. A decrease in the average annual growth rate of net revenue to 7.6 per cent or an increase in operating costs to 4.9 per cent or an increase in the discount rate by 0.4 per cent or a reduction in the growth rate in perpetuity by 0.9 percent would result in the recoverable amount being less than the carrying amount.\n\nCAGR1\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/160/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The straight-line depreciation method is used. The carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is higher than its recoverable amount. Costs of an item of property, plant and equipment comprise all costs directly attributable to the production process, as well as an appropriate proportion of production overheads. No borrowing costs were recognised in the reporting period or in the previous year as they could not be directly allocated to any particular development project. If it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with an item of property, plant and equipment will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset in question can be reliably determined, expenditure subsequent to acquisition is added to the carrying amount of the asset as incurred. The carrying amounts of any parts of an asset that have been replaced are derecognised. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n### Useful life of property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                                                               | Depreciation period       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| IT hardware                                                                   | 3 to 5 years              |\n| Operating<br>and<br>office equipment                                          | 5 to 19 years             |\n| Leasehold<br>improvements                                                     | Based<br>on lease<br>term |\n|                                                                               | Depreciation period       |\n| Right-of-use - land and buildings                                             | Based on lease term       |\n| Right-of-use - IT hardware, operating and office equipment as well as carpool | Based on lease term       |\n\n# Measurement of right-of-use assets\n\nWe lease a large number of different assets. These mainly include buildings and cars. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost. Any accumulated depreciation and impairment amounts are deducted from the cost of right-of-use assets as part of subsequent measurement. This does not apply to short-term leases with a term of not more than 12 months and leases for low-value assets. Expenses in the reporting year resulting from the above-mentioned shortterm and low-value assets are reported in other operating expenses.\n\n#### Useful life of property, plant and equipment\n\nAs a lessor in the case of an operating lease, we present the leased asset as an item of property, plant and equipment and measure the asset at amortised cost. The lease instalments received during the period are shown under other operating income.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-162-0\"></span>Image /page/162/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

For details regarding the corresponding lease liabilities, please see note 12.\n\n# 12 Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets\n\n# Additions and disposals\n\nFinancial assets are recognised when the Group or one of its companies becomes party to a financial instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are generally recognised and derecognised at the trade date. Purchases and sales of debt instruments classified as \"at amortised cost\" and of equities eligible for clearing via the central counterparties (CCPs) of Deutsche Börse Group are recognised and derecognised at the settlement date. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or when the company transfers these rights in a transaction that transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets.\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. acts as a principal in securities borrowing and lending transactions in the context of the ASLplus securities lending system and is an intermediate between lender and borrower without becoming a contracting party from an economic perspective. Consequently, these transactions are not recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n# First-time measurement and classification\n\nFinancial assets are first recognised at fair value. For financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss the recognised amount also includes transaction costs that can be allocated directly to the acquisition of this asset. Transaction costs of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are expensed.\n\nFinancial assets are classified at the acquisition date, from which subsequent measurement is derived. We assign financial assets to the following measurement categories:\n\n- At fair value (either at \"fair value through other comprehensive income\" (FVOCI) or \"fair value through profit or loss\" (FVPL))\n- At amortised cost (aAC)\n\nDebt instruments are allocated on the basis of the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Debt instruments are only reclassified if the business model for managing them is changed. We do not make use of the option to designate debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition (fair value option).\n\nThe classification of investments in equity instruments not held for trading depends on whether the option of designating the corresponding financial assets as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI option) is used on initial recognition. Each individual equity instrument can be allocated separately and may not be changed in subsequent periods.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/164/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

Interest income from these financial assets is measured using the effective interest method. Gains and losses from derecognition, impairment and exchange rate movements are recognised through profit or loss. Measurement effects are shown in banking business or nonbanking business depending on how the financial assets are allocated. For financial assets from banking business all measurement effects are shown in the treasury result of banking and similar business. Interest income from the non-banking business is shown in the financial result. All other effects of non-banking business are presented in result from financial investments. All effects relating to the measurement of trade receivables are shown in other operating income and expenses.\n- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Investments in debt instruments allocated to the \"hold and sell\" business model and whose cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest are measured as at fair value through other comprehensive income. Impairments on these debt instruments are recognised as result from financial investments through profit or loss. On disposal of these debt instruments all the balances in the revaluation surplus are reclassified to result from financial investments through profit or loss. Interest income from fixed income debt securities in this category are shown in the financial result.\n\n Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL): Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for measurement at amortised cost or at FVOCI, are measured at FVPL and their measurement effects are shown in result from financial investments. Distributions from fund interests are also shown in result from financial investments. Interest income from fixed income bonds in this category are shown in the financial result.\n\n### Subsequent measurement of equity instruments\n\nAs a rule, equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). For certain equity instruments we used the irrevocable FVOCI option on acquisition, so that gains and losses there are recognised in other comprehensive income. When the item is derecognised the gains and losses are not recycled through profit or loss, but reclassified to retained earnings. Dividends from these financial assets are shown in result from financial investments.\n\n### Impairment\n\nAs a rule, any impairment for expected credit losses for debt instruments or balances on nostro accounts for which the simplified impairment model does not apply, and which are carried at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income is determined using the three-stage impairment model in IFRS 9. The losses represent a forward-looking measurement of future losses that are generally subject to estimates.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\n#### financial position\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- Stage 1: The impairment upon initial recognition is measured on the basis of the expected losses in the event of default within the next twelve months after the reporting date.\n- Stage 2: If a financial asset's credit risk has increased significantly, the expected credit loss is determined over the entire term. A significant increase in credit risk is determined individually using internal ratings. A significant increase in the credit risk is assumed if an asset is downgraded by three levels within the internal rating system.\n- Stage 3: Credit-impaired financial assets are allocated to Stage 3 and the impairment is based on the full lifetime expected credit losses. This is the case if there are observable data of significant financial difficulties and there is a high risk of default, even if the definition of a default has not yet been met.\n\nIf the credit risk for debt instruments at amortised cost and at fair value through profit or loss or for balances on nostro accounts for which the simplified impairment model does not apply, is low in absolute terms as at the reporting date, they remain in Stage 1 even if the default risk has increased.\n\nWe have the following two triggers to identify a default event and which cause a transfer to Stage 3 of the model:\n\n- Legal default event: A contracting party of the Group is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations due to its insolvency.\n- Contractual default event: A contracting party of the Group is unable or unwilling to fulfil its contractual obligations in a timely manner. The non-fulfilment of the contractual obligation could result in a financial loss for us.\n\nWe measure the expected credit losses for trade receivables using a simplified approach, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognised from initial recognition of a receivable. Due to the high recovery rate for trade receivables with a due date of less than 360 days, a default is assumed for amounts which are overdue for more than 360 days.\n\nA detailed list of expected credit losses is shown i[n note](#page-211-0) 24.\n\n# Financial liabilities\n\n## Additions and disposals\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised when a Group company becomes a party to the financial instrument. Purchases and sales of equities via the central counterparty Eurex Clearing AG are recognised at the settlement date analogous to financial assets. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation has been extinguished because it has been discharged or cancelled or has expired.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial liabilities not held for trading are accounted for at amortised cost. The borrowing costs associated with the placement of financial liabilities are included in the carrying amount and accounted for using the effective interest method if they are directly attributable. Discounts are amortised over the term of the liabilities using the effective interest method. Liabilities for the acquisition of non-controlling shares settled in cash or another financial asset are recognised at the present value of the future purchase price. The effect of the present value of accrued interest on the financial obligation and all measurement changes in the obligation is subsequently measured through profit or loss. The equity interest attributable to non-controlling shareholders underlying the transaction is accounted for as if it had already been acquired at the time of the transaction.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)\n- financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nContingent purchase payments recognised by the purchaser of a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 are not measured at amortised cost. The resulting financial liabilities are recognised at fair value. With a contingent purchase price component the purchaser is obliged to transfer additional assets or shares to the seller if certain conditions are met. Subsequent measurement is at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nWe do not make use of the option to designate financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition (fair value option).\n\nOur exposure to various risks associated with the financial instruments is discussed i[n note 24. T](#page-211-0)he maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above.\n\n## Presentation and netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position are divided into non-current and current. They are presented as non-current if the remaining term is more than twelve months as at the reporting date. They are presented as current assets if the remaining term is less than twelve months.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and only the net amount is presented in the consolidated balance sheet when a Group company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n# Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe derivative financial instruments we use include interest rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange options.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is taken out. The Group applies the provisions of IFRS 9 to account for hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting. When a hedging transaction takes place the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item is documented in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9.\n\nAll other derivative transactions serve mainly to hedge foreign exchange risks in economic hedging relationships. They are classified as \"held for trading\" for accounting purposes and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period at fair value through profit or loss. Depending on the type of transaction, gains and losses from the subsequent measurement are either recognised in the result of treasury activities in banking business and similar business, in result from financial investments or in the financial result.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n- [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting\n\nAs in the previous year, in the reporting year we used cash flow hedge accounting for hedges of foreign exchange risk on highly likely transactions and to hedge translation effects for monetary items within the Group. The cash flow hedge used the previous year to hedge the interest rate risk of a planned security issue was terminated when the bond issue was completed.\n\nThe effectiveness of the hedging relationship is assessed at the beginning and over the entire duration of the hedging relationship to ensure that there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. This entails establishing hedging transactions in which all the relevant contractual parameters of the hedging instrument exactly match those of the hedged item. Hedging of planned transactions may be ineffective if the timing of the planned transaction differs from the original estimate. Ineffectiveness due to changes in our default risk or that of the counterparty to the hedging transaction is deemed to be negligible. Effectiveness is measured regularly as at the reporting dates. The Group uses the hypothetical derivative method for this purpose.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is shown in the reserve for cash flow hedges as part of other comprehensive income; it is limited to the cumulative absolute change in the fair value of the hedged item value since the hedging transaction. Gains or losses on the ineffective portion are recognised directly through profit or loss either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in result from financial investments. The ineffective portion of interest rate hedges is recognised either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in the financial result. If forward contracts are used to hedge planned transactions we designate the entire change in the fair value of the forward, including the forward component, as a hedging instrument. In this case the gains or losses from the effective portion of the change in fair value for the entire future transaction are recognised in the reserve for cash flow hedges as a component of\n\nequity. If the Group uses futures to hedge existing receivables and liabilities, only the spot component of the future is designated. Gains or losses from the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the future are shown in the reserve for cash flow hedges.\n\nChanges in the forward component of the hedging instrument that relates to the hedged item are considered to be hedging costs and shown separately in the reserve for hedging costs in other comprehensive income. The fair value of the forward component not included in the hedging relationship at the time it is designated is written off pro rata temporis over the period of the hedging relationship. The amount written down is recycled from the reserve for hedging costs to profit or loss.\n\nCumulative amounts in the reserve for cash flow hedges are reclassified according to the following methodology:\n\n- If the cash flow hedges serve to hedge a planned transaction, the amount from the hedging instrument that has accumulated in other comprehensive income up to the acquisition date is derecognised from the reserve and treated as part of the acquisition costs.\n- For cash flow hedges of existing receivables and liabilities, the amount that has accumulated in the reserve for cash flow hedges is reclassified to profit or loss in the periods in which there are changes in the hedged future cash flows recognised through profit or loss.\n- If this amount is a loss, however, and the assumption is that all or part of this loss cannot be recouped in future periods, then this amount is recognised immediately through profit or loss.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n Reclassified amounts for foreign exchange hedges are either recognised in the result of treasury activities in banking business and similar business or in result from financial investments. For interest rate hedges recognition is either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in the financial result.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. However, the hedging relationship continues if it was designated as a rolling hedge from the outset. To the extent that the expected transaction is still considered to be highly probable, the expiring positions are replaced by new hedging instruments. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThis item comprises strategic investments which we have irrevocably elected to recognise at fair value through other comprehensive income in this category at initial recognition. The carrying amount as at 31 December 2023 was €222.7 million (2022: €182.8 million).\n\nNone of these financial assets was pledged as collateral. There was an increase of €9.3 million in strategic equity investments in 2023 due to new investments.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0) \n\n- comprehensive income\n- [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0)\n\n[Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0)\n\n[Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)\n\n#### financial position\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n#### Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n| in €m                                                   | 2023 | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------|--------|\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in other comprehensive income |      |        |\n| Strategic investments                                   | 25.5 | - 37.1 |\n| Debt instruments                                        | 0    | - 0.3  |\n| Total                                                   | 25.5 | - 37.4 |\n\n# Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n### Composition of financial assets at amortised cost\n\n|                                                    | 31 Dec 2023 |          |          | 31 Dec 20221 |           |           |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|\n| in €m                                              | Non-current | Current  | Total    | Non-current  | Current   | Total     |\n| Trade Receivables                                  | 0           | 1,832.2  | 1,832.2  | 0            | 2,289.2   | 2,289.2   |\n| of which expected losses                           | 0           | - 8.3    | - 8.3    | 0            | - 6.3     | - 6.3     |\n| Other financial assets measured at amortised costs | 1,801.9     | 18,046.2 | 19,848.0 | 1,894.7      | 18,670.8  | 20,565.5  |\n| Fixed income securities                            | 1,756.0     | 219.2    | 1,975.2  | 1,782.1      | 522.9     | 2,305.0   |\n| Balances on nostro accounts                        | 0           | 436.4    | 436.4    | 0            | 613.4     | 613.4     |\n| Money market lendings                              | 0           | 16,407.1 | 16,407.1 | 0            | 16,272.6  | 16,272.6  |\n| Customer overdrafts from settlement business       | 0           | 390.5    | 390.5    | 0            | 130.1     | 130.1     |\n| Receivables from CCP balances                      | 0           | 341.5    | 341.5    | 0            | 1,076.6   | 1,076.6   |\n| Other                                              | 45.8        | 251.5    | 297.3    | 112.7        | 55.2      | 167.9     |\n| of which expected losses                           | - 0.4       | - 2.3    | - 2.7    | - 0.4        | - 1.5     | - 1.9     |\n| Restricted bank balances                           | 0           | 53,669.4 | 53,669.4 | 0            | 93,538.3  | 93,538.3  |\n| Cash and other bank balances                       | 0           | 1,655.1  | 1,655.1  | 0            | 1,275.6   | 1,275.6   |\n| Total                                              | 1,801.9     | 75,202.8 | 77,004.7 | 1,894.7      | 115,773.9 | 117,668.6 |\n\n1) Previous year adjusted, see note 3.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/170/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Purchases and sales of equities and bonds via the Eurex Clearing AG central counterparty are recognised and simultaneously derecognised at the settlement date. For products that are marked to market (futures, options on futures, as well as OTC interest-rate derivatives), the clearing houses recognise gains and losses on open positions of clearing members on each exchange day. By means of the variation margin, profits and losses on open positions resulting from market price fluctuations are settled on a daily basis. The difference between this and other margin types is that the variation margin does not comprise collateral, but is a daily offsetting of profits and losses in cash. Therefore, futures and OTC interest rate derivatives are not reported in the consolidated balance sheet. \"Traditional\" options, for which the buyer must pay the option premium in full upon purchase, are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Receivables and liabilities from repo transactions and from cash-collateralised securities lending transactions are classified as held for trading and carried at fair value.\n\nThe fair values recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are based on daily settlement prices, which the clearing houses determine and publish according to the rules defined in the contract specifications.\n\n#### Composition of financial instruments held by central counterparties\n\n| in €m               | 31 Dec 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Repo transactions   | 118,074.6   | 109,687.8   |\n| Options             | 27,498.0    | 29,323.4    |\n| Total               | 145,572.5   | 139,011.2   |\n| thereof non-current | 7,667.6     | 9,078.4     |\n| thereof current     | 137,904.9   | 129,932.8   |\n\nReceivables and liabilities that may be offset against a clearing member are reported on a net basis.

Of the total, €2,596.0 million (31 December 2022: €1,554.6 million) relate to foreign exchange derivatives with a positive fair value and €1,410.7 million (31 December 2022: €3,997.7 million) to derivatives with a negative fair value. These foreign currency derivatives are mainly used to convert payments received in US dollars into euros for liquidity management purposes and also as an alternative to unsecured deposits and loans, to hedge the unsecured counterparty risk and liquidity risk in everyday liquidity management.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n#### Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n| in €m                                                                                                      | 2023    | 2022  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|\n| Net gain/(loss) from derivatives not designated as hedges                                                  | - 90.0  | 74.5  |\n| Net gain/(loss) from cash flow hedges                                                                      | - 2.7   | - 1.1 |\n| Net gain/(loss) from cash flow IRS hedges                                                                  | 0       | 3.8   |\n| Net gain/(loss) from other financial assets measured at fair             value through profit or loss      | - 4.4   | - 4.9 |\n| Distributions from fund units                                                                              | 0.6     | 11.4  |\n| Net gain/(loss) from other financial liabilities measured at fair             value through profit or loss | - 9.5   | - 4.6 |\n| Total                                                                                                      | - 106.0 | 79.1  |\n\n## Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting\n\nWe enter into cash flow hedges to hedge existing or future transactions. The hedged items covered by hedge accounting consist of internal Group loans and highly probable planned transactions.\n\nThe effects of foreign currency hedging instruments on the financial position and financial performance is as follows:\n\nThe foreign exchange forwards designated as hedging instruments are for US dollars and are in the same currency as the internal foreign exchange transactions and the highly probable future transactions. Therefore, the hedge ratio is 1:1. The foreign exchange hedging transactions in US dollars are due in 2024.\n\n#### Hedging transactions in cash flow hedges\n\n|                                                                                                                                       | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Foreign exchange derivative<br>in USD                                                                                                 |       |       |\n| Positive<br>market value                                                                                                              |       |       |\n| Carrying<br>amount<br>in €m                                                                                                           | 5.3   | 5.4   |\n| Notional amount<br>in USDm                                                                                                            | 159.0 | 156.0 |\n| Cumulative change in<br>value of hedged<br>items used<br>to<br>deter<br>mine the ineffectiveness of<br>the hedging relationship in €m | 5.3   | 5.4   |\n| Weighted<br>average hedge rate for hedging<br>instruments                                                                             | 1.1   | 1.0   |\n| Negative<br>market value                                                                                                              |       |       |\n| Carrying<br>amount<br>in €m                                                                                                           | 9.9   | 26.8  |\n| Notional amount<br>in USDm                                                                                                            | 227.0 | 340.8 |\n| Cumulative change in<br>value of hedged<br>items used<br>to<br>deter<br>mine the ineffectiveness of<br>the hedging relationship in €m | 4.3   | 24.9  |\n| Weighted<br>average hedge rate for hedging<br>instruments                                                                             | 1.2   | 1.2   |\n\nInterest rate hedges with a nominal volume of €2,000.0 million and foreign exchange hedges with a nominal volume of US\\$ 113.8 million expired in 2023.\n\nThe revaluation surplus for cash shown in other comprehensive income relates to the following hedging instruments:\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/175/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular icons in a horizontal row.

The amounts in the reserve for cash flow hedges relating to interest rate swaps are reversed pro rata temporis until April 2032.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe financial assets measured at fair value includes financial assets and liabilities at the following three hierarchy levels:\n\n- Level 1: Financial instruments with a quoted price for identical assets and liabilities in an active market.\n- Level 2: Financial instruments with no quoted prices for identical instruments on an active market and whose fair value is determined using valuation methods based on observable market parameters.\n- Level 3: Financial instruments where the fair value is determined using one or more unobservable significant inputs. This does not apply to listed equity instruments\n\nThere were no transfers between levels for recurring fair value measurements during the year under review.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/176/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

December 2022 were adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe change in financial assets measured at FVOCI is mainly due to the acquisition of strategic investments in the amount of €9.3 million and positive valuation effects in the amount of €7.2 million, which were recognised in the revaluation surplus with no effect on profit or loss. In addition to the acquisition of fund shares in the amount of €4.7 million and convertible bonds in the amount of €14.2 million measured at FVPL, negative valuation effects in the amount of €16.6 million resulted. The increase in other non-current liabilities measured at FVPL is mainly due to the first time recognition of derivatives that were not in the money on the balance sheet date.\n\nThe unobservable inputs can generally consist of a range of values that are considered probable. The sensitivity analysis determines the fair values of the financial instruments using input factors that lie at the lower or upper limit of the possible range. The fair values of the Level 3 financial instruments would change as follows when using these inputs:\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

The central pillar of the collateral systems is the determination of the overall risk per clearing member (margin) to be covered by cash or securities collateral. Losses calculated on the basis of current prices and potential future price risks are covered up to the date of the next collateral payment.\n\nIn addition to these daily collateral payments, each clearing member must make contributions to the respective default fund (for further details, s[ee \"Risk](#page-63-0)  [report\" se](#page-63-0)ction in the combined management report). Cash collateral is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under \"cash deposits by market participants\" and the corresponding amounts under \"restricted bank balances\".\n\nSecurities collateral is generally not derecognised by the clearing member providing the collateral, as the opportunities and risks associated with the securities are not transferred to the secure party. Recognition at the secure party is only permissible if the clearing member providing the transfer is in default according to the underlying contract.\n\nThe aggregate margin calls based on the executed transactions and default fund requirements after haircuts was €100,990.9 million as at the reporting date (2022: €155,339.1 million), collateral totalling €122,728.5 million (2022: €182,104.6 million) was actually deposited.\n\n#### Composition of collateral held by central counterparties\n\n| in €m                                                 | 31<br>Dec<br>2023 | 31<br>Dec<br>2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Cash collateral (cash deposits)1,3                    | 53,318.6          | 93,067.7          |\n| Securities and<br>book-entry securities collateral2,3 | 69,409.9          | 89,036.9          |\n| Total                                                 | 122,728.5         | 182,104.6         |\n\n1) The amount includes the clearing fund totalling €6,292.8 million (2022: €7,580.5 million), 2) The amount includes the clearing fund totalling €2,709.7 million (2022: €2,481.6 million), 3) The collateral value is determined on the basis of the fair value less a haircut\n\n# 13 Contract balances\n\nThe Group has recognised the following assets and liabilities from contracts with customers:\n\n#### Contract balances\n\n|                      | 31.12.2023  |         |       |  | 31.12.2022  |         |       |  |\n|----------------------|-------------|---------|-------|--|-------------|---------|-------|--|\n| in €m                | non-current | current | Total |  | non-current | current | Total |  |\n| Contract costs       | 10.5        | 11.0    | 21.5  |  | 5.7         | 8.5     | 14.2  |  |\n| Contract assets      | 259.6       | 87.8    | 347.4 |  | 0           | 0       | 0     |  |\n| Contract liabilities | 11.9        | 203.0   | 214.8 |  | 13.6        | 172.0   | 185.6 |  |\n\nContract costs are \"incremental costs of obtaining a contract\" within the meaning of IFRS 15 and include sales commissions.

The €177.8 million included in contract liabilities as at 31 December 2022 was recognised as revenue in the financial year 2023.

similar obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis of actuarial reports. Calculating the present value requires certain actuarial assumptions (e.g. discount rate, staff turnover rate, salary and pension trends) to be made. The current service cost and the net interest expense or income for the subsequent period are calculated on the basis of these assumptions.\n\nThe fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligations, if necessary taking into account the regulations on the upper limit of the value of plan assets in excess of the obligation (so-called asset ceiling), so that the net pension obligation or the asset value from the defined benefit plans results. Net interest expense for the financial year is calculated by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the financial year to the net defined benefit liability determined as at that date.\n\nThe relevant discount rate is determined by reference to the return on longterm corporate bonds with a rating of at least AA (Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings, Fitch Ratings and DBRS) on the basis of the information provided by Bloomberg, and a maturity that corresponds approximately to the maturity of the pension obligations. Moreover, the bonds must be denominated in the same currency as the underlying pension obligation. Measurement of the pension obligations in euros is based on a discount rate which is determined according to the adjusted \"GlobalRate:Link\" methodology from the advisory company Willis Towers Watson, updated in line with the current market trend.\n\nThe actuarial gains or losses and the difference between the expected and the actual return or loss on plan assets are recognised in other comprehensive income in the revaluation surplus. They result from changes in expectations with regard to life expectancy, pension trends, salary trends and the discount rate.\n\nOther long-term benefits for employees and members of executive boards (total disability pension, transitional payments) are also measured using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses and past service cost are recognised immediately and in full through profit or loss.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/189/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The benefit assets equal the total of the acquired capital components of the individual years and are converted into a lifelong pension once the benefits fall due. In addition, retirement benefit agreements are in place with members of the executive boards of Group companies, under which they are entitled to pension benefits upon reaching the age of 63 and following reappointment. When the term of office began, the replacement rate was 30 per cent of individual pensionable income. It rose by 5 percentage points with each reappointment, up to a maximum of 50 per cent of pensionable income.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Germany\n\nThere is an employee-funded deferred compensation plan for employees of certain Deutsche Börse Group companies in Germany who joined prior to 1 January 2019. Under this plan, it is possible to convert portions of future remuneration entitlements into benefit assets of equal value which bear interest of 6 per cent p.a. The benefits consist of a capital payment made in equal annual instalments over a period of three years upon the reaching the age of 65 or at an earlier date due to disability or death.\n\nIn the period from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2006, executives in Germany were offered the opportunity to participate in the following pension system based on capital components: the benefit is based on annual income received, composed of fixed annual salary and the variable remuneration. Every year, participating Group companies provide for an amount that corresponds to a certain percentage of the pensionable income. The participating companies provide an amount corresponding to a specific percentage of this eligible income every year. This amount is multiplied by a capitalisation factor depending on age, resulting in the \"annual capital component\". The benefit assets equal the total of the acquired capital components of the individual years and are converted into a lifelong pension once the benefits fall due. This benefit plan was closed to new staff on 30 June 2006; the executives who were employed in the above period can continue to earn capital components.\n\nAs part of adjustments to the remuneration systems to bring them into line with supervisory requirements, contracts were adjusted for some executives. For executives affected, whose contracts allowed for the inclusion of only the income received and the variable remuneration above the upper limit of the contribution assessment as pensionable income, the pensionable income was determined on the basis of income received from the year 2016. This is adjusted annually to account for the increase of the cost of living according to the consumer price index for Germany as issued by the Federal Statistical Office. For executives affected whose capital components were calculated on the basis of income received, without observing the upper limit of the contribution assessment, an amount has been determined that will be reviewed annually, and adjusted if necessary, by the Supervisory Board, taking any changes in circumstances in terms of income and purchasing power into account.\n\n#### Luxembourg\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan in favour of Luxembourg employees is funded by means of cash contributions to an \"association d'épargne pension\" (ASSEP) organized in accordance with Luxembourg law. The benefits consist of a one-off capital payment, which is generally paid upon reaching the age of 65. Employees receive an annual account statement showing their current balance. The pension plan does not pay any benefits in the event of death or disability. Contributions to the ASSEP are funded in full by the participating companies. The contributions are determined annually on the basis of actuarial opinions in accordance with Luxembourg law.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/191/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular icons in a horizontal row.

at the reporting date using actuarial techniques. The assumptions for determining the actuarial obligations for the pension plans differ according to the individual conditions in the countries concerned and are shown in the following table:\n\n#### Actuarial assumptions\n\n| in %                 | 31 Dec 2023 |            | 31 Dec 2022 |            |\n|----------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|\n|                      | Germany     | Luxembourg | Germany     | Luxembourg |\n| Discount rate        | 3.18        | 3.18       | 3.73        | 3.73       |\n| Salary growth        | 3.00        | 3.50       | 3.00        | 3.50       |\n| Pension growth       | 2.20        | 0          | 2.20        | 0          |\n| Staff turnover rate1 | 2.00        | 2.00       | 2.00        | 2.00       |\n\n1) Up to the age of 50, afterwards 0 per cent\n\nIn Germany, the \"2018 G\" mortality tables (generation tables) developed by Klaus Heubeck are used. For Luxembourg, generation tables of the Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg are used.\n\nOwing to the current very high inflation rates, pension adjustments in the next two to three years will significantly exceed the assumed (long-term) pension trend. This cumulative inflation (adjustment backlog) was taken into account in the corresponding commitments through the one-off increase in pensions.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis presented in the following considers the change in one assumption of the main plans in Germany and Luxembourg at a time, leaving the other assumptions unchanged from the original calculation, i.e. possible correlation effects between the individual assumptions are not taken into account.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/193/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

At the company's instruction, the trustee uses the funds transferred to acquire securities, without any consulting by the trustee. The contributions are invested in accordance with an investment policy, which may be amended by the companies represented in the investment committee. The trustee may refuse to carry out instructions if they are in conflict with the fund's allocation rules or the payment provisions. In accordance with the investment policy, a value preservation mechanism is applied; investments can be made in different asset classes.\n\n#### Luxembourg\n\nIn Luxembourg, the Board of Directors of the Clearstream Pension Fund is responsible for determining the investment strategy, with the aim of maximising returns in relation to a benchmark. This benchmark is 75 per cent derived from the return on five-year German federal government bonds and 25 per cent from the return on the EURO STOXX 50 Index. According to the investment policy, the fund may only invest in fixed-income and variable-rate securities, as well as listed investment fund units; it may hold cash, including in the form of money market funds.\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n- \n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n\nthe Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\n#### [Executive and Supervisory Board](#page-2-0)\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nfinancial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### Composition of plan assets\n\n| in €m                               | 31 Dec 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |       |         |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|\n| Bonds                               | 420.5       | 78.0 %      | 400.1 | 81.0 %  |\n| Government bonds                    | 319.0       |             | 301.0 |         |\n| Multilateral develop-<br>ment banks | 92.8        |             | 82.4  |         |\n| Corporate bonds                     | 8.7         |             | 16.7  |         |\n| Derivatives                         | 6.9         | 1.3 %       | - 0.2 | - 0.0 % |\n| Stock index<br>futures              | 3.7         |             | - 0.1 |         |\n| Interest<br>rate futures            | 3.2         |             | - 0.1 |         |\n| Investment funds                    | 31.0        | 5.7 %       | 30.0  | 6.1 %   |\n| Total<br>listed                     | 458.4       | 85.0 %      | 430.0 | 87.1 %  |\n| Qualifying<br>insurance<br>policies | 49.0        | 9.1 %       | 42.9  | 8.7 %   |\n| Cash                                | 31.9        | 5.9 %       | 20.9  | 4.2 %   |\n| Total not<br>listed                 | 80.9        | 15.0 %      | 63.8  | 12.9 %  |\n| Total plan assets                   | 539.3       | 100.0 %     | 493.8 | 100.0 % |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 the plan assets did not include any financial instruments of the Group (2022: zero). Neither did they include any properties or other assets used by companies in Deutsche Börse Group.\n\n## Risks\n\nIn addition to the general actuarial risks, the risks associated with the defined benefit obligations relate especially to financial risks in connection with the plan assets, including in particular counterparty credit and market risks.\n\n# Market risk\n\nThe return on plan assets is assumed to be the discount rate determined on the basis of corporate bonds with an AA rating. If the actual rate of return on plan assets is lower than the discount rate used, the net defined benefit liability increases accordingly. If volatility is low, the actual return is further expected to exceed the return on corporate bonds with a good rating in the medium to long term. The amount of the net obligation is also influenced in particular by changes in the discount rates. We consider the share price risk resulting from derivative positions in equity index futures in the plan assets to be appropriate. The company bases its assessment on the expectation that the overall volume of payments from the pension plans will be manageable in the next few years, that the total amount of the obligations will also be manageable and that it will be able to meet these payments in full from operating cash flows. Any amendments to the investment policy take into account the duration of the pension obligation as well as the expected payments over a period of ten years.\n\n### Inflation risk\n\nPossible inflation risks that could lead to an increase in defined benefit obligations exist because some pension plans are final salary plans or the annual capital components are directly related to salaries, i.e. a significant increase in salaries would lead to an increase in the benefit obligation from these plans. In Germany, however, there are no contractual arrangements with regard to inflation risk for these pension plans. An interest rate of 6 per cent p.a. has been agreed for the employee-financed deferred compensation plan; the plan does not include any arrangements for inflation, so that it has to be assumed that there will be little incentive for employees to contribute to the deferred compensation plan in times of rising inflation. In Luxembourg, salaries are adjusted for the effects of inflation on the basis of a consumer price index no more than once a year; this adjustment leads to a corresponding increase in the benefit obligation from the pension plan. Since the obligation will be met\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In addition, contributions are paid to the statutory pension insurance scheme. The level of contributions is normally determined in relation to income. As a rule, no provisions are recognised for defined contribution plans. The contributions paid are reported as pension expenses in the year of payment. There are defined contribution pension plans for employees in several countries. In addition, the employer pays contributions to employees' private pension funds.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the costs associated with defined contribution plans amounted to €61.3 million (2022: €54.6 million).\n\n### Multi-employer plans\n\nSeveral Deutsche Börse Group companies are member institutions of BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G., a pension insurance provider with its registered office in Berlin. Employees and employers make regular contributions, which are used to provide guaranteed pension plans, and a potential surplus. The contributions to be made are derived from contribution rates applied to active employees' monthly gross salaries, taking into account specific financial thresholds. Member institutions have a subsidiary liability for the fulfilment of BVV's agreed pension benefits. However, we consider the risk that this liability will be invoked as remote. Given that BVV membership is governed by several Works Council Agreements, membership termination is subject to certain conditions. The notice period for termination is defined in the articles of association of the BVV pension scheme. The employer retains a subsidiary liability for the pension entitlements of every individual employee that have vested as at the termination date. Deutsche Börse Group considers BVV pension obligations as multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. However, we currently lack information regarding the allocation of BVV assets to\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-196-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nindividual member institutions and the respective beneficiaries. Moreover, we do not know Deutsche Börse Group's actual share in BVV's total obligations. This plan is therefore shown in the Group's financial reporting as a defined contribution plan. On the basis of current information published by BVV there is no shortfall that could affect the future contributions payable by the Group. The Deutsche Börse Group is not liable for commitments by other members of BVV.\n\nEPEX Netherlands B.V. participates in the ABP pension fund within the EEX subgroup. Participation is mandatory for all employees. Employer contributions are calculated by ABP and adjusted, if necessary. Since the allocation of assets to member institutions and beneficiaries is not possible, this pension plan can also be presented only as a defined contribution plan.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the costs associated with such designated multiemployer plans amounted to €10.3 million (2022: €10.1 million). In 2024 we expect to make contributions to multi-employer plans amounting to around €10.3 million.\n\n# 18 Share-based payment\n\nShare-based payments for employees, managers and Executive Board members comprise cash-settled remuneration plans and remuneration plans settled with equity instruments. The main remuneration plans at Deutsche Börse Group are described below.\n\n# Stock Bonus Plan (SBP)\n\nThe SBP is open to senior executives of Deutsche Börse AG and its participating subsidiaries. It grants a long-term remuneration component in the form of so-called SBP shares. These are generally accounted for as share-based payments for which Deutsche Börse AG has a choice of settlement in cash or equity instruments for certain tranches. Tranches due in previous years were each settled in cash. In the reporting period, the Deutsche Börse Group established an additional tranche of the SBP for senior executives who are not risk takers. In order to participate in the SBP, beneficiaries must have earned a bonus. The awards are settled in cash and the SBP shares are measured as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The cost of the options is estimated using an option pricing model (fair value measurement) and recognised in staff costs in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe number of stock options is determined by the amount of the individual and performance-based SBP bonus for the financial year, divided by the average share price (Xetra closing price) of Deutsche Börse AG's shares in the fourth quarter of the financial year in question. Neither the converted SBP bonus nor the stock options are paid at the time the bonus is determined. Rather, the entitlement is generally received three years after the grant date (the \"waiting period\"). Within this period, beneficiaries cannot assert shareholder rights (in particular, the rights to receive dividends and attend the Annual General Meeting). Once they have met the condition of service, the beneficiaries' claims resulting from the SBP are calculated on the first trading day following the last day of the waiting period. The current market price at that date (closing auction price of Deutsche Börse shares in electronic trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) is multiplied by the number of stock options. Stock options are settled in cash.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/197/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

This programme was extended in 2016 with the Restricted Stock Units (RSU) plan. The following disclosures relate to both plans.\n\n### Long-Term Sustainable Instrument (LSI)\n\nThe LSI remuneration model requires at least half of a part of the variable remuneration to be settled in cash and half in phantom shares of Deutsche Börse AG (LSI shares). All tranches will be settled in cash. A portion of the variable remuneration is paid in the subsequent year and another portion over a further period of three or four years. Moreover, a portion of the variable remuneration shall be converted into RSU, subject to a three-year retention period after grant and a one-year waiting period (RSU shares). Deutsche Börse Group thus measures the LSI shares as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The options are measured using an option pricing model (fair value measurement). Any right to payment of a stock bonus only vests after the expiration of the one-year service period on which the plan is based, taking certain waiting periods into account.\n\nThe number of LSI and RSU shares for the 2017 tranche is calculated by dividing the proportionate LSI or RSU bonus, respectively, for the year in question by the average closing price of Deutsche Börse AG shares in the last month of a financial year. The number of LSI and RSU shares for the 2018- 2023 tranches is based on the closing auction price of Deutsche Börse shares as at the disbursement date of the cash component of the respective tranche (cash bonus) in the following year or on the closing price as at the following trading day on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. This results in individual LSI\n\ntranches for the LSI bonus, which have maturities of between one and five years. The RSU bonus is used as a basis for another four-year tranche. Payment of each tranche is made after a waiting period of one year. Neither remuneration system stipulates any condition of service. Following the expiry of the waiting period, both the LSI and the RSU shares of the 2017 tranche are measured on the basis of the average closing price of Deutsche Börse AG shares in the last month preceding the end of the waiting period. The LSI and RSU shares of the 2018-2023 tranches are measured at the closing auction price as at the first trading day in February of the year in which the holding period ends. In the reporting year LSI shares from the tranches 2017-2021 were disbursed with a disbursement price of €168.05 for the shares in the tranche 2017. The disbursement price for the tranches 2018-2021 was €166.35. The difference in payout share prices is caused by the nature of the specific terms and conditions for the respective tranches.\n\n#### Restricted Stock Units (RSU)\n\nLike the LSI plan, the RSU plan applies to risk takers within Deutsche Börse Group. RSU shares are settled in cash; Deutsche Börse Group thus measures the RSU shares as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The options are measured using an option pricing model (fair value measurement). Any right to payment of a stock bonus only vests after the expiration of the oneyear service period on which the plan is based, taking a three-year retention period and a one-year waiting period into account. No RSU shares were paid out in the reporting year.\n\n#### Measurement of the LSI and the RSU\n\nTo determine the fair value of the subscription rights, the intrinsic value of the additional pro rata subscription rights is calculated, which also includes an expectation about future dividend payments.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/200/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The number of phantom PSP shares to be allocated is calculated based on the number of shares granted and the increase of net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders, as well as on the relative performance of the total shareholder return (TSR) on Deutsche Börse AG's shares compared with the total shareholder return of the STOXX Europe 600 Financials Index constituents. The shares are subject to a performance period of five years. The subsequent payment of the stock bonus will be settled in cash.\n\nThe 100 per cent stock bonus target was calculated in euros for each Executive Board member. The 100 per cent stock bonus target for selected executives and employees of Deutsche Börse AG and participating subsidiaries is defined by the responsible decision-making bodies. Based on the PSP 100 per cent stock bonus target, the corresponding number of phantom shares for each beneficiary was calculated by dividing the stock bonus target by the average share price (Xetra closing price) of Deutsche Börse AG's shares in the last calendar month preceding the performance period. Any right to payment of a PSP stock bonus vested only at the end of a five-year performance period.\n\nThe final number of Performance Shares was calculated by multiplying the original number of Performance Shares with the level of overall target achievement. The PSP level of overall target achievement was based on two performance factors during the performance period: firstly, on the relative performance of the total shareholder return (TSR) on Deutsche Börse AG's shares\n\ncompared with the total shareholder return of the STOXX Europe 600 Financials Index as the peer group; and secondly, on the increase of Deutsche Börse AG's net profit for the period attributable to shareholders of the parent company. The two performance factors contribute 50 per cent each to calculate overall target achievement. For the 2021 and 2022 tranches the overall target achievement depends on the performance against three different metrics over the performance period. The total shareholder return (TSR) for the Deutsche Börse AG share compared with the total shareholder return for the STOXX Europe 600 Financials Index accounts for 50 per cent. The annual growth rate for adjusted earnings per share over the performance period accounts for a further 25 per cent. The remaining 25 per cent are calculated by reference to performance against four equally weighted ESG targets.\n\nThe payout amount is calculated by multiplying the final number of performance shares with the average share price of Deutsche Börse AG's shares (Xetra closing price) in the last calendar month preceding the performance period, plus the total of dividend payments made during the performance period based on the final number of performance shares. In the reporting year shares from the 2018 PSP tranche were disbursed at a price of €182.30. Until the 2021 tranche, servicing and treatment will be in accordance with the cash settlement rules. Settlement is in cash and with the exception of the 2021- 2023 tranches the transaction is measured and recognised as cash-settled share-based remuneration. Because of their specific contractual conditions the 2021-2023 tranches are treated as a settlement with equity instruments.\n\n#### Measurement of the PSP\n\nTo determine the fair value of the subscription rights, the intrinsic value of the additional pro rata subscription rights is calculated, which also includes an expectation about future dividend payments.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement

Under the GSP tranche for the year 2023, the participating employees could subscribe for up to 50 shares of the Company at a discount of 40 per cent and another 50 shares at a discount of 10 per cent. The acquired shares are subject to a lock-up period of two years.\n\nThe expense of this discount is recognised in the income statement at the grant date. In the reporting period, expenses totalling €7.4 million (2022: €6.3 million) were recognised in staff costs for the GSP.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/204/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

It grants a long-term remuneration component in the form of virtual shares in the former Qontigo subgroup. These are generally accounted for as sharebased payments. The remuneration payable to the beneficiaries is intended to reflect the economic development of the former Qontigo sub-group. The MIP contains a time-based and a performance-based component. The vesting period is three years, and under certain circumstances can be exercised early. It began when the transaction was completed. Due to a potential payout with cash by Group Deutsche Börse, the MIP is accounted for under the principles of a cash-settlement.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the virtual shares is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation on the respective balance sheet date, which appropriately reflects the contractspecific conditions. The underlying simulations depend on the underlying from which the payment is linked to the beneficiaries of the MIP. The enterprise value of the former Qontigo Group serves as the underlying. On the basis of the simulations carried out, a discounted average payment of the contractually agreed payment flows to the respective participants is calculated. The main valuation parameters include the enterprise value and the expected volatility of the former Qontigo Group as well as the expected term and the contract-specific payment profile. A pro rata addition of expenses over the vesting period is conducted in accordance with the criteria for a non-forfeiture of the programme.\n\n# ISS Employee Incentive Programme (EIP)\n\nAn employee incentive programme has been set up for selected managers at ISS, which enables a long-term remuneration component in the form of virtual shares in ISS. The programme is accounted for as share-based payments. The amounts awarded to the beneficiaries are intended to reflect the economic development of ISS. The EIP contains a time-based and a performance-based component. The programme will be settled in the first quarter 2024 with shares in Deutsche Börse AG and is accounted for according to the rules for equity settlement.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the virtual shares was calculated at the date of allocation to the beneficiaries, using a Black-Scholes model with contract-specific inputs. The main valuation parameters included the enterprise value and the expected volatility of ISS, as well as the expected term and the contract-specific payment profile. In line with the vesting criteria, the value of the award is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.\n\n#### ISS STOXX Employee Incentive Programme\n\nAn employee incentive programme with market-standards conditions was set up for the senior management of the ISS STOXX sub-group. It grants a longterm remuneration component in the form of virtual shares and a virtual dividend right for the ISS STOXX sub-group. The programme enables the beneficiaries to participate in long-term valuation increases, so the accounting principles for share-based remuneration apply.\n\nThe vesting period is three years, and under certain circumstances can be exercised early. Grants to the programme beneficiaries were made in late 2023 and early 2024. Since the main contractual conditions were agreed with the beneficiaries in 2023 and the employees had already started their work, Deutsche Börse Group started recognising the corresponding expenses in Q3 2023.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/205/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The virtual dividend right is settled in cash, so this component is accounted for in accordance with the rules on cash settlement.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the virtual shares is calculated at the date of allocation to the beneficiaries, using a Black-Scholes model with contract-specific inputs. The main valuation parameters include the enterprise value and the expected volatility of ISS STOXX, as well as the expected term. A pro rata addition of expenses over the vesting period is conducted in accordance with the criteria for a non-forfeiture of the programme. The value of the virtual dividend right is measured at each reporting date using current market parameters.\n\n### SimCorp Employee Incentive Programme\n\nEmployee incentive programmes with market-standards conditions were set up for the senior management and employees of SimCorp, which are settled in cash. They pay a long-term remuneration component in the form of restricted stock units (RSU) with contingent claims during the vesting period. The programme enables the beneficiaries to participate in long-term valuation increases, so the accounting principles for share-based remuneration apply.\n\nThe vesting period is five years from the award date. The first allocations were made to the beneficiaries before Deutsche Börse Group acquired control of SimCorp.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group has the option of changing and/or adjusting the terms of the incentive programme in agreement with the Executive Board of SimCorp on condition that any such changes and/or adjustments do not reduce the overall value of the restricted stock units.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the restricted stock units was adjusted on the basis of the transaction price reflecting the value of SimCorp at the time of the takeover by Deutsche Börse Group. In line with the vesting criteria, the value of the award is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-206-0\"></span>Image /page/206/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The amount of the provision corresponds to the best possible estimate of the outflow of resources required to fulfil the obligation as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe decline in other current liabilities results primarily from the decline in liabilities from CCP business. These liabilities are not part of the financial liabilities because the obligation does not consist of payment of cash but in physical delivery of commodities.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-207-0\"></span>Image /page/207/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

All current and future tranches may only be settled in cash. There are therefore no potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the Long-Term Sustainability Instrument.\n\nAs part of the employee incentive programmes at Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. as well as SimCorp A/S there are ongoing option rights, which had a small dilutive effect.\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n#### Calculation of earnings per share (basic and diluted)\n\n|                                                                                             | 2023        | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of shares outstanding<br>at<br>beginning<br>of period                                | 183,738,945 | 183,618,782 |\n| Number of shares outstanding<br>at<br>end<br>of period                                      | 185,112,460 | 183,738,945 |\n| Weighted<br>average number<br>of shares outstanding                                         | 184,298,877 | 183,630,715 |\n| Number of potentially<br>dilutive ordinary shares                                           | 290,191     | 354,805     |\n| Weighted<br>average number<br>of shares used<br>to<br>compute diluted<br>earnings per share | 184,589,068 | 183,985,520 |\n| Net profit<br>for the period<br>attributable to Deutsche Börse AG<br>shareholders (€m)      | 1,724.0     | 1,494.4     |\n| Earnings per share (basic) (€)                                                              | 9.35        | 8.14        |\n| Earnings per share (diluted) (€)                                                            | 9.34        | 8.12        |\n\n# 23 Segment reporting\n\nDeutsche Börse divides its business into four segments: This structure is used for the internal Group controlling and forms the basis for the financial reporting.

The effect of intercompany revenue is eliminated (in net revenue) at Group level, however, as the revenue generated within the Group by a segment has the same revenue-reducing effect in the respective segment. For an overview of intercompany revenue [see note 4. S](#page-140-0)ervices between segments are offset on the basis of measured amounts or fixed prices.\n\nOur business model – and that of all our segments – is focused on an internationally operating participant base and pricing does not differ depending on the customer's location. From a price, margin and risk perspective, this means it does not matter whether sales revenue is generated from German or international participants.\n\nThe risks and returns from the activities of the subsidiaries operating within the economic environment of the European Monetary Union (EMU) do not differ significantly from each other on the basis of the factors to be considered in identifying information on geographical regions under IFRS 8. We have therefore identified the following regions: Euro area, other Europe, America and Asia-Pacific.\n\nSales revenue is allocated to the individual regions according to the customer's domicile, while investments and non-current assets are allocated according to the company's domicile and employees according to their location.\n\nAs described above, the analysis of sales is based on the direct customer's billing address. This means e.g. that sales to an American investor trading a product with an Asian underlying via a European clearing member are classified as European sales.\n\n#### Information on geographical regions\n\n| in €m                                 | Sales revenue1 |         | Investments2 |       | Non-financial non-current assets3, 4 |         | Number of employees |        |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|---------|--------------|-------|--------------------------------------|---------|---------------------|--------|\n|                                       | 2023           | 2022    | 2023         | 2022  | 2023                                 | 2022    | 2023                | 2022   |\n| Euro zone                             | 2,715.6        | 2,543.2 | 211.7        | 281.1 | 4,478.8                              | 4,396.2 | 6,655               | 5,702  |\n| Rest of Europe                        | 1,466.9        | 1,315.0 | 25.2         | 8.7   | 5,376.9                              | 1,367.9 | 3,514               | 1,984  |\n| America                               | 719.7          | 640.3   | 27.0         | 32.8  | 3,307.3                              | 3,552.5 | 1,552               | 1,273  |\n| Asia-Pacific                          | 320.6          | 290.0   | 0            | 0.9   | 35.7                                 | 36.1    | 2,781               | 2,119  |\n| Total of all regions                  | 5,222.8        | 4,788.5 | 263.9        | 323.5 | 13,198.7                             | 9,352.7 | 14,502              | 11,078 |\n| Consolidation of internal net revenue | – 89.6         | – 96.2  | 0            | 0     | 0                                    | 0       | 0                   | 0      |\n| Group                                 | 5,133.2        | 4,692.3 | 263.9        | 323.5 | 13,198.7                             | 9,352.7 | 14,502              | 11,078 |\n\n1) Including countries in which more than 10 per cent of sales revenue was generated: Germany (2023: €1,084.0 million; 2022: €1,054.6 million), United Kingdom (2023: €916.2 million; 2022: €883.3 million) and United States (2023: €654.0 million; 2022: €582.3 million).\n\n2) Excluding goodwill and right-of-use assets from leasing.\n\n3) Including countries in which more than 10 per cent of assets are held: Denmark (2023: €3,989.7 million; 2022: €0.2 million), Germany (2023: €3,787.9 million; 2022: €3,701.1 million), United States (2023: €3,306.0 million; 2022: €3,552.5 million) and Switzerland (2023: €1,357.6 million; 2022: €1,334.6 million).\n\n4) These include intangible assets, property, plant and equipment as well as investments in associates and joint ventures.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-211-0\"></span>Image /page/211/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

They are quantified by reference to the economic capital concept (for detailed disclosures, see the sectio[n \"Financial](#page-72-0)  [risk\"\\).](#page-72-0) Required economic capital is assessed on a 99.9 per cent confidence level for a one-year holding period. It is compared with the Group's liable equity capital so as to test the Group's ability to absorb extreme and unexpected losses. Required economic capital (REC) for financial risk is calculated at the end of each month and amounted to €600.0 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\nWe evaluate our risk position continuously. In the view of the Executive Board, no threat to the continued existence of the Group can be identified at this time.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risks at DBG arise from trade receivables and contract assets, fixed income securities held at amortised cost, receivables from money market business, including reverse repos, overdraft facilities from the securities settlement business, receivables from the CCP business, cash and other bank balances. Further credit risks exist for fund interests and convertible bonds at fair value\n\nthrough profit or loss, for financial instruments of the central counterparties and derivative financial investments. Fundamentally and unless otherwise stated, the maximum risk exposure is the carrying amount shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### Cash investments\n\nClearstream receives cash deposits from its customers in various currencies, whereby Eurex Clearing AG receives cash collateral, mainly in EUR and CHF, and European Commodity Clearing AG mainly in EUR. These units invest the funds received in accordance with the treasury policy, which gives rise to a potential credit risk.\n\nWe mitigate such risks either – to the extent possible – by investing short-term funds on a secured basis, e.g. via reverse repurchase agreements, or by depositing them with central banks.\n\nEligible collateral for reverse repurchase agreements mainly consists of highly liquid financial instruments with a minimum rating of AA– (Standard & Poor's/Fitch) or Aa3 (Moody's) issued or guaranteed by governments or supranational institutions.\n\nCounterparty credit risk is monitored on the basis of an internal rating system. Unsecured cash investments are permitted only with counterparties with investment grade ratings within the framework of defined counterparty credit limits. An investment grade rating in this context means an internal rating of at least D, which corresponds to an external Fitch rating of at least BBB.\n\nThe carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements as at 31 December 2023 was €9,424.2 million (2022: €6,805.2 million) and is shown in the items \"Restricted bank balances\" and \"Financial assets measured at amortised cost\". The fair value of securities received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements was €9,614.5 million (2022: €7,144.9 million).\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/212/Picture/22 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Lending takes place on a secured basis and the individual borrowing participants must provide full collateral for their credit limits in line with the EU regulation. These credit limits can be revoked at the discretion of the Clearstream sub-group. As at 31 December 2023 they came to a total of €175.3 billion. €7.1 billion of the total is unsecured and only relates to credit lines granted in special exceptional cases to selected central banks and multilateral development banks, partly on the basis of the borrower's credit rating and partly on a zero-risk weighting according to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) and after approval by the Executive Board of the Clearstream sub-group.\n\nActual outstandings at the end of each business day generally represent a small fraction of the facilities and amounted to €392.7 million as at 31\n\nDecember 2023 (2022: €131.6 million). The portfolio of deposited collateral is not directly attributed to any utilisation, but is determined by the scope of the entire business relationship and the limits granted.\n\nIn addition, Clearstream guarantees the risks arising from the Automated Securities Fails Financing programme that it offers its clients, in which Clearstream Banking S.A. acts as an intermediary between the lender and the borrower. This risk is covered by pledged collateral on the borrower's account. As at 31 December 2023 the outstanding guarantees under this programme amounted to €521.7 million (2022: €1,385.2 million). The securities pledged in connection with these loans amounted to €550.7 million (2022: €1,731.5 million).\n\n### Trade receivables\n\nThe maximum credit risk for the item trade receivables is €1,840.5 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €2,295.7 million). Trading, settlement and custody fees are generally collected without delay by direct debit. Fees for other services, such as the provision of data and information, are settled mainly by transfer. Trade receivables are analysed using an expected credit loss model based on the simplified approach as outlined in IFRS 9. To measure the expected credit loss, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on the days past due. The trade receivables share the main risk characteristics. The expected loss amount has been determined by applying the lifetime expected loss approach. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles over a period of five years and the loss profile experienced over that period.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0) \n\ncomprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0)\n\n[Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\nfinancial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Loss allowances for trade receivables as at 31 December 2023\n\n| in €m              | Not more than 30 days past due | Not more than 60 days past due | Not more than 90 days past due | Not more than 120 days past due | Not more than 360 days past due | More than 360 days past due | Insolvent | Total |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-------|\n| Expected loss rate | 0%                             | 0%                             | 0.4%                           | 0.4%                            | 2.3%                            | 99.8%                       | 100%      |       |\n| Trade receivables  | 97.2                           | 22.6                           | 7.9                            | 4.7                             | 13.7                            | 5.3                         | 2.7       | 154.0 |\n| Loss allowance     | 0                              | 0                              | 0                              | 0                               | 0.3                             | 5.3                         | 2.7       | 8.3   |\n\n### Loss allowances for trade receivables as at 31 December 2022\n\n| in €m              | Not<br>more than<br>30 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>60 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>90 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>120 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>360 days past<br>due | More than 360<br>days past due | Insolvent | Total |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-------|\n| Expected loss rate | 0.0%                                    | 0.0%                                    | 0.2%                                    | 0.9%                                     | 2.1%                                     | 98.5%                          | 100%      |       |\n| Trade receivables  | 92.7                                    | 14.8                                    | 8.9                                     | 2.8                                      | 12.5                                     | 3.8                            | 2.4       | 137.9 |\n| Loss allowance     | 0                                       | 0                                       | 0                                       | 0                                        | 0.3                                      | 3.6                            | 2.4       | 6.3   |\n\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The following criteria are used for the assessment of derecognition:\n\n- Insolvency proceedings are not started for want of assets.\n- Insolvency proceedings have not resulted in any payment for a period of three years, and there is no indication that any amount will be received going forward.\n\nIn the reporting year, as in the previous year there were no significant writeoffs due to customer defaults (2022: nil).\n\n# Contract assets\n\nThe maximum credit risk for the item contract assets was €375.5 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: nil). Impairments of €3.0 million were recognised on contract assets as at 31 December 2023. No contract assets were recognised as at 31 December 2022. Contract assets relate to rights to consideration from customers for software licences under subscription agreements with future payments, if this right depends on future performance by us. Contract assets from contracts with customers are measured at amortised cost less expected credit losses. Contract assets come within the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment testing rules.

This amount represents the risk-based view of Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG, while the carrying amount of the \"financial instruments held by central counterparties\" item in the balance sheet shows the gross amount of the open trades according to IAS 32. To safeguard the Group's central counterparties against the risk of default by a clearing member, the clearing conditions require the clearing members to deposit margins in the form of cash or securities on a daily basis or an intraday basis in the amount stipulated by the respective clearing house. The amount of collateral deposited for the financial instruments of the central counterparties was €122,728.0 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €182,104.6 million). This amount represents the collateral value of cash and securities collateral deposited for margins, covering the net value of all margin and default fund requirements\n\nAdditional security mechanisms of the Group's central counterparties are described in detail in the section [\"Risk report\".](#page-63-0) \n\n#### Credit risk concentrations\n\nOur business model and the resulting business relationships mean that credit risk is concentrated in the financial services sector. Credit limits for counterparties prevent any excessive concentration of credit risks on individual counterparties. Concentrations of collateral are also monitored.\n\nManagement of credit risk concentration, including collateral concentration, and so-called large exposures, is conducted in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements such as those arising from, among others, articles 387– 410 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR), article 47 paragraph 8 of Regulation (EU) 648/2012 (European Market Infrastructure Regulation, EMIR) and respectively applicable national requirements (see also the disclosures on capital management under the heading [\"Regula](#page-76-0)tory [capital requirements](#page-76-0) and regulatory capital ratios\" in the Risk [manage](#page-63-0)[ment section o](#page-63-0)f the combined [management report\\).](#page-16-0) Requirements of concentration risks arising from Regulation (EU) 909/2014 (Central Securities Depository Regulation, CSDR) have been implemented as part of Deutsche Börse Group's affiliated CSD recognised in under article 16 CSDR.\n\nThe required economic capital (based on the so-called \"Value at Risk\" (VaR) with a confidence level of 99.9 per cent) for credit risk is calculated monthly for each day and amounted to €457.0 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €430.0 million).\n\nWe also apply additional methods in order to detect credit concentration risks. We analyse the impact of a default by our two largest counterparties with unsecured commitments and stressed recovery parameters. In addition, analyses are carried out for the Group's top 5 and top 10 counterparties, based on the risk-weighted commitments of the individual counterparties. All the concentration metrics have dedicated early warning thresholds and limits and are part of the quarterly risk reporting to the Executive Board. As in the previous year, no material adverse credit concentrations were detected in 2023.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Market risk\n\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, foreign-exchange rates and other market prices. Deutsche Börse Group is generally only affected to a limited extent by market risk.\n\nThe economic capital required for market price risks (based on the Value at Risk (VaR) with a confidence level of 99.9 per cent) is calculated at the end of each month. As of 31 December 2023 the economic capital for market price risks was €143.0 million (2022: €114.0 million).\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, no impairment losses (2022: €1.0 million) were recognised in profit or loss for entities accounted for using the equity method that are not included in the VaR for market risk.\n\n### Interest rate risk\n\nChanges in market interest rates may affect Deutsche Börse Group's net income for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive assets include the Group's money market and investment portfolios, while interest rate sensitive liabilities mainly consist of shortterm debt instruments. Interest rate risk from long-term liabilities of Deutsche Börse AG is mitigated through issuance of fixed-coupon bonds.\n\nIn line with our risk strategy, we may use financial instruments to hedge existing or highly probable interest rate exposures. For this purpose, interest rate swaps, as well as swaptions, might be used. Our treasury policy requires the critical parameters of the hedging instruments to match the hedged items.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group issued three fixed rate bonds with a total nominal value of €3 billion in 2023 in connection with the takeover of SimCorp. To hedge the long-term financing against unexpected interest rate increases, three forward starting deal contingent interest rate swaps with a nominal value of €2 billion were taken out in May 2023. These swaps were dissolved when the fixed interest bonds were issued in September 2023. Cash flow hedge accounting was applied to this hedging. Details of Deutsche Börse Group's outstanding bonds can be found in the [\"Financial](#page-35-0) position\" section of the combined [management report.](#page-16-0) \n\nCash received as deposits from market participants is invested mainly via short-term reverse repos and in the form of overnight deposits at central banks, limiting the risk of a negative impact due to a changed interest rate environment. Negative interest rates resulting from reinvestments of these cash deposits are passed on to the respective Clearstream customers after applying an additional margin. For Eurex Clearing AG, interest rates on cash collateral are in principle calculated based on a predefined market benchmark rate per currency after deducting an additional spread per currency. In exceptional cases such as market disruption, Eurex Clearing AG reserves the right to calculate interest rates on cash collateral based on the recognised interest rate.\n\nGroup entities may furthermore invest their own capital and part of customer cash balances in high-quality liquid bonds.\n\nThe risk from interest-bearing assets and liabilities is monitored every business day and systematically limited. The system consists of a combined limit metric (CLM) that covers both liquidity and interest rate risk. The interest rate risk limits determine the acceptable maximum loss caused by a hypothetical adverse yield curve shift.\n\nIn this way, the cash flow risk arising from potential interest rate changes was hedged. Cash flow hedge accounting was applied to this hedging.\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Foreign-exchange rate risk\n\nMeasuring and managing foreign-exchange risk is important for reducing our exposure to exchange rate movements. The three main types of foreign-exchange risk that we are exposed to are cash flow-, translation- and transaction-related foreign-exchange risk. Cash flow risk reflects the risk of fluctuations in the present value of future operating cash flows from foreign-exchange movements. Translation risk comprises effects from the valuation to our assets and liabilities in foreign currencies. Finally, transaction risk is closely related to cash flow risk; it may arise through changes in the structure of asset and liabilities in foreign currencies.\n\nWe operate internationally and are, to a limited extent, exposed to foreign-exchange risk, primarily in US\\$, Fr., £ and Kč. Exchange rate fluctuations may affect our profit margins and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the relevant Group entity. The respective currency risks arise mainly from operating income and expenses denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, partly from that portion of the Clearstream segment's sales revenue and net interest income from treasury activities in banking and similar business that is directly or indirectly in US\\$.\n\nCurrency mismatches are avoided to the maximum extent possible. All types of foreign exchange risk are measured regularly and monitored at Group level. Limits are set for the cash flow and currency translation risks that affect our gains and losses. Deutsche Börse Group's treasury policy defines risk limits which take into account historic foreign-exchange rate fluctuations. Any exposure exceeding those limits must be hedged. Foreign-exchange exposures below the defined limits may also be hedged. Management of foreign-exchange risks is in principle based on the Group level. Hedging may take place on a single entity level if foreign-exchange risk threatens the viability of the single entity.\n\nTo eliminate foreign-exchange risks we use financial instruments to hedge existing or highly probable forecast transactions. The Group may use foreign-exchange forwards, foreign-exchange options as well as cross-currency swaps to hedge the exposure to foreign-exchange risk. Under the Group's policy, the critical terms of forwards and options must align with the hedged items.\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. entered into foreign-exchange forwards in 2023 to hedge part of the risk from the result of treasury activities in banking and similar business in US\\$. In addition, the Group uses foreign exchange derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risks in connection with internal cash pooling and loans.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Other market risks\n\nMarket risk also arises from investments in bonds, investments in funds and futures within the framework of contractual trust arrangements (CTAs) and from the Clearstream Pension Fund in Luxembourg. For the CTAs, the investment is protected by a predefined floor, which reduces the risk of extreme losses for Deutsche Börse Group. In addition, there are equity price risks arising from strategic equity investments.\n\n# Liquidity risk\n\nFor us, liquidity risk may arise from potential difficulties in renewing maturing financing, such as commercial paper, issued bonds as well as bilateral and syndicated credit facilities. Financing arrangements required for unexpected events may also result in a liquidity risk. Most of our cash investments are short-term to ensure that liquidity is available, should such a financing need arise. Both Eurex Clearing AG and Clearstream can invest stable customer credit balances in secured money market products (for up to one year for Eurex Clearing and six months for Clearstream) or in investment grade securities with a remaining term to maturity of less than five years for Eurex Clearing and Clearstream, subject to strict monitoring of mismatching and interest rate limits. Term investments can be transacted via reverse repurchase agreements against highly liquid collateral. For refinancing purposes, Eurex Clearing AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. can pledge eligible securities with their respective central banks. In terms of the maturities of the cash spreads received from customers and its corresponding investments, Eurex Clearing is almost perfectly matched.\n\nThe companies of Deutsche Börse Group have the following credit lines at their disposal, which were not recognised as of the balance sheet date.\n\n#### Contractually agreed credit lines\n\n| Company                        | Purpose of credit line | Currency | Amount at 31 Dec 2023 m | Amount at 31 Dec 2022 m |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Deutsche Börse AG              | Working capital1)      | €        | 600.0                   | 600.0                   |\n| Eurex Clearing AG              | Settlement             | €        | 900.0                   | 900.0                   |\n|                                | Settlement             | Fr.      | 200.0                   | 200.0                   |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | US\\$     | 300.0                   | 300.0                   |\n| Clearstream Banking S.A.       | Working capital1)      | €        | 750.0                   | 750.0                   |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | €        | 4,375.0                 | 4,225.0                 |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | US\\$     | 2,950.0                 | 3,200.0                 |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | £        | 0                       | 350.0                   |\n| Clearstream Banking AG         | Settlement             | €        | 200.0                   | 200.0                   |\n| European Energy Exchange AG    | Working capital        | €        | 22.0                    | 22.0                    |\n| European Commodity Clearing AG | Settlement             | €        | 140.0                   | 140.0                   |\n| Axioma Inc.                    | Working capital        | US\\$     | 1.9                     | 1.7                     |\n| SimCorp A/S                    | Settlement             | DKK      | 266.3                   | 0.0                     |\n\n1) €500.0 million of Deutsche Börse AG's working capital credit lines is a sub-credit line of Clearstream Banking S.A.'s €750.0 million working capital credit line.\n\n2) Including committed foreign exchange swap lines and committed repo lines.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. has a bank guarantee (letter of credit) in favour of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. issued by an international consortium to secure daily deliveries of securities between Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking S.A.

Such litigation may result in payments by entities in the Group. If it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will occur, a provision will be recognised based on an estimate of the most probable amount necessary to settle the obligation if such amount is reasonably estimable. The management of the entity affected must assess whether the possible obligation results from a past event, as well as evaluate the probability of a cash outflow and estimate its amount.\n\nWe recognise provisions for possible losses only if there is a present obligation arising from a past event that is likely to result in an outflow of resources and if the Group can reliably estimate the amount of the obligation (see als[o note](#page-206-0)  [19\\). Co](#page-206-0)ntingent liabilities may result from present obligations and from possible obligations arising from events in the past. In order to identify the litigation for which the possibility of a loss is more than unlikely, as well as how the possible loss is estimated, Deutsche Börse Group considers a large number of factors, including the nature of the claim and the facts on which it is based, the jurisdiction and course of the individual proceedings, the experience of the Group, prior settlement talks (to the extent that they have already taken place) as well as expert opinions and evaluations of legal advisers.\n\nLosses also may arise from legal risks which are not highly probable, so that no provisions have been recognised. If the event is not completely improbable, the legal risks may have to be recognised as contingent liabilities. As neither the timing of these contingent liabilities nor the amount of any payment can be estimated reliably, any quantitative disclosure would not be a useful guide to possible future losses. For this reason, no figure is shown for contingent liabilities.\n\nThe main legal disputes that have been classified as contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2023 and for which consequently no provisions have been recognised as at 31 December 2023 are described below.\n\n# Litigation involving Clearstream Banking S.A. in connection with the Central Bank of Iran\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. is involved in different legal proceedings in Luxembourg and the U.S. in connection with the Iranian central bank, Bank Markazi. On the one hand of this, different plaintiffs groups – each of which have obtained U.S. judgements against Iran and/or Bank Markazi – are seeking turnover of assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. is holding as custodian in Luxembourg and that are attributed to Bank Markazi. Several of these plaintiffs groups also raise direct claims for damages against Clearstream Banking S.A. On the other hand, Bank Markazi is suing, among others, Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg in connection with assets that currently or in the past were held by Clearstream Banking S.A. as custodian.\n\nOn the basis of a binding and enforceable U.S. judgement in 2013, assets in an amount of approx. USD 1.9 billion were already turned over to a plaintiffs group in a U.S. proceeding (\"Peterson I\") to which Bank Markazi also was a party. Currently, the following proceedings that were initiated by the mentioned plaintiffs groups and that primarily target assets attributed to Bank Markazi are ongoing:\n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- \"Peterson II\" plaintiffs group: On 30 December 2013, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties seeking turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg and that are attributed to Bank Markazi. The proceedings since then had advanced to the U.S. Supreme Court but were then remanded to the district court. On 22 March 2023, the district court awarded judgement to the plaintiffs for turnover of approximately USD 1.7 billion that are attributed to Bank Markazi and held in custody at Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg in a client account. Clearstream Banking S.A. appealed against the decision.\n- \"Havlish\" plaintiffs group: On 14 October 2016, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties. Besides the request for turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg, the complaint also asserted direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 6.6 billion (plus punitive damages and interest). On 12 October 2020, an amended complaint was filed in this case, which added further plaintiffs and which in turn asserted additional damages of approx. USD 3.3 billion (plus punitive damages and interest) against Clearstream Banking S.A. and the other defendants.\n- \"Levin\" plaintiffs group: On 26 December 2018, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties. Besides the request for turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg, the complaint also asserted direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 29 million (plus punitive damages and interest). The plaintiffs withdrew their complaint effective as of 24 April 2023.\n- \"Heiser\" plaintiffs group: On 4 December 2019, plaintiffs from a previous case filed a new complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. targeting turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg.\n- \"Ofisi\" plaintiffs group: On 26 August 2020, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties. Besides the request for turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg, the complaint also asserts direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 8.7 billion (plus punitive damages and interest).\n- On 24 November 2020, plaintiffs from the abovementioned Havlish case also sued Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties in Luxembourg. The complaint, among others, asserts direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 5.5 billion (plus interest).\n- \"Acosta/Beer/Greenbaum/Kirschenbaum\" plaintiffs group: On 28 February 2022, plaintiffs filed new complaints in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. targeting turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg.\n\nIn connection with assets concerning Bank Markazi, Bank Markazi on 17 January 2018 filed a complaint in Luxembourg court naming Clearstream Banking S.A. and Banca UBAE S.p.A. as defendants. The complaint primarily seeks the restitution of assets totalling approximately USD 4.9 billion (plus interest), which the complaint alleges are held on accounts of Banca UBAE S.p.A. and Bank Markazi with Clearstream Banking S.A. Alternatively, Bank Markazi seeks damages in the same amount.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nIn another proceeding, on 30 April 2021, a Luxembourg first instance court at the request of Bank Markazi issued a declaratory judgement against Clearstream Banking S.A. in connection with, amongst others, the abovementioned Peterson II proceedings pending in the U.S. The first instance decision of 30 April 2021 subjects the transfer of assets attributed to Bank Markazi based on a U.S. decision to the requirement of prior judicial recognition in Luxembourg, violation of which is punishable by a fine of €10 million per violation. Clearstream Banking S.A. has filed an appeal against the decision.\n\nOn 15 June 2018, Banca UBAE S.p.A. filed a complaint against Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg court. This complaint is a recourse action related to the abovementioned complaint filed by Bank Markazi against Clearstream Banking S.A. and Banca UBAE S.p.A. and asks that Banca UBAE S.p.A. be indemnified and held harmless by Clearstream Banking S.A. in the event that Banca UBAE S.p.A. loses the legal dispute brought by Bank Markazi and is ordered by the court to pay damages to Bank Markazi.\n\nIndependent of whether Clearstream Banking S.A. should be required to turn over assets attributed to Bank Markazi in the U.S., the Executive Board of Clearstream Banking S.A. does not think that claims for damages raised against Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg or in the U.S. will be successful. Based on this, as of 31 December 2023 and unchanged from the previous year, no provisions were made in connection with the aforementioned matters.\n\nFurther litigations and proceedings\n\n### Litigations\n\nStarting on 16 July 2010, the insolvency administrators of Fairfield Sentry Ltd. And Fairfield Sigma Ltd., two funds domiciled on the British Virgin Islands, filed complaints in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, asserting claims against more than 300 financial institutions for restitution of amounts paid to investors in the funds for redemption of units prior to December 2008. On 14 January 2011, the funds insolvency administrators filed litigation against Clearstream Banking S.A. for the restitution of US\\$13.5 million in payments made for redemption of fund units, which the funds made to investors via the settlement system of Clearstream Banking S.A. The proceedings, which were suspended for several years, are ongoing.\n\nA buyer of an MBB Clean Energy AG (MBB) bond, which is held in custody by Clearstream Banking AG and was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, filed a lawsuit at a Dutch court concerning claims for damages in the amount of €33 million against Clearstream Banking AG, Deutsche Börse AG and other parties. The lawsuit was dismissed at first instance in October 2020; the plaintiff filed an appeal against the judgement.\n\nOn 23 July 2021, Clearstream Banking AG was served with a lawsuit that Air Berlin PLC i.L. had announced by way of an ad hoc announcement on 25 June 2021. The insolvency administrator in connection with the assets of Air Berlin PLC i.L. claims the payment of approximately €497.8 million from Clearstream Banking AG as personally liable partner of Air Berlin PLC i.L. due to Brexit, and seeks declaratory relief that Clearstream Banking AG is liable for all debts which have not already been approved to the insolvency table in the course of the insolvency proceedings concerning the assets of Air Berlin PLC.\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/225/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

A number of lawsuits have been brought against Clearstream Banking S.A. in Russian courts targeting turnover or restitution of frozen assets. The total value claimed from Clearstream Banking S.A. in these proceedings amounts to approximately €74 million. It cannot be ruled out that further lawsuits concerning frozen assets may be filed, which could also include recourses against assets held by Clearstream Banking S.A. in Russia or elsewhere.\n\nThe Executive board is not currently aware of any significant change in the Group's risk situation.\n\n### Proceedings\n\nOn 2 April 2014, Clearstream Banking S.A. was informed that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has opened a grand jury investigation against Clearstream Banking S.A. due to Clearstream Banking S.A.'s conduct with respect to Iran and other countries subject to U.S. sanction laws. Clearstream Banking S.A. is cooperating with the U.S. attorney.\n\nIn September 2017, Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. were made aware that the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne had initiated proceedings for tax evasion against an employee of Clearstream Banking AG for his alleged involvement in the settlement of transactions of market participants over the dividend date (cum/ex transactions). On 22 January 2018, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne addressed to Clearstream Banking AG a notification of hearing Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A.\n\nas potential secondary participants. Starting on 27 August 2019, together with other supporting authorities, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne conducted searches of the offices of Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., as well as other Deutsche Börse Group companies and sites. In the course of these measures, Deutsche Börse Group entities were made aware that the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne has extended the group of suspects to include current and former employees as well as executive board members of Deutsche Börse Group companies. In 2020 and again in 2022, Deutsche Börse Group became aware of further extensions of the group of suspects. Due to the still early stage of the proceedings, it is still not possible to predict timing, scope or consequences of a potential decision. The companies concerned are cooperating with the competent authorities. They do not expect that they could be successfully held liable.\n\n#### Tax risks\n\nDue to its business activities in various countries, Deutsche Börse Group is exposed to tax risks. A process has been developed to recognise and evaluate these risks, which are initially recognised based on their probability of occurrence. These risks are then measured on the basis of their expected value. A tax liability is recognised in the event that it is more probable than not that the risks will occur. We continuously review whether the conditions for recognising corresponding tax liabilities are met.\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nFollowing the completion of the tax inspections for the years 2006 to 2008 we see the Group exposed to risks resulting from (i) corrections to input VAT deductions in accordance with the letters from the Federal Ministry of Finance of 3 May 2021 and 23 June 2022 (concerning the VAT treatment of services by exchange operators), (ii) the disallowance of tax-free income and intra-Group funding and (iii) the disallowance of provisions for stock option programmes. Full provision has been made in the balance sheet for any tax and interest back-payments that may result and the corresponding appeals have been lodged. We assume that the tax authorities will at least query the points (i) and (ii) mentioned above for the years from 2009 onwards for which the tax assessments are not yet definitive.\n\n# 26 Corporate governance\n\n.\n\nOn 7 December 2023 the Executive and Supervisory Boards issued the latest version of the declaration of compliance in accordance with section 161 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act) and made it permanently available to shareholders on the company's website.\n\n# 27 Related party disclosures\n\nRelated parties as defined by IAS 24 are members of the executive bodies of Deutsche Börse AG and their close family members, as well as the companies classified as associates of Deutsche Börse AG, investors and investees and companies that are controlled or significantly influenced by members of the executive bodies.\n\n# Business relationships with related parties\n\nThe following table shows transactions entered into within the scope of business relationships with non-consolidated companies of Deutsche Börse AG during the 2023 financial year.

[paragraph] 1 HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023,\n- the accompanying group management report (excluding the non-financial statement) as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development; we do not express an audit opinion on the statement on corporate governance referred to above and\n- the non-financial statement included in section \"Nichtfinanzielle Erklärung\" of the group management report is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/239/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial statement included in the group management report.\n\n# Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- ➊ Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets\n- ➋ Accounting for the acquisition of SimCorp A/S\n- ➌ Assessment of certain legal risks\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- ➀ Matter and issue\n- ➁ Audit approach and findings\n- ➂ Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n- ➊ Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets\n- ➀ Goodwill and other intangible assets with definite and indefinite useful lives totalling € 11,248.6 million (116.4 % of Group equity) are reported under the balance sheet item \"Intangible assets\" in the company's consolidated financial statements. The other intangible assets relate in particular to stock exchange licences, brand names and customer relationships. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment once a year or on an ad hoc basis, while other intangible assets with a definite useful life are tested for impairment on an ad hoc basis by the company in order to identify any need for impairment. As part of the impairment test, the carrying amount of the respective (groups of) cash-generating units (including their\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\ncarrying amount for the goodwill test) is compared with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of the fair value less costs to sell. The measurement is generally based on the present value of future cash flows of the respective cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units. The present values are determined using discounted cash flow models. The Group's approved medium-term planning forms the starting point, which is extrapolated using assumptions about long-term growth rates. Expectations about future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors are also taken into account. Discounting is carried out using the weighted average cost of capital of the respective (groups of) cash-generating units.\n\nAs a result of the impairment test, an impairment requirement totalling € 24.6 million was identified.\n\nThe result of this valuation is highly dependent on the estimates of the executive directors with regard to the future cash flows of the respective (groups of) cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the growth rate and other assumptions and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complexity of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n➁ As part of our audit, we first analysed the methodology used to perform the impairment test. In a risk-oriented selection, with the involvement of our valuation specialists, we compared the future cash flows used in the calculation with the Group's approved medium-term planning and additional planning documents for the respective (groups of) cashgenerating units in order to assess the appropriateness of these plans, in particular by analysing the key planning assumptions, comparing the plans with analyst estimates and, in certain cases, performing plan-actual and plan-plan analyses. In addition, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions - where taken into account in the models - and the appropriateness of the growth assumptions after the forecast period and the assumed weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we assessed the company's valuation by comparing the implied multiples with market multiples. In order to take account of the existing forecast uncertainties, we reviewed the sensitivity analyses prepared by the company. Where there was a need for impairment as at the balance sheet date, we verified the appropriate recognition of the impairment losses.\n\nThe valuation methods, parameters and assumptions applied by the legal representatives are in line with our expectations and are also within what we consider to be reasonable ranges.\n\n➂ The company's disclosures on the impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets are contained in section \"10 Intangible assets\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# ➋ Accounting for the acquisition of SimCorp A/S\n\n➀ Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft acquired the majority of shares in the software service provider SimCorp A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark, (\"SimCorp\") by way of a public takeover bid with effect from 29 September 2023. Following further share purchases and the implementation of a squeeze-out under stock corporation law, the company held 100% of the shares in SimCorp as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe acquisition was recognised as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 using the acquisition method. As part of the purchase price allocation, the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired company were recognised at fair value. The purchase price allocation had not yet been finalised as at the reporting date, as it was not yet possible to conclusively determine the tax items and intangible assets in particular. The comparison of the consideration transferred with the acquired assets and liabilities resulted in provisional goodwill of € 2,335.6 million.\n\nDue to the estimation uncertainties in the measurement of the assets and liabilities as well as the identified intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation and the overall material impact of the business combination on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n➁ As part of our audit of the acquisition of SimCorp, we first inspected and analysed the contractual agreements and reconciled the purchase price determined as consideration for the acquired business operations with the evidence provided to us. Based on this, we assessed the company's approach to measuring the identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair values at the acquisition date. Among other things, we analysed the\n\nmodels underlying the valuations as well as the valuation parameters and assumptions applied with the assistance of valuation specialists.\n\nFurthermore, we analysed the adjustment of the groups of cashgenerating units at whose level goodwill is monitored, which was carried out as part of the SimCorp acquisition. In addition, we assessed the disclosures required by IFRS 3.\n\nOverall, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the accounting treatment of the business combination was appropriate, that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors were reasonable and adequately substantiated and that the relevant disclosures in the notes were made in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\n➂ The company's disclosures on the acquisition are contained in section \"02 Consolidation principles\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# ➌ Assessment of certain legal risks\n\n➀ Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliated companies are exposed to certain legal risks. These certain legal risks include legal disputes of Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg, in connection with the Central Bank of Iran, in which Clearstream Banking S.A. is exposed to claims for restitution and damages against the Central Bank of Iran in the amount of USD 4.9 billion (plus interest) and claims by other groups of plaintiffs, a claim by the insolvency administrator of Air Berlin PLC i.L. against Clearstream Banking AG for payment of around €498 million and an investigation relating to securities transactions by market participants over the dividend record date (cum-ex transactions). The assessment of whether and, if so, to what extent a provision is required to cover the risk is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty.

No provisions were recognised for the abovementioned legal risks in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023, as the executive directors do not consider an outflow of funds to be probable.\n\nIn our view, the above-mentioned legal risks are of particular significance for our audit due to their legal complexity, the considerable uncertainties regarding their further development and their potential impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations.\n\n➁ As part of our audit, we inspected the underlying documents relating to the above-mentioned legal disputes and proceedings and analysed the legal assessments of Deutsche Börse Group. With the knowledge that there is an increased risk of misstatements in the financial reporting in the event of uncertainties and that the decisions of the executive directors have a direct impact on the Group's results, we evaluated the executive directors' judgements with the assistance of specialists. In addition, we held regular discussions with the legal departments of the companies in order to understand current developments and the reasons that led to the corresponding assessments of the outcome of the proceedings. The development of the specific legal risks, including the assessments of the legal representatives with regard to the possible outcomes of the proceedings, was made available to us in writing by the legal departments. In addition, we obtained external lawyers' confirmations as at the balance sheet date and analysed legal opinions from external lawyers.\n\nThe estimates made by the legal representatives regarding the aforementioned matters and their presentation in the consolidated financial statements are adequately substantiated and documented.\n\n➂ The company's disclosures on the material legal risks are presented in the section \"25 Financial commitments and other risks\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB as an unaudited part of the group management report.\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\n- the remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act], for which the supervisory board is also responsible\n- all remaining parts of the annual report excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial statement included in the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/243/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe executive directors are also responsible for the preparation of the non-financial statement included in the group management report in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent reporting in the non-financial statement) or error.\n\nThe applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which authoritative comprehensive interpretations have not yet been published. Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretations of such wording and terms in section \"About this report\" of the non-financial statement. The executive directors are responsible for the defensibility of these interpretations. As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is uncertain.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/244/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

Misstatements can arise\n\nfrom fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report and of the non-financial statement included in the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n- Evaluate the suitability of the criteria presented by the executive directors in the non-financial statement as a whole. As explained in the description of the responsibilities of the executive directors, the executive directors have interpreted the wording and terms contained in the relevant regulations; the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to inherent uncertainties mentioned in this description. Those inherent uncertainties in the interpretation apply to our audit accordingly.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/246/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

[number] 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n# Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance work on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.\n- Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/248/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The report was prepared by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with the requirements of section 162 Aktiengesetz (Stock Corporation Act, AktG) and follows the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) as amended on 28 April 2022. It also takes into account the current version of the guidelines of the working group for sustainable management board remuneration systems, which is made up of the supervisory board chairs of listed companies in Germany, as well as representatives of institutional investors, academics and corporate governance experts.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\nAbove and beyond the requirements of section 162 (3) AktG, the remuneration report was reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft both in a formal as well as a material audit. The remuneration report and the attached memorandum on the review of the remuneration report can be found on the Deutsche Börse AG website at [https://www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/remuneration-overview) > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Remuneration.\n\n# Review of the 2023 financial year\n\nThis review of the 2023 financial year explains the context in which the remuneration decisions were taken and enables their comprehensive perception.\n\n# Approval of the remuneration report 2022 by the Annual General Meeting 2023\n\nThe remuneration report for the 2022 financial year was presented to the Annual General Meeting in 2023 for approval. The Annual General Meeting approved the remuneration report for 2022 by a majority of 91.69 per cent. This was the second report on the implementation of the remuneration system that was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2021 (2021 remuneration system) with a majority of 94.97 per cent.\n\nThereafter, the Supervisory Board discussed the feedback from shareholders and proxy advisers provided as part of the consultation on the remuneration report. In view of the continued high approval rate and the positive feedback from shareholders and proxy advisers, the Supervisory Board does not currently see any reason to make fundamental changes to the remuneration report.\n\n{251}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/251/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The last adjustment was made seven years earlier in 2016. Over this period, the size of Deutsche Börse Group and the complexity of its business model, as well as of regulatory requirements, increased significantly, which means that the scope and volume of the Executive Board members' responsibilities have also continued to increase. Deutsche Börse Group's strong growth is reflected in its financial performance indicators and in the number of divisions, business models, employees and regions in which it operates worldwide.\n\nIn line with the objectives of the corporate strategy \"Compass 2023\", Deutsche Börse Group has achieved significant organic and inorganic growth. Two of the most important takeovers in the Group's history took place in this period: the takeover of ISS and the acquisition of SimCorp A/S that was completed in the 2023 financial year. This growth implies greater responsibilities for the Executive Board members, in a global market environment that is difficult overall and is also governed by an increasingly complex legal and regulatory framework.\n\nUnder these circumstances and in view of the extremely positive performance by Deutsche Börse Group, the Supervisory Board has increased the target direct remuneration (base salary, target amount of Performance Bonus and target amount of Performance Shares) for the Executive Board members by 10 per cent p.a., i.e. by 5 per cent for the 2023 financial year. No changes were made to the company pensions of the Executive Board members in this context.\n\n| Adjustment | of target direct | remuneration

Further information on the review of appropriateness can be found in the section \"Appropriateness [of Executive Board remuneration\".](#page-255-0)\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\n# Performance and target achievement in 2023\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board believes it is vitally important to have a clear link between Executive Board members' remuneration and their performance (\"pay for performance\"). A large proportion of Executive Board remuneration therefore consists of performance-based remuneration components. For this reason, and because strategically relevant indicators are used as performance criteria, the amount of Executive Board remuneration is closely linked to the performance of Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group was able to exceed its original forecast significantly in the 2023 financial year. Both net revenue and EBITDA increased by 17 per cent in 2023. Earnings per share went up by 15 per cent.\n\nThe performance of Deutsche Börse Group was influenced by both secular and cyclical growth factors. Structural growth was achieved largely by means of new customer wins and increased market share, expanding customer relationships and innovative products. Cyclical growth effects stemmed particularly from the global increase in interest rates. In combination with an only moderate decrease in cash deposits by customers in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments, this led to strong growth in net interest income at\n\nClearstream. Higher interest rates and a general reduction in the money supply also had a positive impact on the use of interest rate derivatives and repo products from Eurex and Eurex Repo in the Trading & Clearing segment. In this context, the rise in the outstanding notional volume of centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) traded and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives had a positive impact on net revenue. Significantly higher trading volumes for electricity derivatives on the EEX also led to an increase in net revenue in the Trading & Clearing segment. This was due to lower margin requirements as volatility on electricity and gas markets was lower, and additional market share. The newly created Investment Management Solutions segment profited from both sustained demand for ISS products in Governance Solutions, Corporate Solutions and ESG, and from contract renewals with customers in the Analytics business. The acquisition of SimCorp A/S also made a key contribution to M&A growth in this segment from the fourth quarter.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group substantially strengthened its strategic position in key growth markets overall, and again improved its line-up for further organic growth and future competitiveness. This applies particularly to the ongoing strategic development of the pre-trading business, with the creation of the new Investment Management Solutions segment.\n\nThe successful implementation of the corporate strategy, Compass 2023, again significantly improved a number of key financial indicators, which are also used as performance criteria for the performance-based components of Executive Board remuneration, and meant that the strategic objectives were achieved ahead of schedule.\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/253/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

Targets were exceeded for both the performance criterion \"Adjusted Net Income Growth\" and the performance criterion \"Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance\". The target achievement for relative TSR not only reflects the strong absolute performance of the Deutsche Börse share on the capital market, but also its above-average relative performance compared with the relevant peer group.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/254/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Choosing suitable performance criteria for performance-based remuneration sets incentives to manage the company sustainably and successfully over the long term and to drive the realisation of its strategic objectives. In order to support a strong equity culture and further align the interests of the Executive Board and shareholders, most of the performance-based remuneration components are share-based.\n\nExecutive Board remuneration is based on the principle that Executive Board members should receive appropriate remuneration in line with their performance, functions and responsibilities. By setting ambitious performance criteria, the Supervisory Board follows a strict pay-for-performance approach. The long-term structure of the remuneration system, as expressed in the largely multi-year assessment basis for the performance-based remuneration components, also avoids creating incentives for taking unreasonable risks.\n\nThe following overview shows the main guidelines applied by the Supervisory Board for the Executive Board remuneration:\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-255-0\"></span>Image /page/255/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board is presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval. The Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system regularly with the support of its Nomination Committee. After any significant changes, but not less than every four years, the Supervisory Board again presents the remuneration system to the Annual General Meeting for approval.\n\n# Appropriateness of Executive Board remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of Executive Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board on the basis of the remuneration system, whereby the Nomination Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's decision. The Supervisory Board ensures that remuneration is appropriate to the corresponding Executive Board member's tasks and performance, as well as to the company's financial situation, and that it does not exceed common market pay levels without special justification. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board conducts a regular horizontal and vertical peer group comparison, generally every other year.\n\nTo do so, the Supervisory Board may engage external experts who are independent of the Executive Board and the company. The horizontal comparison is based on relevant national and international peer groups. The Supervisory Board selects the peer groups based on the criteria country, size and industry sector as stipulated in AktG. Based on the country criterion and given their comparable size, DAX-listed companies are considered as a suitable peer group for the purpose of the horizontal comparison. In order to reflect the industry-sector criterion, European financial institutions were used as customers and competitors of Deutsche Börse Group, as well as international stock exchange operators as additional peer groups.\n\nIn order to assess whether the remuneration is in line with usual levels within the company (vertical comparison), the Supervisory Board – in accordance with the recommendations of the GCGC – also takes into account the ratio of Executive Board remuneration to the remuneration of senior managers and the workforce as a whole, and how the various salary grades have developed over time. In this context, senior managers mean the two management levels below the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board considers the remuneration ratio with regard to the employees of Deutsche Börse AG and the employees of Deutsche Börse Group overall.\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/256/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The Supervisory Board was supported by an independent external advisor and the Executive Board remuneration was found to be appropriate.\n\n# Target remuneration\n\nFurther information\n\nIn their service contract, each Executive Board member is promised a target remuneration in line with common market levels, which depends largely on their relevant knowledge and experience for the role. It is also based on the target remuneration for the other Executive Board members. As described in the chapter \"Review of the 2023 [financial year\",](#page-250-0) the target remuneration of the Executive Board members was adjusted in the 2023 financial year and the target direct remuneration increased as of 1 July 2023 by 10 per cent p.a., i.e. by 5 per cent for the 2023 financial year. On this basis, the total target remuneration for the Executive Board members for 2023 was as follows:\n\n#### Target remuneration (part 1)\n\n|                                      |                  | Theodor Weimer<br>(CEO) |                  |           |                  | Christoph Böhm<br>(CIO/COO) |                  |           |  |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------|--|\n|                                      | 2023<br>€ thous. | 2023<br>%               | 2022<br>€ thous. | 2022<br>% | 2023<br>€ thous. | 2023<br>%                   | 2022<br>€ thous. | 2022<br>% |  |\n| Base salary                          | 1,575.0          | 26.3                    | 1,500.0          | 25.8      | 756.0            | 26.8                        | 720.0            | 26.2      |  |\n| Fringe benefits                      | 60.6             | 1.0                     | 60.5             | 1.1       | 25.3             | 0.9                         | 28.4             | 1.0       |  |\n| One-year variable remuneration       | 1,155.0          | 19.3                    | 1,100.0          | 19.0      | 588.0            | 20.8                        | 560.0            | 20.3      |  |\n| Performance Bonus (cash component)   | 1,155.0          | –                       | 1,100.0          | –         | 588.0            | –                           | 560.0            | –         |  |\n| Multi-year variable remuneration     | 2,520.0          | 42.0                    | 2,400.0          | 41.3      | 1,176.0          | 41.6                        | 1,120.0          | 40.7      |  |\n| Performance Bonus (Restricted Stock) | 1,155.0          | –                       | 1,100.0          | –         | 588.0            | –                           | 560.0            | –         |  |\n| Performance Shares Tranche 2022-2026 | –                | –                       | 1,300.0          | –         | –                | –                           | 560.0            | –         |  |\n| Performance Shares Tranche 2023-2027 | 1,365.0          | –                       | –                | –         | 588.0            | –                           | –                | –         |  |\n| Pension expense                      | 683.8            | 11.4                    | 745.9            | 12.8      | 278.4            | 9.9                         | 324.2            | 11.8      |  |\n| Total target remuneration            | 5,994.4          | 100.0                   | 5,806.4          | 100.0     | 2,823.7          | 100.0                       | 2,752.6          | 100.0     |  |\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/257/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In the 2021 remuneration system, maximum remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer is €12,000,000 and for the ordinary Executive Board members €6,000,000.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\nThe maximum remuneration includes all payouts of non-performance-based remuneration (base salary, fringe benefits, pension and risk protection) and performance-based remuneration components (Performance Bonus, Performance Shares), whereby the pension and risk protection are based on the service cost.\n\nIt will only be possible to report on compliance with maximum remuneration for 2023 after the payout for the tranche of Performance Shares granted in 2023. To the extent that the payout from Performance Shares would result in the maximum remuneration being exceeded, the payout would be reduced accordingly to ensure compliance with the maximum remuneration.\n\nA maximum remuneration also existed prior to the 2021 remuneration system to cap the annual payouts from remuneration components. It was set at €9,500,000 for each active Executive Board member and was always complied with.\n\n# Overview of the remuneration structure for Executive Board members\n\nIn structuring the remuneration, the Supervisory Board strives to ensure that the overall framework for remuneration within the Executive Board is as uniform as possible. The remuneration system for Executive Board members consists of non-performance-based and performance-based components.\n\nThe non-performance-based remuneration components consist of base salary, contractual fringe benefits and provisions for retirement and risk protection. The performance-based component consists of the Performance Bonus and the Performance Shares.\n\nIn addition, the company's share ownership guidelines require Executive Board members to invest a substantial amount in Deutsche Börse AG shares during their term of office.\n\nThe following overview shows the main elements of the 2021 remuneration system.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/259/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

Furthermore, around 70 per cent of this performance-based remuneration has a multi-year assessment basis and is also share-based. This ensures that the remuneration structure is aligned with the company's sustainable long-term development. It also ensures that the performance-based remuneration to reward the achievement of long-term targets is higher than that for short-term targets and that the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with those of shareholders.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe base salary accounts for around 30 per cent of the target direct remuneration. The Performance Bonus, which is paid out after the respective financial year, accounts for approx. 22.5 per cent of the target direct remuneration. The Performance Bonus, which is available to the Executive Board members after a further four financial years (performance-based restricted stock) also accounts for approx. 22.5 per cent. Performance Shares account for approx. 25 per cent of the target direct remuneration.\n\nImage /page/260/Figure/10 description: The image is a diagram illustrating the structure of executive compensation over a five-year period. The diagram is divided into several components: Base salary (approximately 30%), Performance Bonus (approximately 45%), Performance Shares (approximately 25%), Pension and risk coverage, Contractual fringe benefits, and Share ownership guidelines (SOG). The Performance Bonus is further divided into 50% in cash and 50% performance-based restricted stock with a blocking period of four years. The Performance Shares have a five-year performance period. The Share ownership guidelines (SOG) have a build-up period of four years after appointment, with a requirement to hold shares until the end of the term of office, at 200% for the CEO and 100% for ordinary Board members of gross base salary. The diagram also highlights the pay-for-performance aspect, which constitutes 70% of the target direct remuneration, and the long-term focus, which constitutes approximately 70% of performance-based remuneration and is long-term and share-based.\n\n{261}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/261/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

When setting the amount of base salary, the Supervisory Board is guided by the relevant knowledge and experience of the Executive Board members for their respective role.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\n### Fringe benefits\n\nExecutive Board members receive contractually agreed fringe benefits. These include, inter alia, an appropriate company car for business and personal use. They also receive taxable contributions towards private pensions. In addition, the company takes out appropriate insurance coverage for them. This included accident insurance in the 2023 financial year. Another fringe benefit in the 2023 financial year was the use of carpool vehicles or vehicles with drivers.\n\nExecutive Board members were not granted any other fringe benefits in the 2023 financial year apart from those mentioned.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there was also directors & officers (D&O) insurance for Executive Board members.\n\n### Pension and risk coverage\n\nFurther information\n\nAs another non-performance-based component of the remuneration system the Executive Board members are entitled to a pension as well as invalidity and life insurance.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are generally entitled to receive retirement benefits upon reaching the age of 60, provided that they are no longer in the service of Deutsche Börse AG at that time. A different rule applies to Thomas Book, who is entitled to retirement benefits on reaching the age of 63. The Supervisory Board reviews and determines the pensionable income that is used as the basis for retirement benefits. Executive Board members normally receive a defined contribution pension. An exception applies to Executive Board members with existing entitlements from previous positions within Deutsche Börse Group. In this case, they may receive a defined benefit pension instead. This exception only applies to Thomas Book.\n\n#### Defined contribution pension system\n\nThe rules of the defined contribution pension scheme apply to Theodor Weimer, Christoph Böhm, Heike Eckert, Stephan Leithner and Gregor Pottmeyer.\n\nUnder the defined contribution pension scheme, the company makes an annual capital contribution to the scheme for each calendar year that a member serves on the Executive Board. This pension contribution is calculated by applying an individual contribution rate to their pensionable income. The Supervisory Board determines and regularly reviews the pensionable income. The annual capital contributions calculated in this way bear interest of at least 3 per cent per annum. As a rule, retirement benefits are paid as a monthly pension. However, the Executive Board member may choose for payment to be made in the form of a one-off lump sum or as five instalments. The entitlements vest in accordance with the provisions of Betriebsrentengesetz (German Company Pensions Act).\n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/262/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons. The first button has a house icon, the second button has a magnifying glass icon, the third button has a left-pointing arrow with a line behind it, the fourth button has a left-pointing arrow, and the fifth button has a right-pointing arrow.\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-250-0) [Auditor's Report](#page-299-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Defined benefit pension system (legacy commitment)\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nAfter reaching the contractually agreed retirement age, beneficiaries covered by the defined benefit pension system receive a certain proportion of their individual pensionable income as a pension, known as the replacement rate. The requirement is that the respective Executive Board member was in office for at least three years and was reappointed at least once. As is the case under the defined contribution scheme, the Supervisory Board determines and regularly reviews the pensionable income. The replacement rate depends on the length of Executive Board service and number of reappointments, and amounts to a maximum of 50 per cent. The payment terms and the rules governing vesting correspond to those of the defined contribution scheme.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are entitled to an early pension if the company does not extend their service agreements, unless the reasons for doing so are attributable to the Executive Board member or would justify terminating the agreement without observance of a notice period. As in the case of a retirement pension, the amount of the early pension is calculated by applying the replacement rate to the respective pensionable income. Executive Board members with a defined contribution pension are not eligible for an early pension.\n\n#### Permanent incapacity to work and death benefits\n\nA key element of the retirement benefits is insurance coverage for Executive Board members in the event of permanent incapacity for work or death. If an Executive Board member has a permanent occupational disability, the company has the right to put that Executive Board member into retirement. A permanent occupational disability arises if the Executive Board member is incapable of working for more than six months and it is not expected that they will be fit to return to work within another six months. In this case, Executive Board\n\nmembers with defined benefit pensions receive an amount calculated by applying the achieved replacement rate to the respective pensionable income. Executive Board members with defined contribution pensions receive the plan assets already accrued when the pension benefits fall due, plus a supplement. The supplement corresponds to the full annual pension contribution that would have been due in the year of departure multiplied by the number of years between the date on which the pension benefits fall due and the Executive Board member's sixtieth birthday. If an Executive Board member dies, their surviving spouse receives 60 per cent and each eligible child 10 per cent (for full orphans: 25 per cent) of the amount presented above, however up to a maximum of 100 per cent of the pension contribution.\n\n#### Transitional payments\n\nFurther information\n\nIn the event that an Executive Board member becomes permanently incapable of working, the defined benefit pension agreements for Executive Board members provide for a transitional payment. The amount of this payment corresponds to the target amount of performance-based remuneration (Performance Bonus and Performance Shares) in the year in which the event triggering the benefits occurs. It is paid out in two tranches in the two following years. If an Executive Board member dies, their spouse receives 60 per cent of the transitional payment.\n\nThe pensionable income and the present value of the pension commitments as at 31 December 2023 are shown in the following tables in consolidated form for each Executive Board member:\n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/263/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Performance-based remuneration comprises a Performance Bonus and Performance Shares. The performancebased remuneration components are mostly assessed on a multi-year basis to ensure the sustainable long-term development of Deutsche Börse AG. They are also mostly share-based, which aligns the interests of the Executive Board and the shareholders. Performance-based remuneration is calculated largely on the basis of long-term performance by measuring various performance criteria over five years (Performance Shares and performance-based restricted stock: a oneyear performance period plus a four-year blocking period). The cash portion of the Performance Bonus (annual payout) is the only short-term element of the performance-based remuneration. The performance criteria include both financial and non-financial targets. In order to systematically pursue the idea of pay for performance, the performance criteria are set ambitiously. In order to take a holistic approach to the company's success, different performance criteria are used for the Performance Bonus and Performance Shares.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nIn accordance with recommendation G.8 GCGC, targets and reference parameters set by the Supervisory Board for performance-based remuneration components for each upcoming financial year may not be changed retrospectively.\n\nThe performance criteria and other important aspects of the performancebased remuneration components address the core pillars of the corporate strategy.

The target achievement and the resulting cash payout, as well as the amount to be invested in shares (performance-based restricted stock), are measured based on three equally weighted performance criteria: net revenue, EBITDA and individual targets.\n\nThe Performance Bonus is intended to set incentives for the realisation of operational objectives which are materially important to the long-term development of Deutsche Börse AG. For this reason, the performance criteria include net revenue and EBITDA, financial indicators which are vital for the successful execution of the corporate strategy and create incentives for profitable growth. Individual targets make it possible to differentiate performance according to the operational and strategic responsibilities of the individual Executive Board members. At the same time, the individual targets allow the Executive Board as a whole to be guided, particularly in terms of achieving core strategic targets which are essential for the implementation of the corporate strategy.\n\nA Performance Bonus with a certain target amount is agreed with each Executive Board member every year, with target achievement being measured over the course of a financial year. In total, an overall target achievement ranging from 0 per cent to 200 per cent is possible. This means that a complete loss of the Performance Bonus is also possible.\n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/266/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Target achievement of 0 per cent to 200 per cent is possible for each performance criterion.\n\n### Net revenue\n\nThe basis is net revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements. This consists of revenue plus net interest income from banking business and other operating income, less volume-related costs. Using net revenue as a performance criterion for the Performance Bonus is intended to incentivise the desired growth in net revenue. This serves as the basis for all the other activities carried out by Deutsche Börse AG and for its long-term, sustainable success.\n\nThe target achievement for the market expectation component and the target achievement for the growth component are added to calculate the target achievement for the net revenue performance criterion.\n\nTarget achievement for the market expectation component of net revenue To calculate the target achievement for the market expectation component of net revenue, a target value is set by the Supervisory Board before the financial year begins. The target value set by the Supervisory Board is based on capital market consensus. In this way the Supervisory Board ensures that the target is in line with investors' expectations for the upcoming financial year. For 2023 the Supervisory Board set a target of €4,577.2 million.\n\nThe target value determines the lower limit, which is 85 per cent of the target value and so €3,890.6 million for the 2023 financial year. The upper limit is 110 per cent of the target and so €5,034.9 million.\n\n{267}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/267/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

This ensures that the target achievement is measured by reference to the target set. Net revenue for the measurement of target achievement was reduced by €–198.0 million in the 2023 financial year to reflect the takeover of SimCorp A/S, which was not included in the target set. On this basis the actual value was €4,878.6 million.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\n### Determination of actual value Net revenue\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\n| €m            | Net revenue<br>2023 |\n|---------------|---------------------|\n| \"As reported\" | 5,076.6             |\n| Adjustments   | - 198.0             |\n| Actual value  | 4,878.6             |\n\nThis represents a target achievement of 165.85 per cent in the market expectation component of net revenue.\n\n#### Target achievement value Net revenue\n\n|                            | Target<br>achievement<br>2023 |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Target<br>value €m         | 4,577.2                       |\n| Actual value €m            | 4,878.6                       |\n| Deviation<br>%             | 6.58                          |\n| Target<br>achievement<br>% | 165.85                        |\n\nFurther information\n\nImage /page/267/Figure/15 description: The image is a line graph.

This stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses. One of the main pillars of the corporate strategy, alongside absolute growth, is the profitability of this growth. To reflect this strategic relevance, EBITDA has been established as a key indicator for the purpose of managing Deutsche Börse AG and implementing the corporate strategy, and thus serves as a performance criterion for the Performance Bonus.\n\nThe target achievement for the market expectation component and the target achievement for the growth component are added to calculate the target achievement for the EBITDA criterion.\n\nTarget achievement for the market expectation component of EBITDA To calculate the target achievement for the market expectation component of EBITDA, a target value is set by the Supervisory Board before the financial year begins. The target value is determined by multiplying the EBITDA margin in the previous year by the target value for the performance criterion net revenue for the upcoming financial year, as described above. For the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board set a target value of €2,665.1 million.\n\nThe target value determines the lower limit, which is 85 per cent of the target value and so €2,265.3 million for the 2023 financial year. The upper limit is 110 per cent of the target value and so €2,931.6 million for the 2023 financial year.\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/269/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

The overall target achievement for the performance criterion EBITDA is therefore 200.00 per cent in 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Target achievement EBITDA 2023\n\n|        |                                                                  | Growth component     |                      |             |                            |                                                 |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|        | Market<br>expectation<br>component<br>target<br>achievement<br>% | EBITDA<br>2023<br>€m | EBITDA<br>2022<br>€m | Change<br>% | Target<br>achievement<br>% | Overall<br>target<br>achievement<br>EBITDA<br>% |\n| EBITDA | 200.00                                                           | 2,944.3              | 2,525.6              | 16.58       | 49.73                      | 200.00                                          |\n\n### Individual targets\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe individual targets are set by the Supervisory Board for each Executive Board member for the upcoming financial year (or for the remainder of the year if the member is appointed in the course of the year). Individual targets may be defined for multiple or all Executive Board members together. When setting individual targets, the Supervisory Board ensures that they are demanding and quantifiable. To ensure this is the case, concrete figures or expectations are defined for the target achievement. To avoid any dilution of the\n\nincentive effect, each Executive Board member has no more than four targets per financial year.\n\nThe targets are derived from the corporate strategy and promote its implementation. Strategic projects and initiatives can be used, as can operating measures that serve directly or indirectly for the implementation of the corporate strategy.\n\nIndividual targets should contribute to an implementation of the corporate strategy as well as the long-term, sustainable development of Deutsche Börse AG. Targets can be based on both financial and non-financial indicators. ESG targets are also potential individual targets. By defining financial and non-financial targets and measuring their achievement, the Supervisory Board ensures that the implementation of the corporate strategy is advanced and pursued sustainably, and that a holistic approach is taken to the success of Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nUp to four individual targets were defined for all Executive Board members at the start of the 2023 financial year. The Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board both discussed the individual targets in detail. A decision on the target achievement was taken on the basis of a detailed presentation and assessment of the Executive Board's collective and individual performances.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the targets for each Executive Board member for 2023:\n\n{271}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/271/Picture/7 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

On the other hand, the inclusion of ESG targets in the PSP emphasises a focus on Deutsche Börse AG's sustainable development. At the same time, the five-year performance period encourages a focus, in particular, on the long-term development of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\nThe PSP provides each Executive Board member with a number of so-called Performance Shares at the beginning of every financial year. The number of these initial (virtual) Performance Shares is determined by dividing the amount of the individual target remuneration in euros by the average Xetra® closing price of Deutsche Börse shares in the calendar month preceding the start of the performance period.\n\nThe relevant share price at grant for the PSP Tranche 2023, which was granted at the beginning of the 2023 financial year and ends at the close of the 2027 financial year, was €168.05. The individual target amounts, the share price at grant, the number of virtual Performance Shares granted and the potential maximum number of Performance Shares at the end of the performance period are shown for the individual Executive Board members below:\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/275/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The overall target achievement for the Performance Shares is measured using the performance criteria relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), earnings per share (EPS) and ESG targets. The financial performance criteria each allow for a target achievement of 0 per cent to 250 per cent, whereas the ESG targets allow for a target achievement of 0 per cent to 217.5 per cent. The target achievement for the criteria relative TSR and EPS is measured at the end of the five-year performance period. The target achievement for the ESG targets is determined and locked in at the end of every financial year, however. The final target achievement for the ESG targets is measured at the end of the five-year performance period using the average target achievement over the financial years.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nThe final number of virtual Performance Shares is determined by the overall target achievement for the performance criteria over the five-year performance period, multiplied by the number of Performance Shares initially granted. The final number of Performance Shares determined in this manner is multiplied by the average Xetra® closing price for Deutsche Börse shares in the calendar month preceding the end of the performance period, plus the dividends paid during the performance period. This represents the development of the Deutsche Börse share over the five-year performance period. The result of the multiplication is the payout amount for the acquisition of real shares. The payout amount from the Performance Shares is capped at 400 per cent of the target amount. It is due no later than with the regular salary payment for the calendar month following the approval of the consolidated financial statements after the end of the respective performance period.\n\nThe Executive Board members are obliged to invest the entire payout amount after tax in shares of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/276/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The formula starts with \"Target amount\" multiplied by \"Overall target achievement (0-242%)\". The overall target achievement is the sum of \"Relative TSR\", \"EPS\", and \"ESG targets\", with weights of 50%, 25%, and 25% respectively. The result is then multiplied by \"Development of virtual Performance Shares over five-year performance period\", which equals \"Payout in cash with obligation to acquire shares Cap: 400% target amount\". The formula is labeled with \"Performance period of five years\".\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\n# Performance criteria for the PSP Tranche 2023\n\n#### Relative Total Shareholder Return\n\nThe Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Deutsche Börse share compared with the companies in the sector-specific index STOXX® Europe 600 Financials over the five-year performance period provides an external performance criterion that is aligned with the capital market. The relative TSR emphasises the alignment of interests between Executive Board and shareholders and also integrates a relative performance metric into the remuneration system. This creates a strong incentive to outperform the relevant peer group over the long term.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 50 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. By defining an ambitious target achievement curve, which starts the payout only after the median has been exceeded, the Supervisory Board emphasises the pay-for-performance approach to Executive Board remuneration also with regards to the Total Shareholder Return.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for relative TSR is as follows:\n\nImage /page/276/Figure/15 description: The image is a graph showing the target achievement percentage versus the relative TSR against index (percentile rank). The x-axis represents the relative TSR against index (percentile rank), with labels at 50th, 60th, and 90th percentiles. The y-axis represents the target achievement percentage, with labels at 0, 50, 100, and 250. The graph shows a piecewise linear function. From the start to the 50th percentile, the target achievement is 0%. At the 50th percentile, the target achievement jumps to 50%. From the 50th percentile to the 60th percentile, the target achievement increases linearly to 100%. From the 60th percentile to the 90th percentile, the target achievement increases linearly to 250%. After the 90th percentile, the target achievement remains constant at 250%.\n\nThe target achievement for the criterion relative TSR is disclosed at the end of the performance period for the respective PSP tranche.\n\n### Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is used as an internal financial performance criterion. The basis for the criterion is EPS as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Alongside net revenue and EBITDA, EPS is the third key indicator for measuring the successful implementation of the growth strategy. Implementing EPS as a performance criterion for the Performance Shares incentivises long-term profitable growth in this remuneration component too, and reflects Deutsche Börse AG's focus on growth. Including EPS as a performance criterion for the Performance Shares also ensures that only M&As that are\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/277/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The target defined by the Supervisory Board is an EPS CAGR of 7.5 per cent p.a. over the performance period. The cap was set at 18.75 per cent p.a. and the floor at 0 per cent p.a.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for EPS is as follows:\n\nget achievement (%)\n\nFurther information\n\nImage /page/277/Figure/13 description: The image is a graph with x and y axes. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 18.75, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 250. A line starts at (0,0), increases linearly to (7.5, 100), and then continues to increase linearly to (18.75, 250).\n\nTo measure target achievement, the reported EPS is adjusted for any amortisation of intangible assets, purchase price allocations (PPA) and transaction costs in the case of large M&A transactions valued at more than €1 billion. The PPA correction reflects the business model of Deutsche Börse AG and potential M&A targets, since these typically only have minor tangible assets. Adjusting for transaction costs means the Executive Board is not penalised by completing larger M&A transactions, which is in line with the growth strategy by means of both organic and inorganic growth.\n\n{278}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/278/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

This underlines Deutsche Börse AG's focus on a holistic approach to its corporate responsibility and ensures its sustainable success as a company.\n\nThe ESG targets are defined on the basis of a catalogue of criteria with four categories: \"External view\", \"Employee satisfaction\", \"Expansion of ESG business\" and \"CO2 neutrality\". They reflect the different ESG aspects and cover them holistically.\n\n| Category  | External view                                                  | Employee<br>satisfaction           | Expansion of<br>ESG business                  | CO2 neutrality                            |  |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--|\n| Target    | Good results in<br>three leading<br>independent ESG<br>ratings | Good results in<br>employee survey | Growth in net<br>revenue from<br>ESG products | Achieve and<br>maintain<br>CO2 neutrality |  |\n| Weighting | 6.25%                                                          | 6.25%                              | 6.25%                                         | 6.25%                                     |  |\n| Logic     | 5-year target with annual lock-in                              |                                    |                                               |                                           |  |\n\nThe targets in these four categories are clearly measurable and subject to specific target achievement curves. To measure overall target achievement for the ESG targets, the first step is to calculate the target achievement in the four categories \"External view\", \"Employee satisfaction\", \"Expansion of ESG business\" and \"CO2 neutrality\" at the end of each financial year. These figures are then added on a weighted basis and formally confirmed. At the end of the five-year performance period, the second step is to measure the overall target achievement for the ESG targets by calculating the average of the annual target achievements for ESG targets over the entire performance period. The possible overall target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 217.5 per cent. The annual target achievement for the ESG targets and the achievement in the individual categories of ESG targets are disclosed at the end of each financial year.\n\n### External view\n\nFurther information\n\nIn the \"External view\" category, the aim is to achieve good results in three leading independent ESG ratings. The target achievement is based on the average ranking (percentile) in three leading independent ESG ratings determined beforehand by the Supervisory Board. For the PSP Tranche 2023, the Supervisory Board has chosen the ESG ratings from S&P, Sustainalytics and MSCI.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. The Supervisory Board has chosen the 90th percentile as the target and defined an upper and lower limit. The upper limit is the 99th percentile and the lower limit the 75th percentile.\n\n{279}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/279/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The x-axis shows the 75th, 90th, and 99th percentiles. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 250. The line graph shows that the target achievement is 0% until the 75th percentile. It then increases linearly to 100% at the 90th percentile. Finally, it increases linearly to 250% at the 99th percentile and remains constant thereafter.\n\nAverage percentile in ESG ratings\n\nRemuneration report\n\n### Employee satisfaction\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nA sustainable HR policy is also part of Deutsche Börse AG's sustainability strategy. This particularly includes a high level of employee satisfaction. To emphasise this, good results in the annual employee survey are integrated as an additional ESG target. The survey is carried out by an independent external provider.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. The Supervisory Board has defined a target value in the annual employee survey of 71.5 per cent approval, and set upper and lower limits. The cap is set at 84.5 per cent approval and the floor at 55.5 per cent approval.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for the category \"Employee satisfaction\" is as follows:\n\nImage /page/279/Figure/18 description: The image is a line graph. The x-axis ranges from approximately 50 to 90, with labeled points at 55.5, 71.5, and 84.5. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 250, with a labeled point at 100. A dark blue line starts at (55.5, 0), increases linearly to (71.5, 100), and then continues to increase linearly to (84.5, 250), after which it remains constant at 250.\n\nBasis: employee survey (%)\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/280/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In 2021, Deutsche Börse Group developed an own definition for ESG net revenue and reviews it annually. As part of this review, the scope of the ESG net revenue was adjusted.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nIn the Investment Management Solutions segment, ISS STOXX offers rating services for management and investment decisions on the one hand, as well as solutions for compliance with regulatory, governance or market standards and/or shareholder or stakeholder expectations. On the other hand, ISS STOXX offers ESG indices and climate benchmarks. The corresponding ESG net revenue includes the Corporate Solutions, ESG Analytics and Governance Solutions businesses as well as all revenue from the licensing of sustainable index solutions. License revenue from such products can either be allocated directly (e.g. in the case of ETF licenses) or an allocation is made if they are sold as part of a package.\n\nIn the Trading & Clearing segment, EEX operates trading and clearing services for commodity spot and derivatives markets. EEX defines ESG net revenue as revenue related to sustainable commodity markets. They include contracts for green power, emission allowances and related registry/ guarantee of origin services as well as power products, related to the share of renewable energy production in the respective market area or country.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. The Supervisory Board has defined a target value for growth in ESG net revenue of 10 per cent p.a., and set upper and lower limits. The cap was set at 25 per cent p.a. and the floor at 0 per cent p.a.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for the category \"Expansion of ESG business\" is as follows:\n\nTarget achievement (%)\n\nImage /page/280/Figure/16 description: The image is a line graph. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 25, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 250.

If CO2 neutrality is achieved, the target achievement is 100 per cent. If it is missed, the target achievement is 0 per cent.\n\nAs a further incentive to achieve CO2 neutrality, the target achievement is also subject to a sub-condition: that CO2 emissions have to be reduced. If CO2 emissions are reduced, the target achievement in the category \"CO2 neutrality\" is increased by 20 per cent. If this is not the case, the target achievement is reduced by 20 per cent. Since energy use in buildings accounts for a large share, CO2 neutrality is calculated per workplace.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for the category \"CO2 neutrality\" is as follows:\n\nTarget achievement (%)\n\nImage /page/281/Figure/14 description: The image is a graph comparing CO2 emissions per workplace for companies that are not CO2-neutral versus those that are. The x-axis is labeled \"Not CO2-neutral\" and \"CO2-neutral.\" The y-axis ranges from 0 to 200. For companies that are not CO2-neutral, the CO2 emissions per workplace are at 0. For CO2-neutral companies, the CO2 emissions per workplace are at 100. There are two horizontal dotted lines at 80 and 120, labeled \"No reduction of CO2 emissions per workplace (-20% target achievement)\" and \"Reduction of CO2 emissions per workplace (+20% target achievement)\" respectively.\n\nCO₂ neutrality\n\n{282}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-282-0\"></span>Image /page/282/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

The PSP Tranche 2019 was based on the remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board with effect from 1 January 2016 and approved by the Annual General Meeting with a majority of 84.19 per cent on 11 May 2016 (remuneration system 2016). The target achievement for the PSP Tranche 2019 was measured on the basis of the equally weighted performance criteria \"Adjusted Net Income Growth\" and \"TSR Performance\".\n\n#### Adjusted Net Income Growth\n\nAdjusted Net Income Growth is the growth in the adjusted net income attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche Börse AG for the corresponding financial year. The Supervisory Board determines the target achievement rate for Adjusted Net Income Growth at the end of each financial year during the fiveyear performance period, which is then locked in. The target achievement rate at the end of the performance period in question is the average of the annual target achievement rates for each of the five years. Target achievement degrees may range between 0 per cent and 250 per cent.\n\n{283}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/283/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

It differs from unadjusted net income (€1,724.0 million) by non-recurring effects due to M&A activities and legal disputes. It was also corrected for the costs of organisational restructuring.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nThe increase of 17.56 per cent represents a target achievement of 250.00 per cent for the 2023 financial year.\n\nOverall, a target achievement of 170.388 per cent was determined for the performance criteria \"Adjusted Net Income Growth\" for the PSP Tranche 2019.\n\nThe following overviews show the individual target achievements over the performance period and the target achievement curve:\n\n#### Target achievement Net income\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\n| Financial<br>year          | Net income growth<br>% | Target<br>achievement<br>% |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 2019                       | 10.26                  | 139.40                     |\n| 2020                       | 8.93                   | 108.58                     |\n| 2021                       | 8.16                   | 103.96                     |\n| 2022                       | 20.24                  | 250.00                     |\n| 2023                       | 17.56                  | 250.00                     |\n| Ø<br>Target<br>achievement |                        | 170.388                    |\n\nFurther information\n\nImage /page/283/Figure/15 description: The image is a graph that shows the relationship between adjusted net income growth (in percentage) and some other variable.

The y-axis is not explicitly labeled but has horizontal dotted lines at values 100, 115, 133, and 250. The graph itself is a piecewise linear function. It starts at a low value for adjusted net income growth less than 0, then increases linearly until it reaches 100 at +7.5% growth. It continues to increase, reaching 115 at +10% growth, then jumps to 133 at +10% growth. It then increases linearly again until it reaches 250 at +15% growth. Finally, it remains constant at 250 for adjusted net income growth greater than +15%.\n\n#### TSR Performance\n\nThe relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance for Deutsche Börse shares is derived from Deutsche Börse AG's ranking relative to the companies included in the STOXX® Europe 600 Financials index. The ranking is measured on the basis of the TSR performance, which is calculated by comparing the TSR at the beginning and end of the performance period. Possible target achievement ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent.\n\nOverall, a target achievement of 155.00 per cent was determined for the performance criteria \"TSR Performance\" for the PSP Tranche 2019.\n\n{284}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/284/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

They also align Executive Board remuneration more closely with the strategic objective of Deutsche Börse AG's long-term success. The remuneration system obliges the CEO to hold 200 per cent and ordinary Executive Board members 100 per cent of their annual gross base salary in Deutsche Börse AG shares.\n\nShares from the Performance Bonus and shares from the payout of Performance Shares are also taken into account for the share ownership guidelines, in addition to shares held privately.\n\nThe required shareholdings have to be acquired within a period of four years.\n\nThe purchase of shares under the Performance Bonus Plan and the Performance Share Plan and purchases from private funds is carried out for Executive Board members by a service provider determined by Deutsche Börse AG and engaged by the Executive Board member, which invests the respective amounts in Deutsche Börse AG shares for the Executive Board member independently, without any influence from the Executive Board member or the company. Shares are purchased during the first four trading days in June of each year that are consecutive calendar days.\n\n{286}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/286/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The Supervisory Board is entitled to assert a clawback claim even after an Executive Board member has left the company, for a period of up to two years following termination of the service contract. Any claims for damages remain unaffected by any clawback of performance-based remuneration.\n\nThere was no cause to apply the malus or clawback rules in the 2023 financial year, so the Supervisory Board did not reduce or recover any performancebased remuneration.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group – Annual report 2023\n\n{288}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/288/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The payment is calculated on the basis of the total remuneration for the past financial year and, where appropriate, the expected total remuneration for the current financial year.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\nThe payouts for the Performance Bonus and the Performance Shares take place on the dates and conditions originally agreed upon. Payouts are not made any earlier. In accordance with the recommendation of the GCGC, an exception applies in cases in which the service contract ends early because of permanent incapacity or any other illness, or the death of the Executive Board member. In these cases, the target amount of Performance Bonus and Performance Shares is paid out immediately.\n\n## Early termination for good cause\n\nIf the service contract is terminated early for a good cause for which the Executive Board member is responsible, or if an Executive Board member steps down before the end of the performance period without good cause or without a corresponding agreement, any claims to the Performance Bonus and all Performance Shares are forfeited.\n\n## Post-contractual non-competition clause\n\nA post-contractual non-competition clause applies to members of the Executive Board. This means that the Executive Board members are contractually prohibited from acting for a competing company, or from undertaking competing activities, for one year following the end of their service. Compensation of 75 per cent of the base salary and 75 per cent of the most recent Performance Bonus is payable during the non-compete period. Pension benefits and any severance payments are offset against the compensation. In addition, 50 per cent of other earnings are deducted if these – together with the compensation – exceed the Executive Board member's most recent remuneration. The company may waive the post-contractual non-compete clause before the Executive Board member's contract of service ends.\n\n# Information on third-party benefits\n\nExecutive Board members did not receive any benefits from third parties for their work on the Executive Board in the 2023 financial year.\n\n{289}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/289/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The remuneration awarded and due comprises all remuneration components for which performance has already been measured, for which all conditions precedent and subsequent are met or no longer apply, and which are vested at the close of the financial year. It is irrelevant whether the payout has already been made in the 2023 financial year or occurs at the beginning of the 2024 financial year. So for the one-year variable remuneration, for example, the Performance Bonus (cash component) for the 2023 financial year is shown, although the payout takes place at the beginning of the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe remuneration shown for the 2023 financial year consists of:\n\n- Base salary paid in the 2023 financial year\n- Fringe benefits received in the 2023 financial year\n- Performance Bonus determined for the 2023 financial year (cash component), which will be paid out in the 2024 financial year\n- Performance Bonus determined for the 2023 financial year (restricted stock), which will be paid out and invested in the 2024 financial year\n- Tranche of Performance Shares granted in 2019 and ended at the close of 2023, which will be paid out in three equal parts in 2024, 2025 and 2026\n\nThe service cost as defined in IAS 19 is part of Executive Board remuneration. The retirement benefit commitments for the 2023 financial year are shown accordingly in the tables.\n\n{290}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/290/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The current system is only slightly different to the previous system of remuneration of Supervisory Board members which was applied from 1 May 2020. In the current remuneration system the attendance fee is also paid for virtual attendance and is paid for each meeting day.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nFurther information\n\nThe remuneration system for the Supervisory Board consists of a fixed remuneration plus an attendance fee. This is in line with the recommendation G.18 sentence 1 GCGC as amended on 28 April 2022. The structure of Supervisory Board remuneration, providing for fixed remuneration only, strengthens the Board's independence and provides for a counterbalance to the structure of Executive Board remuneration, which is mainly variable and aligned with Deutsche Börse Group's growth strategy. Supervisory Board remuneration therefore contributes to the implementation of the business strategy, and thus promotes Deutsche Börse Group's long-term development.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual remuneration of €85 thousand. In accordance with recommendation G.17 GCGC, remuneration is increased for the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Deputy Chair, as well as for chairs and members of committees. Remuneration of the Chair is €220 thousand. Remuneration of the Deputy Chair is €125 thousand. Members of Supervisory Board committees receive additional fixed annual remuneration of €30 thousand for each committee position they hold. The remuneration for members of the Audit Committee is €35 thousand. Remuneration of committee chairs is €40 thousand and for the Chair of the Audit Committee €75 thousand. If a Supervisory Board member sits on more than one\n\nSupervisory Board committee, only work on two of the committees is remunerated. Remuneration is then paid for work on the two committees with the highest remuneration. Supervisory Board members who only hold office for part of the financial year receive one-twelfth of the fixed annual remuneration and, if applicable, of the remuneration payable for their membership of committees, for each month or part-month in which they are members. The remuneration for any financial year is due and payable as a one-off payment after the Annual General Meeting that accepts the consolidated financial statements for the relevant financial year or decides on their approval.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board or a Supervisory Board committee receive an attendance fee of €1 thousand for each Board or committee meeting that they attend. Where two or more meetings are held on the same day, the attendance fee is only paid once.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are included in a directors & officers (D&O) insurance policy maintained by the company at an appropriate level in the interests of the company.\n\nAfter preparation by the Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board examines on a regular basis whether its members' remuneration is appropriate, given their tasks and the situation of the company. It carries out a horizontal market comparison for this purpose. The Supervisory Board may seek the advice of an independent external expert. Given the particular nature of the Supervisory Board's work, the review of Supervisory Board remuneration does not generally include a vertical comparison with the remuneration of employees of Deutsche Börse AG or Deutsche Börse Group.\n\n{294}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/294/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The joint operation Frankfurt consists of Deutsche Börse AG and the following entities: Eurex Frankfurt AG, Eurex Clearing AG, Eurex Repo GmbH, Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange GmbH, Clearstream Holding AG and Clearstream Banking AG. As for Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration, the average remuneration for the entire workforce is total remuneration (including any bonuses and other fringe benefits).\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nFurther information\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\n# Look ahead to 2024 from a remuneration perspective\n\nAs the remuneration system for the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG and the Remuneration Report 2022 were approved by a large majority of shareholders, no changes to the remuneration system are currently planned. On the contrary, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG sees these votes as a clear recommendation to maintain the current remuneration unchanged and to apply it again in the 2024 financial year. This applies particularly to the underlying performance criteria and the target achievement curves.\n\nIn view of the scheduled approval of the remuneration system for the Executive Board by the Annual General Meeting in 2025, the Supervisory Board, advised by its Nomination Committee, will review the current remuneration system in the 2024 financial year and notify significant shareholders of the results of the review and planned adjustments.\n\nRegardless of this, the intention is to present a remuneration system for the Supervisory Board with adjustments for approval at the Annual General Meeting 2024. The intention is to adjust the amount of remuneration in line with the function, in order to guarantee that the Supervisory Board remuneration remains competitive in future. In addition, this will reflect both the continuous expansion of Deutsche Börse Group's business activities in terms of their structure, volume and international scope, and the complexity of the legal and regulatory requirements and the demands on the Supervisory Board members and the increased liability risk that results.\n\nDetailed information about the adjustments to the Supervisory Board remuneration can be found in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting 2024.\n\n{299}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-299-0\"></span>Image /page/299/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The executive directors and the Supervisory Board are also responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Responsibility of the auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of\n\nfinancial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or error. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or error, including the related disclosures. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the remuneration report and related disclosures. The objective is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control system. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n{300}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/300/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Since we express an unqualified opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this opinion includes that the disclosures pursuant to Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG have been made in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\n# Restriction of use\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the audit agreement with Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft concluded with Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft.

We delivered very good figures and significantly exceeded the targets that we set at the beginning of the year. And with the decisions taken as part of Horizon 2026, the most recent update to our strategy, we have created a strong basis from which to develop in the years ahead.\n\nThe world in 2023 was dominated by Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine, the terrorist attack on Israel and the military response to it, the immeasurable suffering on both sides, and not least by a resurgence of populist politics and extremist tendencies in many democracies around the world. For the market participants that operate in this world, we at Deutsche Börse Group are not only a pillar of stability, but also an engine of change. Because we create trust in the markets of today and tomorrow, and we enable innovation through investment by creating access to capital markets.\n\nDespite this environment, the price fluctuations on the securities markets organised by us were lower last year than they have been for a long time: they were down by more than a third on the previous year, as measured by the VSTOXX® index. In the past, this would necessarily have resulted in lower revenues and profits for us, but that is no longer the case today. And that is not only good news for our workforce, but also – and especially – for you, our shareholders.\n\nHow did this development come about? We have consistently increased the share of our recurring income in recent years, taking it to 63 per cent last year. This is an achievement I am proud of, and on behalf of the entire Executive Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the employees of Deutsche Börse sincerely for their dedication.\n\nIn particular, I would like to express my gratitude for the success we had in initiating and completing the biggest transaction in our company's history by taking over the global software business SimCorp last year. It contributed 5 percentage points to our net revenue growth. This is almost one third of our total growth in net revenue. And with an increase of 17 per cent overall in 2023, this growth was gratifyingly strong.\n\nThe increase was also driven by organic growth with a strong secular – which means long-term – component. Here we reported an increase of 5 per cent. This secular growth was particularly marked in energy trading, where we gained additional market share and new customers. Then there were the strong tailwinds from rising interest rates. They benefit interest rate derivatives, but above all our net interest income. A total of 7 percentage points of our growth was due to these cyclical influences.\n\nSince we had our costs under control at the same time, despite higher capital expenditure, our pre-tax profits – or EBITDA – rose sharply by 17 per cent, the same amount as net revenues.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/0 description: The image shows a row of five gray circular buttons. The first button contains a house icon, the second button contains a magnifying glass icon, the third button contains a left-pointing arrow with a line, the fourth button contains a left-pointing arrow, and the fifth button contains a right-pointing arrow.\n\n#### [Letter from the CEO](#page-2-0)\n\n[The Executive Board](#page-4-0) [The Supervisory Board](#page-5-0)\n\n[Report of the Supervisory Board](#page-6-0)\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nIn the course of the latest update to our strategy in the context of Horizon 2026, we have modernised our dividend policy. We have adjusted the range within which we distribute a dividend, which is now set at 30 to 40 per cent of profits. This leads on seamlessly from our performance in recent years and takes the further expected significant profit growth into account. And for the first time, we are also promising you that the dividend per share will go up every year. So for 2023, we are proposing a dividend of €3.80 per share. This is 6 per cent more than in the previous year and represents around 40 per cent of our profits. Share buybacks are now also part of our capital allocation strategy again. We already started in early 2024 and will be returning the record sum of €1 billion to you this year: €700 million via the dividend and €300 million via share buybacks.\n\nWhat else is coming up in 2024? We expect our net revenues to go up to more than €5.6 billion. And our forecast for EBITDA is more than €3.2 billion. This already includes the possibility of moderate interest rate cuts by central banks.\n\nFurther sustainable growth is now on the horizon. Our new Horizon 2026 strategy consists of three elements. First: we are banking on strong organic growth of 10 per cent per year; of which 7 per cent p.a. will come from our existing businesses, and our acquisition of SimCorp has already contributed another 3 per cent p.a. on average. Second: we have created a new segment: Investment Management Solutions (IMS). This comprises the software and analytics business of SimCorp and Axioma, as well as the index, data and sustainability business of ISS STOXX. IMS is our new strategic cornerstone, with great potential for organic growth and strong recurring revenues. It enables us to address the buy side, i.e. institutional investors, as direct customers. This is a market with above-average, secular growth. Third: we are expanding our digital platforms for existing and new asset classes. The partnership with Google Cloud that we also initiated last year plays a crucial role here.\n\nI am certain that with this strategy, Deutsche Börse is well equipped for more successful years of strong growth. We know where we want to go. And I promise you this on behalf of the entire Executive Board – we will not be resting on our past successes.\n\nYours,\n\nhuodel haius\n\nTheodor Weimer Chief Executive Officer\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>Image /page/4/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The first was to provide intensive support for the development of the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. Secondly, we were involved at an early stage in the full acquisition of SimCorp A/S (SimCorp) by Deutsche Börse AG, provided regular advice on the transaction and approved it. SimCorp provides integrated investment management solutions for the financial industry. Together, the merged businesses of SimCorp, Axioma, Inc. (Axioma) and ISS STOXX form the new Investment Management Solutions segment – a key step in the implementation of the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. Thirdly, we prepared the CEO succession and other important personnel decisions within the Supervisory Board. In Stephan Leithner, we have found a convincing successor for Theodor Weimer, whose appointment expires at the end of 2024. By this time, Mr Weimer will have reached the age of 65.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG dealt in depth and regularly with the company's position, prospects and fundamental strategic options. The Supervisory Board was also involved in an advisory capacity in Deutsche Börse Group's activities to buy and sell companies and parts thereof. We performed the tasks assigned to us by law and the company's Articles of Association and bylaws. We have advised the Executive Board regularly on its management of the company and monitored its work. We were involved in all decisions of fundamental importance.\n\nWe continued our overarching work on environmental, social and governance matters (ESG). In the reporting year, we concentrated on the social aspects of ESG.\n\nOur work in 2023 was dominated by a difficult ongoing geopolitical situation. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine continued into its third year and\n\nthe attack on Israel by the terrorist organisation Hamas was followed by intensive military operations and armed conflicts. This is accompanied by ongoing uncertainty about future inflation rates worldwide and slow economic growth, particularly in industrialised countries. Our global economic and financial system therefore remains faced with great challenges.\n\nAt our meetings, the Executive Board provided us with comprehensive and timely information in accordance with the legal requirements. The high frequency of plenary and committee meetings and workshops ensured an intensive exchange of information between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. In addition, the CEO kept the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously and regularly informed concerning the current developments affecting the company's business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions and the long-term outlook and discussed these issues with him.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meetings in 2023 were held at the company's headquarters and in Cork, Ireland. In the reporting year, we held a total of seven plenary meetings, including one extraordinary meeting on the planned takeover of SimCorp. Five workshops also took place as part of the regular training and professional development measures for the Supervisory and Executive Boards, focusing on the Horizon 2026 strategy process (March), cybersecurity and current threats (March), strengthening the German and European capital markets and the role of Deutsche Börse Group (June), sustainability regulations and their implementation (September) and the future world of work, concentrating on the labour markets for IT and financial services (September). In another workshop we dealt with the subject of artificial intelligence (December). The workshops were carried out by internal and external experts.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

This virtual format was chosen particularly for meetings convened at short notice.\n\nThe average attendance rate for all Supervisory Board members at the plenary and committee meetings (including those held solely as video or conference calls) was 100 per cent during the year under review. An average of 24 per cent was in the form of virtual attendance.\n\nThe individual Supervisory Board members attended meetings in person or virtually as follows:\n\n#### Attendance of Supervisory

The Executive Board consulted the Supervisory Board at an early stage about the development of the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. This defines the strategic framework for Deutsche Börse Group until 2026 and also includes an updated climate strategy. We advised the Executive Board on all relevant aspects of the strategy. For details on the Group Horizon 2026 strategy, please refer to the \"Strategy and steering [parameters\"](#page-21-0) section in the combined [management](#page-16-0) report.\n\nAnother core element of our Supervisory Board work in the reporting year was the strategic expansion and reinforcement of our pre-trading business. Deutsche Börse AG acquired all the shares in the Danish company SimCorp, having successfully completed a public takeover offer. SimCorp is an international software company that provides integrated front-to-back investment management solutions for asset managers and other buy-side businesses. The business of the newly acquired SimCorp was merged with the data and analytics business of Axioma. The businesses of ISS, Inc. and STOXX Ltd. were also merged. A new segment, Investment Management Solutions, was created for the SimCorp, Axioma and ISS STOXX businesses in order to reflect the size and strategic importance of the pre-trading unit. At the Supervisory Board, we accompanied these structural changes and the expansion of our business and approved the necessary measures.\n\nAnother key focus of our Supervisory Board activities was the careful and early preparation of the upcoming change at the head of the Executive Board. With Stephan Leithner, we were able to ensure a convincing succession for Theodor Weimer. He will take up office on 1 October 2024. Mr Leithner and Mr Weimer will each exercise the function of Co-CEO until Mr Weimer's\n\nscheduled departure at the end of 2024. The Supervisory Board has thus created the conditions for an orderly change of leadership at an early stage.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would expressly like to thank Theodor Weimer, who took office at the beginning of 2018. He initially made a significant contribution to stabilising Deutsche Börse AG and from then on decisively and actively drove forward the strategic development of Deutsche Börse Group. Under his leadership, Deutsche Börse Group has grown steadily and sustainably and has seen extremely positive economic development.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also dealt with its future composition in the reporting year. Representatives of shareholders and employees will be elected for a period of office of three years in 2024. Please refer to the [\"Personnel](#page-15-0) matters\" section for details.\n\nIn the field of information technology, we discussed the partnership with a well-known global provider of cloud infrastructure and the main projects to develop the digital settlement platform D7 and an exchange for digital assets. Artificial intelligence and other new technologies, and the opportunities they represent for Deutsche Börse Group, were another key area of our work in this field. In view of their great importance for the Group and the infrastructure services it provides to financial and capital markets, we again discussed the subjects of information security and cyber resilience in depth.\n\nOne overarching focal area of our work was again the discussion of different topics relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. We discussed the updated climate strategy in detail, which is integrated into the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026. The Supervisory Board also examined in detail sustainability regulations and reporting and their implementation at Deutsche Börse Group. Furthermore, we gained an overview of the future world of work in the areas of information technology and financial services, which are important for us. Sustainability targets also play an important role in the system\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

In the context of the financial statements, we adopted the 2022 remuneration report, which was approved by a majority of 91.69 per cent of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2023. The Supervisory Board also supported the Executive Board's proposal to hold the Annual General Meeting online in the reporting year. This was based, in particular, on the experience of online Annual General Meetings held by Deutsche Börse AG in prior years and the concrete form of the online Annual General Meeting as defined in the new legislation governing stock corporations. Based on the positive experience of online general meetings to date, the amended company's Articles of Association, which have been approved by the 2023 Annual General Meeting, enable a corresponding decision to be taken for the Annual General Meetings in the next two years.\n\nIn the reporting year, we again dealt with various legal matters, such as the current status of litigation and legal proceedings involving Clearstream Banking S.A. in the USA and Luxembourg, and the ongoing investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne regarding the conception and settlement implementation of securities transactions by market participants over the dividend date (cum-ex transactions). Market participants used such transactions to make unjustified tax refund claims. In this context, the Supervisory Board also dealt with investigations into such transactions by the stock exchange regulator in the German state of Hesse.\n\nOther important litigation and legal proceedings concerning Deutsche Börse Group were also a key aspect of our work on the Supervisory Board. The efficiency, suitability and effectiveness of the internal control system and the handling of findings by internal control functions as well as external auditors and regulatory authorities were another important area of our work.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board Chair held meetings with institutional investors and proxy advisers in November and December 2023 to discuss current governance topics affecting the Supervisory Board. These meetings focused on\n\nthe Supervisory Board's work in the reporting year, the outlook for 2024, the upcoming personnel decisions for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, as well as a proposed increase in Supervisory Board remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board Chair summarised his dialogue with investors in the plenary meetings and the meetings of the Nomination Committee.\n\nOur plenary meetings and workshops during the reporting period focused particularly on the following issues:\n\nAt our ordinary meeting on 8 February 2023, the Executive Board reported in a regular cycle on the status of the cross-divisional client relationship management. We also discussed the preliminary result for the 2022 financial year and the Executive Board's dividend proposal for 2022. After in-depth discussion, we set the amount of the variable remuneration for the Executive Board for 2022. We also adopted the 2022 corporate governance statement and approved the Executive Board's resolution to hold the 2023 Annual General Meeting in a new online format. The Executive Board informed us in detail about succession planning for the senior management level, the targets set and achieved in terms of gender diversity, and the steps taken to build a global pool of female talent. A status report was also given on the current status of the public takeover offer for the Danish software company SimCorp, and the further measures to build a new Investment Management Solutions segment including ISS, STOXX and Qontigo. The Executive Board also informed us about the structure of the partnership with a well-known global provider of cloud infrastructure. We also adopted measures following the effectiveness review in 2022.\n\nAt the ordinary meeting on 9 March 2023, the Executive Board again informed us at length and in detail about the planned voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp and the further measures to build a new Investment Management Solutions segment including ISS, STOXX and Qontigo.

We discussed the financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG for 2022, the consolidated financial statements for 2022 and the 2022 remuneration report in the presence of the auditors. We approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2022 and the 2022 remuneration report, having carried our own detailed examination, in line with the recommendation of the Audit Committee, which had previously carried out an in-depth preparatory examination of the documents. The meeting also gave us the opportunity to discuss matters with the auditors without the presence of the Executive Board. In addition to the Supervisory Board report for 2022, we also adopted the agenda for the 2023 Annual General Meeting and elected Barbara Lambert as the deputy chair of the meeting. Furthermore, we examined in detail the results of the review of the appropriateness of Executive Board remuneration that is carried out with external support every two years, and adapted the base salary and target remuneration for the Executive Board as from 1 June 2023, as well as the pension agreement with Heike Eckert. The Executive Board informed us of the personnel situation in Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nA strategy workshop also took place on 9 March 2023, in which the Executive Board presented the baseline for the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026, and explained the strategy process and timetable.\n\nIn an IT workshop on 9 March 2023, we also dealt with the topic of cybersecurity and had the current overall threat level explained to us from the perspective of the federal government.\n\nIn an extraordinary meeting on 25 April 2023, we approved the announcement of the voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp and the other transaction steps to create an Investment Management Solutions segment.\n\nAt our ordinary meeting on 16 May 2023, we discussed the upcoming Annual General Meeting with the Executive Board.\n\nThe ordinary meeting on 21 June 2023 was held at one of Deutsche Börse Group international offices again for the first time since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the meeting in Cork, Ireland, we examined in detail and discussed the Horizon 2026 Group strategy devised by the Executive Board. The Strategy and Sustainability Committee had previously discussed the new Group strategy and the updated climate strategy in detail. The Executive Board also informed us about the status of various legal matters, including the current status of the litigation and legal proceedings involving Clearstream Banking S.A. in the USA and Luxembourg, and a hearing by the Hesse Exchange Supervisory Authority on establishing the risk management system for the stock market operations of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. We also discussed the investigations by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne into security transactions by market participants over the dividend date (cum-ex transactions). The Executive Board also notified us of the status of a project to optimise internal processes.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

We dealt particularly with the current requirements for sustainability reporting and the implementation of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act at Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nIn another workshop on human resources on 27 September 2023, we explored how the world of work would look in future and found out about current and future developments on the national and global labour market for IT and financial services.\n\nIn the ordinary meeting on 28 September 2023, the Executive Board informed us about the result of the voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp, the further steps towards a complete acquisition of the company, its subsequent delisting and the planned integration steps. The Executive Board also explained the status of the transaction steps to create an Investment Management Solutions segment. We dealt with the effectiveness review to be carried out in the reporting year and with the forthcoming Supervisory Board elections in 2024. Ahead of these elections and the annual suitability review, we reviewed and specified the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board as scheduled. Finally, the Executive Board presented an overarching Group programme to address the regulatory findings in the field of information technology.\n\nIn an IT workshop for the Supervisory Board on 7 December 2023, we dealt extensively with the fundamentals, current developments and use cases of artificial intelligence, in order to provide a basis for the further discussions of this topic planned for 2024.\n\nIn the ordinary meeting on 7 December 2023, we adopted the budget for 2024 and set the Executive Board targets for the 2024 financial year. The Executive Board informed us about the results of the annual employee survey, the implementation status of the personnel strategy and the revisions that had been made to the strategy for 2024. We gained an impression of the performance of recently acquired companies and equity investments and the investments made in the context of Deutsche Börse Group's corporate venturing activities. We discussed and adopted the results of our annual effectiveness review in accordance with section D.12 of the German Corporate Governance Code, the annual suitability assessment of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, as well as the upcoming year's training plan for the Supervisory Board. We also adopted the declaration of conformity in accordance with section 161 Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act) for the 2023 financial year, which can be viewed [at www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/declaration-of-conformity) > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Declaration of Conformity. Furthermore, we resolved to propose an adjustment to Supervisory Board remuneration at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The Executive Board informed us of the current status concerning the Investment Management Solutions segment.\n\nMartin Jetter, the Supervisory Board Chair, presented the agenda before each Supervisory Board meeting and informed the Supervisory Board about current matters. Theodor Weimer, the CEO, also informed us about the current developments affecting the company's business and significant transactions at the start of every meeting. At the end of each meeting the Supervisory Board members talked openly and extensively among themselves, without Executive Board members, about the meeting itself and general topics. A similar discussion also took place at the Supervisory Board meeting on 8 March 2024 in which we approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023, and which was also attended by the auditors. From 2021 onwards, the members of the Audit Committee have had regular talks with the external auditors without the Executive Board members.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The committees are responsible primarily for preparing the decisions to be taken by, and topics to be discussed in, the plenary meetings. Additionally, the Supervisory Board has delegated individual decision-making powers to the committees, to the extent that this is legally permissible. The individual committee chairs reported in detail to the plenary meetings on the work performed by their committees. The Chair of the Supervisory Board chairs the Nomination Committee, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, the Chairman's Committee and the Mediation Committee.

Pursuant to section 31(3) MitbestG, it submits proposals to the Supervisory Board for the appointment or dismissal of Executive Board members when a two-thirds majority has not been reached. The Mediation Committee only convenes as required. There was no need for the Mediation Committee to hold a meeting during the year under review.\n\n# Audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, based in Frankfurt am Main, (PwC) audited the annual financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG, the consolidated financial statements and the integrated combined management report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, together with the accounting system, and issued an unqualified audit opinion. The condensed financial statements and interim management report contained in the half-yearly financial report for the first six months of 2023 were reviewed by PwC. The documents relating to the financial statements and the reports by PwC were submitted to us for inspection and examination in good time. The auditors responsible were Marc Billeb and Michael Rönnberg. The auditors attended the relevant meetings of the Audit Committee and the meeting of the full Supervisory Board to discuss the financial statements – in all cases, also without the Executive Board members, they reported on the key results of their audit. In particular, they explained the net assets, financial position and result of operations of the company and the Group and were available to provide further information. They had regular exchanges with the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Audit as well as the Risk Committee, also outside the meetings. The audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report and non-financial declaration did not give rise to any objections. No facts were identified in the course of the audit that would indicate an inaccuracy in the declaration of conformity pursuant to section 161 AktG declared by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, for which an obligation of the auditor to notify the Chair of the Audit Committee had been agreed. There were also no objections raised as a result of the nonmandatory audit of the form and content of the remuneration report. The Supervisory Board discussed the services provided by PwC on a regular basis in addition to their statutory auditing services. There were no grounds for suspecting that the auditor's independence might be impaired.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>Image /page/15/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

It is satisfied that the reports meet the statutory requirements under sections 317 and 321 HGB, in particular. The committee reported to the Supervisory Board on its examination and recommended that it approve the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur own examination – during a plenary meeting – of the 2023 annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and the integrated combined management report did not lead to any objections. We therefore approved the result of the audit. We approved the annual financial statements prepared by the Executive Board and the consolidated financial statements at our meeting on 8 March 2024, in line with the Audit Committee's recommendation. As a result, the annual financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG have been adopted. The Audit Committee discussed the Executive Board's proposal for the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus (Bilanzgewinn) with the Executive Board. The discussion covered company liquidity, its financial planning and shareholders' interests. Following this discussion and its own examination, the Audit Committee concurred with the Executive Board's proposal for the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus. After examining this ourselves, the plenary meeting of the Supervisory Board also approved the Executive Board's proposal.\n\n# Personnel matters\n\nThere were no personnel changes in the Supervisory Board during the reporting period. Michael Rüdiger decided not to stand again for election to the Supervisory Board. He will therefore leave the board when his term of office ends at the close of the Annual General Meeting in 2024. The Supervisory Board discussed his succession in the reporting year and will propose Sigrid Kozmiensky for election by the Annual General Meeting in 2024.\n\nNo personnel changes were made with regard to the Executive Board in 2023.\n\n# Dealing with conflicts of interest\n\nIn order to rule out in advance even the impression that their personal interests might affect their work and decisions in the Supervisory Board, all Supervisory Board members disclose to the Chair of the Supervisory Board, without delay, any conflict of interests, particularly those that may arise due to an advisory function or decision-making role at customers, suppliers, lenders or other business partners. One Supervisory Board member did not take part in discussions or decisions on the subject of cum-ex transactions in order to avoid any potential conflict of interest. With regard to another potential conflict of interest in view of his roles as Supervisory Board Chair of BlackRock Asset Management Deutschland AG and Chair of the Board of Directors of BlackRock Asset Management Schweiz AG, Michael Rüdiger did not take part in discussions or decisions in the Supervisory Board on the acquisition of SimCorp. Lagebericht Abschluss\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees for their great commitment and good work in 2023, which remained challenging due to the ongoing geopolitical situation and its economic effects. die gute Arbeit im Jahr 2020, das aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie überaus herausfordernd war.\n\nFrankfurt/Main, 8 March 2024 for the Supervisory Board\n\nMartin Fye\n\nMartin Jetter Chair of the Supervisory Board\n\nVorsitzender des Aufsichtsrats\n\n12\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-16-0\"></span>Combined management report\n\nNettoerlöswachstum\n\n+XX%\n\nCAGR 2019–2022\n\n- 18 [Deutsche Börse:](#page-17-0)  [Fundamental information about](#page-17-0)  [the Group](#page-17-0)\n- 22 [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n- 27 [Economic situation](#page-26-0)\n- [44 Non-financial](#page-43-0) declaration\n- 64 [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- 83 [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- 88 [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- 90 [Report on post-balance sheet](#page-89-0)  date [events](#page-89-0)\n- 91 [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- 115 [Deutsche Börse AG](#page-114-0)  [\\(notes based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- 120 [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/12 description: The image is an abstract design featuring a blue background with a grid-like pattern.

On the left side of the diagram are the input factors, which include intellectual capital, human capital, financial capital, and partnerships. These input factors feed into the business model, which is represented by the Deutsche Borse Group logo. On the right side of the diagram are the outcome dimensions, which include economic position, employees, customers and markets, and social environment.\n\nAccording to the terminology used by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), we essentially need four capitals (input factors) to implement our business model. We deploy these capitals within a binding regulatory\n\nframework: intellectual capital, human capital, financial capital and partnerships. They enable us to create value with our business model. The impact that we have with our business model can be thought of in the following four outcome dimensions:\n\nEconomic situation: As a fast-growing company we create financial value, substance and returns on which our investors, employees, customers and society can build.\n\nEmployees: As an employer, we take wide-ranging measures to enable our employees to fully realize their development potential. We also work to boost the satisfaction of our employees and their loyalty to our Group. All this helps to build our employer brand, which is the main reason why talented people choose us.\n\nCustomers and markets: Our products and services contribute to increase transparency for market participants and to enable them to price in and integrate market developments, changes and transformations. In this way we enable our customers and market participants to make better-informed decisions.\n\nSocial environment: Our value creation also goes far beyond the areas of direct concern to us as a company. We thus focus on the environment and human rights aspects of our supply chain and are involved in initiatives to strengthen the local financial industry.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-21-0\"></span>Image /page/21/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

As a fully integrated end-to-end provider we offer our customers a broad value chain with innovative solutions.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nThe market environment in which we operate is very dynamic. This applies not only to the markets themselves, which we organise and operate via our platforms. Our competitive environment as a market infrastructure operator is also permanently in flux. The provider landscape has consolidated drastically in the past decades, which has strengthened the remaining operators of market infrastructure and enabled them to extend their business in various directions. New business activities and new customer groups beyond the core business have moved to the foreground. Today, market infrastructure providers not only service the sell-side, like banks and financial service providers, but rather have extended and diversified their customer target group.\n\nWe too have continued to expand our market leadership in the European Union as a fully integrated end-to-end provider in the financial markets. By this gradual expansion of our business model we are now also able to cater to the buy-side as a new customer group. Our broad value chain now includes solutions for investment management, trading and clearing through to securities services. We have achieved this by both organic growth and targeted acquisitions. We see ourselves as a hybrid of technology company and financial services provider, with a value chain that has a high degree of integration and diversification. As a result, our business model is characterised by great scalability, a low risk profile and low capital intensity, with a high affinity for technology at the same time. This is not only a unique sales proposition in international competition, but also forms the basis for attractive growth opportunities and also makes our business model more robust and resilient to market fluctuations or secular shifts.\n\nAll this has enabled us to exceed the financial targets we set ourselves as part of our Strategy Compass 2023. We achieved the original guidance for 2023 back in 2022. And we revised the 2023 targets upwards several times during the course of the year.\n\n#### Target achievement Compass 2023\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n| Key performance<br>indicators                                            | Target Compass<br>2023 | Target achieve-<br>ment 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Net revenue                                                              | ~€4.3 billion          | €5,076.6 million             |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation<br>(EBITDA) | ~€2.5 billion          | €2,944.3 million             |\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

It defines the strategic direction and financial targets for the years ahead through to 2026 and thus secures our outstanding market position and continued viability. The core of Horizon 2026 is the business strategy that we have mapped out comprehensively and in detail at a Group and segment level. The relevant strategic aspects of human resources, information technology, environment, social and governance, and particularly climate action, are integral parts of our business strategy. Further information on these topics can be found in the chapter [\"Non-financial declaration\".](#page-43-0) The relevant financial strategy for our Group is reflected in the adjusted framework for capital allocation. It backs up our business strategy and forms the basis for our further corporate growth.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Strategy and steering parameters\n\nIn our strategy we make a fundamental distinction between organic growth, generated from existing operations, and inorganic growth by means of focused acquisitions to expand or deepen our value chain. Organic growth consists mainly of secular initiatives such as product innovation, additional market share or new customer gains, as well as cyclical growth due to interest rate effects or higher trading volumes due to market fluctuations.\n\nOur growth course as defined in Horizon 2026 is built on three strategic pillars.\n\n- Strong organic growth: As in the past, organic growth forms the foundation for Horizon 2026. We benefit from long-term industry trends in attractive markets and strive for profitable organic growth of around 7 per cent per year on average. Secular growth is intended to account for by far the largest share of this.\n- Investment Management Solutions: With the acquisition of SimCorp we complement our former activities in the area of data and analytics with a holistic offering for institutional investors by pooling end-to-end solutions for investment management and high-quality data in a new segment. In addition, we expect the acquisition of SimCorp completed in 2023 to deliver an average of around 3 per cent inorganic growth per year, and so increase the share of recurring revenue.\n- Digital leadership: We intend to keep expanding our leading role in the digitalisation of assets. With D7 we already operate in the Securities Services segment one of the leading digital infrastructures globally in the post-trade area with more than 7,000 digital issuances. Cloud technologies and artificial intelligence also help us to increase our effectiveness and efficiency, and to open up new business areas at the same time.\n\nDeutsche Börse is aiming for overall growth in net revenue of 10 per cent p.a. on average until 2026. The reference year for this is 2022. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) should increase to an average of 11 per cent p.a. Earnings per share before the effects of purchase price allocations (cash EPS) should increase over the same period by an average of 11 per cent a year.\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n#### [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-26-0)\n\n- [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)\n- [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Overwiew of targets \"Horizon 2026\" targets\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n| in €                                                                       | Basis 2022  | Targets of<br>\"Horizon 2026' |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| Net revenue                                                                | 4.3 billion | ~ 10 % CAGR                  |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisa-<br>tion (EBITDA) | 2.5 billion | ~ 11 % CAGR                  |\n| Cash EPS                                                                   | 8.61        | ~ 11 % CAGR                  |\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Strategy and steering parameters\n\nTo achieve these targets, we are addressing the following market trends in our four operating segments.\n\n Investment Management Solutions: The increasing importance of the buyside in financial markets and the outsourcing of investment operations to central service providers, as well as higher demand for index-driven investments, ESG services and reliable data\n\n- Trading & Clearing: The shift from OTC to on-exchange trading, greater use of fixed income products in response to restrictive monetary policies, increasing demand for repo products and rising demand for digital assets\n- Fund Services: The trend towards outsourcing of fund distribution operations to boost efficiency and the increasing demand for fund data services and analytics\n- Securities Services: The strong increase in outstanding debt and rising demand for repo products and financing solutions via the capital markets as a result of the returning strong positive interest rates\n\nAdditional cyclical growth components may include higher market volatility in the Trading & Clearing segment, as well as higher long-term interest rates in Fund Services and Securities Services. In addition, targeted acquisitions may also contribute to future growth if they are strategically and financially attractive.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Growth

\"Horizon 2026\"\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nWe review our organic growth initiatives continuously. We capitalize particularly on the expansion in secular growth markets and asset classes. At the same time we always focus on the needs of our customers and technological advances. Key initiatives and growth drivers are also described in more detail in the \"Report on [opportunities\"](#page-82-0) section.\n\nCombined management report Strategy and steering parameters\n\nThe \"Report on expected [developments\" se](#page-87-0)ction describes expected developments in the 2024 financial year.\n\nAdditionally, the remuneration system for the Executive Board and executive staff has also created a number of incentives for growth in the individual business divisions. Th[e \"Remuneration report\"](#page-249-0) provides a detailed description of all targets.\n\n# Financial steering parameters\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe most important key performance indicators to manage of our economic situation are net revenue and EBITDA, since these are vital for the successful execution of our growth strategy and set incentives for profitable growth. The basis is net revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements. This consists of sales revenue, plus net treasury income from banking business and similar business, plus other operating income, less volume-related costs. One of the most important pillars of the corporate strategy, in addition to absolute growth, is the profitability of this growth. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and as such is a gauge of our operative earning power. It is a common indicator for measuring profitability. Another key financial control criterion is earnings per share before purchase price allocations (Cash EPS), since all profit and loss effects are reflected in this indicator, and it can therefore be used to measure the successful implementation of the growth strategy.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-26-0\"></span>Image /page/26/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

We increased our net revenue significantly again in 2023. We benefited from both organic growth and the acquisition of SimCorp.\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nIn the following section we look at the macroeconomic and sector-specific environment, the course of business, our earnings, the development of profitability and other financial performance indicators.\n\n# Macroeconomic and sector-specific environment\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nSecular growth factors and M&A are a core element of our strategy. We can plan them, manage them and adjust them to external circumstances. Our business performance is also influenced by macroeconomic and sector-specific factors that are beyond our direct control, however.\n\nIn 2023 these included:\n\n- Persistently high inflation, which did fall over the course of the year, but remained significantly above the central banks' target rates\n- The resulting ongoing restrictive monetary policy of central banks in the USA and Europe, and their insistence that this policy will be pursued until inflation rates approach the desired level\n- The insolvency of some US banks in mid-March and the consolidation on the Swiss banking market\n- Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine and the related sanctions and effects on global supply chains and energy supply\n- The Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 and the resulting new escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East since then\n\nIn its January 2024 estimate, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted slower global economic growth of 3.1 per cent for 2023 (2022: +3.5 per cent). It expects the euro area to grow by 0.5 per cent (2022: +3.5 per cent) and for the economy in Germany to even contract by 0.3 per cent (2022: +1.8 per cent).\n\n# Business developments\n\nThe 2023 financial year was dominated by the activities of central banks to combat high inflation rates. Inflation declined over the course of the year in both the USA and Europe, but rates were still too high, making a looser monetary policy impossible.\n\nThe ECB raised its deposit rate in several stages, most recently to 4.00 per cent in September, while the Federal Reserve increased its target range for the federal funds rate to 5.25-5.50 per cent in July and has left it at this level since. Both central banks said that any change in their restrictive monetary policies depended on the future development of key economic indicators. Higher interest rates mean on the one hand that we profit from higher net interest income in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments. At the same time there were phases in which higher interest rates increased market participants' hedging requirements and led to greater trading activity in fixed income products in the Trading & Clearing business. Central banks' withdrawal from the money market also caused higher demand for repo products. In the commodities business, trading activity returned to the power markets, with\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Image /page/27/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

This was the result of lower and more stable power prices, which reduced the margin requirements.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nVolatility on stock markets, as measured by the VSTOXX, was significantly lower than the previous year. Higher trading volumes were only seen briefly in March following the insolvency of several US banks and the consolidation on the Swiss banking market. The VSTOXX stood at an average of 18 points, which was 35 per cent lower than the average for the previous year. Trading activity in securities and equity index derivatives in the Trading & Clearing unit was correspondingly lower.\n\n# Results of operations\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the results of operations in financial year 2023 were affected significantly by both secular and cyclical growth factors. The biggest driver of year-on-year net revenue growth in the Group was a sharp rise in interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic, combined with only a moderate decline in cash deposits from our customers in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments, resulting in very strong growth in net interest income. Higher interest rates and a downwards trend in the money supply had a positive impact on the use of interest rate derivatives and repo products in the financial derivatives business within the Trading & Clearing segment. In this context the rise in the outstanding notional volume of centrally cleared overthe-counter (OTC) traded and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives had a positive influence on net revenue. In addition, lower margin requirements as a result of reduced volatility on power and gas markets, and new customer gains, increased trading volumes for power derivatives in the commodities business in the Trading & Clearing segment, which was in turn reflected in higher net revenue. The Investment Management Solutions segment profited from both continuous product demand in Governance Solutions, Corporate Solutions and ESG, and from contract renewals with customers in the Analytics business. The acquisition of SimCorp, which was fully consolidated into the\n\nGroup in the fourth quarter, also made a decisive contribution to M&A growth in this segment. In contrast to the previous year, which saw a positive one-off effect of €63 million in total in net revenue, there were no significant non-recurring effects on the revenue side in the reporting year.\n\nOur net revenue therefore increased to €5,076.6 million in the financial year 2023 (2022: €4,337.6 million). The net revenue increase of 17 per cent consisted partly of 5 per cent secular growth, which came largely from new customer gains and gains in market share, the expansion of customer relationships and product innovations. Cyclical growth effects accounted for a further 7 per cent. The global increase in interest rates deserves particular mention. Another 5 per cent comes from M&A growth in connection with the acquisition of SimCorp.\n\nOperating costs rose by 16 per cent to €–2,118.3 million in financial year 2023 (2022: €–1,822.2 million). Around 5 per cent resulted from organic cost growth, which also includes an increase in the headcount compared with the previous year, inflation effects and investments in secular growth measures. 10 per cent of the increase is due to the SimCorp acquisition effect, related transaction costs of €22 million and the costs of realising potential synergies in the new Investment Management Solutions segment of €56 million.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The result from financial investments, which is included in EBITDA, came to €–14.0 million (2022: €10.2 million). In the course of the purchase of minority interests in ISS and the bundling of expertise in our Investment Management Solutions segment, one-off adjustments to the valuation of a contingent purchase price component resulted in losses of €9 million. The decline was also due to valuation effects from minority interests.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nAmortisation, depreciation and impairment losses came to €418.4 million (2022: €355.6 million). The change stems mainly from purchase price allocations for the acquisition of SimCorp in the Investment Management Solutions segment, as well as a €25 million write-down on intangible assets at Crypto Finance AG in the Trading & Clearing segment.\n\nOur Group's financial result of €–74.1 million (2022: €–63.5 million) was mainly determined by the issue of new corporate bonds with medium and long maturities, and short-term debt instruments for a total volume of €4 billion to finance the acquisition of SimCorp. The Group's tax ratio of around 27 per cent was slightly higher than the previous year.\n\nOverall, the net profit for financial year 2023 attributable to Deutsche Börse Group shareholders was €1,724.0 million (2022: €1,494.4 million), which represents a year-on-year increase of 15 per cent. Undiluted earnings per share were €9.35 (2022: €8.14) for an average of 185.1 million shares. Earnings per share before purchase price allocations (cash EPS) stood at €9.98 (2022: €8.61).\n\nNet profit for the period attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to €72.8 million (2022: €68.8 million) and comprised mainly earnings attributable to non-controlling shareholders of EEX and ISS STOXX.\n\n# Comparison of results of operations with the forecast for 2023\n\nFor financial year 2023 we originally forecast an increase in net revenue to within a range of €4.5-4.7 billion. We increased this forecast several times over the course of the financial year, and at the time the results of the third quarter were published we were predicting net revenue, now including SimCorp, of around €5.0 billion. In line with our strategy we also anticipated an increase in secular net revenue growth of at least 5 per cent. Given the very good cyclical performance in financial year 2022, which was characterised by much higher market volatility and a global rise in interest rates, we assumed that the cyclical net revenue contribution in 2023 would be lower, or even negative. However, as inflation rates increased significantly in both the USA and Europe, the central banks moved to intervene quickly, resulting in another significant interest rate hike. Net interest income from the banking business rose accordingly in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments to a total of €702.4 million (2022: €260.0 million). In addition, the acquisition of SimCorp, which was not included in the original forecast for 2023, contributed another €198.0 million to the Group's net revenue. With net revenue of €5,076.6 million we therefore significantly exceeded our original forecast. Net revenue growth of 17 per cent includes 5 per cent secular growth. This means we also delivered on our forecast for secular net revenue growth.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Over the course of the financial year this forecast was also raised, to around €2.9 billion. Our operating costs were mainly affected by the acquisition of SimCorp and went up by 16 per cent. They include both transaction expenses and the costs to achieve potential synergies in the new Investment Management Solutions segment totalling €79 million. Despite this, EBITDA rose by 17 per cent to €2,944.3 million and so was at the upper end of our forecast.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n#### Comparison forecast 2023 with financial year 2023\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n|                                                              | Forecast 2023 €bn | Actual 2023 €m |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Net revenue                                                  | ~5.01             | 5,076.6        |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation | ~2.92             | 2,944.3        |\n\n1) Originally €4.5–4.7 billion (guidance raised over the course of the financial year) 2) Originally ~€2.6–2.8 billion (guidance raised over the course of the financial year)\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\n# Comparison of financial position with the forecast for 2023\n\nAs part of the ongoing development of our capital management we adjusted the relevant rating ratios in 2023 (see \"Capital [management\" s](#page-37-0)ection). As expected, our ratio of net debt to EBITDA of 2.19 at year-end was just below the new maximum figure of 2.25 for rating purposes, due to the acquisition of SimCorp. The ratio of free funds from operations to net debt of 36 per cent was slightly below the now minimum target of 40 per cent, as expected, which was also due to temporarily higher borrowing for the SimCorp transaction. The cash flow from operating activities was again significantly positive. Based on a dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting of €3.80 per share, the distribution quota of 40 per cent is within the range of 30 to 40 per cent communicated as part of our redeveloped capital management. The dividend of €3.60 proposed the previous year was paid as planned in May. The cash flow from operating activities was significantly positive. Investment in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of €264.0 million was not completely in line with the budget of €300 million.\n\n# Development of profitability\n\nDeutsche Börse Group's return on shareholders' equity expresses the ratio of net income after taxes to average equity available to the Group during the course of 2023. In the reporting year, it was at 19.5 per cent (2022: 18.8 per cent).\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

It is divided into the Software Solutions and the ESG & Index units.\n\nIn the Software Solutions unit we report on the activities of SimCorp, which now also includes the analytics business of Axioma. SimCorp is a renowned provider of investment management software and offers a market-leading frontto-back investment management platform. As a Software-as-a-Service-(SaaS) and Business-Process-as-a-Service-(BPaaS) player for global asset owners, asset managers and asset servicers, our open platform provides both flexibility and operating efficiency for our customers in all asset classes. In today's fastmoving markets the top priority is also a comprehensive and agile approach to portfolio and risk management. For this reason we have bundled the portfolio construction and risk management solutions from Axioma (Analytics) with our investment management platform. By combining our strengths we can make\n\nmore effective use of our respective assets and resources and offer our customers even more added value. Net revenue in this unit is made up of licensing, update and service revenue for on-premise and SaaS solutions, as well as revenue from the analytics business. Revenue from professional services activities is recognised under Other.\n\nIn the ESG & Index unit we report on both the ESG and Index business generated by our ISS STOXX subsidiary. Under the umbrella of ISS STOXX are the STOXX Index business (also comprising STOXX® and DAX® indices) as well as the four existing business units of ISS: ISS Governance, ISS ESG, ISS Corporate Solutions and ISS Market Intelligence. The combination of robust and diverse ESG and governance datasets from ISS with the all-round expertise of STOXX in producing benchmarks and customer-specific indices, as well as in index production and settlement, enables ISS STOXX to operate effectively on a global basis. Net revenue in this business is made up of ETF, exchange and other licence revenue. While ETF licence revenue depends on the volume invested in exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) based on STOXX® and DAX®, exchange licence revenue are derived mainly from the volume traded in index derivatives on STOXX and DAX indices on Eurex. By licensing sustainable index solutions that mirror the entire index product portfolio, we contribute to the ESG trend. Net revenue at ISS is made up of ESG revenue, which comprises corporate and governance solutions, ESG data, research and ESG ratings. Market intelligence activities are presented under Other.\n\nIn the financial year the Software Solutions unit of the segment profited particularly from higher net revenue thanks to new customer gains and contract renewals by existing customers, which are mainly linked to the timing of transactions. This relates both to the performance in the existing analytics business and to that of SimCorp. Net revenue from SimCorp was consolidated for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was somewhat above our original expectations due to a higher number of new contracts for software solutions. As a result of the acquisition, the segment costs were driven largely by the related transaction costs of €22 million and the costs of €56 million for realising\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>Image /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The corporate solutions offered by ISS for companies also continued to experience interest. Compared with the previous year, the exchange rate effects of a weaker US dollar on average had a slightly negative impact on net revenue.\n\nIn the Index business, lower trading activity in equity index derivatives on our derivatives exchange Eurex had an impact on Index net revenue. It declined year on year by 10 per cent. By contrast, the trend towards exchange-traded index funds and correspondingly higher investment volumes support business with ETF licences. It increased by 5 per cent compared with the previous year. Net revenue in the Index unit was therefore slightly up on the previous year. However, Index net revenue the previous year included a one-off, volumebased licence fee reimbursement of €19 million from the Trading & Clearing segment.\n\n# Trading & Clearing segment\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n#### Key indicators Trading & Clearing segment\n\n| in €m                    | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Net revenue              | 2,262.8 | 2,187.1 | 3 %    |\n| Financial<br>derivatives | 1,264.3 | 1,234.4 | 2 %    |\n| Equities                 | 471.0   | 509.0   | − 7 %  |\n| Interest<br>rates        | 397.1   | 367.9   | 8 %    |\n| Margin<br>fees           | 91.0    | 117.6   | − 23 % |\n| Other                    | 305.2   | 239.9   | 27 %   |\n| Commodities              | 565.0   | 475.5   | 19 %   |\n| Power                    | 241.5   | 183.3   | 32 %   |\n| Gas                      | 101.7   | 89.2    | 14 %   |\n| Other                    | 221.8   | 203.0   | 9 %    |\n| Cash equities            | 293.9   | 344.4   | − 15 % |\n| Trading                  | 126.5   | 176.2   | − 28 % |\n| Other                    | 167.4   | 168.2   | − 0 %  |\n| Foreign<br>exchange      | 139.6   | 132.8   | 5 %    |\n| Operating<br>costs       | − 914.6 | − 876.3 | 4 %    |\n| EBITDA                   | 1,349.4 | 1,330.8 | 1 %    |\n\nThe Trading & Clearing segment comprises four asset classes: financial derivatives, commodities, cash equities and foreign exchange. In the financial derivatives asset class, we report on the performance in the financial derivatives trading and clearing business at Eurex exchange. Performance is driven mainly by the trading activities of institutional investors and other professional market participants and depends, to a large extent, on our clients' hedging needs and market volatility. Revenue is also generated from marketing data and managing collateral.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The EEX Group operates marketplaces and clearing houses for energy and commodity products, connecting more than 800 participants around the world. The product portfolio comprises contracts on power, environmental, freight and agricultural products. The EEX Group's most important revenue drivers are the power spot and derivatives markets, and the gas markets. These include products such as green power derivatives, emissions trading and certificates of origin.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe cash equities asset class shows the development of our trading venues in the cash market (Xetra® and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange). Besides trading and clearing services income, revenue stems from the ongoing listing of companies' securities and exchange admissions, the marketing of trading data, infrastructure services and from services provided to partner exchanges.\n\nThe segment also includes the foreign exchange asset class, which reports on business performance on the trading platforms operated by our subsidiary 360T. Net revenue is generated mainly by the trading activities of institutional investors, banks and internationally active companies.\n\nUncertainty among market participants declined noticeably year on year in 2023, which was reflected in lower volatility on equities and commodities markets. Market volatility on stock markets, as measured by the VSTOXX, fell by 35 per cent. Hedging requirements fell as a result, and so trading activities in equity index derivatives were down by 9 per cent in the Financial derivatives unit. It was offset by an increase of 6 per cent in trading with interest rate derivatives due to higher interest rates. Changes in the interest rate environment also had a positive impact on the outstanding notional volume of over-the-counter (OTC) and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives in central clearing, which were up year on year by 19 per cent. Combined with the central banks' more restrictive monetary policy, repo transactions in the Financial derivatives, Other unit in particular saw strong demand from market participants and contributed €86 million to net revenue (2022: €51 million).\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty concerning the security of European gas and broader energy supplies dominated the financial year 2022, but the gas and power markets were calmer in the reporting period. Prices of the respective reference products for power and gas in the Commodities unit therefore fell significantly from their record highs in 2022. This reduced the margin required for trading in derivatives substantially, which had a distinctly positive effect on the futures markets. The trading volume in power derivatives climbed year on year by 38 per cent and in gas derivatives by 18 per cent. The unit also profited from new customer gains, which stemmed partly from the fact that centrally cleared offerings are highly competitive compared with the OTC market. Commodities, Other, reported a higher net revenue contribution from collateral management fees resulting from the significant increase in interest rates in both Europe and the USA.\n\nAs with our European competitors, in addition to a decline in market volatility, the high interest rate environment also weighed on equity trading in Cash equities. It was only towards the end of the year that key indices like the DAX picked up sharply, reaching all-time highs in some cases. This was only partly able to offset a general decline in the order book volume of 31 per cent, however. Xetra's market share as the reference market for trading in DAX shares was again over 60 per cent, as in the previous year.\n\nIn Foreign exchange we increased the average daily trading volume on our platform by 6 per cent in the reporting year, despite lower volatility in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Net revenue in this unit performed correspondingly well.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n#### Economic situation\n\n[Macroeconomic and sector-specific](#page-26-0) \n\nenvironment\n\nBusiness developments\n\n#### [Results of operations](#page-27-0)\n\n[Financial position](#page-35-0) \n\n[Net assets](#page-39-0) \n\n- [Overall assessment of the economic](#page-41-0)  position by the Executive Board [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)\n- [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Fund Services segment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n#### Key indicators Fund Services segment\n\n| in €m             | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Net revenue       | 439.9   | 375.9   | 17 %   |\n| Fund settlement   | 213.9   | 211.5   | 1 %    |\n| Fund distribution | 85.3    | 89.7    | - 5 %  |\n| Other             | 140.7   | 74.7    | 88 %   |\n| Operating costs   | - 209.8 | - 171.5 | 22 %   |\n| EBITDA            | 226.7   | 203.8   | 11 %   |\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe Fund Services segment pools order routing and settlement activity and custody volumes of mutual, exchange-traded, and alternative funds processed by Clearstream in the fund processing unit. Clients can settle and manage their entire fund portfolio across all asset classes on the Vestima® fund processing platform. The fund distribution business consists of the distribution platform at Clearstream Fund Centre. Fund Services therefore offers one of the leading fund services platforms in the European market for distribution partners, banks, asset managers and fund providers. Net revenue in this segment is largely a function of the volume and value of assets under custody and the number of orders and settlements processed. In addition, Other net revenue in the Fund Services segment includes the net interest income from the fund settlement business and net revenue from fund data management, which largely stems from the acquisition of Kneip S.A.\n\nThe financial year 2023 was challenging for the European fund industry. On the one hand, fund prices profited from higher European equities indices than in the previous year. On the other hand, higher interest rates resulted in outflows from actively managed funds. On balance, the value of assets under custody was roughly the same as the previous year. The market environment also had a slightly negative impact on the number of securities settled. Net revenue from fund settlement was therefore only slightly up on the previous year.\n\nThe fund distribution business was also faced with the same market trends described above in the financial year. New customer wins and the transfer of new customer portfolios could not fully make up for a slight decline in average fund distribution assets. Net revenue in this unit fell slightly year on year as a result.\n\nIn April 2023 we announced that Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. had received its own banking licence in Luxembourg and so was independent in the market, but will remain closely linked with Clearstream's national and international central depositories (CSD, ICSD) in order to exploit synergies between the units for the benefit of our customers. Due to the increased independence of our fund services business from the securities business, the relevant portion of the net interest income from banking business of €57 million was reclassified from Securities Services to Fund Services (Other). At the same time, the separation resulted in a transfer of net revenue of €16 million from Fund Services to Securities Services (Custody, Settlement and Other).\n\nOther net revenue also includes the fund data business of Kneip, which was consolidated in the second quarter 2022.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n### [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n#### Economic situation\n\n[Macroeconomic and sector-specific](#page-26-0) \n\nenvironment\n\nBusiness developments\n\n#### [Results of operations](#page-27-0)\n\n[Financial position](#page-35-0) \n\n[Net assets](#page-39-0) \n\n- [Overall assessment of the economic](#page-41-0)  position by the Executive Board\n- [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)\n- [Risk report](#page-63-0)\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Securities Services segment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n#### Key indicators Securities Services segment\n\n| in €m                                     | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Net revenue                               | 1,510.7 | 1,122.9 | 35 %   |\n| Custody                                   | 615.1   | 585.0   | 5 %    |\n| Settlement                                | 114.4   | 104.8   | 9 %    |\n| Net interest income from banking business | 645.5   | 260.0   | 148 %  |\n| Other                                     | 135.7   | 173.11  | – 22 % |\n| Operating costs                           | – 412.8 | – 391.2 | 6 %    |\n| EBITDA                                    | 1,092.2 | 729.5   | 50 %   |\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n1) The deconsolidation of REGIS-TR was completed on 31 March 2022 and includes a disposal gain of €50 million.\n\nOur settlement and custody activities are reported under the Securities Services segment. In providing the post-trade infrastructure for Eurobonds and other securities markets, our subsidiary Clearstream is responsible for the issuance, settlement, management, and custody of securities from 60 domestic markets worldwide, plus the international market. Net revenue in this segment is driven mainly by the volume and value of assets under custody, which determine the custody fees. The settlement business depends primarily on the number of settlement transactions processed by Clearstream via stock exchanges as well as over-the-counter (OTC). The segment also includes net interest income from banking business, which represents a significant portion of the segment's net revenue due to the steep rise in global interest rates.\n\nNet revenue in the Securities Services segment was affected most in 2023 by the monetary policy measures taken by central banks around the world in response to higher inflation. Net interest income from banking business, which in the Securities Services segment stems from cash deposits by our clients, profited significantly from higher base rates in both the USA and Europe. The volume of cash balances fell by 6 per cent, by contrast, which indicates more active liquidity management by our customers. Since the first quarter of 2023 around €90 million of the net interest income from banking business has been segregated as assets under sanctions held by us, of which €14 million relates to prior periods. This is therefore not shown in net revenue. When the fund business was spun out of Clearstream, the relevant portion of net interest income from banking business and other effects were reclassified from Securities Services to Fund Services (Other), as described in the Fund Services segment.\n\nOngoing high issuance by companies and the public sector, as well as the general increase in share prices as a result of buoyant markets, led to growth of 6 per cent in assets under custody in 2023. The principal contribution came from the year-on-year change in the volumes of debt instruments held by our national and international central securities depositories (CSD, ICSD). These also rose by 6 per cent on average. The custody unit also reports on collateral management and the securities lending business. A more restrictive monetary policy and higher interest rates caused a significant increase of 14 per cent in outstanding volume compared with the previous year. The securities settlement business also saw solid growth of 6 per cent in the financial year. The key driver in this area was an increase in the settlement of OTC securities.\n\nNet revenue the previous year included a disposal gain of some €50 million from the sale of our stake in the European transaction register REGIS-TR. This was recognised in Other net revenue.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>Image /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

Change in other cash and bank balances was affected by cash used for acquisitions, as well as cash outflows from operating activities.\n\nCash flow from operating activities was €2,482.5 million (2022:\n\n€2,141.6 million) before changes in CCP positions on the reporting date and was made up primarily of net income for the period of €1,796.8 million (2022: €1,563.2 million) and from changes in working capital.\n\nCash outflows for investing activities amounted to €3,997.2 million in 2023 (2022: €1,406.5 million) and were largely driven by the acquisition of SimCorp and fluctuations between short and long-term investments of customer funds. The acquisition of SimCorp led to a cash outflow of €3,887.3 million. Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of €264.0 million (2022: €323.5 million) was slightly below the planning framework of around €300 million and related primarily to IT and growth investments.\n\nCash inflow from financing activities was €2,206.9 million (2022: cash outflow of €951.1 million) and in addition to the dividend payment for the 2022 financial year of €661.5 million (2022: dividend for the 2021 financial year of €587.6 million), included three bonds with a nominal volume of €3,000.0 million to finance the SimCorp acquisition.\n\nCash flow for 2023, which is the sum of all inflows and outflows of cash from operating, investing and financing activities, came to €845.2 million (2022: €126.0 million) and was dominated by cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe positive cash flow from operating activities, sufficient credit lines and our flexible management and planning system meant that we were again adequately supplied with liquidity in 2023.\n\nFor further details of cash flow, see the consolidated [cash flow statement](#page-128-0) and note 21 to the consolidated [financial statements.](#page-207-0)\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

We are aiming to maintain our strong rating at Group level, which was changed to AA- after the SimCorp takeover. Furthermore, we endeavour to maintain the strong AA credit ratings of our subsidiaries Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG, in order to ensure their long-term success in securities settlement and custody. The activities of our Eurex Clearing AG subsidiary also require strong credit quality.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nTo keep these good credit ratings we aim for the following relevant key performance indicators going forward:\n\n- Net debt to EBITDA ratio: no more than 2.25\n- Free funds from operations (FFO) to net debt: at least 40 per cent\n- Interest cover ratio: at least 14\n- Tangible equity (for Clearstream Banking S.A.): at least €1,100 m\n\nWe follow the methodology of S&P Global Ratings closely when calculating these ratios.\n\n- To determine EBITDA for rating purposes, reported EBITDA is adjusted by the result from financial investments, as well as by unfunded pension obligations. EBITDA for rating purposes in 2023 was €2,970 million.\n- FFO for rating purposes is calculated by deducting interest and tax payments from EBITDA for rating purposes. FFO for rating purposes in 2023 was €2,307 million.\n- The Group's net debt for rating purposes is reconciled by first deducting 50 per cent of the hybrid bond, as well as the surplus cash as at the reporting date, from gross debt (i.e. from interest-bearing liabilities). Liabilities from operating leases and unfunded pension obligations are then added. Net debt for rating purposes in 2023 was €6,493 million.\n\n Interest expenses for rating purposes are calculated on the basis of interest expenses for financing, less interest expenses of Group entities which are also financial institutions. These include Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG. Interest expenses which are not related to our financing are not included in the calculation of interest expenses. Only 50 per cent of the hybrid bonds are counted towards interest expenses. Interest expenses for rating purposes in 2023 came to €86 million.\n\nThe following table \"Relevant parameters\" illustrates our calculation methodology and shows the values for the reporting year.\n\n#### Relevant parameters\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n|                                                                        |    | Target figures | 2023  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|----------------|-------|\n| Net debt / EBITDA                                                      |    | ≤ 2.25         | 2.19  |\n| Free funds from operations (FFO) / net debt                            | %  | ≥ 40           | 36    |\n| Interest coverage ratio                                                |    | ≥ 14           | 35    |\n| Tangible equity of Clearstream Banking S.A.

Clearstream Banking S.A. achieved this during the year under review, with a figure of €1,648 million.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nS&P Global Ratings bases the calculation of key performance indicators on the corresponding weighted average of the reported or expected results of the previous, the current and the following reporting period. To ensure the transparency of the key performance indicators, we report them based on the current reporting period.\n\n# Dividends and share buy-backs\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nWe aim to distribute dividends equivalent to between 30 and 40 per cent of net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders. Within this range, we manage the actual payout ratio mainly in relation to our business performance and based on continuity considerations. In addition, we plan to invest the remaining available funds primarily in our external development. Should the Group not be able to invest these funds, additional distributions, particularly in the form of share buy-backs, would be another possible use for them.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting we will be proposing to pay a dividend of €3.80 per no-par value share for the financial year 2023 (2022: €3.60). This dividend is equivalent to a distribution ratio of 40 per cent of net profit for the period attributable our shareholders. Given 185.1 million no-par shares bearing dividend rights, this would result in a total dividend payment of €703.4 million (2022: €661.6 million). The number of shares with dividend rights is produced by deducting 4.9 million treasury shares from our ordinary share capital of 190.0 million shares.\n\nIn November 2023 we announced a share buy-back programme for 2024 on the basis of the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2019. Company shares are to be bought back for a total cost of up to €300.0 million (without incidental expenses) in the period to 3 May 2024.\n\n# Credit ratings\n\n#### Credit ratings\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n|                              | Long-term | Short-term |\n|------------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Deutsche<br>Börse<br>AG      |           |            |\n| S&P<br>Global<br>Ratings     | AA–       | A–1+       |\n| Clearstream<br>Banking S.A.  |           |            |\n| Fitch Ratings                | AA        | F1+        |\n| S&P<br>Global<br>Ratings     | AA        | A–1+       |\n| Clearstream<br>Banking<br>AG |           |            |\n| S&P<br>Global<br>Ratings     | AA        | A–1+       |\n\nOur credit quality is reviewed regularly by S&P Global Ratings, while Clearstream Banking S.A. is rated by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings, and Clearstream Banking AG by S&P Global Ratings.\n\nOn 21 December 2023, Fitch Ratings affirmed the AA credit rating of Clearstream Banking S.A. with a stable outlook.

After the transaction and the related additional borrowing were completed on 20 September 2023 it then downgraded the credit rating from AA to AA-, also as expected. This did not affect the credit ratings for Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. S&P Global Ratings confirmed its AA- credit rating for Deutsche Börse AG and its AA credit rating for Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. on 29 January 2024. Deutsche Börse AG's rating reflects the assumption that the Group will continue its growth strategy. Clearstream Banking S.A.'s rating reflects its strong risk management, minimal debt levels and strong position on the international capital markets – especially through its international custody and transaction business.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\n# Net assets\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nSignificant changes to net assets are described below.

The increase in non-current assets resulted mainly from the SimCorp acquisition, which is reflected in higher intangible assets, and from exchange rate-related fluctuations in goodwill. The decline in current assets was particularly due to the volatility of restricted bank balances and financial instruments of the central counterparties at the reporting date.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Economic situation\n\nGroup equity rose by 11 per cent compared with the previous year. This was due mainly to the net profit for the reporting year 2023, less the dividend payment for the previous financial year 2022.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group invested a total of €264.0 million in the reporting year (2022: €323.5 million) in intangible assets and property plant and equipment (capital expenditure, CapEx), mainly in connection with IT and growth investments.\n\n# Working capital\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nWorking capital comprises current assets less current liabilities, excluding technical closing-date items. Current assets, excluding technical closing-date items, amounted to €2,298.9 million (2022: €2,588.6 million). As Deutsche Börse Group collects fees for most of its services on a monthly basis, the trade receivables of €1,832.2 million included in current assets as at 31 December 2023 were relatively low compared with net revenue (31 December 2022: €2,289.2 million). The decline in trade receivables was particularly due to open items as at the reporting date from the market volatility of the sports markets within EEX Group, which were offset by a decline in trade payables at the same time. The current liabilities of the Group, excluding technical closingdate items, amounted to €2,312.6 million (2022: €2,763.3 million, excluding technical closing-date items). For this reason the Group had slightly negative working capital of €13.8 million at year-end (2022: negative working capital of €174.7 million).\n\n# Technical closing-date items\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe \"financial instruments of the central counterparties\" item relates to the function performed by Eurex Clearing AG, European Commodity Clearing AG as well as Nodal Clear, LLC. Since they act as the central counterparties for Deutsche Börse Group's various markets, their financial instruments are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value. The financial instruments of the central counterparties are described in detail in the section \"Risk [report\" o](#page-63-0)f the combined management report and i[n notes](#page-163-0) 12 and [24](#page-211-0) to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nMarket participants linked to the Group's clearing houses partly provide collateral in the form of cash deposits, which are subject to daily adjustments. The cash deposits are generally invested on a secured basis overnight by the central counterparties and reported in the balance sheet under \"restricted bank balances\". The total value of cash deposits at the reporting dates relevant for the reporting period (31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December) varied between €46.8 billion and €58.9 billion (2022: €53.4 billion and €119.5 billion).\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-41-0\"></span>Image /page/41/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The resulting rapid interest rate rises boosted market participants' need for hedging with interest rate derivatives, but also had a significantly positive effect on growth in net interest income from banking business in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments. Fears of recession and uncertainty concerning the future direction of interest rates subdued share trading and also led to outflows from fund assets under management. It was only as inflation rates began to recede sustainably and with the prospect of an end to further interest rate increases that equity indices picked up again strongly in the fourth quarter of 2023. Compared with the record highs in 2022, price volatility and the related volumes of capital committed to power and gas markets declined significantly. Trading activity rose accordingly, particularly in power derivatives. With net revenue of €5,076.6 million, we achieved year-on-year growth of 17 per cent for the Group, which was above our expectations. Of the total, 5 per cent is due to secular growth and 7 per cent to cyclical growth effects. The acquisition of SimCorp, which was consolidated in the Group for the first time in the fourth quarter of the financial year, contributed another 5 per cent from M&A growth. The increase in costs was also mostly related to the acquisition of SimCorp, and included extraordinary transaction expenses and the costs of realising potential synergies (costs to achieve) in the new Investment Management Solutions segment totalling €79 million. Earnings before interest, taxes,\n\ndepreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased year on year by 17 per cent to €2,944.3 million, which was slightly higher than our expectations in view of the effects mentioned above. Additional borrowing to finance the acquisition also affected the financial result, which changed accordingly to €74.0 million.\n\nOn this basis we consider that Deutsche Börse Group's financial position remained very solid during the reporting period. As in prior years we reported strong cash flow from operating activities. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA, which is important for the credit rating, came to 2.19 and was thus below the now applicable limit of 2.25.\n\nAs in recent years, we are again offering shareholders a higher dividend for the 2023 financial year. The proposed dividend is €3.80 (2022: €3.60), representing a year-on-year increase of 6 per cent. We also decided in 2023 to carry out a share buyback programme with a volume of €300 million, which began on 2 January 2024 and should be completed by 3 May 2024 at the latest. The proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit reflects treasury shares held directly or indirectly by the company that do not carry dividend rights under section 71b Aktiengesetz (AktG, the German Stock Corporation Act). The number of shares carrying dividend rights can change until the Annual General Meeting through the repurchase or sale of further treasury shares.

A detailed overview of all GRI indicators (GRI index) is available on our homepage. Further detailed information that is referenced in this report does not form part of the combined management report itself unless explicitly stated. To the extent that no explicit statements are made for the parent company, qualitative information within the meaning of the combined management report applies equally to Deutsche Börse Group and the parent company Deutsche Börse AG. In some cases, quantitative details concerning the parent entity and subsidiaries consolidated for the first time are disclosed separately.\n\nIn the course of our materiality analysis we continuously determine and evaluate the expectations and requirements of relevant internal and external\n\nstakeholders. In the year 2023 we surveyed several internal stakeholders in order to validate the results from 2021. This did not give rise to any changes.\n\n# ESG governance\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nSustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche Börse Group. It is therefore an essential element of corporate governance at the level of both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sustainability matters at Deutsche Börse Group. It was supported in the reporting year by the interdisciplinary Group Sustainability Board, which is chaired by the CFO. The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It deals with company initiatives relating to environmental, social and governance topics (ESG). This includes advising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate planning and controlling. The Group Sustainability Board has been replaced by the Group Sustainability Committee as of 1 January 2024. The Group Sustainability Committee is the new central management unit for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and supports and advises the Executive Board on all aspects of sustainability. The Group Sustainability Committee is intended to ensure the implementation of effective ESG practices in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-44-0\"></span>Image /page/44/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Responsibility for ESG reporting was transferred from Group ESG Strategy to the section Sustainability Reporting, which is part of the CFO function, on 1 October 2023.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nAt the Supervisory Board level, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee has dealt, in particular, with sustainable corporate governance and activities in the field of ESG at Deutsche Börse Group since 2021. In addition to embedding ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this way, it is particularly important for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board committees, especially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination Committee. Current, relevant sustainability aspects also form part of the training programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and are dealt with in workshops and seminars.\n\n# ESG targets\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe following non-financial performance indicators have been identified as relevant for management and are divided according to the outcome dimensions of our value creation process, employees, customers and markets and social environment (see Corporate purpose and [value creation](#page-20-0) process):\n\n#### Non-financial key performance indicators\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n| Key performance<br>indicators            | Targets          | Actuals 2023    |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Employees                                |                  |                 |\n| Employee satisfaction1                   | >71.5%           | 73%             |\n| Share of women in leadership positions2  | >23%             | 23%             |\n| Customer and markets                     |                  |                 |\n| System availability (customer-facing IT) | >99.5%           | >99.9%          |\n| Social environment                       |                  |                 |\n| ESG ratings                              | >90th percentile | 98th percentile |\n\n1) Result without SimCorp\n\n2) Group target for senior management\n\nEmployees: We use two key performance indicators for measuring employeerelated factors: The first indicator is used to measure employee satisfaction on an annual basis and to take action based on the results.

Together with our core corporate values of performance, reliability, integrity, openness and responsibility they define our corporate culture. At the same time they form the basis of our commercial success. For this reason we have an active People strategy, promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and systematically measure how attractive we are as an employer.\n\n# People strategy\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nWorking in its four strategic dimensions (Attract, Develop, Engage, Lead), our People strategy aims to attract the best talents, to develop them, to enable them to engage effectively and to continue their personal and professional development. These four dimensions form the foundation for four multi-year initiatives. With these initiatives we want to create a flexible, sustainable working environment that offers our employees excellent working conditions.\n\nWe successfully put our hybrid working model into practice in the framework of Trust@Work. With this hybrid working model that spans teams and projects we create the conditions for effective cooperation and focus particularly on important moments at work, mental health and well-being. This process is backed up by DigitizeHR, an initiative to fully digitise our operating HR processes and provide actionable analytics. MissionGrow! is our initiative for improving development opportunities for our employees. We have revised our career model to increase transparency, offer equality of opportunity and create a culture of continuous feedback. Based on the results of our People Survey 2021 and 2022, the first improvements have been implemented and additional focus areas for the WorkFlows initiative defined, in order to make Groupwide corporate processes more efficient and user-friendly as well as to implement dedicated measures based on notable results. The initiatives were launched in 2020 for a period of three years. Most of the milestones have been reached, and the remaining topics were transferred to the line organisation as part of continuous improvement.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/46/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In this spirit, we are continuously working on the implementation of our talent attraction strategy by considering the market situation and adjust it accordingly. Our strategy conveys the message that with us new talents become part of an international team that drives positive change and is characterised by curiosity and an open mind. We welcome people from all different origins, age groups and personal backgrounds, and want to give them the opportunity to grow with us. We achieve this via a number of employee development programmes. Internal training courses – on cloud technology, digital infrastructure and agile development methods, for example – are the logical continuation of these programmes and form the basis for structured retraining and further training. They are supplemented by mentoring programmes and personality-related training courses; on communication, taking responsibility or becoming a team player, for instance.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nWe expanded our existing range of development programmes in 2023. In particular we introduced activities for a structured programme intended to increase mobility between countries, locations and legal entities. In addition, we continued the LightUp! events for managers that were launched the previous year, which focus on refreshing competences and on expectations of modern managers. Taken as a whole, these formats strengthen our people development offering.\n\nFurther information about participation by employees and managers in training and development measures can be found [in the table \"Key](#page-50-0) data on Deutsche Börse Group's workforce as of 31 December 2023\".\n\nIn our annual staff survey, the People Survey, which also deals with subjects such as pervading strategy and teamwork, we got very satisfying marks for our attractiveness as an employer (82 per cent approval). The largely positive feedback underlines how Deutsche Börse Group stands for a working environment which makes it easy for staff to reconcile their career and their private life, with flexible models for working hours, allowances for childcare, part-time degree courses and part-time work. We also measure the average value of the two topics Strategic Alignment & Organisational Framework and Team Effectiveness & Collaboration annually. Our goal is to achieve an average value of more than 71.5 per cent in both topics. In 2023 we achieved a value of 73.0 per cent (without SimCorp).

At our 56 locations around the world we have over 14,000 employees from the most diverse cultural backgrounds. Our diversity is not only apparent in the origins of our employees, however, but also in the breadth of professional expertise and the many other differences that make up each individual personality in our team.\n\nWe are convinced that this diversity is decisive for our global success. We see the wealth of individual characteristics and strengths as the key to fulfilling our corporate purpose. For this reason, we strive to create an inclusive working environment in which everyone feels welcome and where they feel comfortable about contributing their ideas.\n\nWe are a signatory of th[e \"Diversity Charter\"](https://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/en/) and [\"Women's Empowerment](https://www.weps.org/)  [Principles](https://www.weps.org/) (WEPs)\" and acknowledge our corporate social responsibility as expressed in the Code of Conduct that applies throughout the Group. A public Diversity, Equity & Inclusion statement, in which we express our appreciation of all present and future employees and a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion policy constitute further elements of our diverse and inclusive working environment. We were also certified as a Fair Pay Analyst in 2023 for our successful endeavours to pay our staff regardless of their gender.\n\nWe do not tolerate any discrimination, whether on the grounds of age, gender, physical or health disability, sexual orientation and identity, ethnic origin or belief and irrespective of whether behaviour among employees or the placing of orders with third parties is concerned. We have therefore implemented processes designed to take equal treatment into consideration in the selection of staff and enable the Group to take prompt action whenever discrimination is suspected. Relevant cases were reported in 2023 either by our whistleblower system, to the respective Line Management or directly to the local Human Resources Department. All relevant cases requiring further remedial actions have\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The members of our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion council represent our global workforce and our different minorities; they inform and advise the Executive Board on initiatives and act as trusted third parties and personal contacts for the employees. The council strives to ensure that our everyday workspace continues to be a place where everyone feels appreciated and gets the opportunities they deserve. We also introduced the function of Chief Sustainability and Chief Diversity Officer in our Group in 2023, who is responsible for our diversity, equity and inclusion endeavours. The responsibilities of this dual role complement one another and underline the priority that we at Deutsche Börse Group give to all dimensions of environmental, social and governance policy. It remains a particular aspiration for us to increase the proportion of women at the management level. Our various programmes for promoting talent, and so also for qualifying women for management positions, contribute to the long-term advancement of women. In addition to our programmes, other measures include focused succession planning, as well as internal and external mentoring and training programmes. Exchanges among female colleagues are encouraged by an internal women's network. We provided special support for applicants and our employees directly and indirectly affected by the military conflict in Ukraine. We are also committed to providing better opportunities for underprivileged people through dedicated programmes. For details regarding targets for female quotas, please refer to the section entitled [\"Corporate governance statement](#page-111-0) – target figures for the proportion of [female executives beneath the](#page-111-0) Executive Board\" and th[e \"Com](#page-88-0)parison [with the forecast for](#page-88-0) 2023\".\n\nThe results of our staff survey on diversity, equity and inclusion confirm that our employees feel that they are welcome here with us (90 per cent positive) and that they are treated fairly and respectfully by their managers (94 per cent positive), regardless of their ethnic origins, their gender or their cultural background. This positive feedback reaffirms our intention to keep expanding our programme for diversity, equity and inclusion, in the spirit of creating a fully inclusive working environment.\n\n# Staff developments\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, Deutsche Börse Group employed a total of 14,502 staff (women: 5,836; men: 8,643; other: 23; 31 December 2022: 11,078), drawn from 131 nationalities at 56 locations worldwide.

Our products and services contribute to increase transparency for market participants and to enable them to price in and integrate market developments, changes and transformations. In this way, we enable our customers and market participants to make better-informed decisions.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n# System stability and availability\n\nThe availability of our customer-facing trading systems is an important indicator of the overall quality that we achieve when developing and operating our systems. Deutsche Börse AG operates its trading systems for the cash and derivatives markets as redundant server installations, distributed across two geographically separated, secure data centres. Should a trading system fail, it would be operated from the second data centre. Together with clients, Deutsche Börse successfully simulated this scenario again in 2023 – as well as the impact of local disruptions – within the scope of the FIA Test (the annual disaster recovery exercise conducted by the Futures Industry Association). This kind of disaster recovery test was also carried out after every larger software release. Other disruptions, such as technology malfunctions at individual workstations or personnel failures, were also tested.\n\nOur multiple testing of software, its verified roll-out and the seamless monitoring of servers, networks and applications has brought availability up to over 99.9 per cent in the reporting year. The plan is to introduce further technical measures to gain greater independence from providers of critical infrastructure technologies.\n\n# Information security\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nSecurity in all its facets has a high priority and is a strong focus of our Group. This does not just involve ensuring the availability of all services, but also the confidentiality of all information and the integrity of data. The range of threats increased again in 2023, not least due to geopolitical challenges and additional conflicts. Deutsche Börse Group is faced with the reality that cyber threats continuously adopt the latest technologies and so develop at high speed, and we adapt our systems and processes accordingly. Global regulation also continues to develop in order to meet the challenges. Deutsche Börse Group uses an extensive framework of policies and processes, supplemented by specific controls and technical abilities based on the international security standard ISO/IEC 27001.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group invests continuously in new security solutions, processes and projects, in order to address effectively the growing number of threats with state-of-the-art security technologies. Security measures are implemented at several levels (defence-in-depth), to reduce the risk of security incidents from individual error sources. To strengthen abilities to defend and protect against cyber-attacks, regular improvements are made to cyber-analysis, cyber-security automation, identification and prevention of attacks, vulnerability management, penetration testing and professional \"white hat\" attacks on the Group's own IT.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-53-0\"></span>Image /page/53/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

A key building block is the networking and reconnaissance of attack vectors in order to counter them without delay. This takes place via both digital interfaces and intensive exchanges as a member of national associations (Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics, CSSA), trade associations (World Federation of Exchanges, GLEX) and international networks (Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, FS-ISAC and the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative, CIISI-EU) which contribute significantly towards a forward-looking stance vis-à-vis cyber threats, and the development of strategies to fend off such threats. Furthermore, we are a member of the ECB's Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European financial infrastructures (ECRB) and are in close contact with the DAX40 CERT/CISO working group and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe information security function checks that the information security and information security risk management requirements are adhered to; it also monitors the systemic integration of, and compliance with, security policies in the context of product and application development. We operate a situation centre (Cyber Emergency Response Team, CERT) to detect and assess threats from cybercrime at an early stage, and coordinate risk mitigation measures in cooperation with the business units. The security of Deutsche Börse Group is also defined via its ecosystem of suppliers and outsourcing partners, which are integrated into the security concept. These partners are also benchmarked against Group requirements and integrated into the risk assessment.\n\nThe effectiveness of physical security is also permanently reviewed, with similar assessments and measures. A new security system was implemented in the offices at the individual locations around the world in 2023.\n\nFor a description of the risks in connection with information security we refer to the section in the chapt[er \"Risk report\".](#page-63-0) \n\n# ESG products\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe Deutsche Börse Group can increase its information transparency for investors, founders, asset managers and market participants, but also for external observers, by including ESG aspects in its product portfolio – be it by integrating ESG ratings, data and/or analysis, or by reporting data on trading volumes for securities, derivatives, renewable energies and/or commodities. For an overview of our ESG products, we refer to the GRI [index.](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/responsibility/sustainability/esg-reporting-ratings/gri) \n\n# Compliance\n\nResponsible business operations imply adherence to laws and regulations; they are also based on the principle of integrity and ethically irreproachable conduct at all times. We have implemented a compliance management system (CMS), which aims to prevent misconduct and avoid liability and reputational risks for the Deutsche Börse Group, its legal representatives, executives and staff. Beyond business-related and regulatory compliance requirements, the focus is on continuously strengthening compliance awareness throughout the Group.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

It is communicated to all employees in the Group and is available on the internet and intranet sites. Our code of business conduct summarises our core values and principles, which are intended to act as support for decision-making and enforce market integrity, transparency, efficiency and security. As a member of the AG Global Compact, Deutsche Börse AG is also committed to its principles, notably to support human and labour rights, to protect the environment and to work against corruption in all its forms, which includes extortion and bribery.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\nObjectivity and integrity are the guiding principles for employees of Deutsche Börse Group. Our management is fully aware of their function as role models and the importance of the \"tone from the top\", which makes it possible to draw the attention of every individual employee towards managing compliance risks, both within the Group and among market participants. In order to sustainably anchor these guiding principles, and to prevent the Group and its staff from legal sanctions and reputational damage, Group Compliance has implemented risk-based compliance and preventive measures.\n\n## Compliance management system\n\nAn effective compliance management system (CMS) constitutes an indispensable element of good corporate governance. The Group Compliance function manages the CMS as a second line of defence function and ensures compliance with legislation, regulations and internal rules, and promotes best practice within the Group. In addition, the Group Compliance function monitors, controls and implements risk-based measures to mitigate risks with negative impacts (e.g. direct or indirect financial losses, regulatory penalties or reputational damage). On this basis the CMS provides the foundation for sustainable risk transparency; specifically, it facilitates the reduction of compliance risks in the areas of money laundering/terrorism financing, criminal offences, data protection, corruption, market manipulation, conflicts of interest and insider trading, as well as monitoring of requirements concerning financial sanctions and embargoes.\n\nThe appropriateness and effectiveness of the CMS are evaluated at least once a year on the basis of the individual CMS elements. The results are then presented to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG. The CMS elements particularly comprise:\n\n- Compliance risk analyses Identified and assessed risks provide the basis for determining the scope and focus of compliance activities and the management of the compliance risk profile.\n- Policies Compliance requirements that are regularly updated in accordance with applicable legislation, regulations and defined compliance targets.\n- Controls Regular and ad hoc controls are carried out to detect any compliance deficits.\n- Training Creation of a compliance mindset and appreciation by means of compliance training.\n- Reporting Regular and ad hoc reporting to the relevant stakeholders.\n- Internal & external audits Independent and objective review of the CMS in terms of its suitability and effectiveness, and identification of improvement potential.\n- Ongoing development of the CMS Projects and internal initiatives for the continuous development of the CMS.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

When determining the focus and improvements of the CMS, we are guided by applicable prudential legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as by the recommendations of internationally accepted standards. Based on these standards, Group Compliance identifies fields of action and measures to continuously adapt the CMS to changing requirements.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n# Compliance organisational structure\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG. Compliance reporting comprises the relevant compliance risks in the context of the compliance mandate, as well as other compliancerelevant information and activities.\n\nThe Group Compliance Committee is an interdisciplinary committee at management level that aims to support and advise the respective Executive Boards and Compliance functions within Deutsche Börse Group on compliance topics. Committee members are the senior managers of the business units, the Chief Compliance Officers and representatives of the relevant control functions for the Group as a whole.\n\nIn the context of the current geopolitical events and the resulting potential economic and political consequences, Deutsche Börse continues to analyse which risks could have an impact in the individual business areas and which measures need to be taken and implemented.\n\n## Data protection/protection of personal data\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nData protection serves to protect the personal data of individuals. It aims to protect the privacy of employees and customers, but also of third parties, such as service providers. To guarantee data protection, personal data may only be processed on the basis of a corresponding justification and in compliance with the principles of data protection.\n\nWe again took steps to comply with data protection legislation in 2023, particularly in terms of appropriate and transparent processing of personal data, and continuously developed our processes. The Executive Board appointed a data protection officer years ago and established the Group data protection function, which helps to ensure compliance with the data protection framework, itself based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation. It also drives the sustained development of a data protection culture in Deutsche Börse Group, which takes current commercial requirements and legislative changes into account by means of training courses and awareness activities.\n\nThe Group data protection function assumes the role of data protection officer for Group companies, insofar as this is required by law and it has been given the mandate as a central function. In this regard, the data protection function in-forms and advises the individual legal entities on data protection requirements. The data protection function also serves as a contact for data protection authorities, and supports the business units in their assessments of the data protection risks.\n\nThe data protection function's framework, as a second line of defence, is incorporated into the structure of our compliance safeguards. The data protection officers inform the respective Executive Boards annually and in an eventrelated manner on the status of data protection within the company and the measures to expand the data protection framework.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-56-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n[Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-26-0)\n\n#### Non-financial declaration\n\n[ESG governance](#page-43-0)\n\n[ESG targets](#page-44-0) \n\n[Employees](#page-45-0) \n\n[Customers and markets](#page-52-0) \n\n#### Social environment\n\n[EU Taxonomy](#page-58-0)\n\n[Risk report](#page-63-0) \n\n- [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n- [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n- [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n- [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Key figures: corruption and data protection\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n|                                                                                             |   | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|-------|-------|\n| Corruption                                                                                  |   |       |       |\n| Prosecuted corruption cases                                                                 |   | 0     | 0     |\n| Percentage of business units for which measures have been taken to address corruption risks | % | 100   | 100   |\n| Number of employees who were trained in ABC measures (anti-bribery and corruption)1,2       |   | 8,181 | 1,563 |\n| Data protection                                                                             |   |       |       |\n| Number of justified customer complaints relating to data protection                         |   | 0     | 0     |\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n1) Employees of Deutsche Börse Group must repeat the web-based ABC training every two years. The training was revised in 2023, which is why the number of participants is significantly higher than in 2022. 2) The information is based on the employees that are connected to the central HR system. Group companies that are not connected to the HR system carry out compliance training on their own responsibility and not via the Group function.\n\n# Social environment\n\nOur value creation also goes far beyond the areas of direct concern to us as a company. Accordingly, for example, the environment, human rights issues in the supply chain or participation in financial centre initiatives fall within our focus.\n\n# Environment\n\nWe endeavour to contribute to the Paris Climate Agreement with our business activities. In 2023, we have adapted our climate targets in line with current market standards towards a long-term climate strategy. This comprises nearterm targets by 2030 and a net-zero target by 2045:\n\n# Near-term targets:\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n- Scope 1 & 2: Deutsche Börse aims to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by 2030 from a 2022 base year\n- Scope 3: Deutsche Börse targets to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, business travel and employee commuting by 42% by 2030 from a 2022 base year\n- Scope 3 Supplier Engagement: Deutsche Börse aims that 87% of its suppliers, as measured by its emissions of purchased goods and services and capital goods, will have science-based targets by 2028\n\n# Net-zero target:\n\n Scope 1, 2 & 3: Deutsche Börse strives to reduce its absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% by 2045, from a 2022 base year\n\nThese targets are to be validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in the first quarter of 2024. To achieve our targets, we will develop a transition plan in 2024, which will contain dedicated emission reduction measures.\n\nWe provide our stakeholders with transparent information about our environmental performance in our annual GRI Index. Last year we also published a progress report on the basis of the TCFD recommendations. This report summarises the information about how we deal with climate risks and opportunities and our science-based targets.

At the same time, we permanently and systematically seek dialogue with our internal and external stakeholders and thus determine the focus topics of our work. To do so we use investor days, employee and customer surveys, discussions with rating agencies and society at large, involvement in various initiatives and our regular materiality analysis, in which we ask our stakeholders about our company and our impact on society and the economy. Regarding the initiatives that we support, we refer to ou[r homepage.](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/responsibility/sustainability/materiality-analysis) \n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n# ESG ratings\n\nWe use this external validation of our own ESG efforts through ESG ratings to continuously improve and sharpen our ESG profile. Insights from the ESG rating processes were also factored into our materiality analysis. The following rating agencies measure the sustainability performance of Deutsche Börse AG every year and play a particularly important role for us:\n\n#### ESG Ratings\n\n| Rating<br>agency | Rating |      |\n|------------------|--------|------|\n|                  | 2023   | 2022 |\n| S&P              | 70     | 79   |\n| Sustainalytics   | 83     | 82   |\n| MSCI             | AAA    | AAA  |\n\n# Human rights\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nOur management approach for a Group-wide commitment to sustainability includes respect for human rights both in the supply chain and within the company. We have therefore published a Deutsche Börse Group Statement on Human Rights. It relates to Deutsche Börse AG and its subsidiaries and covers our relationships with employees, suppliers and customers. For this purpose, Deutsche Börse AG and centrally-serviced Group companies require their suppliers to comply with ethical standards of conduct in their dealings with employees, suppliers, customer and other third parties. This takes place in accordance with our Code of conduct for suppliers, the Code of business conduct and the policy statement on the human rights strategy of Deutsche Börse AG in accordance with section 6 (2) Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG).\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>Image /page/58/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that categorises economic activities as environmentally sustainable in terms of the following six environmental objectives:\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n- Climate change mitigation\n- Climate change adaptation\n- Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n\nCombined management report Non-financial declaration\n\n- Transition to a circular economy\n- Pollution prevention and control\n- Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nArticle 8 of the EU Taxonomy defines the disclosure requirements for the proportion of turnover, capital and operating expenditure derived from and related to environmentally sustainable economic activities as well as energy production from nuclear energy and fossil gas.\n\n# Principles for determining the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible environmentally sustainable economic activities\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe Taxonomy-eligible turnover is divided by the Group's total turnover to determine the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible turnover. The denominator is based on sales in accordance with IAS 1.82(a) as presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For further details, please refer to [note 4, table \"Composition](#page-145-0) of our net revenues\" (Part 1-2)\"), column \"Net revenues 2023\").\n\nFor financial year 2023 we have not identified any Taxonomy-eligible turnover within the scope of application of the delegated acts.\n\n# Capital and operating expenditure\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe proportion of Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure (CapEx) is determined by dividing the Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure by total additions to intangible and tangible assets. For further details, se[e note 10, table \"Intangible](#page-155-0)  [assets\" a](#page-155-0)nd note [11, table \"Property, plant](#page-162-0) and equipment (incl. right-of-use [assets\\)\", lines](#page-162-0) \"Additions\".\n\nLikewise, to determine the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure (OpEx), the Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure is divided by the Group's total operating expenditure. For further details, see note [6, table](#page-148-0)  \"Composition of other [operating expenses\".](#page-148-0) \n\nFor financial year 2023 we have not identified any Taxonomy-eligible capital or operating expenditure within the scope of application of the delegated acts.\n\nEnergy production from nuclear energy and fossil gas\n\nFor financial year 2023 we have not identified any economic activities at Deutsche Börse Group involving energy production from nuclear energy and fossil gas.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In key aspects its risk profile therefore represents risks at the level of its subsidiaries, which include providers of strictly regulated financial market infrastructure. Risk at Deutsche Börse Group is expressed in terms of required economic capital (REC), which is calculated on the basis of assumptions. Required economic capital as at 31 December 2023 amounted to €1,619 million (2022: €1,754 million). It is covered by a risk-bearing capacity, derived from shareholders' equity, of €8,898 million (2022: €7,742 million). The risks of Deutsche Börse Group are therefore covered by its risk-bearing capacity. Looking at the Group companies it can be said that DBG has a conservative risk profile and that it monitors and limits risks closely.\n\nThe required economic capital is made up of operational risks, financial risks (including credit and market risks), business risks and pension risks. The following chart shows the specific breakdown of risks as at 31 December 2023:\n\nImage /page/63/Figure/23 description: The image is a donut chart showing the distribution of different types of risks. The chart includes the following categories: Pension risk (5%), Market risk (9%), Credit risk (28%), and Operational risks (58%). The values associated with each risk are: Pension risk (86, +57 year on year), Market risk (143, +29 year on year), Credit risk (457, +27 year on year), and Operational risks (933, -248 year on year).\n\nThere have been no material changes in the DBG risk profile compared to the previous year. The reduction of the required economic capital is partly due to a revision of scenarios at Clearstream Securities Services (€-81 million) and for non-banks. Including Crypto Finance in full caused credit risk to increase by €27 million and market price risk by €10 million. Methodological changes resulted in an increase of €57 million in the pension risk.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-64-0\"></span>Image /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

DBAG itself is not a bank and has not been classified as a financial holding company by the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, so it is not itself subject to supervision as a bank. DBAG aligns its risk management with the standards for companies, and parts of the standards for banks are applied if they are appropriate. In view of their economic importance we particularly discuss the banks in our Group, namely Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. and Eurex Clearing AG. Further details are also provided for European Commodity Clearing AG as a central counterparty (CCP) according to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).\n\n# Material developments compared with the previous year\n\nClearstream Fund Centre S.A., a separate legal entity, was established at the beginning of 2023 for the fund business of Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG. This is a subsidiary of DBAG. Business activities in the fund business are reported in the Fund Services segment. Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. is a bank and must meet CRR requirements in this respect. It is also regulated under MiFID, and one of its main purposes is to support customers to meet their regulatory fund requirements in accordance with MiFID.\n\nDBAG acquired 100 per cent of the shares in SimCorp A/S in late October after a public takeover offer. The risks related to the acquisition of SimCorp have been examined and as at 31 December 2023 it was found that it does not materially change the overall risk profile of Deutsche Börse Group. The current integration of Axioma with SimCorp entails an increased operational risk in connection with the successful completion of the integration project.\n\nClearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. have to meet combined capital requirements (Complementary Approach Ratio) as from April 2023. These result from the capital requirements of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR, for details see \"Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\").\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. remained affected in 2023 by Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, which required a considerable amount of management attention. Developments continue to be monitored closely in order to analyse the various impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war. The main focus was on adapting processes and controls to the countermeasures that Russia has taken in response to western sanctions. Clearstream Banking S.A. started to reduce its customer relations to Russian state actors massively following the first invasion of Ukraine in 2014.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In addition, they rely on the banking processes to ensure the adequacy of capital and liquidity (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, ICAAP, and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process, ILAAP), which comprise internal stress tests and constitute a core component of the risk management approach.\n\nOur banks Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. and Eurex Clearing AG calculate their regulatory capital requirements in line with the applicable CRR, which conforms to the first pillar of the Basel Standard for Bank Supervision. Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG meet the CRR requirements and also the capital requirements of European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Clearstream companies must also comply with the Minimum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL). The central securities depositories Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. are also subject to the Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR). For details see the section \"Regulatory [capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\".](#page-76-0) \n\nEurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG are authorised as central coun-terparties (CCPs) and are subject to the requirements of EMIR and the Recovery and Resolution of Central Counterparties (CCP RR) regime. By contrast, recovery and resolution plans for the Clearstream companies and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. are ensured by their compliance with the EU Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD).\n\nIn addition to the European requirements, there are national requirements of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management (MaRisk) issued by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin), requirements of the German Banking Act as well as the circular 12/552 issued by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Luxembourg (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, CSSF) to be mentioned.\n\nOther subsidiaries have different licences to provide services in the financial industry, which means they too are governed by extensive statutory requirements, including for risk management. Clearstream Banking AG maintains a central register within the meaning of the Electronic Securities Act (eWPG), for example. Eurex Repo GmbH and 360 Treasury Systems AG are also subject to specific provisions applicable to investment firms. Nodal Clear, LLC is a Derivatives Clearing Organisation (DCO) subject to regulation by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Crypto Finance AG is authorised to operate a securities business under Article 41 of the Swiss Financial Institution Act (FINIG), whereas Crypto Finance (Asset Management) AG is authorised as an asset manager for collective investment schemes under the Swiss Collective Investment Scheme Act (KAG). Both are subject to supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Our recently acquired subsidiary SimCorp is basically a non-regulated company. It was subject to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) only because it was listed on the stock exchange. It was delisted from Nasdaq Copenhagen on 30 October 2023 following the takeover by Deutsche Börse AG. With the delisting SimCorp is no longer subject to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-66-0\"></span>Image /page/66/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

It is part of the Hesse Ministry for the Economy, Energy, Transport and Housing.\n\n# Goals and principles of risk management\n\nDeutsche Börse Group strives for a leading role in all our business areas. We provide the infrastructure for dependable and secure capital markets and are involved constructively in its regulation. We align our risk management approach with our business model and our corporate strategy.\n\nOur risk management approach is based on the following principles: risk limitation, implementation of the business strategy in line with the risk appetite, and a reasonable relationship between risk and return.\n\nIn the course of growth by the business segments (e.g. organic growth, M&A activities, extension of the leading position in digital platforms for existing and new asset classes), risk management supports implementation of the strategy in line with the risk appetite by identifying risks, communicating clearly, limiting risks and monitoring. The aim is make well-founded strategic decisions within the boundaries of the defined risk appetite. Embedded cross-cutting risks such as ESG risks are also considered.\n\nWe aim to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return. Internal risk management is based on the Group-wide detection and management of risk, [see the chart \"Interlocking](#page-67-0) business strategy and risk management strategy\".\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>Image /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

For the banks that are the focus of the following comments – particularly including Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A. Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. and Eurex Clearing AG – and the securities firms - in the Group, this is supplemented by the normative perspective, which is discussed in more detail in the section \"Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios (normative perspective)\". The value at risk (VaR) model is the main tool for quantifying risks. The purpose of the VaR model is to determine the amount of economic capital – given a confidence interval of 99.9 per cent defined ex ante – required to cover very unlikely but possible losses incurred within twelve months. Moreover, we carry out stress tests in order to simulate extreme, yet plausible, events and their impact upon the Group's risk-bearing capacity. Complementary risk metrics have been established as an additional approach to risk monitoring, which serve as an early warning system for in-house risks. These risk metrics are based on operational risks (including IT and security risks, potential losses), credit, liquidity and business risks, as well as the indicators defined for recovery plans.\n\nStress tests are carried out in order to simulate separately and in aggregate extreme but plausible events for all material types of risk. They simulate the occurrence of extreme losses or the accumulation of large losses within a single year. Both hypothetical and historical scenarios are used and calculated for the banks and securities firms in the Group. Reverse stress tests are also carried out. They calculate which loss scenarios or liquidity squeezes would have to materialise for the risk-bearing capacity to be exceeded from a capital or liquidity perspective. Additional adverse scenarios are simulated for the relevant supervisory perspective (normative perspective) by the banks and securities firms. The recovery plans for the banks include additional recovery stress tests.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>Image /page/68/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

To this end, the Group continuously reviews internal events with regard to their risk properties, whilst also considering regional as well as global developments. We are thus able to recognise and analyse existing risks; at the same time, it is able to swiftly and adequately respond to emerging risks, as well as to changes in the market or in the business environment.\n\nRisk metrics are used to quantify the most important internal risks against set limits. These supplement the risk quantification from the economic perspective and serve to monitor management indicators other than the capital requirement, and non-quantifiable risks. Any under- or overshoot of the defined limits serves as an early warning signal, which is reported to the Executive Board on a monthly basis. Furthermore, any such breach immediately triggers the necessary analysis and risk mitigation processes.\n\nOur risk management approach also includes a sustainable, long-term component. In addition to the current existing risks, additional risks are also considered over a horizon of twelve months. For this purpose, we have developed socalled risk maps tailored specifically for expected or upcoming regulatory requirements and IT and information security risks. In addition, other operational, business and financial risks are also assessed beyond a twelve-month period. The risk maps categorise risks according to their probability of occurrence, and their potential financial impact, and show how the results relate to environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects.\n\n# Economic and normative perspective\n\nThe economic perspective assesses risk positions arising from business operations. The normative perspective includes inputs from regulatory models. The economic perspective is used to derive the minimum required economic capital (REC), so that our risk-bearing capacity based on the statistical model applied is not exhausted more than once in 1,000 years.\n\nFrom a normative perspective, regulatory capital requirements are the relevant management metrics. This means that risk management aims to meet the regulatory capital requirements for the banks and regulated securities companies in the Group. The economic and normative perspectives are used for risk management. The aim is therefore not only to meet the regulatory capital requirements, but also to ensure financial stability by means of the additional economic approach.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-69-0\"></span>Image /page/69/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

By contrast, Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG determine their economic risk-bearing capacity on the basis of their regulatory capital (for details, see the section \"Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios\").\n\nThe risk management function measures the amount of economic capital regularly and compares this with the risk-bearing capacity to produce a management indicator. The regulated entities also use the normative perspective. The economic capital for the banks includes Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. and Eurex Clearing AG. The following entities in particular are not banks: Deutsche Börse AG, Eurex Frankfurt AG (including Eurex Repo GmbH), European Energy Exchange AG (including ECC and Nodal), 360T Group, the entities in the Investment Management segment (Qontigo, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), Axioma) and Crypto Finance AG.

Existing risks have been classified. ESG risks have been analysed and quantified in this context as far as possible. In the course of this analysis the effects of ES-G risks were classified as immaterial and no new risks were identified.\n\nWe measure the availability of the systems as an important risk indicator. As an international exchange operator and innovative provider of market infrastructure, state-of-the-art IT is of the utmost importance for the Group to ensure that it can deliver its services smoothly and continuously. Special IT risk indicators for system availability have been defined in accordance with a defined risk appetite, to monitor the uptime and performance of the main IT systems in all units and business segments and to ensure that they remain within the defined parameters. Yellow and red limits are defined for this purpose, to enable the timely and transparent escalation and reporting of breaches to senior management. Since availability risk is the biggest operational risk for the Group, it is the subject of regular testing. This simulates the impact of a failure of our own systems or those of suppliers.\n\nRisks can also arise if a service provided to a customer is inadequate and leads to complaints or legal disputes. For example, errors in the settlement of securities transactions due to product or process deficiencies or faulty manual input. The related processes are tested at least annually. Other sources of errors may lie with suppliers or defective products. We register complaints and formal objections as a key indicator of deficient processing risk.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

These can occur if Deutsche Börse Group breaches laws or other stipulations, enters into inadequate contractual agreements or fails to monitor and observe the case law to a sufficient degree. Legal risks also include losses due to fraud and labour law issues.\n\nFurthermore, losses resulting from insufficient anti-money-laundering controls, violations of competition law or of banking secrecy are included. Such risks can also arise if government sanctions are not observed, e.g. in case of conflicting requirements of different states, or in the event of breaches of other national or international regulations.\n\nWe take specific organisational measures to mitigate operational risks. Among them are emergency plans, measures to ensure information security and the physical safety of employees and buildings, insurance coverage, as well as compliance regulations and procedures. Comments on compliance requirements can be found in the sectio[n \"Compliance\".](#page-53-0) \n\n# Contingency plans\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nIt is vital for our Group to be able to provide our products and services with the greatest possible reliability, in order to retain the trust of customers and markets, and to meet our contractual obligations. We have to maintain our business operations and take precautions against failures. If our core processes and resources are not available, this represents not only a substantial risk for the entire Group but also even a potential systemic risk for the financial markets in general. A system of contingency plans has therefore been established throughout the Group (Business Continuity Management System, BCMS). This\n\ncovers all processes designed to ensure continuity of operations in the event of an emergency and reduces unavailability risk. Measures include precautions relating to all material resources (staff, systems, workspace, suppliers), including the redundant design of essential IT systems and the technical infrastructure, as well as emergency measures designed to mitigate the unavailability of staff or workspaces in core functions.\n\nOur Group has introduced and tested a management process for emergencies that enables us to respond quickly and in a coordinated manner. This is intended to minimise the effects on business processes and on the market and to enable a quick return to regular operations. All business units have appointed emergency managers to act as central contacts and take responsibility during emergencies. The emergency managers inform the Executive Board or raise the alarm with them in the case of severe incidents. If the incident escalates, the Executive Board member responsible acts as the crisis manager or delegates this role. Our emergency plans are tested regularly by rehearsing critical situations as realistically as possible. Such tests are generally carried out unannounced.\n\n# Information security\n\nAs digitalisation advances, the financial sector as a whole continues its technological development, which increases the risks of cyber-attacks. Attacks on company IT systems and on financial infrastructure are increasing worldwide and the Federal Office for IT Security (BSI) estimates the threat is greater than ever. Attacks with malware or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks represent major dangers, for instance.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>Image /page/72/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Deutsche Börse AG has developed an integral risk management process to protect the company, its employees and values from internal and external attacks and threats – in a proactive as well as reactive manner. Analysts continuously assess the security situation at our locations and on business trips, and are in close contact with national and international authorities (Federal Criminal Police Office – BKA, Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution – BfV, etc.), security service providers, and security departments of other companies.

The Group's credit risks result from the specific business models of our subsidiaries and DBAG's treasury investments.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nVarious risk metrics are used to measure and manage the credit risk of our subsidiaries. To derive the credit risk, the required economic risk capital is measured using Monte Carlo simulations and regulatory capital requirements as well as stress tests are used. Among other things the indicators include the extent to which individual clients make use of their credit facility and the concentration of credit. The measurement criteria also include the credit rating of the counterparties and the collateral provided. Reverse stress tests for banks show how many clients would have to default for the losses to exceed the riskbearing capacity.\n\nBoth Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG extend credit to their customers to make securities settlement more efficient. This lending business may give rise to short-term receivables from counterparties of several billion euros, but differs fundamentally from the traditional bank lending business and the associated risk profile. Credit risk can also arise from cash investments, which are the responsibility of the Treasury function. Treasury invests both the company's own funds and those that our customers deposit with Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG; the funds are mostly invested on a secured basis.\n\nFinally, there may be short-term unsecured credit balances at correspondence banks in the course of securities settlement. To manage and monitor the counterparty risk in the Group, the credit score of potential customers and counterparties to an investment is assessed before our subsidiaries enter into business relations.\n\nOur subsidiaries define safety margins for the collateral depending on the risk involved and review them continuously. We reduce our risk when investing funds belonging to Group companies and client deposits by distributing investments across multiple counterparties, all with a high credit quality, and by investing funds primarily in the short term and in secured form if possible. Investment limits are established for each counterparty on the basis of at least annual credit checks and using ad hoc analyses, as necessary.\n\nIn accordance with their terms and conditions, Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG only enter into transactions with their clearing members. Clearing mainly relates to defined securities, rights and derivatives that are traded on specific stock exchanges. Eurex Clearing AG also offers this service for over-the-counter (OTC) products such as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. It acts as a central counterparty between the business parties. It reduces the resulting credit risk by offsetting receivables and by requiring clearing members to post collateral. These processes are part of an EMIR-compliant security system, which the central counterparties in the Group have implemented.\n\nThis backup system consists of different levels that prevent one or even several customer defaults from affecting the functioning of the central counterparties. As a first step, each clearing member must demonstrate a minimum amount of liable capital or, in the case of funds, assets under management. The second stage requires the daily provision of collateral in the form of money or creditworthy and liquid securities (margins), which, at the request of the central counterparties, must be supplemented or even replaced by customers during the day if securities no longer meet the high quality requirements. It should be noted that the underlying risk measurement already factors in changes in prices and positions over the course of the day. In the third stage, all clearing participants are obliged to pay additional collateral into a default fund on a pro rata basis according to their individual risk profile.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

A maximum of €600 million is available, from which own equity payments can already be used on a pro rata basis in the security scheme described above. Third parties have no rights under this comfort letter. The contribution from Eurex Clearing AG to the overall payment waterfall in the event of a liquidation is €200 million. Before the collateral in the default fund is used, European Commodity Clearing AG provides prefinanced allocated own funds of €35 million. If all these funds are not sufficient, European Community Clearing AG can call up additional contributions to the default fund from non-defaulting clearing participants up to three times within 90 days. Before doing so, European Commodity Clearing AG must provide additional prefinanced allocated own funds of €15 million.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nIn addition, Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG can use the facilities of the Deutsche Bundesbank and so hold most of the customer funds without any default risk. Investment losses on currencies for which Eurex Clearing AG or European Commodity Clearing AG have no access to the respective central banks, and therefore invest with commercial banks, will be borne, on a pro rata basis, by Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG and by those clearing members active in the currency where losses were incurred. The maximum amount payable by Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG is capped at €50 million for Eurex Clearing AG and €15 million for European Commodity Clearing AG.\n\nAs with Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG, Treasury also invests its own funds and client deposits for Eurex Clearing AG; here too, most of the investments are secured. To date, no default by one of our customers with a secured credit line has resulted in a financial loss for us.\n\n# Market risk\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nMarket risk include risks of an adverse development of interest rates, exchange rates or other market prices, which may occur when investing own or customer funds, on open risk positions in foreign currencies or on pension liabilities. We measure these risks using Monte Carlo simulations based on historical price data, as well as corresponding stress tests. Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. measures market risks based on historical developments in interest rates, exchange rates and other market prices, and with additional stress tests. To minimise foreign currency risks, we avoid open currency positions whenever possible. Market risk exposure only results from relatively small open foreign currency positions.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used across the Group solely for hedging purposes. This relates to interest rate or currency swaps, for instance, which are used as part of a conservative investment policy for Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG, or futures to reduce the market risk of existing positions at Crypto Finance AG.\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

They are actively managed in line with a defined investment policy and so have a limited exposure to market risk. We also reduced the risk of extreme losses by deciding to invest the bulk of the CTA on the basis of a value preservation mechanism.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nWe did not sustain any significant losses from market price risks in 2023.\n\n# Liquidity risk\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nLiquidity risk arises if a Group company is unable to meet its upcoming payment obligations in time and in full or if it can only do so at a higher refinancing cost.\n\nLiquidity risks arise primarily at our subsidiaries Eurex Clearing AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., since these are credit institutions. Furthermore, liquidity risks arise at European Commodity Clearing AG as it is classified as a credit institution under the German Banking Act.\n\nShort-term operating liquidity is mainly covered internally, by retaining earnings. The aim is to hold sufficient liquidity to be able to meet all our obligations as they fall due. An intra-group cash pool is used to pool surplus cash from our subsidiaries with Deutsche Börse AG, as far as regulatory and legal provisions allow. Liquid funds are invested on a short-term basis to ensure that they are available. Short-term investments are also largely secured by liquid bonds from first-class issuers. In addition, we have access to short-term external sources of financing, such as agreed credit lines with individual commercial banks or consortia, and a commercial paper programme.\n\nIn recent years, we have used our access to the capital markets to issue corporate bonds in order to meet our structural financing needs.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group's liquidity risk management objective is two-fold: we aim to cover short-term liquidity needs while safeguarding the long-term financing of our Group and thereby reducing liquidity risks.\n\nFor the early identification of risk, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG calculate daily the liquidity requirement using various stress tests that would occur in the event of client defaults. The companies hold sufficient liquidity to cover the requirement as determined by these calculations. Furthermore, potential risks that are identified in the course of stress tests are analysed, and corresponding risk-reduction measures initiated.\n\nAggregated across all currencies, the companies always had sufficient liquidity to cover their actual liquidity needs in 2023.\n\nLiquidity risks are not quantified in the REC (see note 24 to the consolidated [financial statements\\).](#page-211-0) \n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n#### Risk report\n\n[Risk profile Deutsche Börse Group](#page-63-0) [Regulatory classification](#page-64-0)  [Goals and principles of risk management](#page-66-0)  [Risk management approach](#page-67-0)  [Economic and normative perspective](#page-68-0)  [Risk-bearing capacity from an economic](#page-69-0) \n\n# perspective\n\n[Organisational structure and reporting](#page-77-0)  lines for risk management [Centrally coordinated risk management](#page-79-0)  process [Overall assessment of the risk situation](#page-81-0)  by the Executive Board [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0) [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0) Deutsche Börse AG [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n# [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Pension risk\n\nsory Board\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nPensions for past and present employees are managed in a variety of pension funds. Pension risk is the risk of rising costs from the current measurement of pension provisions due to higher life expectancies, salary increases and higher inflation rates. It is calculated with the support of actuaries during the first quarter of the financial year. The methods used to measure pension risk were modified in 2023 which led to an increase of €57 million in the pension risk.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\n# Business risk\n\nBusiness risk is the unexpected residual loss which arises when the Earnings at Risk exceed the anticipated net income after tax, which can be due to the competitive environment (e.g. customer behaviour, investment failure, industry trend), macro-economic and geopolitical developments or erroneous strategic management decisions. Factors influencing this residual loss could be lower revenues or higher costs than planned. Business risk is reported when the calculated value at risk is higher than the budgeted net income for the next four quarters. This approach is based on the use of historic actuals as well as anticipated data and the expenses and income actually reported. Since historic actuals are not yet available for Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., an approach based on business risk scenarios is used there. Business risks are continuously monitored by the business units. There was no disclosable business risk for the Group on the basis of the simulation model as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regularly considers whether to classify Deutsche Börse AG as a financial holding company. It has currently come to the conclusion that Deutsche Börse AG is not a financial holding company. Classification as a financial holding company could have an impact on our capital requirements.\n\n# Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios (normative perspective)\n\nOperational risk, credit risk and market risk are used to determine the capital requirements from a normative perspective. Regulatory capital requirements are not determined for Deutsche Börse Group, but separately for each regulated entity. However, the risk profile from a normative perspective is comparable to the risk profile derived from economic capital. Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG used the standard approach for analysing and evaluating credit and market risk. The institutions have adopted different approaches regarding operational risk: Clearstream uses the considerably more complex Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) in all business units, which has been approved and is regularly audited by BaFin. In contrast, Eurex Clearing AG, European Commodity Clearing AG and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. employ the basic indicator approach in order to calculate regulatory capital requirements.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>Image /page/77/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

For this reason, the regulatory capital equivalent to the subscribed capital of €25.0 million was not taken into account for regulatory purposes as at 31 December 2022. Eurex Frankfurt AG also contributed capital of €50 million to Eurex Clearing AG as at 25 September 2023.\n\nIn February and March 2023, Clearstream Banking AG carried out two capital increases for a total of €110.0 million. The reason for strengthening its capital base was primarily a change in the interpretation of the CRR and CSDR capital requirements by the supervisory authority, resulting in both requirements being applied cumulatively. The reduction in equity at Clearstream Holding AG is due to the new legal entity Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. Own funds decreased mainly due to the carve-out of Clear-stream Fund Centre Holding and its subgroup.\n\nClearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. have Minimum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities, MREL, which were met at all times. The Minimum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) result from the recovery and resolution planning for the Clearstream entities as well as Clearstream Fund Centre S.A. on compliance with the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Banking AG as central depositories are subject to the capital requirements of CSDR, whereas Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG as central counterparties are subject to the specific capital requirements of EMIR, which were met at all times in the reporting year. As of April 2023, Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. must meet the combined capital requirements (complementary approach ratio) defined in CRR and CSDR. They have satisfied the complementary approach ratio since it came into effect.\n\n# Organisational structure and reporting lines for risk management\n\n# Organisational structure and reporting lines\n\nOur risk management approach applies to the entire Deutsche Börse Group. Risk management functions, processes and responsibilities are binding for all our employees and organisational units.

It ensures that the requirements for the risk management approach and risk appetite are met.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer leads the development of proposals for the risk management framework, risk appetite, approaches and methods for risk monitoring and control, capital allocation and the necessary processes. Risks are continuously analysed, evaluated and reported: once a month or as needed to the Executive Board, four times a year to the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board and once a year to the Supervisory Board. Likewise, the CRO reports to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of the risk management system on an annual basis. This system ensures that the responsible bodies can check whether the defined risk limits are complied with.\n\nOur subsidiaries act in the same way, always ensuring that they meet the requirements of the Group. In particular, they adhere to the risk appetite framework allocated to them by Deutsche Börse Group. The banks and European Commodity Clearing AG have independent executive boards and supervisory boards. The relevant supervisory boards and their committees are involved in the process. The same applies to the executive boards and the corresponding risk management functions. Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., European Commodity Clearing AG and Eurex Clearing AG implement the risk management approach with specific features derived for their own businesses. They equally use metrics and reporting formats adjusted to the overarching Group structure. As a rule, the management of the respective subsidiary is responsible for structuring the risk management approach and for compliance with the relevant legal requirements.\n\n# Centrally coordinated risk management process\n\nOur risk management is implemented in a five-stage, centrally coordinated process. All potential losses should be identified in a timely manner, centrally recorded and, whenever possible quantitatively measured. Measures for managing them are to be recommended as necessary and their implementation ensured (see chart \"Five-stage risk management process\"). A further component of our risk management approach is the three lines of defence (3LoD) model, which is established at Deutsche Börse AG and at the banks and securities companies in our Group. This model defines a clear segregation of functions and responsibilities between the operating business units (first line of defence), risk management (second line of defence) and internal audit (third line of defence).\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/19 description: The image shows a diagram of risk management responsibilities. The diagram is divided into three sections: Executive Board, Chief Risk Officer/Group Risk Management, and Business areas. The Executive Board is responsible for the risk management approach and appetite. The Chief Risk Officer/Group Risk Management is responsible for continuous monitoring and management of the risk profile throughout the risk management process, assessing, and monitoring and reporting. The Business areas are responsible for identifying, notifying, and controlling.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-80-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n#### Risk report\n\n[Risk profile Deutsche Börse Group](#page-63-0) [Regulatory classification](#page-64-0)  [Goals and principles of risk management](#page-66-0)  [Risk management approach](#page-67-0)  [Economic and normative perspective](#page-68-0)  [Risk-bearing capacity from an economic](#page-69-0)  perspective [Organisational structure and reporting](#page-77-0)  lines for risk management [Centrally coordinated risk management](#page-79-0) \n\n#### process\n\n[Overall assessment of the risk situation](#page-81-0)  by the Executive Board [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0) [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0) Deutsche Börse AG\n\n[\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0) [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n#### [Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nThe first stage identifies the risks and the possible causes of losses or operational malfunctions. In the second stage, the business areas (first line of defence) regularly – or immediately, in urgent cases – report the risks that they have identified and quantified. The report goes to the risk management function (part of the second line of defence), which evaluates the potential threat in a third stage. In the fourth stage the business units manage the risks by avoiding, mitigating or transferring them, or by actively accepting them. The fifth and final stage involves monitoring different risk metrics and, where necessary, informing the responsible Executive Board members and committees of significant risks, their assessment and possible emergency measures. In addition to its regular reports, the CRO division compiles ad hoc reports for the Executive and Supervisory Boards. The risk management functions at Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Funds Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG submit reports to the respective executive boards and supervisory boards. The internal audit function (third line of defence) is an independent function and monitors both the business units and the risk management functions.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\n# Structure of the internal control system\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nDeutsche Börse has a Group-wide internal control system (ICS) that defines a framework with minimum requirements for all entities in the Group. The framework provides the basis for the risk-based implementation of the ICS. It supports the effective and efficient implementation and operation of the ICS regardless of the degree of regulation, or the size of the entity, for example.\n\nThe ICS helps to manage risks and particularly covers risks at the process level. This entails defining rules for the uniform recording and assessment of process risks, in aggregate and at the individual risk level. It should be emphasised that both financial and non-financial effects are taken into account when assessing the materiality of risks. A control cycle carried out at least once a year defines minimum requirements for continuous improvements and ICS reporting. This also includes an assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the measures taken by the business units as the first line of defence.\n\nA particular emphasis in the ICS implementation is on steps to manage material risks in connection with financial and non-financial reporting.\n\nThe central unit Financial Accounting and Controlling (FA&C), which reports directly to the CFO, and decentralised units working to standards defined by FA&C are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with the statutory requirements. Group Tax is responsible for determining tax items. The relevant department heads are responsible for the related processes, including effective security and control measures. The aim is to ensure that risks relating to the accounting process are identified early on, so that remedial action can be taken in good time.\n\nFA&C provides the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements with accounting guidelines that are intended to support consistent and correct accounting across the Group. Moreover, we continuously monitor and analyse changes in the accounting environment and adjust our processes accordingly.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>Image /page/81/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Incompatible tasks – such as modifying master data on the one hand and issuing payment instructions on the other – are strictly segregated at a functional level. An independent control unit grants individual employees access rights to the accounting system and continuously monitors these permissions using a so-called incompatibility matrix.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report\n\nRisk report\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nSubsidiaries of Deutsche Börse Group maintain and consolidate their general ledgers in the same system. Accounting data from other companies is uploaded for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe processes, systems and controls described above aim to provide reasonable assurance that our accounting system complies with the applicable principles and laws. In addition, Compliance and Internal Audit act as a further line of defence, performing risk-based, process-independent controls on whether the ICS is appropriate and effective.\n\nThe accounting-based internal control system (ICS) was strengthened and expanded in 2023. A Control Over Financial Reporting (COFR) policy was introduced and adopted by all the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements. The COFR policy is intended to manage the risks associated with financial reporting across the Group, deliver end-to-end transparency in the financial processes and ensure the reliability of financial reporting. FA&C has provided a standardised process catalogue for accounting processes, including standardised risk-control matrices and documentation requirements. Compliance is regularly monitored by FA&C. These measures are to be strengthened and expanded again in 2024.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Audit Committee established by the Supervisory Board receive regular reports on the effectiveness of the ICS with respect to the financial reporting process.\n\n# Overall assessment of the risk situation by the Executive Board\n\n# Summary\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe risk profile of Deutsche Börse Group did not change significantly in the 2023 financial year. All known impacts of the geopolitical and macroeconomic developments were actively managed within the Group and potential new risks were analysed on an ongoing basis. The aggregate total risk of Deutsche Börse Group comprising all risk types (operational, financial, pension and business risk) was always matched by sufficient covered funds. Group risk management and the internal control system (ICS) were further strengthened and expanded in 2023, as described above. No significant change in the risk situation of the Group has been identified by the Executive Board at the present time.\n\n# Outlook\n\nDeutsche Börse Group continually assesses its risk situation. From stress tests, the economic capital requirements as calculated and based on the risk management system, Deutsche Börse AG's Executive Board concludes that the available risk coverage amount and liquidity are sufficient. There is currently no indication that the risk coverage amount has to be adjusted for 2024. Furthermore, it cannot identify any risk that would endanger the Group's existence as a going concern. Group risk management and the internal control system (ICS) are to be strengthened and expanded further in 2024. SimCorp will also be fully included in the measurement of economic capital. In addition, the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) across the Group for aspects relevant to risk management will be driven forward.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-82-0\"></span>Image /page/82/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

We pursue both organic growth and focused M&A activities.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n# Organisation of opportunities management\n\nCombined management report Report on opportunities\n\nWe evaluate the organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the individual business areas continuously, i.e. over the course of the year. With our opportunity management, we can identify, evaluate and seize opportunities for the Group as early as possible – and turn them into business successes. At Group level these opportunities are systematically assessed as part of the annual budgeting process and strategic reviews. The process begins with a careful analysis of the market environment, which considers both what the customer wants, as well as market developments, competitors and regulatory changes. Ideas for growth initiatives are developed further using uniform, Group-wide templates and subjected to a profitability analysis. On this basis, our Executive Board decides which initiatives are to be implemented.\n\nIn the course of preparing our Horizon 2026 strategy we validated our opportunities again and adjusted them accordingly.\n\n# Organic growth opportunities\n\nWe have a very broad portfolio of products and services with which we cover all areas of a market infrastructure provider's value chain. In order to maintain and expand this position we are pursuing a growth strategy called Horizon 2026 (see section \"Strategy and steering [parameters\"\\).](#page-21-0) We are focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities. These consist largely of secular opportunities that we can influence ourselves. Secular opportunities arise for example as a result of regulatory changes, new client requirements such as the growing demand for exchange-traded solutions to previously over-the-counter (OTC) transactions or from the trend to allocate an increasing portion of assets to passive investment strategies (e.g. ETFs). There are also cyclical opportunities that are beyond our direct control and result from changes in the macroeconomic environment. Apart from that, we see long-term growth opportunities resulting from the technological transformation. With the help of distributed ledger technology, public cloud solutions for operating IT infrastructure and artificial intelligence, we not only want to become efficient in our existing business, but also see opportunities for new products and services related to digital assets, for example.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

With the merger of SimCorp and Axioma we have created an end-to-end offering along the entire process chain for institutional investors. This also enables us to realise revenue and cost synergies. It opens up significant, sustainable and long-term growth opportunities and enables us to diversify our business and further increase the proportion of our recurring revenue.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nOne-stop shop for global indices and data (combination of ISS and STOXX): Our objective in the index business is to give the already established European index provider STOXX an even more global profile, in order to develop and market other indices worldwide. By combining our index provider STOXX with the ESG and data business of ISS we have created the foundation for offering our customers an integrated range of indices and ESG data. This gives us an advantage over our global competitors and helps us to give new and existing customers the best possible service. In addition, Deutsche Börse's index business will continue to take advantage of the structural trend towards passive investment products (ETFs). An increasing number of private clients and asset managers now follow this trend; not only are the costs lower, but many active investment strategies have been returning under-average performance. We are also realising revenue and cost synergies by merging ISS and STOXX under joint management.\n\n### Trading & Clearing\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nNew interest rate derivatives: Higher interest rates and wider fluctuations in expectations on future rates increase demand for interest rate products as investments and speculative opportunities, and to hedge interest rate risks. To support this, we use our leading position in long-term interest rate derivatives in order to win short-term business in interest rate derivatives for our platforms too. Customers profit from efficiencies in margin requirements if they pool their short-term interest rate business as well as their long-term interest rate business on our platforms. We offer an additional incentive by expanding our partnership programme, which enables market participants to share in our economic success.\n\nClearing of OTC derivatives: We have used political and regulatory developments, along with our expertise in building liquid markets, and expanded our market share in the clearing of OTC derivatives to around 20 per cent in recent years. In the years ahead we want to profit from overall market growth and increase our market share at the same time. To achieve these goals we use our improved risk model and efficiencies in cross-margining, i.e. offsetting margins for OTC trades with those for exchange-traded business. The current obligation being discussed by the EU supervisory authorities to use an active cross-margining account within the EU could also contribute to gaining additional market share.\n\nRising demand for repo products: The retreat by central banks from the money market and higher interest rates have caused demand for secured money market products to rise. We anticipate that we will profit from overall market growth and win new customers for our products at the same time.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span>Image /page/84/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

These new products reflect changes in customer preferences and regulatory requirements, and we therefore expect to see further significant growth here in the years ahead.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Report on opportunities\n\nRising demand for power derivatives: The increasing share of renewable energies in the energy mix causes wider price fluctuations on European power markets. At the same time, industries with high energy requirements are obliged to include future energy costs in their calculations well in advance when pricing their final products. Their hedging requirement and demand for power derivatives is correspondingly high. Liquidity in the European power markets operated by us is now high, which has attracted new market participants, such as algorithmic and quant traders. They have no physical need, but use power as an asset class for trading. We want to use this momentum to increase liquidity on our platforms even further and open up new customer groups.\n\nTokenisation: We are at the beginning of a new technology and digital assets will increase the range of investable and tradable instruments significantly. With the Digital Asset Business Platform we want to make tokenised assets fungible for institutional customers and profit from this trend over the long term.\n\n#### Fund Services\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n#### Cross-border settlement and distribution of investment funds:\n\nOur clients can use Clearstream's settlement, custody and distribution services for their entire fund portfolio – covering traditional investment funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as well as hedge funds. Given that supervisory authorities are also calling for more efficient settlement and custody solutions in order to guarantee maximum security for client assets under custody, we expect to acquire additional client portfolios in the future by means of outsourcing agreements. We are also continuously expanding our range of products\n\nand services. So, for example, we have significantly expanded our range of fund services to include the management of distribution agreements, as well as data compilation through acquisitions.\n\n### Securities Services\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nExpand fixed-income securities services: With new offerings for our customers in the Securities Services segment we intend to use our presence and range in fixed-income securities services in a more normal interest rate environment. This includes expanding the repo and securities lending business. Both products are currently seeing stronger demand due to central banks' withdrawal from the money market and increased demand for high-quality collateral.\n\nDigital value chain in custody: Clearstream customers can already issue assets the same-day in a digital value chain via our D7 platform. We want to build on this success and enable our customers to manage and settle positions and accounts digitally in future – and to do so for all their asset classes. In addition to economies of scale and cost savings, we anticipate further long-term growth from a larger number of transactions.\n\n# Cyclical opportunities\n\nIn addition to secular growth opportunities, we have cyclical opportunities, for instance as a result of macroeconomic developments or unexpected market events. We do not have any direct control over these cyclical opportunities, but they do have the potential to increase our net revenue significantly. They include high trading volumes on our markets, on the one hand, which could be caused by a change in interest rate expectations or global events. On the other we benefit from rising interest rates, because they increase the net interest income we receive on cash balances.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-85-0\"></span>Image /page/85/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

They include cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT). These technologies can help to harmonise markets, open up new business potential, boost efficiency and reduce risks. We continuously and systematically observe and evaluate new technological developments and trends in terms of their impact and importance for our business model and our processes. Together with external partners we deliberately build and extend our expertise in selected technological areas.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n# Cloud\n\nWe work continuously to migrate our services and processes to the cloud and to optimise them. In addition to the flexible use of computing capacities, this has other advantages for us. For instance, the introduction of new functionalities and updating of existing software might be tested faster and better by clients in the cloud. This makes our processes significantly more agile, as new releases can be introduced at more frequent intervals, allowing us to respond better to clients' requirements.\n\nWe have been following a hybrid multi-cloud strategy with great success for years. Via agreements with leading international cloud providers we have already positioned ourselves at the summit of cloud use in the European financial services sector. In addition, on 9 February 2023, we announced a new strategic partnership with Google Cloud. It is intended to cover 10 years and allows us to profit from the technical performance and robust security mechanisms of a respected cloud provider.\n\nAs part of our partnership with Google Cloud we are concentrating on four areas:\n\n1. Increase cloud use: we are planning to move up to 70 per cent of the processes within our Group to the cloud. The migration is planned for completion by late 2026 and will comprise both cloud-to-cloud migrations and on-premise-to-cloud migrations. We are also working with other cloud providers in addition to Google.\n\n2. Data mesh: We are developing a data mesh that enables the shared use of data across different data storage devices and companies within the Group. Building on this, the aim is to create a market place where we can make data and analytics products and services available to external customers.\n\n3. Digital Assets Business Platform: We are planning to build an ecosystem for digital assets that is operated on the basis of an institutional value chain, using native digital infrastructure components in the cloud. The platform would conform to recognised standards in the finance industry and service a variety of asset classes and use cases on and off the blockchain.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Digital Securities Platform D7: D7 is our contribution to a European ecosystem for digital assets. With D7 we want to enable market participants the settlement of their digital assets on an institutionalised platform. This will drive digitisation and efficiency in post-trading and create a next-generation digital securities platform. The aim is to digitise the entire value chain from issuance to administration, repayment and archival. It will make it possible to create, record, settle and manage digital securities and digital assets in centralised and decentralised ledgers.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Report on opportunities\n\n# Distributed ledger technology (DLT)\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents another technological opportunity. It is sometimes considered a disruptive technology, and at present, the financial services sector is increasingly exploring its opportunities. Thanks to its decentralised nature, it facilitates direct interaction between participants, thus offering the potential for simplifying complex processes. The challenge in the financial industry is to make use of distributed ledger technology while meeting high security standards and taking risk limitation and cost efficiency aspects into account.\n\nAs an established provider of market infrastructure with an integrated value chain, we are in a good position to exploit the potential of distributed ledger technology. Our experience of applicable industry standards and legal and regulatory requirements is a decisive advantage here.\n\n# Artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nWell-known use cases have increasingly brought artificial intelligence into the public eye. As a provider of market infrastructure in the financial industry we are particularly evaluating artificial intelligence from the perspective of efficiency gains and scalability across the Group. Artificial intelligence is already being used in initial applications – for our customers (OSCAR collateral management, settlement prediction tool) and for our employees (chatbots). We always keep an eye on technological and regulatory developments, in order to evaluate and implement the best new use cases for artificial intelligence. To do so we make use of both internal and external know-how, in the context of strategic partnerships for instance.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-87-0\"></span>Image /page/87/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

In the long term we intend to continue consistently on our growth path, in order to make Deutsche Börse Group the preferred global market infrastructure provider.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe forecast describes Deutsche Börse Group's expected performance for the 2024 financial year. It contains statements and information on events in the future and is based on the company's expectations and assumptions at the time of publication of this corporate report. In turn, these are subject to known and unknown opportunities, risks and uncertainties. Numerous factors, many of which are outside the company's control, influence the Group's success, its business strategy and its financial results. Should opportunities, risks or uncertainties materialise, or should one of the assumptions made turn out to be incorrect, the Group's actual performance could deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations and assumptions contained in the forward-looking statements and information contained in this forecast.\n\n# Developments in the operating environment\n\n# Macroeconomic environment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nGlobal economic growth slowed again over the course of 2023, as a result of much more restrictive monetary policies by central banks. The escalation of the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East in the second halfyear also caused uncertainty among market participants. We expect the economic situation to remain tense in 2024 due to high interest rates. Interest rate cuts by central banks following further falls in inflation could have a positive impact on the economic environment, on the one hand. On the other, a\n\nsharper decline in economic growth than expected or a recession could lead to uncertainty among market participants.\n\n# Future development of results of operations\n\nFor the year 2024 we are expect revenue to increase again to more than €5.6 billion. In addition to organic growth on the basis of our secular growth opportunities, the consolidation of SimCorp will make a significant contribution. We are also currently anticipating slight secular headwinds if central banks should reduce their base rates. If market volatility goes up or interest rates stay at least at their current level, this would have a positive effect. In terms of operating costs we are planning an increase for investment in our organic growth opportunities, and the additional contribution from SimCorp. On this basis we anticipate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of more than €3.2 billion in 2024.\n\n#### Forecast for results of operations 2024\n\n|                                                                       | Basis 2023<br>€m | Forecast 2024<br>€bn |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Net revenue                                                           | 5,076.6          | >5.6                 |\n| Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) | 2,944.3          | >3.2                 |\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-88-0\"></span>Image /page/88/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

As far as the forecast development of non-financial performance indicators for 2024 is concerned, system availability was brought back into line with the high targets by means of additional back-up measures, which became part of everyday operations. We therefore expect that the system availability of customer facing IT will remain high in the forecast period.\n\nBeing an attractive employer is important for our sustained success. We want to attract top talents and retain them for the long term. The measures described in the chapte[r \"Employees\"](#page-45-0) have put us in a good position and we are confident that we can maintain or improve on our employee satisfaction of more than 71.5 per cent.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's Executive Board has defined target quotas for women on the two management levels beneath the Executive Board, in accordance with section 76 (4) of the AktG, in each case referring to Deutsche Börse AG. By 31 December 2024, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and second management levels beneath the Executive Board is planned to reach 15 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. Moreover, on a global Group level the Executive Board has adopted a voluntary commitment to increase the share of women holding upper management positions to 24 per cent by the end of 2024, and of women holding lower management positions to 33 per cent during the same period. We have extended the scope of our voluntary commitment over and above the legal requirements.\n\nThe assessment of independent ESG rating agencies is an important benchmark for our ESG efforts. We continuously analyse our performance and take action accordingly. Over the forecast period we expect that we will be able to maintain our good position above the 90th percentile of the ESG ratings.\n\n#### Targets of non-financial KPI for 2024\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n|                                           | Based on 2023   | Target for 2024  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| System availability of customer-facing IT | >99.9 %         | >99.5 %          |\n| Employee satisfaction                     | 73 %            | >71.5 %          |\n| Share of women in leadership positions1   | 23 %            | >24 %            |\n| ESG ratings                               | 98th percentile | >90th percentile |\n\n1) Group target for senior management.\n\n# Future development of the Group's financial position\n\nWe expect that cash flow from operating activities, which is our primary source of financing, will remain significantly positive in future. We expect that three significant factors will influence changes in liquidity in the forecast period: firstly, we plan to invest around €350 million in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at Group level. These investments will serve primarily to develop new products and services in our growth areas and to enhance existing ones. We also launched a share buy-back programme with a volume of €300 million in January 2024. In May 2024 we will propose a dividend of €3.80 per share to the Annual General Meeting. This would represent a cash outflow of about €703.4 million. Apart from the above, we did not expect any other material factors to impact the Group's liquidity at the time the combined management report was prepared. As in previous years, we assume that we will have a sound liquidity base in the forecast period due to positive cash flow from operating activities, adequate credit lines (for details see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements), and [our flexible management and](#page-211-0) planning systems.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-89-0\"></span>Image /page/89/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In future we will aim to distribute dividends equivalent to 30-40 per cent of the net profit for the period attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche Börse AG. The dividend per share is planned to increase going forward. In addition, available liquidity can be invested in the Group's further inorganic development, as in the past. In the event of any surplus liquidity, the company intends to supplement the dividend with share buy-backs.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Report on post-balance sheet\n\ndate events\n\nTo maintain its strong credit ratings at Group level, we aim for a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.25, and a ratio of free funds from operations to net debt of at least 40 per cent. Financing the takeover of SimCorp temporarily caused the ratio of free funds from operations to net debt to not fulfil the target at year-end 2023. We expect to be within the limit for this indicator again in 2024 thanks to positive cash flow from operating activities.\n\n# Overall assessment by the Executive Board\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nWe believe the Group remains very well positioned in terms of international competition, thanks to its broadly diversified offering along the securities trading value\n\nchain and its innovative strength. This being the case, we expect to see a positive trend in the results of operations over the long term. Our new corporate strategy and the resulting measures should further accelerate this growth. In this context the Group aims to become more agile and effective and sharpen its client focus, in order to become the global market infrastructure provider of choice, with a top ranking in all its business areas. Taking the conditions for organic growth into account, the Executive Board is planning an increase in net revenue to more than €5.6 billion in the forecast period. The Executive Board expects EBITDA to go up to more than €3.2 billion in the forecast period. Overall, on this basis the Executive Board assumes that cash flow from operating activities will be clearly positive and that, as in previous years, the liquidity base will be sound. The overall assessment by the Executive Board is valid as at the publication date for this combined management report.\n\n# Report on post-balance sheet date events\n\nThere were no significant events after the end of the reporting period.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-90-0\"></span>Image /page/90/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In addition to specifying concrete rules, the code of business conduct provides general guidance as to how employees can contribute to implementing the defined values in their everyday working life. The goals of the code of business conduct are to provide guidance on working together in the company on a day-to-day basis, to help resolve any conflicts and to resolve ethical and legal challenges. All newly hired employees receive the code of business conduct as part of their employment contract documentation.

The code of conduct for suppliers as applicable to Deutsche Börse AG and the central purchasing department requires suppliers, among other things, to respect human rights and environmental regulations and to comply with minimum standards in these areas. The minimum standards also incorporate the requirements of the German Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (Supply Chain Due Diligence Act) and the UK Modern Slavery Act. Service providers and suppliers must sign this code of conduct or enter into an equivalent voluntary commitment before they can do business with Deutsche Börse AG and the Group companies represented by the central purchasing department. The code of conduct for suppliers is reviewed regularly in the light of current developments and amended if necessary. It can be found [online at www.deutsche-bo](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/responsibility/sustainability/policies-guidelines)erse.com > Responsibility > Sustainability > Our policies and guidelines.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n# Sustainability and values\n\nDeutsche Börse Group's business activities are based on the legal frameworks and ethical standards of the different countries in which the Group operates. A key way in which we underscore the values we consider important for the Deutsche Börse Group is by joining initiatives and organisations that advocate generally accepted ethical standards. Relevant memberships are as follows:\n\nUN Global Compact [www.unglobalcompact.org: t](https://unglobalcompact.org/)his voluntary business initiative established by the United Nations aims to achieve a more sustainable and more equitable global economy. At the heart of the compact are ten principles covering the areas of human rights, labour, environment protection and anticorruption. Deutsche Börse Group has submitted annual communications on progress (COPs) on its implementation of the UN Global Compact since 2009. Charta der Vielfalt [www.charta-der-vielfalt.de:](https://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/en/) as a signatory to the Diversity Charter, the company has committed to acknowledging, respecting and promoting the diversity of its workforce, customers and business associates – irrespective of their age, gender, disability, race, religion, nationality, ethnic background, sexual orientation or identity.\n\nInternational Labour Organization [www.ilo.org: th](https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm)is UN agency is the international organisation responsible for drawing up and overseeing international labour standards. It brings together representatives of governments, employees and employers to promote the joint development of policies and programmes. Deutsche Börse Group has signed up to the ILO's labour standards and hence has agreed to abide by them.\n\n## Sustainability in corporate governance\n\nSustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche Börse Group. It is therefore an essential element of corporate governance at the level of both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sustainability matters at Deutsche Börse Group. It was supported in the reporting year by the interdisciplinary Group Sustainability Board, which is chaired by the CFO. The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It deals with company initiatives relating to environmental, social and governance topics (ESG). This includes advising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate planning and controlling. The Group Sustainability Board has been replaced by the Group Sustainability Committee as of 1 January 2024. The Group Sustainability Committee is the new central management unit for sustainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group. It is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and supports and advises the Executive Board on all aspects of sustainability. The Group Sustainability Committee is intended to ensure the implementation of effective ESG practices in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Responsibility for ESG reporting was transferred from Group ESG Strategy to the section Sustainability Reporting, which is part of the CFO function, on 1 October 2023.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nAt the Supervisory Board level, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee has dealt, in particular, with sustainable corporate governance and activities in the field of ESG at Deutsche Börse Group since 2021. In addition to embedding ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this way, it is particularly important for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board committees, especially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination Committee. Current, relevant sustainability aspects also form part of the training programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and are dealt with in workshops and seminars.\n\nTo promote the sustainable development of the Deutsche Börse Group, ESG targets are an integral part of the remuneration system for the Executive Board. Details of the Executive Board remuneration system can be found in the [\"Remuneration report\".](#page-249-0) \n\nFurther information on this subject can be found online at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Responsibility [> Sustainability.

The Group has a number of rules and processes for this purpose. They comprise both statutory and internal rules that can be adapted specifically to individual industry segments. They include policies on whistleblowing, risk management and the internal control system.\n\n# Whistleblower system\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nDeutsche Börse Group plays an active role in the fight against breaches of rules and regulations. One example is Deutsche Börse Group's whistleblowing system, which provides a channel to report non-compliant behaviour. Deutsche Börse Group uses the Business Keeper Monitoring System (BKMS®), an online application that enables employees, clients and third parties to report matters that could be criminal offences and incidents of noncompliance by employees or third parties concerning the business of Deutsche Börse Group. Reports can be made in their own name or anonymously and can be made around the clock.\n\nFurther information regarding the whistleblower system can be found at [www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/our-company/contact/contact-for-whistleblowers) > Our Company > Contact > Whistleblower system.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Deutsche Börse Group's enterprise-wide control systems are embedded in an overarching framework. This comprises, among other things, the legal requirements, the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, international regulations and recommendations and other company-specific policies. The executives responsible for the different elements of the control system are in close contact with each other and with the Executive Board. Key aspects of its design and implementation are also reported regularly to the Supervisory Board or its committees. Equally, the Group has an enterprise-wide risk management system that covers and provides mandatory rules for functions, processes and responsibilities. The internal control system and risk management system also cover sustainability-related targets. Details of the internal control system and risk management at Deutsche Börse Group can be found in th[e \"Risk report\" s](#page-63-0)ection.\n\nFrom its examination of the internal control and risk management system and the reports of the Internal Audit function regarding its risk-oriented and process-independent controls conducted, the Executive Board does not have any indications which would result in reservations regarding the appropriateness and efficacy of the systems.\n\n# Working practices of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nAn important fundamental principle of the German Stock Corporation Act is the dual board system – which assigns separate, independent responsibilities to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. These responsibilities and their implementation at Deutsche Börse AG are set out in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nBoth boards perform their duties in the interests of the company and with the aim of achieving a sustainable, long-term increase in value. Their actions are based on the principle of responsible corporate governance. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG therefore work closely together in a spirit of mutual trust. The Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with comprehensive information on the company's and the Group's position and the course of business in a regular and timely manner. In addition, the Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly concerning issues relating to corporate planning, the risk situation and risk management, compliance and the company's control systems. The strategic orientation of the company is examined in detail and agreed upon with the Supervisory Board. Implementation of the relevant measures is discussed at regular intervals. The Chief Executive Officer reports to the Supervisory Board without undue delay, orally or in writing, on matters that are of special importance to the company.\n\nIn addition, the CEO keeps the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously and regularly informed of the current developments affecting the company's business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions and the long-term outlook and discusses these issues with him or her. The Supervisory Board may also request reports from the Executive Board at any time, especially on matters and business transactions at Deutsche Börse AG and subsidiaries that have a significant impact on Deutsche Börse AG's position.

The Executive Board had six members in the reporting year. The main duties of the Executive Board include defining the Group's corporate goals and sustainable strategic orientation, managing and monitoring the operating units, as well as establishing and monitoring an efficient risk management system. The Executive Board is responsible for preparing the annual and consolidated financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG, as well as for producing financial information during the course of the year. In addition, it must ensure the company's compliance with legal requirements and official regulations.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are jointly responsible for all aspects of management. Irrespective of this collective responsibility, the individual members manage the company's business areas assigned to them in the Executive Board's schedule of responsibilities independently and are personally responsible for them. In addition to the business areas, the functional areas of responsibility are that of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Information Officer/Chief Operating Officer (CIO/COO) and Governance, People & Culture. The business areas cover the operating business units, such as the company's cash market activities, the derivatives business, the market data business, securities settlement and custody, collateral and liquidity management, fund distribution services as well as the Investment Management Solutions segment with offerings in the areas of indices, analytics, sustainability information (ESG) and software.

Among other things, these list issues that are reserved for the entire Executive Board, special measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board, other procedural details and the arrangements for passing resolutions. The Executive Board holds regular meetings. They are convened by the CEO, who coordinates the work of the Executive Board. Any Executive Board member can require a meeting to be convened. In accordance with its bylaws, the entire Executive Board normally takes decisions on the basis of resolutions passed by a simple majority of the members voting on them in each case. If a vote is tied, the CEO has the casting vote.\n\nMore information on the Executive Board, its composition, members' individual appointments and biographies can be found [at www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/executive-board) > Investor Relations> Corporate Governance > Executive Board.\n\n# Deutsche Börse AG's Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in its management of the company. This also covers sustainability matters. The Supervisory Board supports the Executive Board in significant business decisions and provides advice on strategically important issues. In the Rules of Procedures for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board has defined transactions of fundamental importance which require its approval. In addition, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing the members of the Executive Board, deciding on their total remuneration and examining Deutsche Börse AG's annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report.

In addition, extraordinary meetings are held as required. Executive Board members attend the meetings unless the Supervisory Board decides otherwise in any particular case. The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Executive Board. Exchanges also take place as necessary with the annual auditors. The committees also hold regular meetings. Unless mandatory statutory provisions or the articles of incorporation call for a different procedure, the Supervisory Board passes its resolutions by a simple majority. If a vote is tied, the Chair has the casting vote. Further details of how the Supervisory Board and its committees work are defined in particular in the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board, which can be downloaded [at www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/supervisory-board/rules-of-procedure) > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Supervisory Board > Rules of procedure.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews both the knowledge, skill and experience of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board as a whole and of their members regularly, at least once a year, and examines the structure, size, composition and performance of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. Its review is based on a catalogue of specific targets, including qualification requirements, which, in turn, are reviewed regularly by the Supervisory Board. As a result of this review the qualification matrix was amended in the reporting year to show the competences \"Strategy\" and \"Sustainability\" separately. In this way, the Supervisory Board has made the qualification matrix even more transparent. The Supervisory Board also regularly, at least once a year, reviews the effectiveness of its work, discusses opportunities for improvement and decides on suitable measures if necessary. The concrete targets are described in the chapter Targets for composition and [qualification requirements](#page-102-0) of the Supervisory Board\n\nand the [annual effectiveness review](#page-110-0) is described in the chapter Examination of the effectiveness of Supervisory Board work.\n\nThe Chair of the Supervisory Board consults, on a regular basis, with the shareholder and employee representatives on the Supervisory Board, also outside the meetings, and arranges talks to prepare for the Supervisory Board meetings as necessary. Separate pre-meetings of shareholder and employee representatives also take place regularly before the ordinary meetings of the full Supervisory Board.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-97-0\"></span>Image /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The targets include qualification requirements as well as diversity targets. Furthermore, members shall have sufficient time, as well as the personal integrity and suitability of character, to exercise their office. In addition, more than half the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be independent. The targets, including the qualification requirements, are reviewed by the Supervisory Board regularly, at least annually, and modified as necessary. The status of implementation can be seen in the qualification matrix at the end of this statement.\n\nIn the reporting year, the Supervisory Board reviewed the specific targets at the recommendation of the Nomination Committee and refined them, so that the competences \"Strategy\" and \"Sustainability\" are shown separately in the qualification matrix from this reporting year onwards. In this way, the Supervisory Board has made the qualification matrix even more transparent, and in particular it also shows in which ESG areas the respective Supervisory Board members have sustainability experience. The Supervisory Board, supported by the Nomination Committee, also examined the targets for the overall board and for the individual members and confirmed that they had been met.\n\n# Qualification requirements\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nGiven their knowledge, skills and professional experience, members of the Supervisory Board shall have the ability to perform the duties of a supervisory board member in a company with international business activities. The Supervisory Board has determined necessary basic competencies and particular competencies. The particular competences are derived from the business model, the corporate targets, as well as from specific regulations applicable to Deutsche Börse Group.\n\n# Basic competencies\n\nIdeally, each Supervisory Board member has the following basic competencies:\n\n- Understanding of business issues\n- Analytical and strategic skills\n- Understanding of the corporate governance system\n- Knowledge of the financial sector\n- Understanding of Deutsche Börse AG's activities\n- Understanding of Deutsche Börse Group's structure\n- Understanding of sustainability matters as relevant to Deutsche Börse AG\n- Understanding of the member's own position and responsibilities\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

At least two of its members should have sound knowledge, especially concerning the following topics:\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\n- Capital markets, business models of stock exchanges and data business\n- Clearing, settlement and custody business\n- Information technology and security, digitalisation\n- Strategy\n- Sustainability\n- Accounting, finance and audit\n- Risk management and compliance\n- Regulatory requirements, law\n\nThe current composition of the Supervisory Board fulfils these criteria concerning the qualification of its members. The requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the GCGC for professional knowledge of accounting and auditing in the Audit Committee are also met. Barbara Lambert, the Chair of the Audit Committee, has the necessary professional knowledge of both auditing and accounting. The same applies to Michael Rüdiger, a member of the Audit Committee, who also has the necessary specialist knowledge of both auditing and accounting.\n\nBarbara Lambert studied economics in Switzerland, where she also obtained her diploma as an auditor. As an active auditor of financial statements and banks over many years, she can draw on extensive experience of conducting and managing audit activities, particularly in the financial sector. She continues to update her auditing knowledge on a regular basis to this day. In addition to chairing the Audit Committee of Deutsche Börse AG, Barbara Lambert is a member or chair of the following audit and risk committees of boards of directors and supervisory boards: Implenia AG (since 2019), Synlab AG (since 2021, mandate will be resigned as of 31 March 2024), Merck KGaA (since\n\n2023) and of the two companies UBS Switzerland AG (since 2022) and Credit Suisse (Switzerland) AG (since 2023), which belong to the same group of companies. In these functions, she regularly attends the training sessions offered by the respective companies. Alongside her work on boards of directors and supervisory boards, Barbara Lambert is a member of many relevant professional associations and networks, such as the Swiss expert association for auditing, tax and trusts (EXPERTsuisse), where in 2007 she was also a member of the expert group for bank auditing, and the German Audit Committee Chair Network of the Audit Committee Institute e.V. Her membership of these associations and networks serves not only the professional exchange but also her further professional training.

The shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board therefore decided that at least half the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be independent. Supervisory Board members are considered to be independent within the meaning of C.6 GCGC if they are independent of the company and its Executive Board and independent of any controlling shareholder. In particular, Supervisory Board members are no longer to be considered independent if they have a personal or business relationship with the company or its Executive Board that may cause a substantial (and not merely temporary) conflict of interest. According to recommendation C.7 GCGC, more than half the shareholder representatives shall be independent of the company and the Executive Board.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nIn the opinion of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, all of them are independent.\n\n# Diversity concept for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe diversity concept for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, as adopted by the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 289f (2) no. 6 HGB, has the objective of ensuring a wide range of perspectives and experience through the composition of both bodies. The concept is implemented within the scope of selecting and appointing new Executive Board members or regarding proposals for election of new Supervisory Board members.\n\n# Flexible age limit and term of office\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nThe Supervisory Board considers the flexible age limit stipulated in its bylaws (generally 70 years) when nominating candidates for election by the Annual General Meeting. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board's bylaws provide for a general limitation to members' maximum term of office to twelve years, which the Supervisory Board shall also consider in its nominations of candidates to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe flexible age limit for members of the Executive Board provides for the term of office to expire at the end of the month during which a member reaches the age of 60 years. An Executive Board member may be reappointed for one year at a time from the month in which they reach the age of 60. The last period of office should, nevertheless, end at the close of the month in which the Executive Board member turns 65. When appointing members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board pursues the objective of achieving an optimal composition of the Executive Board from the company's perspective. In this context, experience and industry knowledge, as well as professional and personal qualifications, play a major role. Depending on the Executive Board position to be filled, it is not just the scope and depth of skills that is decisive, but also whether the specific skills are up to date. The flexible age limit has been deliberately worded to preserve the Supervisory Board's flexibility in taking decisions on appointments.\n\nAt present, no Executive Board member has passed the age limit of 65 years.\n\nTheodor Weimer's term of office as Chairman of Deutsche Börse AG's Executive Board runs until 31 December 2024. Theodor Weimer will reach the age of 65 in 2024. Gregor Pottmeyer's term of office as CFO of Deutsche Börse AG runs until 30 September 2025. Gregor Pottmeyer will reach the age of 63 in 2025. While maintaining the general rule on a flexible age limit, the Supervisory Board decided, in view of their long-standing experience and knowledge of the sector and professional and personal qualifications, not to renew\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

Working at our company means collaborating with colleagues across over 56 locations from 131 nations. We are proud of the diverse cultural, professional and personal backgrounds of our colleagues around the globe. We are committed to maintaining, supporting and fostering the diverse and inclusive culture of Deutsche Börse AG across all diversity dimensions.\n\nRegulations require us to consider one aspect of this diversity in particular detail in this report: the share of women holding management positions.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG meets the statutory requirements for the proportion of women on the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. This applies particularly to the diversity requirements for the Executive Board that have been in force since 2021.\n\nSome 37.5 per cent of the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board are women and the Supervisory Board is determined to further increase this share.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also determined to increase the proportion of women on the Executive Board, taking the current appointments into consideration. Currently, there is one female member on the board.\n\nFuture personnel decisions will take this into account.\n\nIn detail: with regard to the Supervisory Board, the legally binding gender quota of 30 per cent in accordance with section 96 (2) AktG applies. In order to prevent any discrimination of either shareholder representatives or employee representatives, and in order to increase the planning security in the relevant election procedures, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have opposed the overall fulfilment of the quota in accordance with section 96 (2) sentence 2 AktG. Thus, the minimum quota of 30 per cent is to be complied with for each gender both with regard to the shareholder representatives and to the employee representatives. Based on the statutory calculation method, this means that at least two women and two men from both the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives must be on the Supervisory Board. There are currently six women on the Supervisory Board: three women among the shareholder representatives and three women among the employee representatives. The statutory gender quota is therefore fulfilled.\n\nA statutory minimum quota for the Executive Board was introduced in the Act to Extend and Amend the Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (FüPoG II) of 10 June 2021. Executive Boards of listed companies with more than three members must include at least one woman and one man (section 76 (3a) AktG). This statutory minimum participation requirement replaces the obligation of companies to set a legally non-binding target quota. Deutsche Börse AG meets these statutory requirements and reports on them in accordance with section 289f (2) No. 5a HGB.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n- Deutsche Börse: [Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0) [Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0) [Economic situation](#page-26-0) [Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0)  [Risk report](#page-63-0)  [Report on opportunities](#page-82-0) [Report on expected developments](#page-87-0) [Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0) [Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n- Deutsche Börse AG [\\(disclosures based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# International profile\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nThe composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board shall reflect the company's international activities. With Dr Andreas Gottschling, Shannon A. Johnston, Barbara Lambert, Charles Stonehill, Clara-Christina Streit and Chong Lee Tan, there are six shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board who are not, or not exclusively, German citizens. In addition, many of the members of the Supervisory Board have long-term professional experience in the international field or are working abroad on a permanent basis. The Supervisory Board will therefore continue to meet the objectives concerning its international composition.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nThe same applies to the Executive Board, where Stephan Leithner holds non-German citizenship, and whose members have gained long-standing international working experience as well.\n\n# Educational and professional background\n\nThe Supervisory Board has set itself the objective of considering an appropriate range of educational and professional backgrounds regarding its own composition, as well as regarding the composition of the Executive Board. In addition to possessing professional experience in the financial services industry, members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board also have a professional background in consultancy, the IT sector, auditing, administration and regulation. In terms of professional education, most members have business, economics or legal degrees, in addition to backgrounds in IT, engineering and other areas. Education and professional experience thus also contribute to fulfilling the previously mentioned qualification requirements for Supervisory Board members.\n\nThe composition of both Deutsche Börse AG's Supervisory Board and Executive Board is in line with the objectives stated above.\n\nThe following qualification matrix provides an overview of how the main targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board are met, and of the extent to which the particular competencies defined in the qualification requirements are present.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The Supervisory Board's Nomination Committee, whose responsibility it is to put forward suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board for its proposals for election to the Annual General Meeting, has therefore dealt in detail with the election by the Annual General Meeting of the shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board in 2024. Michael Rüdiger has decided not to stand again for election to the Supervisory Board. In a resolution dated 6 February 2024, the shareholder representatives on the Nomination Committee proposed eight candidates for election as shareholder representatives by the Annual General Meeting. Seven of the eight proposed candidates are currently Supervisory Board members; one candidate has not been a member to date. The targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board and the qualification requirements were taken into account when selecting this candidate. To this end, the shareholder representatives on the\n\nNomination Committee began by drawing up a long list of suitable individuals. After interviewing the candidates on the long list, the shareholder representatives on the Nomination Committee agreed on a new candidate for the Supervisory Board elections in 2024. Information about all the candidates, including their CVs, will be sent with the invitation to the Annual General Meeting of Deutsche Börse AG to be held on 14 May 2024, and can also be viewed before the Annual General Meeting at www.deutsche-boerse.com/agm.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-110-0\"></span>Image /page/110/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Deutsche Börse AG follows recommendation D.11 GCGC and the guidelines of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on management bodies of market operators and data reporting services providers, and supports Supervisory Board members in this endeavour. For example, it organises targeted introductory events for new Supervisory Board members and workshops on selected strategy, sustainability and current issues or on topics of fundamental importance. In addition to a specific workshop on the Horizon 2026 strategy process, two technology workshops on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity were held in the reporting year. Another two workshops were held on sustainability topics, which dealt with sustainability regulation and the future world of work in sectors relevant to Deutsche Börse AG. One workshop took place on the role of Deutsche Börse Group in the capital markets. Deutsche Börse AG covers the costs of workshops and basic training organised by itself for new Supervisory Board members. They also comprise training events from the Qualified Supervisory Board educational programme that the company designed itself. Deutsche Börse AG also covers the costs of third-party training activities in individual cases. Further information about the Supervisory Board workshops can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\n# Examination of the effectiveness of Supervisory Board work\n\nDeutsche Börse AG regards regular reviews of the effectiveness of Supervisory Board work – in accordance with recommendation D.12 GCGC – as a key component of good corporate governance. The annual effectiveness review is supported by an external service provider every third year, most recently in 2022. The effectiveness review in 2023 took place internally in the third\n\nquarter by means of a structured questionnaire and covered the tasks and composition of the Supervisory Board, collaboration within the Supervisory Board and with the Executive Board, as well as Supervisory Board and committee meetings. In addition, topics relating to the discussion and working culture and how current matters are dealt with by the Supervisory Board were addressed. The review yielded positive results, both in terms of overall effectiveness as well as regarding the audited subject areas. The Supervisory Board discussed the suggestions for improvement that were made, such as giving greater weight to the perspectives of external stakeholders of Deutsche Börse Group and developing the opportunities for exchange within the Supervisory Board, and initiated steps to implement them.\n\n# Long-term succession planning for the Executive Board\n\nTogether with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board ensures that longterm succession planning takes place. For this purpose the Supervisory Board, or its Nomination Committee, regularly – at least once a year – concerns itself with potential candidates for the Executive Board. The Chair of the Executive Board is involved in these considerations, provided that the discussions do not refer to their own succession. The Supervisory Board prepares an applicant profile for vacant Executive Board positions. It takes care to ensure that the knowledge, expertise and experience of all Executive Board members is diverse and well balanced and adheres to the adopted diversity concept. Moreover, the Supervisory Board ensures it is informed regularly about the succession planning at the first level beneath the Executive Board, and provides advice to the Executive Board in this regard.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-111-0\"></span>Image /page/111/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

By 31 December 2023, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and second management levels beneath the Executive Board was planned to reach 15 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively. As of 31 December 2023, the share of women holding positions on the first and second management levels beneath the Executive Board at Deutsche Börse AG in Germany was 15 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively.\n\nChanges at the second management level had an impact on the number of female executives and the achievement of the target percentage at this level.\n\nThe Deutsche Börse Group is highly international, which means that for the development of female managers and appointments to management positions the consideration of a cross-company and cross-country perspective plays an important role. In this context, the Executive Board had set a Group-wide target share of women holding upper management positions (first three management levels below the Executive Board) of 23 per cent by 31 December 2023, and of women holding lower management positions of 30 per cent during the same period. In fact, this voluntary commitment went further than the statutory obligation. Firstly, the target figures determined in this context relate to Deutsche Börse Group worldwide. Secondly, the definition of management levels/positions was expanded to include heads of teams, for example. On a global level, as at 31 December 2023, these quotas stood at 23 per cent for upper management levels and 33 per cent for lower management positions.\n\n# Shareholder representation, transparent reporting and communication\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Among other things, the AGM elects the shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board and decides on formal approval for the actions of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. It also passes resolutions on the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus, capital measures, approval of intercompany agreements, amendments to the company's articles of incorporation, Supervisory Board remuneration, approval of the remuneration system for the Executive Board and the remuneration report, and the appointment of the auditors for the financial statements. Ordinary AGMs – at which the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board give an account for the past financial year – take place once a year.\n\nIn the spirit of good corporate governance, Deutsche Börse AG aims to make it as easy as possible for shareholders to exercise their shareholder rights and exchange views directly with one another.\n\nFor instance, Deutsche Börse AG shareholders may follow the AGM live over the internet and can be represented at the AGM by proxies nominated by Deutsche Börse AG, also by means of electronic communication. The proxies exercise voting rights solely in accordance with shareholders' instructions and can also be reached during the AGM.

A more in-depth discussion takes place particularly if the results are not within the range expected by the Supervisory Board, so for example if the voting differs significantly from that of comparable companies on fundamentally comparable topics. This was not the case in the reporting year for the resolutions taken at the AGM, including the temporary authorisation to hold virtual AGMs.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\nSection 118a (1) AktG establishes that a company's articles of incorporations may stipulate that the Annual General Meeting is to be held online, without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies, or may authorise the Executive Board to adopt the corresponding resolutions.\n\nIn the reporting year the Executive Board decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, on the basis of the transitional provisions of section 26n (1) of the Introductory Act to AktG that the AGM should take place online, without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies. Shareholders were able to follow the entire Annual General Meeting live online and exercise their voting rights, also via electronic communications, by means of postal voting or appointing the company proxies. They also had the opportunity to exercise their rights to speak and obtain information during the AGM by means of a video link, and to submit comments beforehand. Additionally, the company voluntarily published the speeches by the Chairs of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board ahead of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn the reporting year, the AGM of Deutsche Börse AG also decided to amend the company's articles of incorporation and authorise the Executive Board for a limited period of two years to hold the AGM virtually, without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies. For future AGMs, a decision will be taken individually, and taking the particular circumstances as well as the interests of the company and its shareholders into account, as to whether the AGM should be held virtually, and use made of the authorisation. Past experience, as well as the time and expense involved, may also be taken into\n\nconsideration. The Executive Board decided on this basis to hold the AGM virtually again in 2024.\n\nThe company currently intends to structure future virtual AGMs in a similar way to the ordinary Annual General Meeting in the reporting year. In particular, it intends to refrain from accepting and answering questions ahead of the AGM. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members will attend the venue in person for the virtual AGM 2024.\n\nTo maximise transparency and ensure equal access to information, Deutsche Börse AG's corporate communications generally follow the rule that all target groups should receive all relevant information simultaneously. Deutsche Börse AG's financial calendar informs shareholders, analysts, shareholders' associations, the media and interested members of the public of key events such as the date of the AGM, or publication dates for financial performance indicators.\n\nAd hoc disclosures, information on directors' dealings and voting rights notifications, corporate reports and interim reports, and company news can all be found on Deutsche Börse's websit[e www.deutsche-boerse.com.](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations) Deutsche Börse AG provides information about its annual and consolidated financial statements as well as interim reports in conference calls for analysts and investors. Furthermore, a regular investor day is held and Deutsche Börse continuously outlines its strategy and business developments to everyone who is interested, abiding by the principle that all target groups worldwide must be informed at the same time.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

Additional information is published in its half-yearly financial report and two quarterly statements. The annual financial statement documents and the annual report are published within 90 days of the end of the financial year (31 December); intra-year financial information (half-yearly financial report and quarterly statements) is made available within 45 days of the end of the relevant quarter or six-month period. Following preparations by the Audit Committee, the annual and consolidated financial statements are discussed by the entire Supervisory Board and with the external auditors, examined and then approved. The Executive Board discusses the half-yearly report and the quarterly statements for the first and third quarters with the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee prior to their publication. The half-yearly financial report is reviewed by the external auditors.\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nFollowing the recommendation by the Supervisory Board, the Annual General Meeting 2023 again elected PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, (PwC) as the auditors for the annual and consolidated financial statements 2023 and for the auditor's review of the half-yearly financial report in the reporting year. PwC was also engaged to perform a review of the form and contents of the remuneration report during the 2023 financial year. The auditors responsible are Marc Billeb and Michael Rönnberg. They have both been responsible for the audit since 2021. The Supervisory Board's proposal was based on a corresponding recommendation by the Audit Committee, which had obtained the necessary statement of independence from PwC before the election. This states that there are no personal, business, financial or other relationships between the auditor, its governing bodies and audit managers, on the one hand, and the company and the members of its Executive and Supervisory Boards, on the other, that could give cause to doubt the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee checked that this continued to be the case during the reporting period. It also oversaw the financial reporting process in 2023. The Supervisory Board was informed in a timely manner of the committee's work and the insights gained; there were no material findings.

They are the underlying basis for the notes that follow.\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\n# Business and operating environment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n# Business model and general position of the company\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nDeutsche Börse AG is the parent company of Deutsche Börse Group. The parent company's business activities include, first and foremost, the cash and derivatives markets, which are reflected in the Trading & Clearing segment. Deutsche Börse AG also operates essential parts of the Group's information technology. The performance of the Securities Services segment (formerly Clearstream) is primarily reflected in Deutsche Börse AG's business performance via the profit and loss transfer agreement with Clearstream Holding AG. The business and the operating environment of Deutsche Börse AG are largely the same as for the Group. They are described in the section \"Macroeconomic [and sector-specific environment\".](#page-26-0) \n\n# Deutsche Börse AG's course of business in the reporting period\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's sales revenue increased by 3.0 per cent in the 2023 financial year, which was in line with the company's expectations. By contrast, total costs (staff costs, amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment and other operating expenses) rose by 6.7 per cent. EBITDA was €2.7 billion in the 2023 financial year and so was significantly above the forecast for the 2023 financial year of €1.4 billion. Net profit was up by 142.1 per cent compared with the previous year. The financial year was mainly defined by the ongoing geopolitical situation and the resulting market risks, rising inflation and interest rate increases by the central banks. Volatility on stock markets was lower overall than in the previous year, however. The increase in net income is primarily due to non-recurring effects within the result from equity investments. This stems partly from the fact that for the first time profits were recognised at Clearstream Holding AG in the period in which they originated, and partly from reorganisation of Deutsche Börse AG's shareholdings. On the basis of these developments, the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG considers its performance in 2023 to be positive in context.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-115-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n[Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-16-0)\n\n[Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n[Risk report](#page-63-0) \n\n```\nReport on opportunities\n```\n[Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n\n[Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n\n[Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n\n#### Deutsche Börse AG\n\n[\\(notes based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n### [Business and operating environment](#page-114-0)\n\n# Results of operations of\n\n- Deutsche Börse AG [Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-116-0)  Assets of Deutsche Börse AG [Deutsche Börse AG employees](#page-117-0)\n- [Remuneration report of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-118-0) Corporate governance statement in\n- accordance with section 289f HGB\n- Opportunities and risks facing Deutsche\n- Börse AG\n- Report on expected developments for\n- Deutsche Börse AG\n- [Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n#### Performance figures for Deutsche Börse AG\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n| in € m                                   | 2023    | 2022    | Change  |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Sales revenue                            | 1,697.4 | 1,647.9 | 3.0 %   |\n| Total costs                              | 1,280.7 | 1,199.8 | 6.7 %   |\n| Net<br>income from equity<br>investments | 1,764.0 | 524.2   | 236.5 % |\n| EBITDA                                   | 2,698.8 | 1,215.1 | 122.1 % |\n| Net profit<br>for the period             | 2,118.4 | 875.1   | 142.1 % |\n| Earnings per share (€)1                  | 11.44   | 4.76    | 140.3 % |\n\nConsolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n1) Calculation based on weighted average of shares outstanding\n\n# Results of operations of Deutsche Börse AG\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's sales revenue rose by 3.0 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to an increase in sales revenue of €22.9 million in the Trading & Clearing Segment. For more information on the development of the Trading & Clearing segment, please refer to the \"Trading [& Clearing segment\" s](#page-31-0)ection. The other segments mainly relate to the provision of central functions. By contrast, these segments have a material impact on the company's investment income. The breakdown of income by the company's individual segments is shown in the tabl[e \"Sales revenue by segment\".](#page-116-0) \n\nThe company's total costs were up 6.7 per cent year on year. For a breakdown, please refer to the tabl[e \"Overview](#page-116-0) of total costs\". Staff costs rose by 16.2 per cent year on year during the year under review, to €341.4 million. The increase in staff costs is mainly due to the larger number of employees following the opening of new offices in Czech Republic and Ireland. Amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment increased by 0.4 per cent in the year under review. Other operating expenses were up 4.0 per cent year on year. This stems from the opening of new offices and general price increases.\n\nThe result of equity investments at Deutsche Börse AG rose year on year by 236.5 per cent in 2023. It consisted partly of dividend income of €261.7 million (2022: €161.6 million) and income from the transfer of profits of €1,474.1 million (2022: €412.2 million). The higher income from profit transfers is due to the fact that for the first time profits were recognised in the year in which they originated at the level of Clearstream Holding AG and its net income for the year increased as a result. An internal reorganisation within Deutsche Börse Group, which included the contribution and the sale of the investment in ISS HoldCo Inc. to ISS STOXX GmbH and the transfer of the investment in Axioma Inc. to SimCorp A/S as a capital contribution, resulted in an overall positive effect of €26.8 million in financial year 2023. Impairment losses of €35.9 million were recognised on financial assets, along with writeups of €37.3 million.\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) went up by 122.1 per cent due to the effects mentioned above. Net income for the period amounted to €2,118.4 million, an increase of 142.1 per cent.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse:\n\n[Fundamental information about the Group](#page-17-0)\n\n[Strategy and steering parameters](#page-21-0)\n\n[Economic situation](#page-16-0)\n\n[Non-financial declaration](#page-43-0) \n\n[Risk report](#page-63-0) \n\n[Report on opportunities](#page-82-0)\n\n[Report on expected developments](#page-87-0)\n\n[Report on post-balance sheet date events](#page-89-0)\n\n[Corporate governance statement](#page-90-0)\n\nDeutsche Börse AG\n\n#### Deutsche Börse AG\n\n[\\(notes based on HGB\\)](#page-114-0)\n\n[Business and operating environment](#page-114-0) [Results of operations of](#page-115-0) \n\n# Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG\n\nAssets of Deutsche Börse AG [Deutsche Börse AG employees](#page-117-0)  [Remuneration report of Deutsche Börse AG](#page-118-0) Corporate governance statement in accordance with section 289f HGB Opportunities and risks facing Deutsche Börse AG\n\nReport on expected developments for\n\nDeutsche Börse AG\n\n[Takeover-related disclosures](#page-119-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Sales revenue by segment\n\nExecutive Board & Supervi-\n\nsory Board\n\n| in €m                                 | 2023    | 2022    | Change  |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Trading<br>& Clearing                 | 1,523.9 | 1,501.0 | 1.5 %   |\n| Securities Services                   | 107.8   | 116.3   | - 7.3 % |\n| Fund Services                         | 54.6    | 25.9    | 110.8 % |\n| Investment<br>Management<br>Solutions | 11.1    | 4,7     | 136.2 % |\n| Total                                 | 1,697.4 | 1,647.9 | 3.0 %   |\n\nCombined management report Corporate governance statement Consolidated financial statements and notes\n\nRemuneration report Further information\n\n### Overview of total costs\n\n| in €m                               | 2023    | 2022    | Change |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Staff costs                         | 341.4   | 293.9   | 16.2 % |\n| Depreciation<br>and<br>amortisation | 73.9    | 73.6    | 0.4 %  |\n| Other operating expenses            | 865.4   | 832.3   | 4.0 %  |\n| Total                               | 1,280.7 | 1,199.8 | 6.7 %  |\n\n# Development of profitability\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's return on equity expresses the ratio of net income after taxes to average equity available to the company during the course of 2023. Return on equity rose from 21.9 per cent in 2022 to 49.1 per cent in the year under review. The increase is particularly due to the one-off effect of recognising profits in the year in which they originated at the level of Clearstream Holding AG for the first time.\n\n# Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to €150.4 million (2022: €442.0 million).

There are no other classes of shares besides these ordinary shares.\n\nThe share capital has been contingently increased by up to €17.8 million by issuing up to 17.8 million no-par value registered shares (contingent capital 2019). The contingent capital increase will only be implemented to the extent that holders of convertible bonds or of warrants attaching to bonds with warrants issued by the company or by a Group company in the period until 7 May 2024 on the basis of the authorisation granted to the Executive Board by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 8 May 2019 on Item 8 (b) of the agenda exercise their conversion or option rights, that they meet their conversion or option obligations, or that shares are tendered, and no other means are used to settle such rights or obligations. More details can be found in Article 4 (7) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\nThe Executive Board is only aware of those restrictions on voting rights that arise from Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act). Those shares affected by section 136 AktG are therefore excluded from voting rights. Furthermore, shares held by Deutsche Börse AG as treasury shares are exempted from the exercise of any rights according to section 71b AktG.\n\nUnder the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG, German Securities Trading Act), any investor whose shareholding reaches, exceeds or falls below specified voting right thresholds as a result of purchase, sale or any other transaction is required to notify the company and Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin, German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority). The lowest threshold for this disclosure requirement is 3 per cent. Deutsche Börse AG is not aware of any direct or indirect equity interests in its capital exceeding 10 per cent of the voting rights.\n\nThere are no shares with special provisions granting the holder control rights.\n\nEmployees holding shares in Deutsche Börse AG exercise their rights in the same way as other shareholders in accordance with the statutory provisions and the Articles of Association.\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are appointed and dismissed in accordance with sections 84 and 85 AktG and with Article 6 of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG. Amendments to the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG are adopted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting in accordance with section 119 (1) No. 6 AktG. Under Article 12 (4) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG, the Supervisory Board has the power to make changes to the Articles of Association that relate to the wording only. In accordance with Article 18 (1) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG, resolutions of the Annual General Meeting are passed by a simple majority of the votes cast, unless otherwise required by the Aktiengesetz. Insofar as AktG additionally prescribes a majority of the share capital represented at the time of a resolution, a simple majority of the share capital represented is sufficient where this is legally permissible.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

If there is a change of control, the credit relationship between Deutsche Börse AG and the lenders can be reviewed in negotiations within a period of no more than 60 days. In this process, each lender has the right, at its own discretion, to terminate its credit commitment and demand partial or full repayment of the amounts owing to it. A change of control occurs if Deutsche Börse AG no longer directly or indirectly holds the majority of Clearstream Banking S.A. or if a person or a group of persons acting in concert acquires more than 50 per cent of the voting shares of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\n- Under the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €600.0 million fixed-rate bond issue 2020/2047 (hybrid bond), and the terms of Deutsche Börse AG's €500.0 million fixed-rated bond issue 2022/2048, Deutsche Börse AG has a termination right in the event of a change of control (as defined in the terms of the bond), which, if exercised, entitles Deutsche Börse AG to redeem the bonds at par, plus accrued interest. If Deutsche Börse AG does not exercise this termination right, the affected bonds' coupon will increase by an additional 500 basis points per annum. A change of control occurs if a person or a group of persons acting in concert, or third parties acting on their behalf, has or have acquired more than 50 per cent of the shares of Deutsche Börse AG or the number of Deutsche Börse AG shares required to exercise more than 50 per cent of the voting rights at Annual General Meetings of Deutsche Börse AG.

Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are shown in millions of euros (€m). Due to rounding, actual amounts may differ from unrounded or disclosed figures.\n\nInformation about capital management, which is also part of these consolidated financial statements, is included in the chapte[r Regulatory capital re](#page-76-0)quirements [and regulatory](#page-76-0) capital ratios in th[e Risk report s](#page-63-0)ection in t[he com](#page-16-0)bined [management report.](#page-16-0)\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/133/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons inside.

Such disclosures are focused on applicable accounting options under IFRS. Deutsche Börse Group does not present the underlying published IFRS guidelines, unless this is considered crucial to enhance transparency. The annual financial statements of subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the Group-wide accounting policies based on IFRS that are described in the following. They were applied consistently to the periods shown.\n\nAssets and liabilities and items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and any mandatory disclosures are listed separately if they are material. We define as material a proportion of around 10 per cent of the relevant total.\n\nNew accounting standards – implemented in the year under review\n\nAll the mandatory standards and applications endorsed by the European Commission were applied by us in the reporting year 2023. They were not applied earlier than required.\n\n|                 |                                                                                                                      | Application<br>date | Effects   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| IAS 1           | Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Prac-<br>tice Statement 2 on materiality                                                | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IAS 8           | Clarification on how to better distin-<br>guish changes in accounting policy<br>from changes in accounting estimate  | 1 Jan 2023          | none      |\n| IAS 12          | Amendments with respect to deferred<br>tax relating to assets and liabilities aris-<br>ing from a single transaction | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IAS 12          | Amendments to the international tax re-<br>form – Pillar II model rules                                              | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IFRS 17         | Insurance contracts                                                                                                  | 1 Jan 2023          | See notes |\n| IFRS 17, IFRS 9 | Initial application of IFRS 17 and<br>IFRS 9 – Comparative information                                               | 1 Jan 2023          | none      |\n\n#### The amendment to IAS 1 and IFRS Guidance document 2 on materiality\n\nThe amendment to IAS 1 supplements guidelines for determining disclosures on accounting methods in an entity's financial statements and explains , how an entity can identify material accounting policies. These amendments have no material effect on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n# The Amendments to Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\nThe amendment to IAS 12 (Income Taxes) relates to the recognition of deferred taxes in connection with transactions that give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences on first-time recognition. The amendment makes it clear that the non-recognition of deferred taxes when an asset or liability is recognised for the first time outside a business combination does not apply to these transactions.

The reform project known as Pillar II Model Rules pursues the goal of ensuring effective minimum taxation of profits of affected multinational corporations at 15 per cent per jurisdiction. The aim is to limit international tax competition and ensure fair and appropriate taxation.\n\nThe Pillar II Model Rules were published by the OECD in December 2021 and on 12 December 2022 the EU member states agreed on a directive for the effective minimum taxation of multinational corporations that has to be transposed into national law by 31 December 2023. The German parliament passed the Minimum Taxation Directive - Transposition Act on 10 December 2023 with effect for financial years starting on or after 01 January 2024; corresponding rules also apply in the great majority of jurisdictions outside the EU that are relevant for us.\n\nSince our subsidiaries and permanent establishments are predominantly domiciled in jurisdictions whose nominal tax rate is above the minimum tax rate of 15 per cent, we do not expect any material tax impact for 2024, the first year of application.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 12 provide for a temporary exemption from the obligation to recognise deferred taxes in connection with the introduction of the global minimum tax rate.\n\n### IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\"\n\nThe new accounting standard IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts) was published in May 2017 and replaces the IFRS 4 standard. Generally speaking, the new standard is not only relevant to insurance companies, but to all entities that issue insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. It is not relevant for accounting by the insured party, however. IFRS 17 aims for the consistent, rules-based accounting treatment of insurance contracts and provides for insurance liabilities to be measured at their current settlement value. Furthermore, the objective is to form a uniform basis regarding the recognition, measurement and presentation of insurance contracts, including the notes. The standard is applicable in the EU for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 The standard was endorsed by the EU on 23 November 2021. The revised version of IFRS 17 has no impact on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n## New accounting standards – not yet implemented\n\nThe IASB issued the following new or amended standards and interpretations, which were not applied in the consolidated financial statements, because endorsement by the EU was still pending or the application was not mandatory. The new or amended standards and interpretations must be applied for financial years beginning on or after the respective effective date. Even though early application may be permitted for some standards, Deutsche Börse Group does not usually use any early application options.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n[Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n#### Standard/Amendment/Interpretation\n\n|                  |                                                                                                                                                     | Application<br>date | Effect   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| IAS 1            | Amendments in classification of liabilities<br>as current or non-current and amend-<br>ments in the classification of liabilities<br>with covenants | 1 Jan 2024          | See note |\n| IAS 7 and IFRS 7 | Amendment to supplier finance arrange-<br>ments disclosure                                                                                          | 1 Jan 2024          | non      |\n| IAS 21           | Amendments affecting guideline IAS 21:<br>lack of exchangeability                                                                                   | 1 Jan 2025          | non      |\n| IFRS 16          | Amendments in the accounting for lease<br>liabilities in sale and leaseback transac-<br>tions on seller/lessee                                      | 1 Jan 2024          | See note |\n\n# The amendment to IAS 1 Amendments to the Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Amendments to the Classification of Liabilities with Covenants\n\nThe amendments relate to the classification of liabilities with covenants. The IASB clarified that covenants that have to be met before or on the reporting date may have an effect on classification as current or non-current. Covenants that only have to be met after the reporting date do not affect the classification, however. Rather than being considered as part of the classification, any such covenants should be disclosed in the notes. This is intended to enable users of financial statements to judge whether non-current liabilities could become due within twelve months. These amendments have no material effect on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n# Amendments to IFRS 16 concerning accounting by the seller-lessee for liabilities under sale and leaseback transactions.\n\nThe amendments relate to the measurement of lease liabilities under sale and leaseback transactions and require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in such a way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The new examples explain various different procedures, particularly for variable lease payments. The amendments are applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The IASB permits the amendments to be applied earlier, subject to an EU endorsement. These amendments are not expected to have an impact on the Group's financial performance or financial position.\n\n# 02 Consolidation principles\n\nIntra-Group assets and liabilities are eliminated. Income arising from intra-Group transactions is netted against the corresponding expenses. Intercompany profits or losses arising from deliveries of intra-Group goods and services, as well as dividends distributed within the Group, are eliminated. Deferred taxes for consolidation adjustments are recognised where these are expected to reverse in subsequent years.\n\nInterests in equity attributable to non-controlling shareholders are presented under \"non-controlling interests\" within equity. Where these are classified as \"puttable instruments\", they are reported under \"liabilities\" at cost.\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n- [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n- the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n- [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Currency translation\n\nTransactions denominated in a currency other than a company's functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. Monetary balance sheet items in foreign currencies are measured at the exchange rate on the reporting date. Non-monetary balance sheet items recognised at historical cost are measured at the exchange rate on the transaction date. By contrast, non-monetary balance sheet items measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the valuation date. Exchange rate differences for monetary balance sheet items are recognised either as other operating income or expenses, or as the result of banking and similar business or as result from financial investments in the period in which they arise, unless the underlying transactions are hedged. In the case of equity instruments designated at FVOCI, the exchange rate differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nBalance sheet items of entities whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into the reporting currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated into euros at the spot rate and equity items at historical rates. The positions in the consolidated income statement are converted at average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting exchange differences are recognised directly in \"revaluation surplus\". Resulting exchange differences are recognised without effect on profit or loss in the revaluation reserve. When the relevant subsidiary is sold, these exchange rate differences are recognised in the net profit for the period in which the deconsolidation gain or loss is realised.\n\nThe following euro exchange rates of consequence to Deutsche Börse Group were applied:\n\n#### Exchange rates\n\n|                  |               | Average rate<br>2023 | Average rate<br>2022 | Closing price<br>as<br>at<br>31<br>Dec<br>2023 | Closing price<br>as<br>at 31<br>Dec<br>2022 |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Swiss francs     | CHF<br>(Fr.)  | 0.9736               | 1.0030               | 0.9306                                         | 0.9864                                      |\n| US dollars       | USD<br>(US\\$) | 1.0810               | 1.0524               | 1.1065                                         | 1.0671                                      |\n| Czech koruna     | CZK<br>(Kč)   | 24.0165              | 24.5458              | 24.6996                                        | 24.1469                                     |\n| Singapore dollar | SGD (S\\$)     | 1.4506               | 1.4491               | 1.4594                                         | 1.4309                                      |\n| British pound    | GBP<br>(£)    | 0.8712               | 0.8547               | 0.8683                                         | 0.8850                                      |\n| Danish kroner    | DKK<br>(dKr.) | 7.4493               | 7.4398               | 7.4542                                         | 7.4364                                      |\n\nAny goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising from initial consolidation are reported in the functional currency of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\n### Net investments in a foreign operation\n\nTranslation differences from a monetary item that is part of a net investment of Deutsche Börse Group in a foreign operation are initially recognised in the revaluation reserve and are reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement when the net investment is sold.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Deutsche Börse AG controls a company if it is exposed to variable returns resulting from its involvement with the company in question or has rights to such returns and is able to influence them by using its power over the company.\n\nInitial consolidation of subsidiaries in the course of business combinations uses the purchase method. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their acquisition date fair values. Any excess of cost over the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the subsidiary's net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is reported in subsequent periods at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Non-controlling interests are measured at the acquisition date by the corresponding proportion of the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity.\n\nDeutsche Börse AG's equity interests in subsidiaries and associates included in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 are presented in the list of shareholdings i[n note](#page-230-0) 34.\n\n## Material acquisitions\n\n### Acquisition of SimCorp A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark (SimCorp)\n\nOn 22 September 2023 Deutsche Börse announced the final result of the public takeover offer for SimCorp A/S , Copenhagen, Denmark (SimCorp). Including the shares bought directly on the market, Deutsche Börse held more than 90 per cent of all SimCorp shares (not including treasury shares held by SimCorp).\n\nAfter the successful completion of the public takeover on Friday, 29 September 2023, Deutsche Börse AG exercised its right to acquire all the SimCorp shares from the remaining minority shareholders (Squeeze-out). Since 31 October 2023 Deutsche Börse AG holds 100 per cent of the outstanding shares in SimCorp.\n\nSimCorp and its subsidiaries have been fully consolidated in Deutsche Börse Group since 29 September 2023. The SimCorp business was allocated to the new Investment Management Solutions segment from the fourth quarter of 2023 onwards, where the activities of the previous Data & Analytics segment are also reported.\n\nInitial consolidation of SimCorp in the consolidated financial statements took place using the purchase method. Significant revenue and cost synergies are expected from the transaction, which are reflected in the goodwill resulting from the transaction.\n\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities of SimCorp are recognised at fair value on the acquisition date. Any excess of cost over the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the subsidiary's net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is reported in subsequent periods at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe purchase price allocation was based on a preliminary basis, as it was not yet possible to make a final determination, particularly with regards to taxes and intangible assets.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-138-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n- [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n- the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n| (SimCorp)                             |                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| in €m                                 | Preliminary goodwill calculation<br>29 Sep 2023 |\n| Consideration transferred             |                                                 |\n| Purchase price in cash                | 3,747.6                                         |\n| Financial liability1                  | 139.7                                           |\n| Total consideration                   | 3,887.3                                         |\n| Acquired assets and liabilities       |                                                 |\n| Customer relationships                | 848.7                                           |\n| Trade names                           | 359.3                                           |\n| Software                              | 423.1                                           |\n| Property, plant and equipment         | 37.1                                            |\n| Non-current contract assets           | 185.3                                           |\n| Other non-current assets              | 18.8                                            |\n| Deferred tax assets                   | 4.0                                             |\n| Current contract assets               | 86.1                                            |\n| Other current assets                  | 17.1                                            |\n| Trade receivables                     | 79.0                                            |\n| Acquired bank balances                | 54.8                                            |\n| Deferred tax liabilities              | – 390.2                                         |\n| Miscellaneous non-current liabilities | – 49.6                                          |\n| Contract liabilities                  | – 39.8                                          |\n| Miscellaneous current liabilities     | – 82.0                                          |\n| Total assets and liabilities acquired | 1,551.7                                         |\n\nGoodwill resulting from the business combination with SimCorp A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n1) At the acquisition date of 29 September 2023, there was still a financial liability for the planned squeezeout, which was completed on the balance sheet date of 31 December 2023.\n\nGoodwill (not tax-deductible) 2,335.6\n\nThe full consolidation of SimCorp resulted in an increase in net revenues of €198.0 million as well as in an increase in profit after tax of €12.3 million. If the company had been consolidated as at 1 January 2023, this would have resulted in an increase in net revenues of €544.1 million as well as in an decrease of profit after tax of €– 69.3 million, including the financing costs.\n\n# 03 Adjustments\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 Deutsche Börse Group made various changes in presentation and reclassifications in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The published figures as at 31 December 2022 have been adjusted accordingly. These are purely changes in presentation, which had no effect on net income for the period or total comprehensive income.\n\n# Adjustments relating to the SAP S/4 HANA transformation\n\nWe adjusted the structure of the consolidated statement of financial position when the new Group account structure was drawn up in the course of our SAP S/4 HANA transformation, because it is more transparent and logical to present all benefits to employees in separate balance sheet items, in order to emphasise the importance of these obligations. We also brought the presentation within Group equity into line with the current market standard, in order to make the financial information more comparable. The presentation of certain liabilities from clearing transactions was also sharpened.\n\n# Equity\n\n The currency translation reserve previously reported as part of retained earnings will henceforth be reported as part of the revaluation surplus. This resulted in a reclassification to equity of €–145.5 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €–352.1 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statement](#page-132-0)s [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n# [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- The cumulative changes from the revaluation of defined benefit obligations are now reported as part of retained earnings and were previously part of the revaluation surplus. This resulted in a reclassification to equity of €–133.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €–36.3 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\t- Shares granted as part of stock option programmes and settled in equity instruments were not presented uniformly within equity hitherto. Certain programmes were previously presented within retained earnings and will now be presented on a uniform basis in the revaluation surplus. This resulted in a retrospective reclassification of €–3.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €–5.5 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWe have introduced a new non-current and current balance sheet item, \"Employee benefits\" [\\(see note](#page-187-0) 17) to pool pension obligations, other non-current employee benefits and non-current termination benefits. A reclassification from the previous item \"Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits\" of €149.0 million was made retrospectively as at 01 January 2022 and of €23.9 million as at 31 December 2022. Obligations from early retirement benefits, share-based payments and variable remuneration were also reclassified from other non-current provisions. This resulted in a retrospective reclassification of €14.8 million as at 01 January 2022 and of €95.9 million as at 31 December 2022. €30.6 million as at 1 January 2022, and €38.0 million as at 31 December 2022 was also reclassified retrospectively from other\n\ncurrent liabilities for holiday entitlements, flexitime and overtime credits to the new item \"Current employee benefits\". €186.9 million as at 1 January 2022 and €224.9 million as at 31 December 2022 was also reclassified retrospectively from other current provisions for share-based payment, bonus and severance payments.\n\n## Reclassification of clearing liabilities\n\nLiabilities in connection with the processing of clearing transactions that were settled in cash were previously presented in other current liabilities. This difference was identified in the course of the SAP S/4 HANA migration and they were reclassified to \"Other financial liabilities at amortised cost\". This resulted in a reclassification of €74.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €15.1 million as at 31 December 2022. The consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022 was restated accordingly.\n\n## Reclassifications of financial assets and liabilities under sanctions\n\nIn prior years, current financial assets and the corresponding current liabilities to which the Group had no access because of international sanctions were presented in the consolidated statement of financial position. The accounting treatment for these items was revised on the basis of a legal analysis. This reduced the financial assets and financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position by €188.0 million as at 1 January 2022 and by €203.8 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-140-0\"></span>Image /page/140/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

They particularly include performance obligations and methods of revenue recognition. Revenue is measured on the basis of the consideration agreed in a customer contract. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over goods or services to the customer. For information on contract assets and liabilities, se[e note](#page-181-0) 13.\n\n### Sales revenue\n\nWe report our sales revenue on the basis of our segment structure. Revenue recognition for the segments' main product lines, as broken down and reported by us, are described as follows:\n\n# Investment Management Solutions\n\nThe Group generates revenue from calculating and marketing indices, which financial market participants use as underlyings for financial instruments or as a benchmark for the performance of investments-. The index offering ranges from blue-chip to benchmark to strategy to sustainability to smart-beta indices. The recognition of revenue for index licences is based on fixed payments, variable payments (usage-based volumes; mostly assets under management) or a combination of the two. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance during the contract term. Revenue is revised when warranted by the circumstances. Increases and decreases in estimated revenue are reflected in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by the management. For two fee components (minimum fee and usage-based fee), a contract liability is recognised and reduced each month based on the usage that has been recognised each month.\n\nSoftware solutions offers its clients risk-analytics and portfolio-construction tools. Customers receive the right to use the intellectual property. The intellectual property licences are granted for software products, which are subsequently referred to as \"SaaS Front Office\" and \"SaaS Middle Office\"(Software as a Service). Revenue generated with SaaS Front Office fees is recognised at a specific point in time because all contractual obligations are fulfilled, and the customer obtains control of the asset as soon as the licence key is transferred to the customer. SaaS Middle Office fees are recognised over time, i.e. the contractual term. Fees are also charged for the maintenance and servicing (summarised as \"Maintenance\") of the software products, which are realised over the contract term. For this purpose, the transaction price for maintenance\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside. From left to right, the icons are a house, a magnifying glass, a left-pointing arrow with a line, a left-pointing triangle, and a right-pointing triangle.\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nis calculated and allocated according to the \"expected cost plus a margin\" approach. Additional costs are capitalised for multi-year contracts when initiating a contract.\n\nESG's product portfolio includes Corporate Solutions, ESG Analytics and Governance Solutions. Most of this revenue stems from fixed-term contracts and recurring services. Revenue is recognised on a pro rata basis over the term of the contracted services to customers. Fees are generally charged in advance, either before the licence starts or periodically over the term of the licence. Proxy voting services are provided at a specific point in time and revenue is recognised accordingly when the contractually agreed service is provided. Fees for exceeding the minimum volumes for proxy research and services in connection with the exercise of voting rights are also variable consideration. Since neither the volume that will be used nor the price of these services can be determined with reasonable certainty when the contract starts, the variable portion of the consideration can only be recognised when the transaction price can be determined. Consideration is generally due 30 days after the invoice date. Upon commencement of the contract, there is an expectation that the period between providing the service and receiving the consideration from the client will be no more than one year, so there is no significant financing component. For multi-year contracts, additional costs of obtaining a contract are capitalised.\n\nSimCorp primarily generates revenues in three categories: revenue from customers that operate and service their SimCorp solution on their own servers (on-premise), revenues from SaaS solutions, and professional services. The on-premise revenues come from licence fees, software updates and support services. The SaaS revenues come from fees for SaaS licences and SaaS services, which comprise services and software updates, operating services, including Platform-as-a-Service/hosting fees, and BPaaS fees (business processes as a service). Generally speaking, licence fees may stem from subscriptions or open-ended licensing agreements. Subscriptions entitle the customer to use the software for a particular period, whereas open-ended software licences give the customer the right to use the software for as long as the contract for software updates and support is in effect. Revenue from licences is recognised as soon as all the contractual obligations have been satisfied, i.e. the licence has been transferred to the customer and the customer has gained control over the software. Revenue for software updates and support is recognised on a linear basis of the term of the contract. SaaS services, which include infrastructure services, operating services, digital portal services, investment accounting services, investment operational services, data management services and regulatory reporting platform services, are recognised over the term of the contract. Fees for professional services result primarily from implementation; revenues are recognised on the basis of work completed for time and service contracts. Fixed fee agreements are recognised on the basis of percentage of completion, unless the customer is obliged to take delivery. Additional costs are capitalised for multi-year contracts when initiating a contract.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Revenue is also generated with clearing and settlement services for over-thecounter (OTC) transactions. This mainly comes in the form of booking and management fees. Fees, as well as any reductions are specified in price lists and circulars. Rebates depend mainly on monthly volumes or the monthly fulfilment of liquidity provisioning obligations in certain products or product groups.\n\nRevenue for transactions in listed derivatives is recognised as soon as contracts are matched/registered and there is no unfulfilled obligation towards the customer. In the case of OTC transactions, posting fees are recognised at novation on a monthly basis. These fees are recognised at a point in time. Fees for the administration of financial derivative positions are recognised over time as the service is provided until the transaction has been closed, terminated or has matured.\n\n#### Commodities\n\nIts product portfolio comprises contracts on power, natural gas and emission allowances, as well as freight rates and agricultural products. Revenue is generated primarily from fees that are charged for exchange trading and clearing of commodities products. Transaction fees are specified in the price list. Rebates are granted primarily in the form of monthly rebates for the provision of a certain volume or level of liquidity. These types of rebates are dependent upon the total monthly volume or the monthly fulfilment of certain liquidity provision obligations. Revenue for transactions is recognised as soon as contracts are matched/registered, i.e. there is no unfulfilled obligation towards the customer.\n\n### Cash equities\n\nContracts for trading and clearing of cash market products in securities are accounted for in the same way as described in the Financial derivatives section. As a general rule, securities intended for trading on the regulated market of Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) are subject to the admission and listing, or inclusion, resolved by FWB's Exchange Management. Deutsche Börse AG, as the operator of the public-sector exchange, charges fees for the admission, listing, inclusion and quotation of securities on the regulated market. Fees charged for the admission and inclusion of securities with definite maturities on the regulated market are realised using the projected useful lives of the underlying securities. Accordingly, the fees charged for the listing of securities on the regulated unofficial market are realised using the projected useful lives of the underlying securities. The method for measuring the percentage of completion of the performance obligation on the basis of projected useful lives is considered appropriate within the meaning of IFRS 15. Listing fees are levied for the activity of all bodies of FWB, which supervise the trading and the settlement of trades as well as ensure the proper functioning of all trading activities (permanent possibility to make use of exchange facilities). Listing fees are recurring fees, which are charged for a service that is delivered over time. Accordingly, revenue is realised on a pro-rata basis. Revenue from fees for listings on the regulated unofficial market is realised in a similar manner.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Foreign exchange\n\nIn the foreign exchange business, revenue is recognised for the entire trading process of foreign-exchange products and the commissions generated from this in the form of trading fees. Revenue is recognised when the contractually agreed service is provided to customers. The fees include discounts on a monthly basis. Such discounts are considered accordingly in the month in which the services are rendered and reduce the sales revenue of the respective period.\n\n# Fund Services\n\nThe Fund services segment provides services to standardise fund processing and to increase efficiency and safety in the investment fund sector. The services offered include order routing, settlement, asset management, custody services and distribution and placement of investments. Processing fees for fund custody and the management of distribution agreements are recognised over time. Transaction-related fees are recognised at the time the agreed service is provided. This occurs when instructions are received and the transactions are processed. The service has been fulfilled at this point in time. Revenue is recognised based on the price specified in the price list and reduced by the corresponding rebates.\n\n# Securities services\n\nThe Group generates revenues from infrastructure services and post-trading services, the settlement of securities transactions as well as the custody and administration of securities. The fees are calculated in accordance with the prices set in the price list as well as with any relevant discounts granted. Customers in the custody business receive the benefit from the service provided and consume it at the same time as the performance is fulfilled during the\n\ncontract period. Fees collected for administrative services, such as corporate events for securities, are recognised when the agreed service is provided to clients. This occurs when instructions are received and the transactions are processed. The service has been fulfilled at this point in time. In accordance with the general terms and conditions, customers authorise direct debiting and consequently no financing component has been identified.\n\n### Result of treasury activities in banking and similar business\n\nThe treasury result of banking and similar business stems mainly from investing surplus liquidity and from the fair value measurement of foreign exchange transactions. It also includes income from exchange rate differences resulting from finance instruments in the banking business. As a result of interest rate policies, we also generate interest income from customer balances held with us (in a negative interest rate environment). Furthermore, this item comprises interest payments made on customer balances (positive interest rate environment) as well as cash investments (negative interest rate environment) and fees for providing customer credit lines. Interest income and interest expenses are calculated, allocated and realised when due, with the applicable effective interest rate on a daily basis. In addition, impairment losses from financial instruments as well as income from the reduction of liabilities relating to the banking business are recognised in this item.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board\n\n### [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Other operating income\n\nOther operating income is income not directly attributable to our typical business model. Other operating income is usually realised when all opportunities and risks have been transferred. Other operating income comprises, for instance, income from subleasing property and income from agency agreements, as well as the reversal of impairments recognised on trade receivables. In addition, valuation effects, such as income from exchange rate differences from non-banking business, are reported under other operating income.\n\n### Volume-related costs\n\n.\n\nThe item \"volume-related costs\" consists of expenses directly related to revenue and which depend directly on the following factors:\n\n- the number of certain trading and settlement transactions,\n- the custody volume and volume of global securities financing,\n- the amount of purchased data,\n- the sales commissions to distribution parties for the distribution of capital investments,\n- revenue sharing agreements and maker-taker price models.\n\nVolume-related costs are not incurred if the corresponding revenue is no longer generated.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Composition of net revenue (part 1)\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>\n\n| Combined management report                                   |                                               | Sales revenue |         | Treasury result from banking<br>and similar business |       | Other operating income |        | Volume-related costs |           | Net revenue |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------|--------|----------------------|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| Consolidated financial statements/notes                      | in €m                                         | 2023          | 2022    | 2023                                                 | 2022  | 2023                   | 2022   | 2023                 | 2022      | 2023        | 2022    |\n| Consolidated income statement                                | Investment Management Solutions               |               |         |                                                      |       |                        |        |                      |           |             |         |\n| Consolidated statement of                                    | ESG & Index                                   | 613.2         | 616.7   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0.3                    | 0.9    | -47.2                | -41.3     | 566.3       | 576.3   |\n| comprehensive income                                         | Index                                         | 230.7         | 235.1   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0.3                    | 0.9    | -25.4                | -20.4     | 205.6       | 215.6   |\n| Consolidated balance sheet                                   | ESG                                           | 254.4         | 250.2   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0                      | 0      | -12.3                | -11.6     | 242.1       | 238.6   |\n| Consolidated cash flow statement                             | Other ESG & Index                             | 128.1         | 131.4   | 0                                                    | 0     | 0                      | 0      | -9.5                 | -9.3      | 118.6       | 122.1   |\n| Consolidated statement of changes in equity                  | SimCorp Axioma1                               | 330.3         | 93.4    | 0                                                    | 0     | 0.8                    | 0.6    | -34.2                | -18.6     | 296.9       | 75.4    |\n| Notes to the consolidated financial statements               | On-premises                                   | 126.7         | 0       | 0                                                    | 0     | 0                      | 0      | -0.1                 | 0         | 126.6       | 0       |\n| Notes on the consolidated income statement                   | SaaS (incl.

Distributions from funds and dividends are recognised in profit or loss when the Group's right to receive payments is established and to the extent that such dividends are not capital repayments.\n\n#### Composition of result from financial investments\n\n| in €m                                                                                                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Result of the equity method measurement of associates                                                             | 1.8    | 6.8    |\n| Result of financial investments measured at amortised cost                                                        | - 1.8  | 0      |\n| Result of financial investments measured at fair value through profit or loss                                     | - 13.8 | 2.1    |\n| Result of derivatives                                                                                             | 2.4    | 2.5    |\n| Result of hedge accounting                                                                                        | - 2.7  | - 1.2  |\n| Total                                                                                                             | - 14.0 | 10.2   |\n| in €m                                                                                                             | 2023   | 2022 1 |\n| Interest<br>income from<br>financial<br>assets measured<br>at<br>amortised<br>cost                                | 25.6   | 8.6    |\n| Interest<br>income from<br>financial liabilities measured<br>at<br>amor<br>tised<br>cost                          | 0.9    | 2.9    |\n| Interest<br>income from<br>financial<br>assets measured<br>at<br>fair value<br>through other comprehensive income | 0      | 0.1    |\n| Result<br>from hedge accounting                                                                                   | 0      | 3.8    |\n| Fair value gain<br>from<br>foreign currency<br>derivatives                                                        | 3.6    | 14.4   |\n| Interest<br>income<br>on<br>tax refunds                                                                           | 5.3    | 2.5    |\n| Other interest<br>income<br>and similar income                                                                    | 11.2   | 0.5    |\n| Total                                                                                                             | 46.6   | 32.8   |\n\nFor changes in financial investments se[e note](#page-163-0) 12.\n\n# 08 Financial result\n\nThe financial result comprises interest income and expenses which are not attributable to the Group's banking business and are therefore not recognised in net revenue. Interest income and expense are recognised using the effective interest method over the respective financial instrument's term to maturity. Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the income can be\n\nmeasured reliably. Interest expense is recognised in the period in which it is incurred. Measurement effects from interest rate derivatives, including interest rate hedges, are also shown in this item. The position also includes measurement effects from foreign exchange derivatives to the extent that they relate to treasury activities in the non-banking business.\n\n#### Composition of financial income\n\n1) The reclassification of fair value gains recognised in other comprehensive income in connection with interest rate hedges was reported under financial income in the previous year. Such interest rate hedges are concluded to hedge the cash flow risk arising from potential interest rate changes. In order to reflect this economic purpose more accurately, the resulting amount was adjusted retrospectively as at 31 December 2022 by €–4.8 million. This led to a reduction of €–4.8 million in financial income in the consolidated income statement as at 31 December 2022 and a corresponding reduction in financial expenses.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n- [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n- the Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n| Composition of financial |  |  | expense |\n|--------------------------|--|--|---------|\n|--------------------------|--|--|---------|\n\n| in €m                                                                   | 2023  | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------|\n| Interest expense from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost2 | 79.5  | 48.5 |\n| Transaction cost of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost    | 7.1   | 1.4  |\n| Interest expense from financial assets measured at amortised cost       | 0.1   | 3.0  |\n| Interest expense from lease liabilities                                 | 8.1   | 6.7  |\n| Fair value loss from foreign currency derivatives                       | 0     | 9.5  |\n| Interest expense on taxes                                               | 7.7   | 15.8 |\n| Expense of the unwinding of the discount on pension provisions          | 2.7   | 1.8  |\n| Other interest expense and non-interest expense                         | 15.5  | 9.3  |\n| Total                                                                   | 120.6 | 96.4 |\n\n<sup>1)</sup> Previous year adjusted, [see note 3.](#page-138-0) \n\n2) This includes €7.8 million (2022: €4.8 million) time value gains from interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments to hedge cash flow risk from bond issues.\n\n# 09 Income taxes\n\nDeutsche Börse Group is subject to the tax laws of those countries in which it operates and generates income. If it is probable that the tax authorities will not accept the disclosed amounts or the legal assessments on which the Group's tax declarations are based (uncertain tax positions), tax liabilities are recognised based on the best possible estimate of expected cash outflows. Tax assets are recognised if it is considered almost certain that they will be realised. The recognition of uncertain tax positions is reassessed if there is a change in the underlying facts or their legal assessment (e.g. change in case law).\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the balance sheet liability approach. The deferred tax calculation is based on temporary differences\n\nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the IFRS financial statements and their tax base that will lead to a future tax liability or benefit when assets are used or sold or liabilities are settled. These differences are used to calculate deferred tax assets or liabilities. The deferred tax assets or liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are currently expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the unused tax loss and interest carryforwards only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities exists, and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\n#### Composition of tax expense\n\n| in €m                                              | 2023  | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Current income tax expense/(-income)               | 645.4 | 478.6  |\n| for the current year                               | 638.9 | 513.2  |\n| for previous years                                 | 6.5   | - 34.6 |\n| Deferred income tax expense/(-income)              | 9.5   | 64.7   |\n| due to temporary differences                       | 9.5   | - 7.4  |\n| due to tax loss and interest carryforwards         | 15.2  | 14.9   |\n| due to changes in tax legislation and/or tax rates | - 5.7 | 7.2    |\n| for previous years                                 | - 9.5 | 50.0   |\n| Total income tax expense                           | 654.9 | 543.3  |\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Allocation of income tax expense to Germany and foreign jurisdictions\n\n| in €m                                 | 2023   | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Current income tax expense/(-income)  | 645.4  | 478.6 |\n| Germany                               | 312.6  | 276.3 |\n| Foreign jurisdictions                 | 332.8  | 202.3 |\n| Deferred income tax expense/(-income) | 9.5    | 64.7  |\n| Germany                               | 19.7   | 62.3  |\n| Foreign jurisdictions                 | - 10.2 | 2.4   |\n| Total income tax expense              | 654.9  | 543.3 |\n\nTax rates of 27.4 to 31.9 per cent (2022: 27.4 to 31.9 per cent) were used in the reporting period to calculate income taxes for the German Group companies.

The useful life of internally developed software releases is generally assumed to be seven years; a useful life of ten years is used as the basis in the case of newly developed systems.\n\nPurchased software is generally amortised based on the projected useful life. The expected useful life is 3 to 7 years, depending on the individual purchase. The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at a minimum at the end of each financial year. If the expected useful life of an asset differs from previous estimates, the amortisation period is adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe other intangible assets were largely acquired within the context of business combinations and refer to exchange licences, trade names,customer relationships and order backlog. The acquisition costs correspond to the fair values as at the acquisition date. Depending on the relevant acquisition transaction, the expected useful life is 5 to 20 years for trade names with finite useful lives, 4 to 24 years for participants, customer relationships and order backlog, and 2 to 20 years for other miscellaneous intangible assets.\n\nStock exchange licences and certain trade names have an indefinite useful life. The intention is also to keep them as part of the general company strategy. Their useful lives are therefore assumed to be indefinite.\n\nIntangible assets are derecognised on disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected to flow from them.\n\n## Impairment tests\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an intangible asset may be impaired. If this is the case, the carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) to determine the amount of any potential impairment.\n\nValue in use is estimated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal, before taxes. For this purpose, discount rates are estimated based on the prevailing pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. If no recoverable amount can be determined for an asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset can be allocated is determined.\n\nIrrespective of any indications of impairment, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use must be tested for impairment at least once a year. Impairment tests on CGUs with allocated goodwill are carried out on 1 October every financial year. If the estimated recoverable amount of the asset or CGU is lower than the respective carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised and the net carrying amount of the asset or CGU, respectively, is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\n#### financial position\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nAt the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to the CGU, or groups of CGUs, that is/are expected to create synergies from the relevant acquisition. If changes arise in the structure of CGUs, for example through a new segmentation, goodwill is allocated taking into account the relative fair values of the newly defined CGUs. Irrespective of any indications of impairment, these items must be tested for impairment at least annually at the lowest level of impairment at which we monitor the respective goodwill. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU, or groups of CGUs, to which goodwill is allocated (including the carrying amount of that goodwill) is higher than the recoverable amount of this group of assets. The impairment loss is first allocated to the goodwill, then to the other assets in proportion to their carrying amounts.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the (groups of) CGUs was determined based on the fair value less costs to sell. The value in use was only determined if the fair value less costs to sell did not exceed the carrying amount. Given that no active market was available for the (groups of) CGUs, the determination of fair value less costs to sell was based on the discounted cash flow method (level 3 input factors). The detailed planning period generally covers a time period of five years; for (groups of) CGUs, which have been allocated an asset with an indefinite useful life, such time period ends in perpetuity. Individual costs of\n\ncapital are determined for each (group of) CGU(s), for the purpose of discounting projected cash flows. These capital costs are based on data incorporating beta factors, borrowing costs, as well as the capital structure of the respective peer group. Pricing, trading volumes, assets under custody, market share assumptions or general business development assumptions are based on past experience or market research. Other key assumptions are mainly based on external factors and generally correspond to internal management planning. Significant macroeconomic indicators include, for instance, equity index levels, volatility of equity indices, as well as interest rates, exchange rates, GDP growth, unemployment levels and government debt. When calculating value in use, the projections are adjusted for the effects of future restructurings and performance investments, if appropriate.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there are any indications that an impairment recognised for non-current assets in previous years (except goodwill) no longer applies. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased and the difference is recognised in profit or loss. The maximum amount of this reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have resulted if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous periods. Deutsche Börse Group does not reverse any goodwill impairments.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income

Development costs for internally developed intangible assets are only capitalised when the definition and recognition criteria for intangible assets according to IAS 38 are met and development costs can be separated from research costs.\n\nDevelopment costs that have to be capitalised include direct labour costs, costs of purchased services and workplace costs, including proportionate overheads that can be directly attributed to the preparation of the respective asset for use, such as costs for the infrastructure of software development.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/157/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons with different icons.

Interest expense that cannot be allocated directly to one of the development projects is recognised through profit or loss in the reporting period.\n\nTotal development costs in the reporting year 2023 came to €323.9 million (2022: €274.5 million), of which €201.5 million were capitalised (2022: €181.8 million).\n\nImpairment testing in 2023 revealed an impairment loss of €33.5 million (2022: €20.4 million), which is shown in the line item \"Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses\" and relates to the following assets:\n\n An extraordinary impairment test of Crypto Finance AG was performed as at 30 September 2023 because its performance was persistently under plan. This resulted in an impairment loss in the Trading & Clearing segment (recoverable amount: negative) of €24.6 million (customer relations €14.1 million, software €7.6 million and trade name €2.9 million).\n\n Impairment losses of €8.7 million were also recognised for internally developed software in the Securities Services segment and of €0.2 million in the Fund Services segment (recoverable amount: negative) in the fourth quarter of 2023. The reasons for the impairment were that existing functionalities were no longer used and that significant revenues can no longer be generated.\n\nThe change in the internal reporting structure related to the introduction of the new Investment Management Solutions segment (IMS) also caused (groups of) CGU to which goodwill had been allocated to be divided up. Deutsche Börse Group reallocated the corresponding carrying amounts based on the relative fair values. The goodwill, that was allocated to the former group of CGUs Qontigo was partially allocated to the group of CGUs ISS STOXX (80.7 per cent) as well as SimCorp Axioma (19.3 per cent) in the current financial year. The goodwill allocated to the CGU ISS was fully allocated to the group of CGUs ISS STOXX.

The straight-line depreciation method is used. The carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is higher than its recoverable amount. Costs of an item of property, plant and equipment comprise all costs directly attributable to the production process, as well as an appropriate proportion of production overheads. No borrowing costs were recognised in the reporting period or in the previous year as they could not be directly allocated to any particular development project. If it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with an item of property, plant and equipment will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset in question can be reliably determined, expenditure subsequent to acquisition is added to the carrying amount of the asset as incurred. The carrying amounts of any parts of an asset that have been replaced are derecognised. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n### Useful life of property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                                                               | Depreciation period       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| IT hardware                                                                   | 3 to 5 years              |\n| Operating<br>and<br>office equipment                                          | 5 to 19 years             |\n| Leasehold<br>improvements                                                     | Based<br>on lease<br>term |\n|                                                                               | Depreciation period       |\n| Right-of-use - land and buildings                                             | Based on lease term       |\n| Right-of-use - IT hardware, operating and office equipment as well as carpool | Based on lease term       |\n\n# Measurement of right-of-use assets\n\nWe lease a large number of different assets. These mainly include buildings and cars. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost. Any accumulated depreciation and impairment amounts are deducted from the cost of right-of-use assets as part of subsequent measurement. This does not apply to short-term leases with a term of not more than 12 months and leases for low-value assets. Expenses in the reporting year resulting from the above-mentioned shortterm and low-value assets are reported in other operating expenses.\n\n#### Useful life of property, plant and equipment\n\nAs a lessor in the case of an operating lease, we present the leased asset as an item of property, plant and equipment and measure the asset at amortised cost.

For details regarding the corresponding lease liabilities, please see note 12.\n\n# 12 Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets\n\n# Additions and disposals\n\nFinancial assets are recognised when the Group or one of its companies becomes party to a financial instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are generally recognised and derecognised at the trade date. Purchases and sales of debt instruments classified as \"at amortised cost\" and of equities eligible for clearing via the central counterparties (CCPs) of Deutsche Börse Group are recognised and derecognised at the settlement date. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or when the company transfers these rights in a transaction that transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets.\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. acts as a principal in securities borrowing and lending transactions in the context of the ASLplus securities lending system and is an intermediate between lender and borrower without becoming a contracting party from an economic perspective. Consequently, these transactions are not recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n# First-time measurement and classification\n\nFinancial assets are first recognised at fair value. For financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss the recognised amount also includes transaction costs that can be allocated directly to the acquisition of this asset. Transaction costs of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are expensed.\n\nFinancial assets are classified at the acquisition date, from which subsequent measurement is derived. We assign financial assets to the following measurement categories:\n\n- At fair value (either at \"fair value through other comprehensive income\" (FVOCI) or \"fair value through profit or loss\" (FVPL))\n- At amortised cost (aAC)\n\nDebt instruments are allocated on the basis of the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Debt instruments are only reclassified if the business model for managing them is changed. We do not make use of the option to designate debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition (fair value option).\n\nThe classification of investments in equity instruments not held for trading depends on whether the option of designating the corresponding financial assets as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI option) is used on initial recognition. Each individual equity instrument can be allocated separately and may not be changed in subsequent periods.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/164/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

Interest income from these financial assets is measured using the effective interest method. Gains and losses from derecognition, impairment and exchange rate movements are recognised through profit or loss. Measurement effects are shown in banking business or nonbanking business depending on how the financial assets are allocated. For financial assets from banking business all measurement effects are shown in the treasury result of banking and similar business. Interest income from the non-banking business is shown in the financial result. All other effects of non-banking business are presented in result from financial investments. All effects relating to the measurement of trade receivables are shown in other operating income and expenses.\n- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Investments in debt instruments allocated to the \"hold and sell\" business model and whose cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest are measured as at fair value through other comprehensive income. Impairments on these debt instruments are recognised as result from financial investments through profit or loss. On disposal of these debt instruments all the balances in the revaluation surplus are reclassified to result from financial investments through profit or loss. Interest income from fixed income debt securities in this category are shown in the financial result.\n\n Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL): Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for measurement at amortised cost or at FVOCI, are measured at FVPL and their measurement effects are shown in result from financial investments. Distributions from fund interests are also shown in result from financial investments. Interest income from fixed income bonds in this category are shown in the financial result.\n\n### Subsequent measurement of equity instruments\n\nAs a rule, equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). For certain equity instruments we used the irrevocable FVOCI option on acquisition, so that gains and losses there are recognised in other comprehensive income. When the item is derecognised the gains and losses are not recycled through profit or loss, but reclassified to retained earnings. Dividends from these financial assets are shown in result from financial investments.\n\n### Impairment\n\nAs a rule, any impairment for expected credit losses for debt instruments or balances on nostro accounts for which the simplified impairment model does not apply, and which are carried at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income is determined using the three-stage impairment model in IFRS 9. The losses represent a forward-looking measurement of future losses that are generally subject to estimates.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\n#### financial position\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- Stage 1: The impairment upon initial recognition is measured on the basis of the expected losses in the event of default within the next twelve months after the reporting date.\n- Stage 2: If a financial asset's credit risk has increased significantly, the expected credit loss is determined over the entire term. A significant increase in credit risk is determined individually using internal ratings. A significant increase in the credit risk is assumed if an asset is downgraded by three levels within the internal rating system.\n- Stage 3: Credit-impaired financial assets are allocated to Stage 3 and the impairment is based on the full lifetime expected credit losses. This is the case if there are observable data of significant financial difficulties and there is a high risk of default, even if the definition of a default has not yet been met.\n\nIf the credit risk for debt instruments at amortised cost and at fair value through profit or loss or for balances on nostro accounts for which the simplified impairment model does not apply, is low in absolute terms as at the reporting date, they remain in Stage 1 even if the default risk has increased.\n\nWe have the following two triggers to identify a default event and which cause a transfer to Stage 3 of the model:\n\n- Legal default event: A contracting party of the Group is unable to fulfil its contractual obligations due to its insolvency.\n- Contractual default event: A contracting party of the Group is unable or unwilling to fulfil its contractual obligations in a timely manner. The non-fulfilment of the contractual obligation could result in a financial loss for us.\n\nWe measure the expected credit losses for trade receivables using a simplified approach, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognised from initial recognition of a receivable. Due to the high recovery rate for trade receivables with a due date of less than 360 days, a default is assumed for amounts which are overdue for more than 360 days.\n\nA detailed list of expected credit losses is shown i[n note](#page-211-0) 24.\n\n# Financial liabilities\n\n## Additions and disposals\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised when a Group company becomes a party to the financial instrument. Purchases and sales of equities via the central counterparty Eurex Clearing AG are recognised at the settlement date analogous to financial assets. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation has been extinguished because it has been discharged or cancelled or has expired.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial liabilities not held for trading are accounted for at amortised cost. The borrowing costs associated with the placement of financial liabilities are included in the carrying amount and accounted for using the effective interest method if they are directly attributable. Discounts are amortised over the term of the liabilities using the effective interest method. Liabilities for the acquisition of non-controlling shares settled in cash or another financial asset are recognised at the present value of the future purchase price. The effect of the present value of accrued interest on the financial obligation and all measurement changes in the obligation is subsequently measured through profit or loss. The equity interest attributable to non-controlling shareholders underlying the transaction is accounted for as if it had already been acquired at the time of the transaction.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)\n- financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nContingent purchase payments recognised by the purchaser of a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 are not measured at amortised cost. The resulting financial liabilities are recognised at fair value. With a contingent purchase price component the purchaser is obliged to transfer additional assets or shares to the seller if certain conditions are met. Subsequent measurement is at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nWe do not make use of the option to designate financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition (fair value option).\n\nOur exposure to various risks associated with the financial instruments is discussed i[n note 24. T](#page-211-0)he maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above.\n\n## Presentation and netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position are divided into non-current and current. They are presented as non-current if the remaining term is more than twelve months as at the reporting date. They are presented as current assets if the remaining term is less than twelve months.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and only the net amount is presented in the consolidated balance sheet when a Group company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n# Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe derivative financial instruments we use include interest rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange options.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is taken out. The Group applies the provisions of IFRS 9 to account for hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting. When a hedging transaction takes place the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item is documented in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9.\n\nAll other derivative transactions serve mainly to hedge foreign exchange risks in economic hedging relationships. They are classified as \"held for trading\" for accounting purposes and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period at fair value through profit or loss. Depending on the type of transaction, gains and losses from the subsequent measurement are either recognised in the result of treasury activities in banking business and similar business, in result from financial investments or in the financial result.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n- [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting\n\nAs in the previous year, in the reporting year we used cash flow hedge accounting for hedges of foreign exchange risk on highly likely transactions and to hedge translation effects for monetary items within the Group. The cash flow hedge used the previous year to hedge the interest rate risk of a planned security issue was terminated when the bond issue was completed.\n\nThe effectiveness of the hedging relationship is assessed at the beginning and over the entire duration of the hedging relationship to ensure that there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. This entails establishing hedging transactions in which all the relevant contractual parameters of the hedging instrument exactly match those of the hedged item. Hedging of planned transactions may be ineffective if the timing of the planned transaction differs from the original estimate. Ineffectiveness due to changes in our default risk or that of the counterparty to the hedging transaction is deemed to be negligible. Effectiveness is measured regularly as at the reporting dates. The Group uses the hypothetical derivative method for this purpose.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is shown in the reserve for cash flow hedges as part of other comprehensive income; it is limited to the cumulative absolute change in the fair value of the hedged item value since the hedging transaction. Gains or losses on the ineffective portion are recognised directly through profit or loss either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in result from financial investments. The ineffective portion of interest rate hedges is recognised either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in the financial result. If forward contracts are used to hedge planned transactions we designate the entire change in the fair value of the forward, including the forward component, as a hedging instrument. In this case the gains or losses from the effective portion of the change in fair value for the entire future transaction are recognised in the reserve for cash flow hedges as a component of\n\nequity. If the Group uses futures to hedge existing receivables and liabilities, only the spot component of the future is designated. Gains or losses from the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the future are shown in the reserve for cash flow hedges.\n\nChanges in the forward component of the hedging instrument that relates to the hedged item are considered to be hedging costs and shown separately in the reserve for hedging costs in other comprehensive income. The fair value of the forward component not included in the hedging relationship at the time it is designated is written off pro rata temporis over the period of the hedging relationship. The amount written down is recycled from the reserve for hedging costs to profit or loss.\n\nCumulative amounts in the reserve for cash flow hedges are reclassified according to the following methodology:\n\n- If the cash flow hedges serve to hedge a planned transaction, the amount from the hedging instrument that has accumulated in other comprehensive income up to the acquisition date is derecognised from the reserve and treated as part of the acquisition costs.\n- For cash flow hedges of existing receivables and liabilities, the amount that has accumulated in the reserve for cash flow hedges is reclassified to profit or loss in the periods in which there are changes in the hedged future cash flows recognised through profit or loss.\n- If this amount is a loss, however, and the assumption is that all or part of this loss cannot be recouped in future periods, then this amount is recognised immediately through profit or loss.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n Reclassified amounts for foreign exchange hedges are either recognised in the result of treasury activities in banking business and similar business or in result from financial investments. For interest rate hedges recognition is either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in the financial result.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. However, the hedging relationship continues if it was designated as a rolling hedge from the outset. To the extent that the expected transaction is still considered to be highly probable, the expiring positions are replaced by new hedging instruments. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThis item comprises strategic investments which we have irrevocably elected to recognise at fair value through other comprehensive income in this category at initial recognition. The carrying amount as at 31 December 2023 was €222.7 million (2022: €182.8 million).\n\nNone of these financial assets was pledged as collateral. There was an increase of €9.3 million in strategic equity investments in 2023 due to new investments.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0) \n\n- comprehensive income\n- [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0)\n\n[Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0)\n\n[Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n#### [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)\n\n#### financial position\n\n[Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n#### Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n| in €m                                                   | 2023 | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------|--------|\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in other comprehensive income |      |        |\n| Strategic investments                                   | 25.5 | - 37.1 |\n| Debt instruments                                        | 0    | - 0.3  |\n| Total                                                   | 25.5 | - 37.4 |\n\n# Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n### Composition of financial assets at amortised cost\n\n|                                                    | 31 Dec 2023 |          |          | 31 Dec 20221 |           |           |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|\n| in €m                                              | Non-current | Current  | Total    | Non-current  | Current   | Total     |\n| Trade Receivables                                  | 0           | 1,832.2  | 1,832.2  | 0            | 2,289.2   | 2,289.2   |\n| of which expected losses                           | 0           | - 8.3    | - 8.3    | 0            | - 6.3     | - 6.3     |\n| Other financial assets measured at amortised costs | 1,801.9     | 18,046.2 | 19,848.0 | 1,894.7      | 18,670.8  | 20,565.5  |\n| Fixed income securities                            | 1,756.0     | 219.2    | 1,975.2  | 1,782.1      | 522.9     | 2,305.0   |\n| Balances on nostro accounts                        | 0           | 436.4    | 436.4    | 0            | 613.4     | 613.4     |\n| Money market lendings                              | 0           | 16,407.1 | 16,407.1 | 0            | 16,272.6  | 16,272.6  |\n| Customer overdrafts from settlement business       | 0           | 390.5    | 390.5    | 0            | 130.1     | 130.1     |\n| Receivables from CCP balances                      | 0           | 341.5    | 341.5    | 0            | 1,076.6   | 1,076.6   |\n| Other                                              | 45.8        | 251.5    | 297.3    | 112.7        | 55.2      | 167.9     |\n| of which expected losses                           | - 0.4       | - 2.3    | - 2.7    | - 0.4        | - 1.5     | - 1.9     |\n| Restricted bank balances                           | 0           | 53,669.4 | 53,669.4 | 0            | 93,538.3  | 93,538.3  |\n| Cash and other bank balances                       | 0           | 1,655.1  | 1,655.1  | 0            | 1,275.6   | 1,275.6   |\n| Total                                              | 1,801.9     | 75,202.8 | 77,004.7 | 1,894.7      | 115,773.9 | 117,668.6 |\n\n1) Previous year adjusted, see note 3.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/170/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In addition, Eurex Clearing AG clears over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives and securities lending transactions, where these meet the specified novation criteria.\n\n- European Commodity Clearing AG guarantees the settlement of spot and derivatives transactions at the trading venues of EEX group and the connected partner exchanges.\n- Nodal Clear, LLC, as part of the Nodal Exchange Group, is a Derivatives Clearing Organisation (DCO) registered in the United States and is the central counterparty for all transactions executed on Nodal Exchange.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/172/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Purchases and sales of equities and bonds via the Eurex Clearing AG central counterparty are recognised and simultaneously derecognised at the settlement date. For products that are marked to market (futures, options on futures, as well as OTC interest-rate derivatives), the clearing houses recognise gains and losses on open positions of clearing members on each exchange day. By means of the variation margin, profits and losses on open positions resulting from market price fluctuations are settled on a daily basis. The difference between this and other margin types is that the variation margin does not comprise collateral, but is a daily offsetting of profits and losses in cash. Therefore, futures and OTC interest rate derivatives are not reported in the consolidated balance sheet. \"Traditional\" options, for which the buyer must pay the option premium in full upon purchase, are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Receivables and liabilities from repo transactions and from cash-collateralised securities lending transactions are classified as held for trading and carried at fair value.\n\nThe fair values recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are based on daily settlement prices, which the clearing houses determine and publish according to the rules defined in the contract specifications.\n\n#### Composition of financial instruments held by central counterparties\n\n| in €m               | 31 Dec 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Repo transactions   | 118,074.6   | 109,687.8   |\n| Options             | 27,498.0    | 29,323.4    |\n| Total               | 145,572.5   | 139,011.2   |\n| thereof non-current | 7,667.6     | 9,078.4     |\n| thereof current     | 137,904.9   | 129,932.8   |\n\nReceivables and liabilities that may be offset against a clearing member are reported on a net basis.

The hedged items covered by hedge accounting consist of internal Group loans and highly probable planned transactions.\n\nThe effects of foreign currency hedging instruments on the financial position and financial performance is as follows:\n\nThe foreign exchange forwards designated as hedging instruments are for US dollars and are in the same currency as the internal foreign exchange transactions and the highly probable future transactions. Therefore, the hedge ratio is 1:1. The foreign exchange hedging transactions in US dollars are due in 2024.\n\n#### Hedging transactions in cash flow hedges\n\n|                                                                                                                                       | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Foreign exchange derivative<br>in USD                                                                                                 |       |       |\n| Positive<br>market value                                                                                                              |       |       |\n| Carrying<br>amount<br>in €m                                                                                                           | 5.3   | 5.4   |\n| Notional amount<br>in USDm                                                                                                            | 159.0 | 156.0 |\n| Cumulative change in<br>value of hedged<br>items used<br>to<br>deter<br>mine the ineffectiveness of<br>the hedging relationship in €m | 5.3   | 5.4   |\n| Weighted<br>average hedge rate for hedging<br>instruments                                                                             | 1.1   | 1.0   |\n| Negative<br>market value                                                                                                              |       |       |\n| Carrying<br>amount<br>in €m                                                                                                           | 9.9   | 26.8  |\n| Notional amount<br>in USDm                                                                                                            | 227.0 | 340.8 |\n| Cumulative change in<br>value of hedged<br>items used<br>to<br>deter<br>mine the ineffectiveness of<br>the hedging relationship in €m | 4.3   | 24.9  |\n| Weighted<br>average hedge rate for hedging<br>instruments                                                                             | 1.2   | 1.2   |\n\nInterest rate hedges with a nominal volume of €2,000.0 million and foreign exchange hedges with a nominal volume of US\\$ 113.8 million expired in 2023.\n\nThe revaluation surplus for cash shown in other comprehensive income relates to the following hedging instruments:\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/175/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular icons in a horizontal row.

This does not apply to listed equity instruments\n\nThere were no transfers between levels for recurring fair value measurements during the year under review.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/176/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

December 2022 were adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe change in financial assets measured at FVOCI is mainly due to the acquisition of strategic investments in the amount of €9.3 million and positive valuation effects in the amount of €7.2 million, which were recognised in the revaluation surplus with no effect on profit or loss. In addition to the acquisition of fund shares in the amount of €4.7 million and convertible bonds in the amount of €14.2 million measured at FVPL, negative valuation effects in the amount of €16.6 million resulted. The increase in other non-current liabilities measured at FVPL is mainly due to the first time recognition of derivatives that were not in the money on the balance sheet date.\n\nThe unobservable inputs can generally consist of a range of values that are considered probable. The sensitivity analysis determines the fair values of the financial instruments using input factors that lie at the lower or upper limit of the possible range. The fair values of the Level 3 financial instruments would change as follows when using these inputs:\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

The central pillar of the collateral systems is the determination of the overall risk per clearing member (margin) to be covered by cash or securities collateral. Losses calculated on the basis of current prices and potential future price risks are covered up to the date of the next collateral payment.\n\nIn addition to these daily collateral payments, each clearing member must make contributions to the respective default fund (for further details, s[ee \"Risk](#page-63-0)  [report\" se](#page-63-0)ction in the combined management report). Cash collateral is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under \"cash deposits by market participants\" and the corresponding amounts under \"restricted bank balances\".\n\nSecurities collateral is generally not derecognised by the clearing member providing the collateral, as the opportunities and risks associated with the securities are not transferred to the secure party. Recognition at the secure party is only permissible if the clearing member providing the transfer is in default according to the underlying contract.\n\nThe aggregate margin calls based on the executed transactions and default fund requirements after haircuts was €100,990.9 million as at the reporting date (2022: €155,339.1 million), collateral totalling €122,728.5 million (2022: €182,104.6 million) was actually deposited.\n\n#### Composition of collateral held by central counterparties\n\n| in €m                                                 | 31<br>Dec<br>2023 | 31<br>Dec<br>2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Cash collateral (cash deposits)1,3                    | 53,318.6          | 93,067.7          |\n| Securities and<br>book-entry securities collateral2,3 | 69,409.9          | 89,036.9          |\n| Total                                                 | 122,728.5         | 182,104.6         |\n\n1) The amount includes the clearing fund totalling €6,292.8 million (2022: €7,580.5 million), 2) The amount includes the clearing fund totalling €2,709.7 million (2022: €2,481.6 million), 3) The collateral value is determined on the basis of the fair value less a haircut\n\n# 13 Contract balances\n\nThe Group has recognised the following assets and liabilities from contracts with customers:\n\n#### Contract balances\n\n|                      | 31.12.2023  |         |       |  | 31.12.2022  |         |       |  |\n|----------------------|-------------|---------|-------|--|-------------|---------|-------|--|\n| in €m                | non-current | current | Total |  | non-current | current | Total |  |\n| Contract costs       | 10.5        | 11.0    | 21.5  |  | 5.7         | 8.5     | 14.2  |  |\n| Contract assets      | 259.6       | 87.8    | 347.4 |  | 0           | 0       | 0     |  |\n| Contract liabilities | 11.9        | 203.0   | 214.8 |  | 13.6        | 172.0   | 185.6 |  |\n\nContract costs are \"incremental costs of obtaining a contract\" within the meaning of IFRS 15 and include sales commissions.

The €177.8 million included in contract liabilities as at 31 December 2022 was recognised as revenue in the financial year 2023.

similar obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis of actuarial reports. Calculating the present value requires certain actuarial assumptions (e.g. discount rate, staff turnover rate, salary and pension trends) to be made. The current service cost and the net interest expense or income for the subsequent period are calculated on the basis of these assumptions.\n\nThe fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligations, if necessary taking into account the regulations on the upper limit of the value of plan assets in excess of the obligation (so-called asset ceiling), so that the net pension obligation or the asset value from the defined benefit plans results. Net interest expense for the financial year is calculated by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the financial year to the net defined benefit liability determined as at that date.\n\nThe relevant discount rate is determined by reference to the return on longterm corporate bonds with a rating of at least AA (Moody's Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings, Fitch Ratings and DBRS) on the basis of the information provided by Bloomberg, and a maturity that corresponds approximately to the maturity of the pension obligations. Moreover, the bonds must be denominated in the same currency as the underlying pension obligation. Measurement of the pension obligations in euros is based on a discount rate which is determined according to the adjusted \"GlobalRate:Link\" methodology from the advisory company Willis Towers Watson, updated in line with the current market trend.\n\nThe actuarial gains or losses and the difference between the expected and the actual return or loss on plan assets are recognised in other comprehensive income in the revaluation surplus. They result from changes in expectations with regard to life expectancy, pension trends, salary trends and the discount rate.\n\nOther long-term benefits for employees and members of executive boards (total disability pension, transitional payments) are also measured using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses and past service cost are recognised immediately and in full through profit or loss.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/189/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The benefit assets equal the total of the acquired capital components of the individual years and are converted into a lifelong pension once the benefits fall due. In addition, retirement benefit agreements are in place with members of the executive boards of Group companies, under which they are entitled to pension benefits upon reaching the age of 63 and following reappointment. When the term of office began, the replacement rate was 30 per cent of individual pensionable income. It rose by 5 percentage points with each reappointment, up to a maximum of 50 per cent of pensionable income.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Germany\n\nThere is an employee-funded deferred compensation plan for employees of certain Deutsche Börse Group companies in Germany who joined prior to 1 January 2019. Under this plan, it is possible to convert portions of future remuneration entitlements into benefit assets of equal value which bear interest of 6 per cent p.a. The benefits consist of a capital payment made in equal annual instalments over a period of three years upon the reaching the age of 65 or at an earlier date due to disability or death.\n\nIn the period from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2006, executives in Germany were offered the opportunity to participate in the following pension system based on capital components: the benefit is based on annual income received, composed of fixed annual salary and the variable remuneration. Every year, participating Group companies provide for an amount that corresponds to a certain percentage of the pensionable income. The participating companies provide an amount corresponding to a specific percentage of this eligible income every year. This amount is multiplied by a capitalisation factor depending on age, resulting in the \"annual capital component\". The benefit assets equal the total of the acquired capital components of the individual years and are converted into a lifelong pension once the benefits fall due. This benefit plan was closed to new staff on 30 June 2006; the executives who were employed in the above period can continue to earn capital components.\n\nAs part of adjustments to the remuneration systems to bring them into line with supervisory requirements, contracts were adjusted for some executives. For executives affected, whose contracts allowed for the inclusion of only the income received and the variable remuneration above the upper limit of the contribution assessment as pensionable income, the pensionable income was determined on the basis of income received from the year 2016. This is adjusted annually to account for the increase of the cost of living according to the consumer price index for Germany as issued by the Federal Statistical Office. For executives affected whose capital components were calculated on the basis of income received, without observing the upper limit of the contribution assessment, an amount has been determined that will be reviewed annually, and adjusted if necessary, by the Supervisory Board, taking any changes in circumstances in terms of income and purchasing power into account.\n\n#### Luxembourg\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan in favour of Luxembourg employees is funded by means of cash contributions to an \"association d'épargne pension\" (ASSEP) organized in accordance with Luxembourg law. The benefits consist of a one-off capital payment, which is generally paid upon reaching the age of 65. Employees receive an annual account statement showing their current balance. The pension plan does not pay any benefits in the event of death or disability. Contributions to the ASSEP are funded in full by the participating companies. The contributions are determined annually on the basis of actuarial opinions in accordance with Luxembourg law.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/191/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular icons in a horizontal row.

at the reporting date using actuarial techniques. The assumptions for determining the actuarial obligations for the pension plans differ according to the individual conditions in the countries concerned and are shown in the following table:\n\n#### Actuarial assumptions\n\n| in %                 | 31 Dec 2023 |            | 31 Dec 2022 |            |\n|----------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|\n|                      | Germany     | Luxembourg | Germany     | Luxembourg |\n| Discount rate        | 3.18        | 3.18       | 3.73        | 3.73       |\n| Salary growth        | 3.00        | 3.50       | 3.00        | 3.50       |\n| Pension growth       | 2.20        | 0          | 2.20        | 0          |\n| Staff turnover rate1 | 2.00        | 2.00       | 2.00        | 2.00       |\n\n1) Up to the age of 50, afterwards 0 per cent\n\nIn Germany, the \"2018 G\" mortality tables (generation tables) developed by Klaus Heubeck are used. For Luxembourg, generation tables of the Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg are used.\n\nOwing to the current very high inflation rates, pension adjustments in the next two to three years will significantly exceed the assumed (long-term) pension trend. This cumulative inflation (adjustment backlog) was taken into account in the corresponding commitments through the one-off increase in pensions.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis presented in the following considers the change in one assumption of the main plans in Germany and Luxembourg at a time, leaving the other assumptions unchanged from the original calculation, i.e. possible correlation effects between the individual assumptions are not taken into account.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/193/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

At the company's instruction, the trustee uses the funds transferred to acquire securities, without any consulting by the trustee. The contributions are invested in accordance with an investment policy, which may be amended by the companies represented in the investment committee. The trustee may refuse to carry out instructions if they are in conflict with the fund's allocation rules or the payment provisions. In accordance with the investment policy, a value preservation mechanism is applied; investments can be made in different asset classes.\n\n#### Luxembourg\n\nIn Luxembourg, the Board of Directors of the Clearstream Pension Fund is responsible for determining the investment strategy, with the aim of maximising returns in relation to a benchmark. This benchmark is 75 per cent derived from the return on five-year German federal government bonds and 25 per cent from the return on the EURO STOXX 50 Index. According to the investment policy, the fund may only invest in fixed-income and variable-rate securities, as well as listed investment fund units; it may hold cash, including in the form of money market funds.\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n- \n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)\n\nthe Executive Board\n\n[Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\n#### [Executive and Supervisory Board](#page-2-0)\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\nfinancial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### Composition of plan assets\n\n| in €m                               | 31 Dec 2023 | 31 Dec 2022 |       |         |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|\n| Bonds                               | 420.5       | 78.0 %      | 400.1 | 81.0 %  |\n| Government bonds                    | 319.0       |             | 301.0 |         |\n| Multilateral develop-<br>ment banks | 92.8        |             | 82.4  |         |\n| Corporate bonds                     | 8.7         |             | 16.7  |         |\n| Derivatives                         | 6.9         | 1.3 %       | - 0.2 | - 0.0 % |\n| Stock index<br>futures              | 3.7         |             | - 0.1 |         |\n| Interest<br>rate futures            | 3.2         |             | - 0.1 |         |\n| Investment funds                    | 31.0        | 5.7 %       | 30.0  | 6.1 %   |\n| Total<br>listed                     | 458.4       | 85.0 %      | 430.0 | 87.1 %  |\n| Qualifying<br>insurance<br>policies | 49.0        | 9.1 %       | 42.9  | 8.7 %   |\n| Cash                                | 31.9        | 5.9 %       | 20.9  | 4.2 %   |\n| Total not<br>listed                 | 80.9        | 15.0 %      | 63.8  | 12.9 %  |\n| Total plan assets                   | 539.3       | 100.0 %     | 493.8 | 100.0 % |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 the plan assets did not include any financial instruments of the Group (2022: zero). Neither did they include any properties or other assets used by companies in Deutsche Börse Group.\n\n## Risks\n\nIn addition to the general actuarial risks, the risks associated with the defined benefit obligations relate especially to financial risks in connection with the plan assets, including in particular counterparty credit and market risks.\n\n# Market risk\n\nThe return on plan assets is assumed to be the discount rate determined on the basis of corporate bonds with an AA rating. If the actual rate of return on plan assets is lower than the discount rate used, the net defined benefit liability increases accordingly. If volatility is low, the actual return is further expected to exceed the return on corporate bonds with a good rating in the medium to long term. The amount of the net obligation is also influenced in particular by changes in the discount rates. We consider the share price risk resulting from derivative positions in equity index futures in the plan assets to be appropriate. The company bases its assessment on the expectation that the overall volume of payments from the pension plans will be manageable in the next few years, that the total amount of the obligations will also be manageable and that it will be able to meet these payments in full from operating cash flows. Any amendments to the investment policy take into account the duration of the pension obligation as well as the expected payments over a period of ten years.\n\n### Inflation risk\n\nPossible inflation risks that could lead to an increase in defined benefit obligations exist because some pension plans are final salary plans or the annual capital components are directly related to salaries, i.e. a significant increase in salaries would lead to an increase in the benefit obligation from these plans. In Germany, however, there are no contractual arrangements with regard to inflation risk for these pension plans. An interest rate of 6 per cent p.a. has been agreed for the employee-financed deferred compensation plan; the plan does not include any arrangements for inflation, so that it has to be assumed that there will be little incentive for employees to contribute to the deferred compensation plan in times of rising inflation. In Luxembourg, salaries are adjusted for the effects of inflation on the basis of a consumer price index no more than once a year; this adjustment leads to a corresponding increase in the benefit obligation from the pension plan. Since the obligation will be met\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In addition, contributions are paid to the statutory pension insurance scheme. The level of contributions is normally determined in relation to income. As a rule, no provisions are recognised for defined contribution plans. The contributions paid are reported as pension expenses in the year of payment. There are defined contribution pension plans for employees in several countries. In addition, the employer pays contributions to employees' private pension funds.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the costs associated with defined contribution plans amounted to €61.3 million (2022: €54.6 million).\n\n### Multi-employer plans\n\nSeveral Deutsche Börse Group companies are member institutions of BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G., a pension insurance provider with its registered office in Berlin. Employees and employers make regular contributions, which are used to provide guaranteed pension plans, and a potential surplus. The contributions to be made are derived from contribution rates applied to active employees' monthly gross salaries, taking into account specific financial thresholds. Member institutions have a subsidiary liability for the fulfilment of BVV's agreed pension benefits. However, we consider the risk that this liability will be invoked as remote. Given that BVV membership is governed by several Works Council Agreements, membership termination is subject to certain conditions. The notice period for termination is defined in the articles of association of the BVV pension scheme. The employer retains a subsidiary liability for the pension entitlements of every individual employee that have vested as at the termination date. Deutsche Börse Group considers BVV pension obligations as multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. However, we currently lack information regarding the allocation of BVV assets to\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-196-0\"></span>[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n- [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n- [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nindividual member institutions and the respective beneficiaries. Moreover, we do not know Deutsche Börse Group's actual share in BVV's total obligations. This plan is therefore shown in the Group's financial reporting as a defined contribution plan. On the basis of current information published by BVV there is no shortfall that could affect the future contributions payable by the Group. The Deutsche Börse Group is not liable for commitments by other members of BVV.\n\nEPEX Netherlands B.V. participates in the ABP pension fund within the EEX subgroup. Participation is mandatory for all employees. Employer contributions are calculated by ABP and adjusted, if necessary. Since the allocation of assets to member institutions and beneficiaries is not possible, this pension plan can also be presented only as a defined contribution plan.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the costs associated with such designated multiemployer plans amounted to €10.3 million (2022: €10.1 million). In 2024 we expect to make contributions to multi-employer plans amounting to around €10.3 million.\n\n# 18 Share-based payment\n\nShare-based payments for employees, managers and Executive Board members comprise cash-settled remuneration plans and remuneration plans settled with equity instruments. The main remuneration plans at Deutsche Börse Group are described below.\n\n# Stock Bonus Plan (SBP)\n\nThe SBP is open to senior executives of Deutsche Börse AG and its participating subsidiaries. It grants a long-term remuneration component in the form of so-called SBP shares. These are generally accounted for as share-based payments for which Deutsche Börse AG has a choice of settlement in cash or equity instruments for certain tranches. Tranches due in previous years were each settled in cash. In the reporting period, the Deutsche Börse Group established an additional tranche of the SBP for senior executives who are not risk takers. In order to participate in the SBP, beneficiaries must have earned a bonus. The awards are settled in cash and the SBP shares are measured as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The cost of the options is estimated using an option pricing model (fair value measurement) and recognised in staff costs in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe number of stock options is determined by the amount of the individual and performance-based SBP bonus for the financial year, divided by the average share price (Xetra closing price) of Deutsche Börse AG's shares in the fourth quarter of the financial year in question. Neither the converted SBP bonus nor the stock options are paid at the time the bonus is determined. Rather, the entitlement is generally received three years after the grant date (the \"waiting period\"). Within this period, beneficiaries cannot assert shareholder rights (in particular, the rights to receive dividends and attend the Annual General Meeting). Once they have met the condition of service, the beneficiaries' claims resulting from the SBP are calculated on the first trading day following the last day of the waiting period. The current market price at that date (closing auction price of Deutsche Börse shares in electronic trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) is multiplied by the number of stock options. Stock options are settled in cash.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/197/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

This programme was extended in 2016 with the Restricted Stock Units (RSU) plan. The following disclosures relate to both plans.\n\n### Long-Term Sustainable Instrument (LSI)\n\nThe LSI remuneration model requires at least half of a part of the variable remuneration to be settled in cash and half in phantom shares of Deutsche Börse AG (LSI shares). All tranches will be settled in cash. A portion of the variable remuneration is paid in the subsequent year and another portion over a further period of three or four years. Moreover, a portion of the variable remuneration shall be converted into RSU, subject to a three-year retention period after grant and a one-year waiting period (RSU shares). Deutsche Börse Group thus measures the LSI shares as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The options are measured using an option pricing model (fair value measurement). Any right to payment of a stock bonus only vests after the expiration of the one-year service period on which the plan is based, taking certain waiting periods into account.\n\nThe number of LSI and RSU shares for the 2017 tranche is calculated by dividing the proportionate LSI or RSU bonus, respectively, for the year in question by the average closing price of Deutsche Börse AG shares in the last month of a financial year. The number of LSI and RSU shares for the 2018- 2023 tranches is based on the closing auction price of Deutsche Börse shares as at the disbursement date of the cash component of the respective tranche (cash bonus) in the following year or on the closing price as at the following trading day on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. This results in individual LSI\n\ntranches for the LSI bonus, which have maturities of between one and five years. The RSU bonus is used as a basis for another four-year tranche. Payment of each tranche is made after a waiting period of one year. Neither remuneration system stipulates any condition of service. Following the expiry of the waiting period, both the LSI and the RSU shares of the 2017 tranche are measured on the basis of the average closing price of Deutsche Börse AG shares in the last month preceding the end of the waiting period. The LSI and RSU shares of the 2018-2023 tranches are measured at the closing auction price as at the first trading day in February of the year in which the holding period ends. In the reporting year LSI shares from the tranches 2017-2021 were disbursed with a disbursement price of €168.05 for the shares in the tranche 2017. The disbursement price for the tranches 2018-2021 was €166.35. The difference in payout share prices is caused by the nature of the specific terms and conditions for the respective tranches.\n\n#### Restricted Stock Units (RSU)\n\nLike the LSI plan, the RSU plan applies to risk takers within Deutsche Börse Group. RSU shares are settled in cash; Deutsche Börse Group thus measures the RSU shares as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The options are measured using an option pricing model (fair value measurement). Any right to payment of a stock bonus only vests after the expiration of the oneyear service period on which the plan is based, taking a three-year retention period and a one-year waiting period into account. No RSU shares were paid out in the reporting year.\n\n#### Measurement of the LSI and the RSU\n\nTo determine the fair value of the subscription rights, the intrinsic value of the additional pro rata subscription rights is calculated, which also includes an expectation about future dividend payments.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/200/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The number of phantom PSP shares to be allocated is calculated based on the number of shares granted and the increase of net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders, as well as on the relative performance of the total shareholder return (TSR) on Deutsche Börse AG's shares compared with the total shareholder return of the STOXX Europe 600 Financials Index constituents. The shares are subject to a performance period of five years. The subsequent payment of the stock bonus will be settled in cash.\n\nThe 100 per cent stock bonus target was calculated in euros for each Executive Board member. The 100 per cent stock bonus target for selected executives and employees of Deutsche Börse AG and participating subsidiaries is defined by the responsible decision-making bodies. Based on the PSP 100 per cent stock bonus target, the corresponding number of phantom shares for each beneficiary was calculated by dividing the stock bonus target by the average share price (Xetra closing price) of Deutsche Börse AG's shares in the last calendar month preceding the performance period. Any right to payment of a PSP stock bonus vested only at the end of a five-year performance period.\n\nThe final number of Performance Shares was calculated by multiplying the original number of Performance Shares with the level of overall target achievement. The PSP level of overall target achievement was based on two performance factors during the performance period: firstly, on the relative performance of the total shareholder return (TSR) on Deutsche Börse AG's shares\n\ncompared with the total shareholder return of the STOXX Europe 600 Financials Index as the peer group; and secondly, on the increase of Deutsche Börse AG's net profit for the period attributable to shareholders of the parent company. The two performance factors contribute 50 per cent each to calculate overall target achievement. For the 2021 and 2022 tranches the overall target achievement depends on the performance against three different metrics over the performance period. The total shareholder return (TSR) for the Deutsche Börse AG share compared with the total shareholder return for the STOXX Europe 600 Financials Index accounts for 50 per cent. The annual growth rate for adjusted earnings per share over the performance period accounts for a further 25 per cent. The remaining 25 per cent are calculated by reference to performance against four equally weighted ESG targets.\n\nThe payout amount is calculated by multiplying the final number of performance shares with the average share price of Deutsche Börse AG's shares (Xetra closing price) in the last calendar month preceding the performance period, plus the total of dividend payments made during the performance period based on the final number of performance shares. In the reporting year shares from the 2018 PSP tranche were disbursed at a price of €182.30. Until the 2021 tranche, servicing and treatment will be in accordance with the cash settlement rules. Settlement is in cash and with the exception of the 2021- 2023 tranches the transaction is measured and recognised as cash-settled share-based remuneration. Because of their specific contractual conditions the 2021-2023 tranches are treated as a settlement with equity instruments.\n\n#### Measurement of the PSP\n\nTo determine the fair value of the subscription rights, the intrinsic value of the additional pro rata subscription rights is calculated, which also includes an expectation about future dividend payments.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0) [Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement

Under the GSP tranche for the year 2023, the participating employees could subscribe for up to 50 shares of the Company at a discount of 40 per cent and another 50 shares at a discount of 10 per cent. The acquired shares are subject to a lock-up period of two years.\n\nThe expense of this discount is recognised in the income statement at the grant date. In the reporting period, expenses totalling €7.4 million (2022: €6.3 million) were recognised in staff costs for the GSP.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/204/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

It grants a long-term remuneration component in the form of virtual shares in the former Qontigo subgroup. These are generally accounted for as sharebased payments. The remuneration payable to the beneficiaries is intended to reflect the economic development of the former Qontigo sub-group. The MIP contains a time-based and a performance-based component. The vesting period is three years, and under certain circumstances can be exercised early. It began when the transaction was completed. Due to a potential payout with cash by Group Deutsche Börse, the MIP is accounted for under the principles of a cash-settlement.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the virtual shares is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation on the respective balance sheet date, which appropriately reflects the contractspecific conditions. The underlying simulations depend on the underlying from which the payment is linked to the beneficiaries of the MIP. The enterprise value of the former Qontigo Group serves as the underlying. On the basis of the simulations carried out, a discounted average payment of the contractually agreed payment flows to the respective participants is calculated. The main valuation parameters include the enterprise value and the expected volatility of the former Qontigo Group as well as the expected term and the contract-specific payment profile. A pro rata addition of expenses over the vesting period is conducted in accordance with the criteria for a non-forfeiture of the programme.\n\n# ISS Employee Incentive Programme (EIP)\n\nAn employee incentive programme has been set up for selected managers at ISS, which enables a long-term remuneration component in the form of virtual shares in ISS. The programme is accounted for as share-based payments. The amounts awarded to the beneficiaries are intended to reflect the economic development of ISS. The EIP contains a time-based and a performance-based component. The programme will be settled in the first quarter 2024 with shares in Deutsche Börse AG and is accounted for according to the rules for equity settlement.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the virtual shares was calculated at the date of allocation to the beneficiaries, using a Black-Scholes model with contract-specific inputs. The main valuation parameters included the enterprise value and the expected volatility of ISS, as well as the expected term and the contract-specific payment profile. In line with the vesting criteria, the value of the award is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.\n\n#### ISS STOXX Employee Incentive Programme\n\nAn employee incentive programme with market-standards conditions was set up for the senior management of the ISS STOXX sub-group. It grants a longterm remuneration component in the form of virtual shares and a virtual dividend right for the ISS STOXX sub-group. The programme enables the beneficiaries to participate in long-term valuation increases, so the accounting principles for share-based remuneration apply.\n\nThe vesting period is three years, and under certain circumstances can be exercised early. Grants to the programme beneficiaries were made in late 2023 and early 2024. Since the main contractual conditions were agreed with the beneficiaries in 2023 and the employees had already started their work, Deutsche Börse Group started recognising the corresponding expenses in Q3 2023.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/205/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The virtual dividend right is settled in cash, so this component is accounted for in accordance with the rules on cash settlement.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the virtual shares is calculated at the date of allocation to the beneficiaries, using a Black-Scholes model with contract-specific inputs. The main valuation parameters include the enterprise value and the expected volatility of ISS STOXX, as well as the expected term. A pro rata addition of expenses over the vesting period is conducted in accordance with the criteria for a non-forfeiture of the programme. The value of the virtual dividend right is measured at each reporting date using current market parameters.\n\n### SimCorp Employee Incentive Programme\n\nEmployee incentive programmes with market-standards conditions were set up for the senior management and employees of SimCorp, which are settled in cash. They pay a long-term remuneration component in the form of restricted stock units (RSU) with contingent claims during the vesting period. The programme enables the beneficiaries to participate in long-term valuation increases, so the accounting principles for share-based remuneration apply.\n\nThe vesting period is five years from the award date. The first allocations were made to the beneficiaries before Deutsche Börse Group acquired control of SimCorp.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group has the option of changing and/or adjusting the terms of the incentive programme in agreement with the Executive Board of SimCorp on condition that any such changes and/or adjustments do not reduce the overall value of the restricted stock units.\n\n### Valuation\n\nThe value of the restricted stock units was adjusted on the basis of the transaction price reflecting the value of SimCorp at the time of the takeover by Deutsche Börse Group. In line with the vesting criteria, the value of the award is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-206-0\"></span>Image /page/206/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The amount of the provision corresponds to the best possible estimate of the outflow of resources required to fulfil the obligation as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe decline in other current liabilities results primarily from the decline in liabilities from CCP business. These liabilities are not part of the financial liabilities because the obligation does not consist of payment of cash but in physical delivery of commodities.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-207-0\"></span>Image /page/207/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

All current and future tranches may only be settled in cash. There are therefore no potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the Long-Term Sustainability Instrument.\n\nAs part of the employee incentive programmes at Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. as well as SimCorp A/S there are ongoing option rights, which had a small dilutive effect.\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n#### Calculation of earnings per share (basic and diluted)\n\n|                                                                                             | 2023        | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of shares outstanding<br>at<br>beginning<br>of period                                | 183,738,945 | 183,618,782 |\n| Number of shares outstanding<br>at<br>end<br>of period                                      | 185,112,460 | 183,738,945 |\n| Weighted<br>average number<br>of shares outstanding                                         | 184,298,877 | 183,630,715 |\n| Number of potentially<br>dilutive ordinary shares                                           | 290,191     | 354,805     |\n| Weighted<br>average number<br>of shares used<br>to<br>compute diluted<br>earnings per share | 184,589,068 | 183,985,520 |\n| Net profit<br>for the period<br>attributable to Deutsche Börse AG<br>shareholders (€m)      | 1,724.0     | 1,494.4     |\n| Earnings per share (basic) (€)                                                              | 9.35        | 8.14        |\n| Earnings per share (diluted) (€)                                                            | 9.34        | 8.12        |\n\n# 23 Segment reporting\n\nDeutsche Börse divides its business into four segments: This structure is used for the internal Group controlling and forms the basis for the financial reporting.

The effect of intercompany revenue is eliminated (in net revenue) at Group level, however, as the revenue generated within the Group by a segment has the same revenue-reducing effect in the respective segment. For an overview of intercompany revenue [see note 4. S](#page-140-0)ervices between segments are offset on the basis of measured amounts or fixed prices.\n\nOur business model – and that of all our segments – is focused on an internationally operating participant base and pricing does not differ depending on the customer's location. From a price, margin and risk perspective, this means it does not matter whether sales revenue is generated from German or international participants.\n\nThe risks and returns from the activities of the subsidiaries operating within the economic environment of the European Monetary Union (EMU) do not differ significantly from each other on the basis of the factors to be considered in identifying information on geographical regions under IFRS 8. We have therefore identified the following regions: Euro area, other Europe, America and Asia-Pacific.\n\nSales revenue is allocated to the individual regions according to the customer's domicile, while investments and non-current assets are allocated according to the company's domicile and employees according to their location.\n\nAs described above, the analysis of sales is based on the direct customer's billing address. This means e.g. that sales to an American investor trading a product with an Asian underlying via a European clearing member are classified as European sales.\n\n#### Information on geographical regions\n\n| in €m                                 | Sales revenue1 |         | Investments2 |       | Non-financial non-current assets3, 4 |         | Number of employees |        |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|---------|--------------|-------|--------------------------------------|---------|---------------------|--------|\n|                                       | 2023           | 2022    | 2023         | 2022  | 2023                                 | 2022    | 2023                | 2022   |\n| Euro zone                             | 2,715.6        | 2,543.2 | 211.7        | 281.1 | 4,478.8                              | 4,396.2 | 6,655               | 5,702  |\n| Rest of Europe                        | 1,466.9        | 1,315.0 | 25.2         | 8.7   | 5,376.9                              | 1,367.9 | 3,514               | 1,984  |\n| America                               | 719.7          | 640.3   | 27.0         | 32.8  | 3,307.3                              | 3,552.5 | 1,552               | 1,273  |\n| Asia-Pacific                          | 320.6          | 290.0   | 0            | 0.9   | 35.7                                 | 36.1    | 2,781               | 2,119  |\n| Total of all regions                  | 5,222.8        | 4,788.5 | 263.9        | 323.5 | 13,198.7                             | 9,352.7 | 14,502              | 11,078 |\n| Consolidation of internal net revenue | – 89.6         | – 96.2  | 0            | 0     | 0                                    | 0       | 0                   | 0      |\n| Group                                 | 5,133.2        | 4,692.3 | 263.9        | 323.5 | 13,198.7                             | 9,352.7 | 14,502              | 11,078 |\n\n1) Including countries in which more than 10 per cent of sales revenue was generated: Germany (2023: €1,084.0 million; 2022: €1,054.6 million), United Kingdom (2023: €916.2 million; 2022: €883.3 million) and United States (2023: €654.0 million; 2022: €582.3 million).\n\n2) Excluding goodwill and right-of-use assets from leasing.\n\n3) Including countries in which more than 10 per cent of assets are held: Denmark (2023: €3,989.7 million; 2022: €0.2 million), Germany (2023: €3,787.9 million; 2022: €3,701.1 million), United States (2023: €3,306.0 million; 2022: €3,552.5 million) and Switzerland (2023: €1,357.6 million; 2022: €1,334.6 million).\n\n4) These include intangible assets, property, plant and equipment as well as investments in associates and joint ventures.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-211-0\"></span>Image /page/211/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

They are quantified by reference to the economic capital concept (for detailed disclosures, see the sectio[n \"Financial](#page-72-0)  [risk\"\\).](#page-72-0) Required economic capital is assessed on a 99.9 per cent confidence level for a one-year holding period. It is compared with the Group's liable equity capital so as to test the Group's ability to absorb extreme and unexpected losses. Required economic capital (REC) for financial risk is calculated at the end of each month and amounted to €600.0 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\nWe evaluate our risk position continuously. In the view of the Executive Board, no threat to the continued existence of the Group can be identified at this time.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risks at DBG arise from trade receivables and contract assets, fixed income securities held at amortised cost, receivables from money market business, including reverse repos, overdraft facilities from the securities settlement business, receivables from the CCP business, cash and other bank balances. Further credit risks exist for fund interests and convertible bonds at fair value\n\nthrough profit or loss, for financial instruments of the central counterparties and derivative financial investments. Fundamentally and unless otherwise stated, the maximum risk exposure is the carrying amount shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### Cash investments\n\nClearstream receives cash deposits from its customers in various currencies, whereby Eurex Clearing AG receives cash collateral, mainly in EUR and CHF, and European Commodity Clearing AG mainly in EUR. These units invest the funds received in accordance with the treasury policy, which gives rise to a potential credit risk.\n\nWe mitigate such risks either – to the extent possible – by investing short-term funds on a secured basis, e.g. via reverse repurchase agreements, or by depositing them with central banks.\n\nEligible collateral for reverse repurchase agreements mainly consists of highly liquid financial instruments with a minimum rating of AA– (Standard & Poor's/Fitch) or Aa3 (Moody's) issued or guaranteed by governments or supranational institutions.\n\nCounterparty credit risk is monitored on the basis of an internal rating system. Unsecured cash investments are permitted only with counterparties with investment grade ratings within the framework of defined counterparty credit limits. An investment grade rating in this context means an internal rating of at least D, which corresponds to an external Fitch rating of at least BBB.\n\nThe carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements as at 31 December 2023 was €9,424.2 million (2022: €6,805.2 million) and is shown in the items \"Restricted bank balances\" and \"Financial assets measured at amortised cost\". The fair value of securities received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements was €9,614.5 million (2022: €7,144.9 million).\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/212/Picture/22 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

Lending takes place on a secured basis and the individual borrowing participants must provide full collateral for their credit limits in line with the EU regulation. These credit limits can be revoked at the discretion of the Clearstream sub-group. As at 31 December 2023 they came to a total of €175.3 billion. €7.1 billion of the total is unsecured and only relates to credit lines granted in special exceptional cases to selected central banks and multilateral development banks, partly on the basis of the borrower's credit rating and partly on a zero-risk weighting according to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) and after approval by the Executive Board of the Clearstream sub-group.\n\nActual outstandings at the end of each business day generally represent a small fraction of the facilities and amounted to €392.7 million as at 31\n\nDecember 2023 (2022: €131.6 million). The portfolio of deposited collateral is not directly attributed to any utilisation, but is determined by the scope of the entire business relationship and the limits granted.\n\nIn addition, Clearstream guarantees the risks arising from the Automated Securities Fails Financing programme that it offers its clients, in which Clearstream Banking S.A. acts as an intermediary between the lender and the borrower. This risk is covered by pledged collateral on the borrower's account. As at 31 December 2023 the outstanding guarantees under this programme amounted to €521.7 million (2022: €1,385.2 million). The securities pledged in connection with these loans amounted to €550.7 million (2022: €1,731.5 million).\n\n### Trade receivables\n\nThe maximum credit risk for the item trade receivables is €1,840.5 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €2,295.7 million). Trading, settlement and custody fees are generally collected without delay by direct debit. Fees for other services, such as the provision of data and information, are settled mainly by transfer. Trade receivables are analysed using an expected credit loss model based on the simplified approach as outlined in IFRS 9. To measure the expected credit loss, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on the days past due. The trade receivables share the main risk characteristics. The expected loss amount has been determined by applying the lifetime expected loss approach. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles over a period of five years and the loss profile experienced over that period.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0) \n\ncomprehensive income\n\n[Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0)\n\n[Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0)\n\n[Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0)\n\n[Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0) \n\nfinancial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Loss allowances for trade receivables as at 31 December 2023\n\n| in €m              | Not more than 30 days past due | Not more than 60 days past due | Not more than 90 days past due | Not more than 120 days past due | Not more than 360 days past due | More than 360 days past due | Insolvent | Total |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-------|\n| Expected loss rate | 0%                             | 0%                             | 0.4%                           | 0.4%                            | 2.3%                            | 99.8%                       | 100%      |       |\n| Trade receivables  | 97.2                           | 22.6                           | 7.9                            | 4.7                             | 13.7                            | 5.3                         | 2.7       | 154.0 |\n| Loss allowance     | 0                              | 0                              | 0                              | 0                               | 0.3                             | 5.3                         | 2.7       | 8.3   |\n\n### Loss allowances for trade receivables as at 31 December 2022\n\n| in €m              | Not<br>more than<br>30 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>60 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>90 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>120 days past<br>due | Not<br>more than<br>360 days past<br>due | More than 360<br>days past due | Insolvent | Total |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-------|\n| Expected loss rate | 0.0%                                    | 0.0%                                    | 0.2%                                    | 0.9%                                     | 2.1%                                     | 98.5%                          | 100%      |       |\n| Trade receivables  | 92.7                                    | 14.8                                    | 8.9                                     | 2.8                                      | 12.5                                     | 3.8                            | 2.4       | 137.9 |\n| Loss allowance     | 0                                       | 0                                       | 0                                       | 0                                        | 0.3                                      | 3.6                            | 2.4       | 6.3   |\n\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The following criteria are used for the assessment of derecognition:\n\n- Insolvency proceedings are not started for want of assets.\n- Insolvency proceedings have not resulted in any payment for a period of three years, and there is no indication that any amount will be received going forward.\n\nIn the reporting year, as in the previous year there were no significant writeoffs due to customer defaults (2022: nil).\n\n# Contract assets\n\nThe maximum credit risk for the item contract assets was €375.5 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: nil). Impairments of €3.0 million were recognised on contract assets as at 31 December 2023. No contract assets were recognised as at 31 December 2022. Contract assets relate to rights to consideration from customers for software licences under subscription agreements with future payments, if this right depends on future performance by us. Contract assets from contracts with customers are measured at amortised cost less expected credit losses. Contract assets come within the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment testing rules.

This amount represents the risk-based view of Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG, while the carrying amount of the \"financial instruments held by central counterparties\" item in the balance sheet shows the gross amount of the open trades according to IAS 32. To safeguard the Group's central counterparties against the risk of default by a clearing member, the clearing conditions require the clearing members to deposit margins in the form of cash or securities on a daily basis or an intraday basis in the amount stipulated by the respective clearing house. The amount of collateral deposited for the financial instruments of the central counterparties was €122,728.0 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €182,104.6 million). This amount represents the collateral value of cash and securities collateral deposited for margins, covering the net value of all margin and default fund requirements\n\nAdditional security mechanisms of the Group's central counterparties are described in detail in the section [\"Risk report\".](#page-63-0) \n\n#### Credit risk concentrations\n\nOur business model and the resulting business relationships mean that credit risk is concentrated in the financial services sector. Credit limits for counterparties prevent any excessive concentration of credit risks on individual counterparties. Concentrations of collateral are also monitored.\n\nManagement of credit risk concentration, including collateral concentration, and so-called large exposures, is conducted in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements such as those arising from, among others, articles 387– 410 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR), article 47 paragraph 8 of Regulation (EU) 648/2012 (European Market Infrastructure Regulation, EMIR) and respectively applicable national requirements (see also the disclosures on capital management under the heading [\"Regula](#page-76-0)tory [capital requirements](#page-76-0) and regulatory capital ratios\" in the Risk [manage](#page-63-0)[ment section o](#page-63-0)f the combined [management report\\).](#page-16-0) Requirements of concentration risks arising from Regulation (EU) 909/2014 (Central Securities Depository Regulation, CSDR) have been implemented as part of Deutsche Börse Group's affiliated CSD recognised in under article 16 CSDR.\n\nThe required economic capital (based on the so-called \"Value at Risk\" (VaR) with a confidence level of 99.9 per cent) for credit risk is calculated monthly for each day and amounted to €457.0 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €430.0 million).\n\nWe also apply additional methods in order to detect credit concentration risks. We analyse the impact of a default by our two largest counterparties with unsecured commitments and stressed recovery parameters. In addition, analyses are carried out for the Group's top 5 and top 10 counterparties, based on the risk-weighted commitments of the individual counterparties. All the concentration metrics have dedicated early warning thresholds and limits and are part of the quarterly risk reporting to the Executive Board. As in the previous year, no material adverse credit concentrations were detected in 2023.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Market risk\n\nMarket risk arises from changes in interest rates, foreign-exchange rates and other market prices. Deutsche Börse Group is generally only affected to a limited extent by market risk.\n\nThe economic capital required for market price risks (based on the Value at Risk (VaR) with a confidence level of 99.9 per cent) is calculated at the end of each month. As of 31 December 2023 the economic capital for market price risks was €143.0 million (2022: €114.0 million).\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, no impairment losses (2022: €1.0 million) were recognised in profit or loss for entities accounted for using the equity method that are not included in the VaR for market risk.\n\n### Interest rate risk\n\nChanges in market interest rates may affect Deutsche Börse Group's net income for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different.\n\nInterest-rate-sensitive assets include the Group's money market and investment portfolios, while interest rate sensitive liabilities mainly consist of shortterm debt instruments. Interest rate risk from long-term liabilities of Deutsche Börse AG is mitigated through issuance of fixed-coupon bonds.\n\nIn line with our risk strategy, we may use financial instruments to hedge existing or highly probable interest rate exposures. For this purpose, interest rate swaps, as well as swaptions, might be used. Our treasury policy requires the critical parameters of the hedging instruments to match the hedged items.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group issued three fixed rate bonds with a total nominal value of €3 billion in 2023 in connection with the takeover of SimCorp. To hedge the long-term financing against unexpected interest rate increases, three forward starting deal contingent interest rate swaps with a nominal value of €2 billion were taken out in May 2023. These swaps were dissolved when the fixed interest bonds were issued in September 2023. Cash flow hedge accounting was applied to this hedging. Details of Deutsche Börse Group's outstanding bonds can be found in the [\"Financial](#page-35-0) position\" section of the combined [management report.](#page-16-0) \n\nCash received as deposits from market participants is invested mainly via short-term reverse repos and in the form of overnight deposits at central banks, limiting the risk of a negative impact due to a changed interest rate environment. Negative interest rates resulting from reinvestments of these cash deposits are passed on to the respective Clearstream customers after applying an additional margin. For Eurex Clearing AG, interest rates on cash collateral are in principle calculated based on a predefined market benchmark rate per currency after deducting an additional spread per currency. In exceptional cases such as market disruption, Eurex Clearing AG reserves the right to calculate interest rates on cash collateral based on the recognised interest rate.\n\nGroup entities may furthermore invest their own capital and part of customer cash balances in high-quality liquid bonds.\n\nThe risk from interest-bearing assets and liabilities is monitored every business day and systematically limited. The system consists of a combined limit metric (CLM) that covers both liquidity and interest rate risk. The interest rate risk limits determine the acceptable maximum loss caused by a hypothetical adverse yield curve shift.\n\nIn this way, the cash flow risk arising from potential interest rate changes was hedged. Cash flow hedge accounting was applied to this hedging.\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Foreign-exchange rate risk\n\nMeasuring and managing foreign-exchange risk is important for reducing our exposure to exchange rate movements. The three main types of foreign-exchange risk that we are exposed to are cash flow-, translation- and transaction-related foreign-exchange risk. Cash flow risk reflects the risk of fluctuations in the present value of future operating cash flows from foreign-exchange movements. Translation risk comprises effects from the valuation to our assets and liabilities in foreign currencies. Finally, transaction risk is closely related to cash flow risk; it may arise through changes in the structure of asset and liabilities in foreign currencies.\n\nWe operate internationally and are, to a limited extent, exposed to foreign-exchange risk, primarily in US\\$, Fr., £ and Kč. Exchange rate fluctuations may affect our profit margins and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the relevant Group entity. The respective currency risks arise mainly from operating income and expenses denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, partly from that portion of the Clearstream segment's sales revenue and net interest income from treasury activities in banking and similar business that is directly or indirectly in US\\$.\n\nCurrency mismatches are avoided to the maximum extent possible. All types of foreign exchange risk are measured regularly and monitored at Group level. Limits are set for the cash flow and currency translation risks that affect our gains and losses. Deutsche Börse Group's treasury policy defines risk limits which take into account historic foreign-exchange rate fluctuations. Any exposure exceeding those limits must be hedged. Foreign-exchange exposures below the defined limits may also be hedged. Management of foreign-exchange risks is in principle based on the Group level. Hedging may take place on a single entity level if foreign-exchange risk threatens the viability of the single entity.\n\nTo eliminate foreign-exchange risks we use financial instruments to hedge existing or highly probable forecast transactions. The Group may use foreign-exchange forwards, foreign-exchange options as well as cross-currency swaps to hedge the exposure to foreign-exchange risk. Under the Group's policy, the critical terms of forwards and options must align with the hedged items.\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. entered into foreign-exchange forwards in 2023 to hedge part of the risk from the result of treasury activities in banking and similar business in US\\$. In addition, the Group uses foreign exchange derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risks in connection with internal cash pooling and loans.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# Other market risks\n\nMarket risk also arises from investments in bonds, investments in funds and futures within the framework of contractual trust arrangements (CTAs) and from the Clearstream Pension Fund in Luxembourg. For the CTAs, the investment is protected by a predefined floor, which reduces the risk of extreme losses for Deutsche Börse Group. In addition, there are equity price risks arising from strategic equity investments.\n\n# Liquidity risk\n\nFor us, liquidity risk may arise from potential difficulties in renewing maturing financing, such as commercial paper, issued bonds as well as bilateral and syndicated credit facilities. Financing arrangements required for unexpected events may also result in a liquidity risk. Most of our cash investments are short-term to ensure that liquidity is available, should such a financing need arise. Both Eurex Clearing AG and Clearstream can invest stable customer credit balances in secured money market products (for up to one year for Eurex Clearing and six months for Clearstream) or in investment grade securities with a remaining term to maturity of less than five years for Eurex Clearing and Clearstream, subject to strict monitoring of mismatching and interest rate limits. Term investments can be transacted via reverse repurchase agreements against highly liquid collateral. For refinancing purposes, Eurex Clearing AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. can pledge eligible securities with their respective central banks. In terms of the maturities of the cash spreads received from customers and its corresponding investments, Eurex Clearing is almost perfectly matched.\n\nThe companies of Deutsche Börse Group have the following credit lines at their disposal, which were not recognised as of the balance sheet date.\n\n#### Contractually agreed credit lines\n\n| Company                        | Purpose of credit line | Currency | Amount at 31 Dec 2023 m | Amount at 31 Dec 2022 m |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Deutsche Börse AG              | Working capital1)      | €        | 600.0                   | 600.0                   |\n| Eurex Clearing AG              | Settlement             | €        | 900.0                   | 900.0                   |\n|                                | Settlement             | Fr.      | 200.0                   | 200.0                   |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | US\\$     | 300.0                   | 300.0                   |\n| Clearstream Banking S.A.       | Working capital1)      | €        | 750.0                   | 750.0                   |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | €        | 4,375.0                 | 4,225.0                 |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | US\\$     | 2,950.0                 | 3,200.0                 |\n|                                | Settlement2)           | £        | 0                       | 350.0                   |\n| Clearstream Banking AG         | Settlement             | €        | 200.0                   | 200.0                   |\n| European Energy Exchange AG    | Working capital        | €        | 22.0                    | 22.0                    |\n| European Commodity Clearing AG | Settlement             | €        | 140.0                   | 140.0                   |\n| Axioma Inc.                    | Working capital        | US\\$     | 1.9                     | 1.7                     |\n| SimCorp A/S                    | Settlement             | DKK      | 266.3                   | 0.0                     |\n\n1) €500.0 million of Deutsche Börse AG's working capital credit lines is a sub-credit line of Clearstream Banking S.A.'s €750.0 million working capital credit line.\n\n2) Including committed foreign exchange swap lines and committed repo lines.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. has a bank guarantee (letter of credit) in favour of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. issued by an international consortium to secure daily deliveries of securities between Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking S.A.

Such litigation may result in payments by entities in the Group. If it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will occur, a provision will be recognised based on an estimate of the most probable amount necessary to settle the obligation if such amount is reasonably estimable. The management of the entity affected must assess whether the possible obligation results from a past event, as well as evaluate the probability of a cash outflow and estimate its amount.\n\nWe recognise provisions for possible losses only if there is a present obligation arising from a past event that is likely to result in an outflow of resources and if the Group can reliably estimate the amount of the obligation (see als[o note](#page-206-0)  [19\\). Co](#page-206-0)ntingent liabilities may result from present obligations and from possible obligations arising from events in the past. In order to identify the litigation for which the possibility of a loss is more than unlikely, as well as how the possible loss is estimated, Deutsche Börse Group considers a large number of factors, including the nature of the claim and the facts on which it is based, the jurisdiction and course of the individual proceedings, the experience of the Group, prior settlement talks (to the extent that they have already taken place) as well as expert opinions and evaluations of legal advisers.\n\nLosses also may arise from legal risks which are not highly probable, so that no provisions have been recognised. If the event is not completely improbable, the legal risks may have to be recognised as contingent liabilities. As neither the timing of these contingent liabilities nor the amount of any payment can be estimated reliably, any quantitative disclosure would not be a useful guide to possible future losses. For this reason, no figure is shown for contingent liabilities.\n\nThe main legal disputes that have been classified as contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2023 and for which consequently no provisions have been recognised as at 31 December 2023 are described below.\n\n# Litigation involving Clearstream Banking S.A. in connection with the Central Bank of Iran\n\nClearstream Banking S.A. is involved in different legal proceedings in Luxembourg and the U.S. in connection with the Iranian central bank, Bank Markazi. On the one hand of this, different plaintiffs groups – each of which have obtained U.S. judgements against Iran and/or Bank Markazi – are seeking turnover of assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. is holding as custodian in Luxembourg and that are attributed to Bank Markazi. Several of these plaintiffs groups also raise direct claims for damages against Clearstream Banking S.A. On the other hand, Bank Markazi is suing, among others, Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg in connection with assets that currently or in the past were held by Clearstream Banking S.A. as custodian.\n\nOn the basis of a binding and enforceable U.S. judgement in 2013, assets in an amount of approx. USD 1.9 billion were already turned over to a plaintiffs group in a U.S. proceeding (\"Peterson I\") to which Bank Markazi also was a party. Currently, the following proceedings that were initiated by the mentioned plaintiffs groups and that primarily target assets attributed to Bank Markazi are ongoing:\n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- \"Peterson II\" plaintiffs group: On 30 December 2013, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties seeking turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg and that are attributed to Bank Markazi. The proceedings since then had advanced to the U.S. Supreme Court but were then remanded to the district court. On 22 March 2023, the district court awarded judgement to the plaintiffs for turnover of approximately USD 1.7 billion that are attributed to Bank Markazi and held in custody at Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg in a client account. Clearstream Banking S.A. appealed against the decision.\n- \"Havlish\" plaintiffs group: On 14 October 2016, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties. Besides the request for turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg, the complaint also asserted direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 6.6 billion (plus punitive damages and interest). On 12 October 2020, an amended complaint was filed in this case, which added further plaintiffs and which in turn asserted additional damages of approx. USD 3.3 billion (plus punitive damages and interest) against Clearstream Banking S.A. and the other defendants.\n- \"Levin\" plaintiffs group: On 26 December 2018, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties. Besides the request for turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg, the complaint also asserted direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 29 million (plus punitive damages and interest). The plaintiffs withdrew their complaint effective as of 24 April 2023.\n- \"Heiser\" plaintiffs group: On 4 December 2019, plaintiffs from a previous case filed a new complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. targeting turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg.\n- \"Ofisi\" plaintiffs group: On 26 August 2020, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties. Besides the request for turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg, the complaint also asserts direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 8.7 billion (plus punitive damages and interest).\n- On 24 November 2020, plaintiffs from the abovementioned Havlish case also sued Clearstream Banking S.A. and other parties in Luxembourg. The complaint, among others, asserts direct damage claims against Clearstream Banking S.A. and other defendants in the amount of up to approx. USD 5.5 billion (plus interest).\n- \"Acosta/Beer/Greenbaum/Kirschenbaum\" plaintiffs group: On 28 February 2022, plaintiffs filed new complaints in the U.S. against Clearstream Banking S.A. targeting turnover of certain assets that Clearstream Banking S.A. holds as a custodian in Luxembourg.\n\nIn connection with assets concerning Bank Markazi, Bank Markazi on 17 January 2018 filed a complaint in Luxembourg court naming Clearstream Banking S.A. and Banca UBAE S.p.A. as defendants. The complaint primarily seeks the restitution of assets totalling approximately USD 4.9 billion (plus interest), which the complaint alleges are held on accounts of Banca UBAE S.p.A. and Bank Markazi with Clearstream Banking S.A. Alternatively, Bank Markazi seeks damages in the same amount.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nIn another proceeding, on 30 April 2021, a Luxembourg first instance court at the request of Bank Markazi issued a declaratory judgement against Clearstream Banking S.A. in connection with, amongst others, the abovementioned Peterson II proceedings pending in the U.S. The first instance decision of 30 April 2021 subjects the transfer of assets attributed to Bank Markazi based on a U.S. decision to the requirement of prior judicial recognition in Luxembourg, violation of which is punishable by a fine of €10 million per violation. Clearstream Banking S.A. has filed an appeal against the decision.\n\nOn 15 June 2018, Banca UBAE S.p.A. filed a complaint against Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg court. This complaint is a recourse action related to the abovementioned complaint filed by Bank Markazi against Clearstream Banking S.A. and Banca UBAE S.p.A. and asks that Banca UBAE S.p.A. be indemnified and held harmless by Clearstream Banking S.A. in the event that Banca UBAE S.p.A. loses the legal dispute brought by Bank Markazi and is ordered by the court to pay damages to Bank Markazi.\n\nIndependent of whether Clearstream Banking S.A. should be required to turn over assets attributed to Bank Markazi in the U.S., the Executive Board of Clearstream Banking S.A. does not think that claims for damages raised against Clearstream Banking S.A. in Luxembourg or in the U.S. will be successful. Based on this, as of 31 December 2023 and unchanged from the previous year, no provisions were made in connection with the aforementioned matters.\n\nFurther litigations and proceedings\n\n### Litigations\n\nStarting on 16 July 2010, the insolvency administrators of Fairfield Sentry Ltd. And Fairfield Sigma Ltd., two funds domiciled on the British Virgin Islands, filed complaints in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, asserting claims against more than 300 financial institutions for restitution of amounts paid to investors in the funds for redemption of units prior to December 2008. On 14 January 2011, the funds insolvency administrators filed litigation against Clearstream Banking S.A. for the restitution of US\\$13.5 million in payments made for redemption of fund units, which the funds made to investors via the settlement system of Clearstream Banking S.A. The proceedings, which were suspended for several years, are ongoing.\n\nA buyer of an MBB Clean Energy AG (MBB) bond, which is held in custody by Clearstream Banking AG and was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, filed a lawsuit at a Dutch court concerning claims for damages in the amount of €33 million against Clearstream Banking AG, Deutsche Börse AG and other parties. The lawsuit was dismissed at first instance in October 2020; the plaintiff filed an appeal against the judgement.\n\nOn 23 July 2021, Clearstream Banking AG was served with a lawsuit that Air Berlin PLC i.L. had announced by way of an ad hoc announcement on 25 June 2021. The insolvency administrator in connection with the assets of Air Berlin PLC i.L. claims the payment of approximately €497.8 million from Clearstream Banking AG as personally liable partner of Air Berlin PLC i.L. due to Brexit, and seeks declaratory relief that Clearstream Banking AG is liable for all debts which have not already been approved to the insolvency table in the course of the insolvency proceedings concerning the assets of Air Berlin PLC.\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/225/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

A number of lawsuits have been brought against Clearstream Banking S.A. in Russian courts targeting turnover or restitution of frozen assets. The total value claimed from Clearstream Banking S.A. in these proceedings amounts to approximately €74 million. It cannot be ruled out that further lawsuits concerning frozen assets may be filed, which could also include recourses against assets held by Clearstream Banking S.A. in Russia or elsewhere.\n\nThe Executive board is not currently aware of any significant change in the Group's risk situation.\n\n### Proceedings\n\nOn 2 April 2014, Clearstream Banking S.A. was informed that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has opened a grand jury investigation against Clearstream Banking S.A. due to Clearstream Banking S.A.'s conduct with respect to Iran and other countries subject to U.S. sanction laws. Clearstream Banking S.A. is cooperating with the U.S. attorney.\n\nIn September 2017, Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A. were made aware that the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne had initiated proceedings for tax evasion against an employee of Clearstream Banking AG for his alleged involvement in the settlement of transactions of market participants over the dividend date (cum/ex transactions). On 22 January 2018, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne addressed to Clearstream Banking AG a notification of hearing Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A.\n\nas potential secondary participants. Starting on 27 August 2019, together with other supporting authorities, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne conducted searches of the offices of Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., as well as other Deutsche Börse Group companies and sites. In the course of these measures, Deutsche Börse Group entities were made aware that the Public Prosecutor's Office in Cologne has extended the group of suspects to include current and former employees as well as executive board members of Deutsche Börse Group companies. In 2020 and again in 2022, Deutsche Börse Group became aware of further extensions of the group of suspects. Due to the still early stage of the proceedings, it is still not possible to predict timing, scope or consequences of a potential decision. The companies concerned are cooperating with the competent authorities. They do not expect that they could be successfully held liable.\n\n#### Tax risks\n\nDue to its business activities in various countries, Deutsche Börse Group is exposed to tax risks. A process has been developed to recognise and evaluate these risks, which are initially recognised based on their probability of occurrence. These risks are then measured on the basis of their expected value. A tax liability is recognised in the event that it is more probable than not that the risks will occur. We continuously review whether the conditions for recognising corresponding tax liabilities are met.\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position\n\n#### [Other disclosures](#page-207-0)\n\n[Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\nFollowing the completion of the tax inspections for the years 2006 to 2008 we see the Group exposed to risks resulting from (i) corrections to input VAT deductions in accordance with the letters from the Federal Ministry of Finance of 3 May 2021 and 23 June 2022 (concerning the VAT treatment of services by exchange operators), (ii) the disallowance of tax-free income and intra-Group funding and (iii) the disallowance of provisions for stock option programmes. Full provision has been made in the balance sheet for any tax and interest back-payments that may result and the corresponding appeals have been lodged. We assume that the tax authorities will at least query the points (i) and (ii) mentioned above for the years from 2009 onwards for which the tax assessments are not yet definitive.\n\n# 26 Corporate governance\n\n.\n\nOn 7 December 2023 the Executive and Supervisory Boards issued the latest version of the declaration of compliance in accordance with section 161 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act) and made it permanently available to shareholders on the company's website.\n\n# 27 Related party disclosures\n\nRelated parties as defined by IAS 24 are members of the executive bodies of Deutsche Börse AG and their close family members, as well as the companies classified as associates of Deutsche Börse AG, investors and investees and companies that are controlled or significantly influenced by members of the executive bodies.\n\n# Business relationships with related parties\n\nThe following table shows transactions entered into within the scope of business relationships with non-consolidated companies of Deutsche Börse AG during the 2023 financial year.

[paragraph] 1 HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023,\n- the accompanying group management report (excluding the non-financial statement) as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development; we do not express an audit opinion on the statement on corporate governance referred to above and\n- the non-financial statement included in section \"Nichtfinanzielle Erklärung\" of the group management report is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/239/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial statement included in the group management report.\n\n# Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- ➊ Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets\n- ➋ Accounting for the acquisition of SimCorp A/S\n- ➌ Assessment of certain legal risks\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- ➀ Matter and issue\n- ➁ Audit approach and findings\n- ➂ Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n- ➊ Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets\n- ➀ Goodwill and other intangible assets with definite and indefinite useful lives totalling € 11,248.6 million (116.4 % of Group equity) are reported under the balance sheet item \"Intangible assets\" in the company's consolidated financial statements. The other intangible assets relate in particular to stock exchange licences, brand names and customer relationships. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment once a year or on an ad hoc basis, while other intangible assets with a definite useful life are tested for impairment on an ad hoc basis by the company in order to identify any need for impairment. As part of the impairment test, the carrying amount of the respective (groups of) cash-generating units (including their\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n[Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\ncarrying amount for the goodwill test) is compared with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of the fair value less costs to sell. The measurement is generally based on the present value of future cash flows of the respective cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units. The present values are determined using discounted cash flow models. The Group's approved medium-term planning forms the starting point, which is extrapolated using assumptions about long-term growth rates. Expectations about future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors are also taken into account. Discounting is carried out using the weighted average cost of capital of the respective (groups of) cash-generating units.\n\nAs a result of the impairment test, an impairment requirement totalling € 24.6 million was identified.\n\nThe result of this valuation is highly dependent on the estimates of the executive directors with regard to the future cash flows of the respective (groups of) cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the growth rate and other assumptions and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complexity of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n➁ As part of our audit, we first analysed the methodology used to perform the impairment test. In a risk-oriented selection, with the involvement of our valuation specialists, we compared the future cash flows used in the calculation with the Group's approved medium-term planning and additional planning documents for the respective (groups of) cashgenerating units in order to assess the appropriateness of these plans, in particular by analysing the key planning assumptions, comparing the plans with analyst estimates and, in certain cases, performing plan-actual and plan-plan analyses. In addition, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions - where taken into account in the models - and the appropriateness of the growth assumptions after the forecast period and the assumed weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we assessed the company's valuation by comparing the implied multiples with market multiples. In order to take account of the existing forecast uncertainties, we reviewed the sensitivity analyses prepared by the company. Where there was a need for impairment as at the balance sheet date, we verified the appropriate recognition of the impairment losses.\n\nThe valuation methods, parameters and assumptions applied by the legal representatives are in line with our expectations and are also within what we consider to be reasonable ranges.\n\n➂ The company's disclosures on the impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets are contained in section \"10 Intangible assets\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n# ➋ Accounting for the acquisition of SimCorp A/S\n\n➀ Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft acquired the majority of shares in the software service provider SimCorp A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark, (\"SimCorp\") by way of a public takeover bid with effect from 29 September 2023. Following further share purchases and the implementation of a squeeze-out under stock corporation law, the company held 100% of the shares in SimCorp as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe acquisition was recognised as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 using the acquisition method. As part of the purchase price allocation, the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired company were recognised at fair value. The purchase price allocation had not yet been finalised as at the reporting date, as it was not yet possible to conclusively determine the tax items and intangible assets in particular. The comparison of the consideration transferred with the acquired assets and liabilities resulted in provisional goodwill of € 2,335.6 million.\n\nDue to the estimation uncertainties in the measurement of the assets and liabilities as well as the identified intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation and the overall material impact of the business combination on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n➁ As part of our audit of the acquisition of SimCorp, we first inspected and analysed the contractual agreements and reconciled the purchase price determined as consideration for the acquired business operations with the evidence provided to us. Based on this, we assessed the company's approach to measuring the identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair values at the acquisition date. Among other things, we analysed the\n\nmodels underlying the valuations as well as the valuation parameters and assumptions applied with the assistance of valuation specialists.\n\nFurthermore, we analysed the adjustment of the groups of cashgenerating units at whose level goodwill is monitored, which was carried out as part of the SimCorp acquisition. In addition, we assessed the disclosures required by IFRS 3.\n\nOverall, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the accounting treatment of the business combination was appropriate, that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors were reasonable and adequately substantiated and that the relevant disclosures in the notes were made in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\n➂ The company's disclosures on the acquisition are contained in section \"02 Consolidation principles\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# ➌ Assessment of certain legal risks\n\n➀ Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliated companies are exposed to certain legal risks. These certain legal risks include legal disputes of Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg, in connection with the Central Bank of Iran, in which Clearstream Banking S.A. is exposed to claims for restitution and damages against the Central Bank of Iran in the amount of USD 4.9 billion (plus interest) and claims by other groups of plaintiffs, a claim by the insolvency administrator of Air Berlin PLC i.L. against Clearstream Banking AG for payment of around €498 million and an investigation relating to securities transactions by market participants over the dividend record date (cum-ex transactions). The assessment of whether and, if so, to what extent a provision is required to cover the risk is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty.

No provisions were recognised for the abovementioned legal risks in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023, as the executive directors do not consider an outflow of funds to be probable.\n\nIn our view, the above-mentioned legal risks are of particular significance for our audit due to their legal complexity, the considerable uncertainties regarding their further development and their potential impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations.\n\n➁ As part of our audit, we inspected the underlying documents relating to the above-mentioned legal disputes and proceedings and analysed the legal assessments of Deutsche Börse Group. With the knowledge that there is an increased risk of misstatements in the financial reporting in the event of uncertainties and that the decisions of the executive directors have a direct impact on the Group's results, we evaluated the executive directors' judgements with the assistance of specialists. In addition, we held regular discussions with the legal departments of the companies in order to understand current developments and the reasons that led to the corresponding assessments of the outcome of the proceedings. The development of the specific legal risks, including the assessments of the legal representatives with regard to the possible outcomes of the proceedings, was made available to us in writing by the legal departments. In addition, we obtained external lawyers' confirmations as at the balance sheet date and analysed legal opinions from external lawyers.\n\nThe estimates made by the legal representatives regarding the aforementioned matters and their presentation in the consolidated financial statements are adequately substantiated and documented.\n\n➂ The company's disclosures on the material legal risks are presented in the section \"25 Financial commitments and other risks\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# Other Information\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB as an unaudited part of the group management report.\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\n- the remuneration report pursuant to § 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act], for which the supervisory board is also responsible\n- all remaining parts of the annual report excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial statement included in the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/243/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe executive directors are also responsible for the preparation of the non-financial statement included in the group management report in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group's executive directors. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent reporting in the non-financial statement) or error.\n\nThe applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which authoritative comprehensive interpretations have not yet been published. Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretations of such wording and terms in section \"About this report\" of the non-financial statement. The executive directors are responsible for the defensibility of these interpretations. As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is uncertain.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/244/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

Misstatements can arise\n\nfrom fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report and of the non-financial statement included in the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### Consolidated financial [statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n[Consolidated income statement](#page-124-0) [Consolidated statement of](#page-125-0)  comprehensive income [Consolidated balance sheet](#page-126-0) [Consolidated cash flow statement](#page-128-0) [Consolidated statement of changes in equity](#page-130-0) [Notes to the consolidated financial statements](#page-132-0) [Notes on the consolidated income statement](#page-140-0) [Notes on the consolidated statement of](#page-153-0)  financial position [Other disclosures](#page-207-0) [Responsibility statement by](#page-237-0)  the Executive Board [Independent Auditor's Report](#page-238-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n- Evaluate the suitability of the criteria presented by the executive directors in the non-financial statement as a whole. As explained in the description of the responsibilities of the executive directors, the executive directors have interpreted the wording and terms contained in the relevant regulations; the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to inherent uncertainties mentioned in this description. Those inherent uncertainties in the interpretation apply to our audit accordingly.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/246/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

[number] 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n# Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance work on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.\n- Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/248/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The report was prepared by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with the requirements of section 162 Aktiengesetz (Stock Corporation Act, AktG) and follows the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) as amended on 28 April 2022. It also takes into account the current version of the guidelines of the working group for sustainable management board remuneration systems, which is made up of the supervisory board chairs of listed companies in Germany, as well as representatives of institutional investors, academics and corporate governance experts.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\nAbove and beyond the requirements of section 162 (3) AktG, the remuneration report was reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft both in a formal as well as a material audit. The remuneration report and the attached memorandum on the review of the remuneration report can be found on the Deutsche Börse AG website at [https://www.deutsche-boerse.com](https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/remuneration-overview) > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Remuneration.\n\n# Review of the 2023 financial year\n\nThis review of the 2023 financial year explains the context in which the remuneration decisions were taken and enables their comprehensive perception.\n\n# Approval of the remuneration report 2022 by the Annual General Meeting 2023\n\nThe remuneration report for the 2022 financial year was presented to the Annual General Meeting in 2023 for approval. The Annual General Meeting approved the remuneration report for 2022 by a majority of 91.69 per cent. This was the second report on the implementation of the remuneration system that was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2021 (2021 remuneration system) with a majority of 94.97 per cent.\n\nThereafter, the Supervisory Board discussed the feedback from shareholders and proxy advisers provided as part of the consultation on the remuneration report. In view of the continued high approval rate and the positive feedback from shareholders and proxy advisers, the Supervisory Board does not currently see any reason to make fundamental changes to the remuneration report.\n\n{251}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/251/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The last adjustment was made seven years earlier in 2016. Over this period, the size of Deutsche Börse Group and the complexity of its business model, as well as of regulatory requirements, increased significantly, which means that the scope and volume of the Executive Board members' responsibilities have also continued to increase. Deutsche Börse Group's strong growth is reflected in its financial performance indicators and in the number of divisions, business models, employees and regions in which it operates worldwide.\n\nIn line with the objectives of the corporate strategy \"Compass 2023\", Deutsche Börse Group has achieved significant organic and inorganic growth. Two of the most important takeovers in the Group's history took place in this period: the takeover of ISS and the acquisition of SimCorp A/S that was completed in the 2023 financial year. This growth implies greater responsibilities for the Executive Board members, in a global market environment that is difficult overall and is also governed by an increasingly complex legal and regulatory framework.\n\nUnder these circumstances and in view of the extremely positive performance by Deutsche Börse Group, the Supervisory Board has increased the target direct remuneration (base salary, target amount of Performance Bonus and target amount of Performance Shares) for the Executive Board members by 10 per cent p.a., i.e. by 5 per cent for the 2023 financial year. No changes were made to the company pensions of the Executive Board members in this context.\n\n| Adjustment | of target direct | remuneration

Further information on the review of appropriateness can be found in the section \"Appropriateness [of Executive Board remuneration\".](#page-255-0)\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\n# Performance and target achievement in 2023\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board believes it is vitally important to have a clear link between Executive Board members' remuneration and their performance (\"pay for performance\"). A large proportion of Executive Board remuneration therefore consists of performance-based remuneration components. For this reason, and because strategically relevant indicators are used as performance criteria, the amount of Executive Board remuneration is closely linked to the performance of Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group was able to exceed its original forecast significantly in the 2023 financial year. Both net revenue and EBITDA increased by 17 per cent in 2023. Earnings per share went up by 15 per cent.\n\nThe performance of Deutsche Börse Group was influenced by both secular and cyclical growth factors. Structural growth was achieved largely by means of new customer wins and increased market share, expanding customer relationships and innovative products. Cyclical growth effects stemmed particularly from the global increase in interest rates. In combination with an only moderate decrease in cash deposits by customers in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments, this led to strong growth in net interest income at\n\nClearstream. Higher interest rates and a general reduction in the money supply also had a positive impact on the use of interest rate derivatives and repo products from Eurex and Eurex Repo in the Trading & Clearing segment. In this context, the rise in the outstanding notional volume of centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) traded and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives had a positive impact on net revenue. Significantly higher trading volumes for electricity derivatives on the EEX also led to an increase in net revenue in the Trading & Clearing segment. This was due to lower margin requirements as volatility on electricity and gas markets was lower, and additional market share. The newly created Investment Management Solutions segment profited from both sustained demand for ISS products in Governance Solutions, Corporate Solutions and ESG, and from contract renewals with customers in the Analytics business. The acquisition of SimCorp A/S also made a key contribution to M&A growth in this segment from the fourth quarter.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group substantially strengthened its strategic position in key growth markets overall, and again improved its line-up for further organic growth and future competitiveness. This applies particularly to the ongoing strategic development of the pre-trading business, with the creation of the new Investment Management Solutions segment.\n\nThe successful implementation of the corporate strategy, Compass 2023, again significantly improved a number of key financial indicators, which are also used as performance criteria for the performance-based components of Executive Board remuneration, and meant that the strategic objectives were achieved ahead of schedule.\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/253/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

Targets were exceeded for both the performance criterion \"Adjusted Net Income Growth\" and the performance criterion \"Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance\". The target achievement for relative TSR not only reflects the strong absolute performance of the Deutsche Börse share on the capital market, but also its above-average relative performance compared with the relevant peer group.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/254/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Choosing suitable performance criteria for performance-based remuneration sets incentives to manage the company sustainably and successfully over the long term and to drive the realisation of its strategic objectives. In order to support a strong equity culture and further align the interests of the Executive Board and shareholders, most of the performance-based remuneration components are share-based.\n\nExecutive Board remuneration is based on the principle that Executive Board members should receive appropriate remuneration in line with their performance, functions and responsibilities. By setting ambitious performance criteria, the Supervisory Board follows a strict pay-for-performance approach. The long-term structure of the remuneration system, as expressed in the largely multi-year assessment basis for the performance-based remuneration components, also avoids creating incentives for taking unreasonable risks.\n\nThe following overview shows the main guidelines applied by the Supervisory Board for the Executive Board remuneration:\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-255-0\"></span>Image /page/255/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board is presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval. The Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system regularly with the support of its Nomination Committee. After any significant changes, but not less than every four years, the Supervisory Board again presents the remuneration system to the Annual General Meeting for approval.\n\n# Appropriateness of Executive Board remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of Executive Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board on the basis of the remuneration system, whereby the Nomination Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's decision. The Supervisory Board ensures that remuneration is appropriate to the corresponding Executive Board member's tasks and performance, as well as to the company's financial situation, and that it does not exceed common market pay levels without special justification. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board conducts a regular horizontal and vertical peer group comparison, generally every other year.\n\nTo do so, the Supervisory Board may engage external experts who are independent of the Executive Board and the company. The horizontal comparison is based on relevant national and international peer groups. The Supervisory Board selects the peer groups based on the criteria country, size and industry sector as stipulated in AktG. Based on the country criterion and given their comparable size, DAX-listed companies are considered as a suitable peer group for the purpose of the horizontal comparison. In order to reflect the industry-sector criterion, European financial institutions were used as customers and competitors of Deutsche Börse Group, as well as international stock exchange operators as additional peer groups.\n\nIn order to assess whether the remuneration is in line with usual levels within the company (vertical comparison), the Supervisory Board – in accordance with the recommendations of the GCGC – also takes into account the ratio of Executive Board remuneration to the remuneration of senior managers and the workforce as a whole, and how the various salary grades have developed over time. In this context, senior managers mean the two management levels below the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board considers the remuneration ratio with regard to the employees of Deutsche Börse AG and the employees of Deutsche Börse Group overall.\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/256/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The Supervisory Board was supported by an independent external advisor and the Executive Board remuneration was found to be appropriate.\n\n# Target remuneration\n\nFurther information\n\nIn their service contract, each Executive Board member is promised a target remuneration in line with common market levels, which depends largely on their relevant knowledge and experience for the role. It is also based on the target remuneration for the other Executive Board members. As described in the chapter \"Review of the 2023 [financial year\",](#page-250-0) the target remuneration of the Executive Board members was adjusted in the 2023 financial year and the target direct remuneration increased as of 1 July 2023 by 10 per cent p.a., i.e. by 5 per cent for the 2023 financial year. On this basis, the total target remuneration for the Executive Board members for 2023 was as follows:\n\n#### Target remuneration (part 1)\n\n|                                      |                  | Theodor Weimer<br>(CEO) |                  |           |                  | Christoph Böhm<br>(CIO/COO) |                  |           |  |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------|--|\n|                                      | 2023<br>€ thous. | 2023<br>%               | 2022<br>€ thous. | 2022<br>% | 2023<br>€ thous. | 2023<br>%                   | 2022<br>€ thous. | 2022<br>% |  |\n| Base salary                          | 1,575.0          | 26.3                    | 1,500.0          | 25.8      | 756.0            | 26.8                        | 720.0            | 26.2      |  |\n| Fringe benefits                      | 60.6             | 1.0                     | 60.5             | 1.1       | 25.3             | 0.9                         | 28.4             | 1.0       |  |\n| One-year variable remuneration       | 1,155.0          | 19.3                    | 1,100.0          | 19.0      | 588.0            | 20.8                        | 560.0            | 20.3      |  |\n| Performance Bonus (cash component)   | 1,155.0          | –                       | 1,100.0          | –         | 588.0            | –                           | 560.0            | –         |  |\n| Multi-year variable remuneration     | 2,520.0          | 42.0                    | 2,400.0          | 41.3      | 1,176.0          | 41.6                        | 1,120.0          | 40.7      |  |\n| Performance Bonus (Restricted Stock) | 1,155.0          | –                       | 1,100.0          | –         | 588.0            | –                           | 560.0            | –         |  |\n| Performance Shares Tranche 2022-2026 | –                | –                       | 1,300.0          | –         | –                | –                           | 560.0            | –         |  |\n| Performance Shares Tranche 2023-2027 | 1,365.0          | –                       | –                | –         | 588.0            | –                           | –                | –         |  |\n| Pension expense                      | 683.8            | 11.4                    | 745.9            | 12.8      | 278.4            | 9.9                         | 324.2            | 11.8      |  |\n| Total target remuneration            | 5,994.4          | 100.0                   | 5,806.4          | 100.0     | 2,823.7          | 100.0                       | 2,752.6          | 100.0     |  |\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/257/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

In the 2021 remuneration system, maximum remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer is €12,000,000 and for the ordinary Executive Board members €6,000,000.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\nThe maximum remuneration includes all payouts of non-performance-based remuneration (base salary, fringe benefits, pension and risk protection) and performance-based remuneration components (Performance Bonus, Performance Shares), whereby the pension and risk protection are based on the service cost.\n\nIt will only be possible to report on compliance with maximum remuneration for 2023 after the payout for the tranche of Performance Shares granted in 2023. To the extent that the payout from Performance Shares would result in the maximum remuneration being exceeded, the payout would be reduced accordingly to ensure compliance with the maximum remuneration.\n\nA maximum remuneration also existed prior to the 2021 remuneration system to cap the annual payouts from remuneration components. It was set at €9,500,000 for each active Executive Board member and was always complied with.\n\n# Overview of the remuneration structure for Executive Board members\n\nIn structuring the remuneration, the Supervisory Board strives to ensure that the overall framework for remuneration within the Executive Board is as uniform as possible. The remuneration system for Executive Board members consists of non-performance-based and performance-based components.\n\nThe non-performance-based remuneration components consist of base salary, contractual fringe benefits and provisions for retirement and risk protection. The performance-based component consists of the Performance Bonus and the Performance Shares.\n\nIn addition, the company's share ownership guidelines require Executive Board members to invest a substantial amount in Deutsche Börse AG shares during their term of office.\n\nThe following overview shows the main elements of the 2021 remuneration system.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/259/Picture/0 description: The image shows five circular buttons in a horizontal row.

Furthermore, around 70 per cent of this performance-based remuneration has a multi-year assessment basis and is also share-based. This ensures that the remuneration structure is aligned with the company's sustainable long-term development. It also ensures that the performance-based remuneration to reward the achievement of long-term targets is higher than that for short-term targets and that the interests of the Executive Board are aligned with those of shareholders.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe base salary accounts for around 30 per cent of the target direct remuneration. The Performance Bonus, which is paid out after the respective financial year, accounts for approx. 22.5 per cent of the target direct remuneration. The Performance Bonus, which is available to the Executive Board members after a further four financial years (performance-based restricted stock) also accounts for approx. 22.5 per cent. Performance Shares account for approx. 25 per cent of the target direct remuneration.\n\nImage /page/260/Figure/10 description: The image is a diagram illustrating the structure of executive compensation over a five-year period. The diagram is divided into several components: Base salary (approximately 30%), Performance Bonus (approximately 45%), Performance Shares (approximately 25%), Pension and risk coverage, Contractual fringe benefits, and Share ownership guidelines (SOG). The Performance Bonus is further divided into 50% in cash and 50% performance-based restricted stock with a blocking period of four years. The Performance Shares have a five-year performance period. The Share ownership guidelines (SOG) have a build-up period of four years after appointment, with a requirement to hold shares until the end of the term of office, at 200% for the CEO and 100% for ordinary Board members of gross base salary. The diagram also highlights the pay-for-performance aspect, which constitutes 70% of the target direct remuneration, and the long-term focus, which constitutes approximately 70% of performance-based remuneration and is long-term and share-based.\n\n{261}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/261/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

When setting the amount of base salary, the Supervisory Board is guided by the relevant knowledge and experience of the Executive Board members for their respective role.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\n### Fringe benefits\n\nExecutive Board members receive contractually agreed fringe benefits. These include, inter alia, an appropriate company car for business and personal use. They also receive taxable contributions towards private pensions. In addition, the company takes out appropriate insurance coverage for them. This included accident insurance in the 2023 financial year. Another fringe benefit in the 2023 financial year was the use of carpool vehicles or vehicles with drivers.\n\nExecutive Board members were not granted any other fringe benefits in the 2023 financial year apart from those mentioned.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there was also directors & officers (D&O) insurance for Executive Board members.\n\n### Pension and risk coverage\n\nFurther information\n\nAs another non-performance-based component of the remuneration system the Executive Board members are entitled to a pension as well as invalidity and life insurance.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are generally entitled to receive retirement benefits upon reaching the age of 60, provided that they are no longer in the service of Deutsche Börse AG at that time. A different rule applies to Thomas Book, who is entitled to retirement benefits on reaching the age of 63. The Supervisory Board reviews and determines the pensionable income that is used as the basis for retirement benefits. Executive Board members normally receive a defined contribution pension. An exception applies to Executive Board members with existing entitlements from previous positions within Deutsche Börse Group. In this case, they may receive a defined benefit pension instead. This exception only applies to Thomas Book.\n\n#### Defined contribution pension system\n\nThe rules of the defined contribution pension scheme apply to Theodor Weimer, Christoph Böhm, Heike Eckert, Stephan Leithner and Gregor Pottmeyer.\n\nUnder the defined contribution pension scheme, the company makes an annual capital contribution to the scheme for each calendar year that a member serves on the Executive Board. This pension contribution is calculated by applying an individual contribution rate to their pensionable income. The Supervisory Board determines and regularly reviews the pensionable income. The annual capital contributions calculated in this way bear interest of at least 3 per cent per annum. As a rule, retirement benefits are paid as a monthly pension. However, the Executive Board member may choose for payment to be made in the form of a one-off lump sum or as five instalments. The entitlements vest in accordance with the provisions of Betriebsrentengesetz (German Company Pensions Act).\n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/262/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons. The first button has a house icon, the second button has a magnifying glass icon, the third button has a left-pointing arrow with a line behind it, the fourth button has a left-pointing arrow, and the fifth button has a right-pointing arrow.\n\n[Combined management report](#page-16-0)\n\n#### [Consolidated financial statements/notes](#page-123-0)\n\n#### [Remuneration report](#page-249-0)\n\n### [Remuneration report](#page-250-0) [Auditor's Report](#page-299-0)\n\n[Further information](#page-301-0)\n\n### Defined benefit pension system (legacy commitment)\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nAfter reaching the contractually agreed retirement age, beneficiaries covered by the defined benefit pension system receive a certain proportion of their individual pensionable income as a pension, known as the replacement rate. The requirement is that the respective Executive Board member was in office for at least three years and was reappointed at least once. As is the case under the defined contribution scheme, the Supervisory Board determines and regularly reviews the pensionable income. The replacement rate depends on the length of Executive Board service and number of reappointments, and amounts to a maximum of 50 per cent. The payment terms and the rules governing vesting correspond to those of the defined contribution scheme.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are entitled to an early pension if the company does not extend their service agreements, unless the reasons for doing so are attributable to the Executive Board member or would justify terminating the agreement without observance of a notice period. As in the case of a retirement pension, the amount of the early pension is calculated by applying the replacement rate to the respective pensionable income. Executive Board members with a defined contribution pension are not eligible for an early pension.\n\n#### Permanent incapacity to work and death benefits\n\nA key element of the retirement benefits is insurance coverage for Executive Board members in the event of permanent incapacity for work or death. If an Executive Board member has a permanent occupational disability, the company has the right to put that Executive Board member into retirement. A permanent occupational disability arises if the Executive Board member is incapable of working for more than six months and it is not expected that they will be fit to return to work within another six months. In this case, Executive Board\n\nmembers with defined benefit pensions receive an amount calculated by applying the achieved replacement rate to the respective pensionable income. Executive Board members with defined contribution pensions receive the plan assets already accrued when the pension benefits fall due, plus a supplement. The supplement corresponds to the full annual pension contribution that would have been due in the year of departure multiplied by the number of years between the date on which the pension benefits fall due and the Executive Board member's sixtieth birthday. If an Executive Board member dies, their surviving spouse receives 60 per cent and each eligible child 10 per cent (for full orphans: 25 per cent) of the amount presented above, however up to a maximum of 100 per cent of the pension contribution.\n\n#### Transitional payments\n\nFurther information\n\nIn the event that an Executive Board member becomes permanently incapable of working, the defined benefit pension agreements for Executive Board members provide for a transitional payment. The amount of this payment corresponds to the target amount of performance-based remuneration (Performance Bonus and Performance Shares) in the year in which the event triggering the benefits occurs. It is paid out in two tranches in the two following years. If an Executive Board member dies, their spouse receives 60 per cent of the transitional payment.\n\nThe pensionable income and the present value of the pension commitments as at 31 December 2023 are shown in the following tables in consolidated form for each Executive Board member:\n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/263/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Performance-based remuneration comprises a Performance Bonus and Performance Shares. The performancebased remuneration components are mostly assessed on a multi-year basis to ensure the sustainable long-term development of Deutsche Börse AG. They are also mostly share-based, which aligns the interests of the Executive Board and the shareholders. Performance-based remuneration is calculated largely on the basis of long-term performance by measuring various performance criteria over five years (Performance Shares and performance-based restricted stock: a oneyear performance period plus a four-year blocking period). The cash portion of the Performance Bonus (annual payout) is the only short-term element of the performance-based remuneration. The performance criteria include both financial and non-financial targets. In order to systematically pursue the idea of pay for performance, the performance criteria are set ambitiously. In order to take a holistic approach to the company's success, different performance criteria are used for the Performance Bonus and Performance Shares.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nIn accordance with recommendation G.8 GCGC, targets and reference parameters set by the Supervisory Board for performance-based remuneration components for each upcoming financial year may not be changed retrospectively.\n\nThe performance criteria and other important aspects of the performancebased remuneration components address the core pillars of the corporate strategy.

The target achievement and the resulting cash payout, as well as the amount to be invested in shares (performance-based restricted stock), are measured based on three equally weighted performance criteria: net revenue, EBITDA and individual targets.\n\nThe Performance Bonus is intended to set incentives for the realisation of operational objectives which are materially important to the long-term development of Deutsche Börse AG. For this reason, the performance criteria include net revenue and EBITDA, financial indicators which are vital for the successful execution of the corporate strategy and create incentives for profitable growth. Individual targets make it possible to differentiate performance according to the operational and strategic responsibilities of the individual Executive Board members. At the same time, the individual targets allow the Executive Board as a whole to be guided, particularly in terms of achieving core strategic targets which are essential for the implementation of the corporate strategy.\n\nA Performance Bonus with a certain target amount is agreed with each Executive Board member every year, with target achievement being measured over the course of a financial year. In total, an overall target achievement ranging from 0 per cent to 200 per cent is possible. This means that a complete loss of the Performance Bonus is also possible.\n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/266/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

Target achievement of 0 per cent to 200 per cent is possible for each performance criterion.\n\n### Net revenue\n\nThe basis is net revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements. This consists of revenue plus net interest income from banking business and other operating income, less volume-related costs. Using net revenue as a performance criterion for the Performance Bonus is intended to incentivise the desired growth in net revenue. This serves as the basis for all the other activities carried out by Deutsche Börse AG and for its long-term, sustainable success.\n\nThe target achievement for the market expectation component and the target achievement for the growth component are added to calculate the target achievement for the net revenue performance criterion.\n\nTarget achievement for the market expectation component of net revenue To calculate the target achievement for the market expectation component of net revenue, a target value is set by the Supervisory Board before the financial year begins. The target value set by the Supervisory Board is based on capital market consensus. In this way the Supervisory Board ensures that the target is in line with investors' expectations for the upcoming financial year. For 2023 the Supervisory Board set a target of €4,577.2 million.\n\nThe target value determines the lower limit, which is 85 per cent of the target value and so €3,890.6 million for the 2023 financial year. The upper limit is 110 per cent of the target and so €5,034.9 million.\n\n{267}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/267/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

This ensures that the target achievement is measured by reference to the target set. Net revenue for the measurement of target achievement was reduced by €–198.0 million in the 2023 financial year to reflect the takeover of SimCorp A/S, which was not included in the target set. On this basis the actual value was €4,878.6 million.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\n### Determination of actual value Net revenue\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\n| €m            | Net revenue<br>2023 |\n|---------------|---------------------|\n| \"As reported\" | 5,076.6             |\n| Adjustments   | - 198.0             |\n| Actual value  | 4,878.6             |\n\nThis represents a target achievement of 165.85 per cent in the market expectation component of net revenue.\n\n#### Target achievement value Net revenue\n\n|                            | Target<br>achievement<br>2023 |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Target<br>value €m         | 4,577.2                       |\n| Actual value €m            | 4,878.6                       |\n| Deviation<br>%             | 6.58                          |\n| Target<br>achievement<br>% | 165.85                        |\n\nFurther information\n\nImage /page/267/Figure/15 description: The image is a line graph.

This stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses. One of the main pillars of the corporate strategy, alongside absolute growth, is the profitability of this growth. To reflect this strategic relevance, EBITDA has been established as a key indicator for the purpose of managing Deutsche Börse AG and implementing the corporate strategy, and thus serves as a performance criterion for the Performance Bonus.\n\nThe target achievement for the market expectation component and the target achievement for the growth component are added to calculate the target achievement for the EBITDA criterion.\n\nTarget achievement for the market expectation component of EBITDA To calculate the target achievement for the market expectation component of EBITDA, a target value is set by the Supervisory Board before the financial year begins. The target value is determined by multiplying the EBITDA margin in the previous year by the target value for the performance criterion net revenue for the upcoming financial year, as described above. For the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board set a target value of €2,665.1 million.\n\nThe target value determines the lower limit, which is 85 per cent of the target value and so €2,265.3 million for the 2023 financial year. The upper limit is 110 per cent of the target value and so €2,931.6 million for the 2023 financial year.\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/269/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

The overall target achievement for the performance criterion EBITDA is therefore 200.00 per cent in 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Target achievement EBITDA 2023\n\n|        |                                                                  | Growth component     |                      |             |                            |                                                 |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|        | Market<br>expectation<br>component<br>target<br>achievement<br>% | EBITDA<br>2023<br>€m | EBITDA<br>2022<br>€m | Change<br>% | Target<br>achievement<br>% | Overall<br>target<br>achievement<br>EBITDA<br>% |\n| EBITDA | 200.00                                                           | 2,944.3              | 2,525.6              | 16.58       | 49.73                      | 200.00                                          |\n\n### Individual targets\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe individual targets are set by the Supervisory Board for each Executive Board member for the upcoming financial year (or for the remainder of the year if the member is appointed in the course of the year). Individual targets may be defined for multiple or all Executive Board members together. When setting individual targets, the Supervisory Board ensures that they are demanding and quantifiable. To ensure this is the case, concrete figures or expectations are defined for the target achievement. To avoid any dilution of the\n\nincentive effect, each Executive Board member has no more than four targets per financial year.\n\nThe targets are derived from the corporate strategy and promote its implementation. Strategic projects and initiatives can be used, as can operating measures that serve directly or indirectly for the implementation of the corporate strategy.\n\nIndividual targets should contribute to an implementation of the corporate strategy as well as the long-term, sustainable development of Deutsche Börse AG. Targets can be based on both financial and non-financial indicators. ESG targets are also potential individual targets. By defining financial and non-financial targets and measuring their achievement, the Supervisory Board ensures that the implementation of the corporate strategy is advanced and pursued sustainably, and that a holistic approach is taken to the success of Deutsche Börse Group.\n\nUp to four individual targets were defined for all Executive Board members at the start of the 2023 financial year. The Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board both discussed the individual targets in detail. A decision on the target achievement was taken on the basis of a detailed presentation and assessment of the Executive Board's collective and individual performances.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the targets for each Executive Board member for 2023:\n\n{271}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/271/Picture/7 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

On the other hand, the inclusion of ESG targets in the PSP emphasises a focus on Deutsche Börse AG's sustainable development. At the same time, the five-year performance period encourages a focus, in particular, on the long-term development of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\nThe PSP provides each Executive Board member with a number of so-called Performance Shares at the beginning of every financial year. The number of these initial (virtual) Performance Shares is determined by dividing the amount of the individual target remuneration in euros by the average Xetra® closing price of Deutsche Börse shares in the calendar month preceding the start of the performance period.\n\nThe relevant share price at grant for the PSP Tranche 2023, which was granted at the beginning of the 2023 financial year and ends at the close of the 2027 financial year, was €168.05. The individual target amounts, the share price at grant, the number of virtual Performance Shares granted and the potential maximum number of Performance Shares at the end of the performance period are shown for the individual Executive Board members below:\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/275/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The overall target achievement for the Performance Shares is measured using the performance criteria relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), earnings per share (EPS) and ESG targets. The financial performance criteria each allow for a target achievement of 0 per cent to 250 per cent, whereas the ESG targets allow for a target achievement of 0 per cent to 217.5 per cent. The target achievement for the criteria relative TSR and EPS is measured at the end of the five-year performance period. The target achievement for the ESG targets is determined and locked in at the end of every financial year, however. The final target achievement for the ESG targets is measured at the end of the five-year performance period using the average target achievement over the financial years.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nThe final number of virtual Performance Shares is determined by the overall target achievement for the performance criteria over the five-year performance period, multiplied by the number of Performance Shares initially granted. The final number of Performance Shares determined in this manner is multiplied by the average Xetra® closing price for Deutsche Börse shares in the calendar month preceding the end of the performance period, plus the dividends paid during the performance period. This represents the development of the Deutsche Börse share over the five-year performance period. The result of the multiplication is the payout amount for the acquisition of real shares. The payout amount from the Performance Shares is capped at 400 per cent of the target amount. It is due no later than with the regular salary payment for the calendar month following the approval of the consolidated financial statements after the end of the respective performance period.\n\nThe Executive Board members are obliged to invest the entire payout amount after tax in shares of Deutsche Börse AG.\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/276/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The formula starts with \"Target amount\" multiplied by \"Overall target achievement (0-242%)\". The overall target achievement is the sum of \"Relative TSR\", \"EPS\", and \"ESG targets\", with weights of 50%, 25%, and 25% respectively. The result is then multiplied by \"Development of virtual Performance Shares over five-year performance period\", which equals \"Payout in cash with obligation to acquire shares Cap: 400% target amount\". The formula is labeled with \"Performance period of five years\".\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\n# Performance criteria for the PSP Tranche 2023\n\n#### Relative Total Shareholder Return\n\nThe Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Deutsche Börse share compared with the companies in the sector-specific index STOXX® Europe 600 Financials over the five-year performance period provides an external performance criterion that is aligned with the capital market. The relative TSR emphasises the alignment of interests between Executive Board and shareholders and also integrates a relative performance metric into the remuneration system. This creates a strong incentive to outperform the relevant peer group over the long term.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 50 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. By defining an ambitious target achievement curve, which starts the payout only after the median has been exceeded, the Supervisory Board emphasises the pay-for-performance approach to Executive Board remuneration also with regards to the Total Shareholder Return.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for relative TSR is as follows:\n\nImage /page/276/Figure/15 description: The image is a graph showing the target achievement percentage versus the relative TSR against index (percentile rank). The x-axis represents the relative TSR against index (percentile rank), with labels at 50th, 60th, and 90th percentiles. The y-axis represents the target achievement percentage, with labels at 0, 50, 100, and 250. The graph shows a piecewise linear function. From the start to the 50th percentile, the target achievement is 0%. At the 50th percentile, the target achievement jumps to 50%. From the 50th percentile to the 60th percentile, the target achievement increases linearly to 100%. From the 60th percentile to the 90th percentile, the target achievement increases linearly to 250%. After the 90th percentile, the target achievement remains constant at 250%.\n\nThe target achievement for the criterion relative TSR is disclosed at the end of the performance period for the respective PSP tranche.\n\n### Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is used as an internal financial performance criterion. The basis for the criterion is EPS as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Alongside net revenue and EBITDA, EPS is the third key indicator for measuring the successful implementation of the growth strategy. Implementing EPS as a performance criterion for the Performance Shares incentivises long-term profitable growth in this remuneration component too, and reflects Deutsche Börse AG's focus on growth. Including EPS as a performance criterion for the Performance Shares also ensures that only M&As that are\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/277/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

The target defined by the Supervisory Board is an EPS CAGR of 7.5 per cent p.a. over the performance period. The cap was set at 18.75 per cent p.a. and the floor at 0 per cent p.a.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for EPS is as follows:\n\nget achievement (%)\n\nFurther information\n\nImage /page/277/Figure/13 description: The image is a graph with x and y axes. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 18.75, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 250. A line starts at (0,0), increases linearly to (7.5, 100), and then continues to increase linearly to (18.75, 250).\n\nTo measure target achievement, the reported EPS is adjusted for any amortisation of intangible assets, purchase price allocations (PPA) and transaction costs in the case of large M&A transactions valued at more than €1 billion. The PPA correction reflects the business model of Deutsche Börse AG and potential M&A targets, since these typically only have minor tangible assets. Adjusting for transaction costs means the Executive Board is not penalised by completing larger M&A transactions, which is in line with the growth strategy by means of both organic and inorganic growth.\n\n{278}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/278/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

This underlines Deutsche Börse AG's focus on a holistic approach to its corporate responsibility and ensures its sustainable success as a company.\n\nThe ESG targets are defined on the basis of a catalogue of criteria with four categories: \"External view\", \"Employee satisfaction\", \"Expansion of ESG business\" and \"CO2 neutrality\". They reflect the different ESG aspects and cover them holistically.\n\n| Category  | External view                                                  | Employee<br>satisfaction           | Expansion of<br>ESG business                  | CO2 neutrality                            |  |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--|\n| Target    | Good results in<br>three leading<br>independent ESG<br>ratings | Good results in<br>employee survey | Growth in net<br>revenue from<br>ESG products | Achieve and<br>maintain<br>CO2 neutrality |  |\n| Weighting | 6.25%                                                          | 6.25%                              | 6.25%                                         | 6.25%                                     |  |\n| Logic     | 5-year target with annual lock-in                              |                                    |                                               |                                           |  |\n\nThe targets in these four categories are clearly measurable and subject to specific target achievement curves. To measure overall target achievement for the ESG targets, the first step is to calculate the target achievement in the four categories \"External view\", \"Employee satisfaction\", \"Expansion of ESG business\" and \"CO2 neutrality\" at the end of each financial year. These figures are then added on a weighted basis and formally confirmed. At the end of the five-year performance period, the second step is to measure the overall target achievement for the ESG targets by calculating the average of the annual target achievements for ESG targets over the entire performance period. The possible overall target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 217.5 per cent. The annual target achievement for the ESG targets and the achievement in the individual categories of ESG targets are disclosed at the end of each financial year.\n\n### External view\n\nFurther information\n\nIn the \"External view\" category, the aim is to achieve good results in three leading independent ESG ratings. The target achievement is based on the average ranking (percentile) in three leading independent ESG ratings determined beforehand by the Supervisory Board. For the PSP Tranche 2023, the Supervisory Board has chosen the ESG ratings from S&P, Sustainalytics and MSCI.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. The Supervisory Board has chosen the 90th percentile as the target and defined an upper and lower limit. The upper limit is the 99th percentile and the lower limit the 75th percentile.\n\n{279}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/279/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The x-axis shows the 75th, 90th, and 99th percentiles. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 250. The line graph shows that the target achievement is 0% until the 75th percentile. It then increases linearly to 100% at the 90th percentile. Finally, it increases linearly to 250% at the 99th percentile and remains constant thereafter.\n\nAverage percentile in ESG ratings\n\nRemuneration report\n\n### Employee satisfaction\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nA sustainable HR policy is also part of Deutsche Börse AG's sustainability strategy. This particularly includes a high level of employee satisfaction. To emphasise this, good results in the annual employee survey are integrated as an additional ESG target. The survey is carried out by an independent external provider.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. The Supervisory Board has defined a target value in the annual employee survey of 71.5 per cent approval, and set upper and lower limits. The cap is set at 84.5 per cent approval and the floor at 55.5 per cent approval.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for the category \"Employee satisfaction\" is as follows:\n\nImage /page/279/Figure/18 description: The image is a line graph. The x-axis ranges from approximately 50 to 90, with labeled points at 55.5, 71.5, and 84.5. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 250, with a labeled point at 100. A dark blue line starts at (55.5, 0), increases linearly to (71.5, 100), and then continues to increase linearly to (84.5, 250), after which it remains constant at 250.\n\nBasis: employee survey (%)\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/280/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

In 2021, Deutsche Börse Group developed an own definition for ESG net revenue and reviews it annually. As part of this review, the scope of the ESG net revenue was adjusted.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nIn the Investment Management Solutions segment, ISS STOXX offers rating services for management and investment decisions on the one hand, as well as solutions for compliance with regulatory, governance or market standards and/or shareholder or stakeholder expectations. On the other hand, ISS STOXX offers ESG indices and climate benchmarks. The corresponding ESG net revenue includes the Corporate Solutions, ESG Analytics and Governance Solutions businesses as well as all revenue from the licensing of sustainable index solutions. License revenue from such products can either be allocated directly (e.g. in the case of ETF licenses) or an allocation is made if they are sold as part of a package.\n\nIn the Trading & Clearing segment, EEX operates trading and clearing services for commodity spot and derivatives markets. EEX defines ESG net revenue as revenue related to sustainable commodity markets. They include contracts for green power, emission allowances and related registry/ guarantee of origin services as well as power products, related to the share of renewable energy production in the respective market area or country.\n\nThe possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent. The Supervisory Board has defined a target value for growth in ESG net revenue of 10 per cent p.a., and set upper and lower limits. The cap was set at 25 per cent p.a. and the floor at 0 per cent p.a.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for the category \"Expansion of ESG business\" is as follows:\n\nTarget achievement (%)\n\nImage /page/280/Figure/16 description: The image is a line graph. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 25, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 250.

If CO2 neutrality is achieved, the target achievement is 100 per cent. If it is missed, the target achievement is 0 per cent.\n\nAs a further incentive to achieve CO2 neutrality, the target achievement is also subject to a sub-condition: that CO2 emissions have to be reduced. If CO2 emissions are reduced, the target achievement in the category \"CO2 neutrality\" is increased by 20 per cent. If this is not the case, the target achievement is reduced by 20 per cent. Since energy use in buildings accounts for a large share, CO2 neutrality is calculated per workplace.\n\nThe detailed target achievement curve for the category \"CO2 neutrality\" is as follows:\n\nTarget achievement (%)\n\nImage /page/281/Figure/14 description: The image is a graph comparing CO2 emissions per workplace for companies that are not CO2-neutral versus those that are. The x-axis is labeled \"Not CO2-neutral\" and \"CO2-neutral.\" The y-axis ranges from 0 to 200. For companies that are not CO2-neutral, the CO2 emissions per workplace are at 0. For CO2-neutral companies, the CO2 emissions per workplace are at 100. There are two horizontal dotted lines at 80 and 120, labeled \"No reduction of CO2 emissions per workplace (-20% target achievement)\" and \"Reduction of CO2 emissions per workplace (+20% target achievement)\" respectively.\n\nCO₂ neutrality\n\n{282}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-282-0\"></span>Image /page/282/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

The PSP Tranche 2019 was based on the remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board with effect from 1 January 2016 and approved by the Annual General Meeting with a majority of 84.19 per cent on 11 May 2016 (remuneration system 2016). The target achievement for the PSP Tranche 2019 was measured on the basis of the equally weighted performance criteria \"Adjusted Net Income Growth\" and \"TSR Performance\".\n\n#### Adjusted Net Income Growth\n\nAdjusted Net Income Growth is the growth in the adjusted net income attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche Börse AG for the corresponding financial year. The Supervisory Board determines the target achievement rate for Adjusted Net Income Growth at the end of each financial year during the fiveyear performance period, which is then locked in. The target achievement rate at the end of the performance period in question is the average of the annual target achievement rates for each of the five years. Target achievement degrees may range between 0 per cent and 250 per cent.\n\n{283}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/283/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular icons in a horizontal row.

It differs from unadjusted net income (€1,724.0 million) by non-recurring effects due to M&A activities and legal disputes. It was also corrected for the costs of organisational restructuring.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nThe increase of 17.56 per cent represents a target achievement of 250.00 per cent for the 2023 financial year.\n\nOverall, a target achievement of 170.388 per cent was determined for the performance criteria \"Adjusted Net Income Growth\" for the PSP Tranche 2019.\n\nThe following overviews show the individual target achievements over the performance period and the target achievement curve:\n\n#### Target achievement Net income\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\n| Financial<br>year          | Net income growth<br>% | Target<br>achievement<br>% |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 2019                       | 10.26                  | 139.40                     |\n| 2020                       | 8.93                   | 108.58                     |\n| 2021                       | 8.16                   | 103.96                     |\n| 2022                       | 20.24                  | 250.00                     |\n| 2023                       | 17.56                  | 250.00                     |\n| Ø<br>Target<br>achievement |                        | 170.388                    |\n\nFurther information\n\nImage /page/283/Figure/15 description: The image is a graph that shows the relationship between adjusted net income growth (in percentage) and some other variable.

The y-axis is not explicitly labeled but has horizontal dotted lines at values 100, 115, 133, and 250. The graph itself is a piecewise linear function. It starts at a low value for adjusted net income growth less than 0, then increases linearly until it reaches 100 at +7.5% growth. It continues to increase, reaching 115 at +10% growth, then jumps to 133 at +10% growth. It then increases linearly again until it reaches 250 at +15% growth. Finally, it remains constant at 250 for adjusted net income growth greater than +15%.\n\n#### TSR Performance\n\nThe relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance for Deutsche Börse shares is derived from Deutsche Börse AG's ranking relative to the companies included in the STOXX® Europe 600 Financials index. The ranking is measured on the basis of the TSR performance, which is calculated by comparing the TSR at the beginning and end of the performance period. Possible target achievement ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent.\n\nOverall, a target achievement of 155.00 per cent was determined for the performance criteria \"TSR Performance\" for the PSP Tranche 2019.\n\n{284}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/284/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons.

They also align Executive Board remuneration more closely with the strategic objective of Deutsche Börse AG's long-term success. The remuneration system obliges the CEO to hold 200 per cent and ordinary Executive Board members 100 per cent of their annual gross base salary in Deutsche Börse AG shares.\n\nShares from the Performance Bonus and shares from the payout of Performance Shares are also taken into account for the share ownership guidelines, in addition to shares held privately.\n\nThe required shareholdings have to be acquired within a period of four years.\n\nThe purchase of shares under the Performance Bonus Plan and the Performance Share Plan and purchases from private funds is carried out for Executive Board members by a service provider determined by Deutsche Börse AG and engaged by the Executive Board member, which invests the respective amounts in Deutsche Börse AG shares for the Executive Board member independently, without any influence from the Executive Board member or the company. Shares are purchased during the first four trading days in June of each year that are consecutive calendar days.\n\n{286}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/286/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The Supervisory Board is entitled to assert a clawback claim even after an Executive Board member has left the company, for a period of up to two years following termination of the service contract. Any claims for damages remain unaffected by any clawback of performance-based remuneration.\n\nThere was no cause to apply the malus or clawback rules in the 2023 financial year, so the Supervisory Board did not reduce or recover any performancebased remuneration.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group – Annual report 2023\n\n{288}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/288/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The payment is calculated on the basis of the total remuneration for the past financial year and, where appropriate, the expected total remuneration for the current financial year.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nRemuneration report\n\nFurther information\n\nThe payouts for the Performance Bonus and the Performance Shares take place on the dates and conditions originally agreed upon. Payouts are not made any earlier. In accordance with the recommendation of the GCGC, an exception applies in cases in which the service contract ends early because of permanent incapacity or any other illness, or the death of the Executive Board member. In these cases, the target amount of Performance Bonus and Performance Shares is paid out immediately.\n\n## Early termination for good cause\n\nIf the service contract is terminated early for a good cause for which the Executive Board member is responsible, or if an Executive Board member steps down before the end of the performance period without good cause or without a corresponding agreement, any claims to the Performance Bonus and all Performance Shares are forfeited.\n\n## Post-contractual non-competition clause\n\nA post-contractual non-competition clause applies to members of the Executive Board. This means that the Executive Board members are contractually prohibited from acting for a competing company, or from undertaking competing activities, for one year following the end of their service. Compensation of 75 per cent of the base salary and 75 per cent of the most recent Performance Bonus is payable during the non-compete period. Pension benefits and any severance payments are offset against the compensation. In addition, 50 per cent of other earnings are deducted if these – together with the compensation – exceed the Executive Board member's most recent remuneration. The company may waive the post-contractual non-compete clause before the Executive Board member's contract of service ends.\n\n# Information on third-party benefits\n\nExecutive Board members did not receive any benefits from third parties for their work on the Executive Board in the 2023 financial year.\n\n{289}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/289/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons.

The remuneration awarded and due comprises all remuneration components for which performance has already been measured, for which all conditions precedent and subsequent are met or no longer apply, and which are vested at the close of the financial year. It is irrelevant whether the payout has already been made in the 2023 financial year or occurs at the beginning of the 2024 financial year. So for the one-year variable remuneration, for example, the Performance Bonus (cash component) for the 2023 financial year is shown, although the payout takes place at the beginning of the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe remuneration shown for the 2023 financial year consists of:\n\n- Base salary paid in the 2023 financial year\n- Fringe benefits received in the 2023 financial year\n- Performance Bonus determined for the 2023 financial year (cash component), which will be paid out in the 2024 financial year\n- Performance Bonus determined for the 2023 financial year (restricted stock), which will be paid out and invested in the 2024 financial year\n- Tranche of Performance Shares granted in 2019 and ended at the close of 2023, which will be paid out in three equal parts in 2024, 2025 and 2026\n\nThe service cost as defined in IAS 19 is part of Executive Board remuneration. The retirement benefit commitments for the 2023 financial year are shown accordingly in the tables.\n\n{290}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/290/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

The current system is only slightly different to the previous system of remuneration of Supervisory Board members which was applied from 1 May 2020. In the current remuneration system the attendance fee is also paid for virtual attendance and is paid for each meeting day.\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nFurther information\n\nThe remuneration system for the Supervisory Board consists of a fixed remuneration plus an attendance fee. This is in line with the recommendation G.18 sentence 1 GCGC as amended on 28 April 2022. The structure of Supervisory Board remuneration, providing for fixed remuneration only, strengthens the Board's independence and provides for a counterbalance to the structure of Executive Board remuneration, which is mainly variable and aligned with Deutsche Börse Group's growth strategy. Supervisory Board remuneration therefore contributes to the implementation of the business strategy, and thus promotes Deutsche Börse Group's long-term development.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual remuneration of €85 thousand. In accordance with recommendation G.17 GCGC, remuneration is increased for the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Deputy Chair, as well as for chairs and members of committees. Remuneration of the Chair is €220 thousand. Remuneration of the Deputy Chair is €125 thousand. Members of Supervisory Board committees receive additional fixed annual remuneration of €30 thousand for each committee position they hold. The remuneration for members of the Audit Committee is €35 thousand. Remuneration of committee chairs is €40 thousand and for the Chair of the Audit Committee €75 thousand. If a Supervisory Board member sits on more than one\n\nSupervisory Board committee, only work on two of the committees is remunerated. Remuneration is then paid for work on the two committees with the highest remuneration. Supervisory Board members who only hold office for part of the financial year receive one-twelfth of the fixed annual remuneration and, if applicable, of the remuneration payable for their membership of committees, for each month or part-month in which they are members. The remuneration for any financial year is due and payable as a one-off payment after the Annual General Meeting that accepts the consolidated financial statements for the relevant financial year or decides on their approval.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board or a Supervisory Board committee receive an attendance fee of €1 thousand for each Board or committee meeting that they attend. Where two or more meetings are held on the same day, the attendance fee is only paid once.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are included in a directors & officers (D&O) insurance policy maintained by the company at an appropriate level in the interests of the company.\n\nAfter preparation by the Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board examines on a regular basis whether its members' remuneration is appropriate, given their tasks and the situation of the company. It carries out a horizontal market comparison for this purpose. The Supervisory Board may seek the advice of an independent external expert. Given the particular nature of the Supervisory Board's work, the review of Supervisory Board remuneration does not generally include a vertical comparison with the remuneration of employees of Deutsche Börse AG or Deutsche Börse Group.\n\n{294}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/294/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The joint operation Frankfurt consists of Deutsche Börse AG and the following entities: Eurex Frankfurt AG, Eurex Clearing AG, Eurex Repo GmbH, Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange GmbH, Clearstream Holding AG and Clearstream Banking AG. As for Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration, the average remuneration for the entire workforce is total remuneration (including any bonuses and other fringe benefits).\n\nManagement report Consolidated financial\n\nstatements and notes\n\nFurther information\n\nExecutive Board and Supervisory Board\n\n# Look ahead to 2024 from a remuneration perspective\n\nAs the remuneration system for the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG and the Remuneration Report 2022 were approved by a large majority of shareholders, no changes to the remuneration system are currently planned. On the contrary, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG sees these votes as a clear recommendation to maintain the current remuneration unchanged and to apply it again in the 2024 financial year. This applies particularly to the underlying performance criteria and the target achievement curves.\n\nIn view of the scheduled approval of the remuneration system for the Executive Board by the Annual General Meeting in 2025, the Supervisory Board, advised by its Nomination Committee, will review the current remuneration system in the 2024 financial year and notify significant shareholders of the results of the review and planned adjustments.\n\nRegardless of this, the intention is to present a remuneration system for the Supervisory Board with adjustments for approval at the Annual General Meeting 2024. The intention is to adjust the amount of remuneration in line with the function, in order to guarantee that the Supervisory Board remuneration remains competitive in future. In addition, this will reflect both the continuous expansion of Deutsche Börse Group's business activities in terms of their structure, volume and international scope, and the complexity of the legal and regulatory requirements and the demands on the Supervisory Board members and the increased liability risk that results.\n\nDetailed information about the adjustments to the Supervisory Board remuneration can be found in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting 2024.\n\n{299}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-299-0\"></span>Image /page/299/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons in a horizontal row.

The executive directors and the Supervisory Board are also responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Responsibility of the auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of\n\nfinancial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or error. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or error, including the related disclosures. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the remuneration report and related disclosures. The objective is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control system. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n{300}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/300/Picture/0 description: The image shows five gray circular buttons with white icons inside.

Since we express an unqualified opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this opinion includes that the disclosures pursuant to Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG have been made in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\n# Restriction of use\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the audit agreement with Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft concluded with Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft.
