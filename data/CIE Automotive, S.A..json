The waste generated that cannot be recycled is collected by expert handlers which prioritise recycling over the landfill disposal method. In 2023\\*, 1.69% was sent to landfills 87.35% was reused and the remaining 10.96% was directed to other forms of disposal.\n\n### **Aluminium**\n\nThe injection moulding and machining processes generate sizeable amounts of remains such as sprue, risers, starting pieces, etc. from the injection moulding process and shavings from the machining process. In both instances, the company reuses these remnants in the casting process.\n\n#### **Plastic**\n\nThe plastics division recycles sprue and other remains returned by its injection moulding process.\n\n#### **Steel**\n\nThis is the material with the highest associated volume of waste. As it cannot be recycled in full within the group's factories, it is delivered to a number of different local suppliers for full reuse.\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/10 description: The image shows a gray recycling bin with a white recycling symbol on it. The recycling symbol is made up of three arrows that form a triangle.\n\nResponsibility for waste generation does not end when that waste is removed from CIE Automotive's facilities. In addition to its waste minimisation plans, the company has devised a new waste classification system sorted by method of elimination, thereby seeking to reduce its environmental impact.\n\n### **Food waste**\n\nRegardless of the fact that, due to the group's main activity as a manufacturer of automotive parts and components, this is not a material issue, CIE Automotive carries out different measures to avoid food waste. For example, the start-up of some biogas generation facilities from the food waste generated.\n\n*[For further information on waste generation by region, refer to the detailed table provided in the \"Data tables and glossary\" appendix]*\n\n#### **WASTE MANAGEMENT**\n\n*(\\*) Includes emissions from discontinued German forging companies until June 30, 2023.*\n\n| MT                                 | 2021      | 2022      | 2023*     |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hazardous waste<br>disposed of     | 17,457.9  | 17,462.1  | 21,441.7  |\n| Non-hazardous waste<br>disposed of | 355,293.2 | 324,307.3 | 358,629.6 |\n| TOTAL                              | 372,751.1 | 341,770.0 | 380,071.2 |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/16 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

On the right side of the image is the number 23.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system establishing the conditions that an economic activity has to meet in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable; specifically an activity must make a substantial contribution to one or more of the six environmental objectives established by the European Union, without having a significant detrimental impact (the Do No Significant Harm principle) on the other five, while meeting certain minimum social safeguards, defined as ILO Core Labour Conventions, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Taxonomy is to redirect investment flows towards climate neutrality (net zero GHG emissions) via a two-pronged plan: helping players in the financial sector to decarbonise their securities and credit portfolios and giving non-financial companies (such as CIE Automotive) increased access to financing for technology, products and services in line with the guidelines set in the green transition framework.\n\nFollowing an analysis of its activities, CIE Automotive concluded that its productive processes, despite applying a range of methodologies, are encompassed by economic activity code NACE C29.3.2. Manufacture of other parts and accessories for motor vehicles.\n\nThat economic activity is identified in Commission Delegated Regulation 2023/2485 of 27 June 2023, within the climate change mitigation objective, under code **3.18. Manufacture of automotive and mobility components**, which is defined as follows:\n\n*Manufacture, repair, maintenance, retrofitting, repurposing and upgrade of mobility components for zeroemission personal mobility devices and of automotive and mobility systems, components, separate technical units, parts and spare parts as defined in Article 3, points (18) to (21) and (23) of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council, type approved, designed, and constructed for use only in vehicles and buses of category M1, M2, M3, N1, N2 and N3, and in Article 3, points (15) to (18) and (21) in Regulation (EU) 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, type approved, designed, and constructed for use only in vehicles of category L meeting the criteria set out in this Section and which are essential for delivering and improving the environmental performance of the vehicle.*\n\nAs a result, as defined in the Regulation, CIE Automotive's economic activity is Taxonomyeligible in 2023. Given that this activity is being reported for the first time this year, as prescribed in Article 5 of Commission\n\nDelegated Regulation 2023/2485 of 27 June 2023, this year the Group only has to report eligibility; the alignment disclosures will be mandatory next year.\n\nIn addition, in order to comply with the Regulation's requirements, the Group assessed the materiality of the three KPIs - turnover, CapEx and OPEX - in relation to the rest of the activities described in the Regulations, as outlined next.\n\n#### **TURNOVER**\n\nThe key performance indicator (KPI) related to turnover is calculated as the percentage of turnover derived from Taxonomy-aligned activities (numerator) over total company turnover (denominator). Turnover is defined as the revenue recognised pursuant to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008.\n\nCIE Automotive, S.A. reports an eligible turnover KPI associated with activity 3.18 equivalent to 13.4% (turnover of 531,588 thousand euros). This percentage is arrived at by assigning each automotive part made by each of our factories to each of the original equipment makers that exist in the world. To obtain the percentage of electric vehicles made by all the platforms, CIE Automotive relied on information reported by IHS Markit, one of the largest data and analytics providers for many industries, with a solid presence in the automotive sector. IHS Markit provides the percentages of pure electric vehicles manufactured globally by each platform. CIE Automotive uses those percentages and the sales figures by platform as the basis for estimating turnover associated with zeroemissions vehicles.\n\n### **COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 ON CLIMATE TAXONOMY** Chairman\n\nand CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 3 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/20 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive. The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The \"C\" is formed by two curved black shapes that do not quite meet, creating an opening. The text \"CIE Automotive\" is in a simple, sans-serif font, with \"CIE\" in a bolder typeface than \"Automotive\".\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters. To the right of the words is a large gray quotation mark and the number 23 in black.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **CapEx**\n\nThe CapEx KPI is measured as the percentage of fixed assets invested in eligible economic activities (numerator) over total assets acquired in the course of 2023 (denominator). That denominator (Total CapEx) is defined as additions to tangible and intangible assets during the financial year considered before depreciation, amortisation and any remeasurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant financial year and excluding fair value changes. It also includes additions resulting from business combinations. Accordingly, Total CapEx covers the costs recognised in keeping with IAS 16, IAS 38, IAS 40, IAS 41 and IFRS 16. In 2023, the CIE Automotive Group's CapEx totalled 311,884 thousand euros.\n\nWith respect to activity 3.18. Manufacture of automotive and mobility components, the Group attempted to estimate how much of its CapEx is associated with that activity. That was not possible, however, since the physical assets used to make a part for use in an electric vehicle (eligible activity) are for the most part the same assets as are used to make parts for use in a non-electric vehicle (non-eligible activity). The company is working to develop and improve its methodology and technological toolkit to enable it to directly identify the CapEx associated directly with the eligible activity.\n\nAs for the rest of its CapEx, the Group assessed whether the activities described in the Regulations are activities carried out by CIE Automotive, concluding that the amount of associated CapEx is not material.\n\nLikewise, in an attempt to comply with the Regulation requirements, the Tables include the most significant activities, even though the KPI reported by the company is equivalent to 0%, specifically, activities 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment and 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies, which account for just 323 thousand euros, just 0.1% of the company's Total CapEx.\n\nIt was concluded, therefore, that eligible CapEx under the Taxonomy is equivalent to 0%, so that alignment was not assessed for these activities; nevertheless, the eligible figures are provided in the section titled \"Data tables and glossary\".\n\n### **OpEx**\n\nThe OpEx KPI is defined as the percentage of Taxonomy-eligible OpEx (numerator) over total qualifying OpEx (denominator). That denominator covers direct noncapitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.\n\nIn 2023, the CIE Automotive Group's qualifying OpEx amounted to 60,045 thousand euros, equivalent to 1.7% of the CIE Automotive Group's total OpEx in 2023 (3,567 million euros), so that the Group's qualifying OpEx is considered non-material and, as prescribed in section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Commission Delegated Regulation of 6 July 2021, the numerator is therefore disclosed as being equal to zero, although the denominator is disclosed.\n\n|   | Chairman<br>and<br>CEO's<br>statement             |  |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------|--|\n| 1 | 2023<br>highlights                                |  |\n| 2 | Ready<br>for change                               |  |\n| 3 | Record<br>earnings                                |  |\n| 4 | Common<br>responsibility,<br>shared benefits      |  |\n| 5 | Our response to<br>the environmental<br>challenge |  |\n| 6 | Responsible<br>management                         |  |\n|   | About                                             |  |\n\n[this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/15 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive. The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The letter \"C\" is formed by two curved shapes that do not fully connect, creating an incomplete circle. The text \"CIE Automotive\" is in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/16 description: The image is a light gray illustration of a road winding through a landscape with stylized trees on either side. The road is depicted as a broad, curving path that starts from the lower left corner and extends upwards and towards the right. The trees are simple, rounded shapes with short trunks, giving them a cartoonish appearance. The overall tone of the image is soft and minimalist, with a focus on basic shapes and a muted color palette.\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters. To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" with a gray quotation mark above the number.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n**5.7**\n\n# **Environmental risk management**\n\nThe risk of accidents is covered by the company's civil liability insurance, while the company underwrites gradual pollution risk for the following factories in Spain: CIE Alcasting (aluminium), CIE Amaya (machining), CIE Galfor (forging), CIE Inyectametal (aluminium) and CIE Vilanova (aluminium). The last three facilities have integrated pollution prevention control (IPPC) permits. The claims limit on that gradual pollution insurance policy for those five factories is €3 million.\n\nTo reinforce the management of its environmental and safety risks, CIE Automotive is working on a joint project with the technical department at its insurance broker, which is part of a bigger project addressed in the \"Customer satisfaction\" section. Specifically, a series of risks are being evaluated and prioritised in accordance with criteria established by the broker's risk engineers with the idea of formulating plans for their elimination, or at least mitigation. In 2023, this project focused on factories in North America, Brazil and India, prioritising the largest facilities or those with most assets involved. There were also follow-up visits to factories already inspected in prior years.\n\nClimate change also poses a threat to the company's ability to attain its strategic targets. To that end, CIE Automotive includes climate change risk in its risk mapping process, addressing not only the risks deriving from the company's impact on the environment and climate change, but also the risks posed to the company by the environment and climate change, and the interrelationship between the two.\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/16 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The following pages explain how we took decisions and how we embarked on pathways that not only served to consolidate our financial success but also impacted the people and organisations around us and will ultimately benefit society and the planet in the long term.\n\nWe are living in challenging times: the sector is faced with making heavy investments to decarbonise vehicles and increase their connectivity and comfort; it is being drawn into a price war in the electric vehicle segment; and inflation and higher costs are putting pressure on our earnings. There are also, however, encouraging signs that we are on the cusp of a new automotive cycle. Ageing vehicle fleets around the world, low penetration in emerging economies, and growing sensitivity around more environmentally-friendly cars are some of the most promising factors.\n\n**Antón Pradera** Chairman\n\n**Jesús Mª Herrera** Chief Executive Officer\n\n# **We are transforming the world, we are making a difference**\n\nChairman and CEO's statement\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 1 2 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/2/Picture/9 description: The image shows a road with yellow lines in the middle, leading towards a bright sunset.

We posted a net profit of €320.2 million, growth of 6.7% from 2022. Our bottom line was driven by topline growth of 3.1% to €3.96 billion and a stronger performance across all our markets, lifting the group's EBITDA to €713.2 million, implying a margin of 18.0%. We converted €447.4 million of that EBITDA into cash flow and brought our net debt down to €1.13 billion. In parallel, we paid our shareholders over €100 million, so delivering our commitment to paying out one-third of our net profit in dividends.\n\nAs you can see, these are truly extraordinary numbers, especially considering the environment, which is why we want to thank and congratulate the entire CIE Automotive team for making them possible.\n\nWe are optimistic about the future. We are ready to take advantage of the opportunities thrown up by the current market trends to surmount the challenges looming and continue to generate value for our shareholders, both through dividend payments and share price gains, as we have been doing for over 25 years.\n\nTo do that, we have a unique business model, which has proven its worth in very tough times, articulated around six pillars: multiple locations, customer diversification, a multi-technology approach, disciplined investing, decentralised management and embedded sustainability standards. A model that will allow us to meet the ambitious targets set down in our 2025 Strategic Plan, which position us among the three most profitable automotive parts makers.\n\nWith that in mind, in 2023 we redirected our financial and managerial resources to the businesses and markets offering most growth potential and highest returns. We acquired Iber-Oleff Brasil in a transaction that has reinforced our position in a growth market and allowed us to diversify our local customer base, and we sold our German forging factories specialised in the European truck market.\n\nFinancial returns are not, however, our only ambition. Throughout last year we met all our compliance requirements and continued to engage all our professionals in the task of embedding ESG matters into our day-to-day operations. As signatories of the United Nations Global Compact, we aspire to contribute to delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals contemplated in the Agenda 2030 to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that everyone can live in peace and prosperity. We are well aware that with 10 R&D centers and 108 plants in 17 countries, we are in a privileged position to do that.\n\nIn 2023 we once again marked new records in revenue, profitability and cash generation. **We posted a net profit of €320.2 million, growth of 6.7% from 2022**\n\n### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/11 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

It is thanks to their dedication that we were able to continue to grow in 2023, generate wealth and mobilise other people so that they too become agents of change. In exchange, we provided them with €35 million worth of support measures (health insurance, food, transportation, etc.) and offered them as safe, stimulating and fair a place to work as possible, regardless of where they carry out their work.\n\nWe lifted the percentage of women in our workforce by two points and by year-end had completed diversity and inclusion assessments at 93% of our factories, generating action plans for including people of different cultures, genders, generations and abilities. This is a particularly important milestone in countries whose populations are not sensitive to these matters and where there is no legislation around them.\n\nOur responsible doings have a domino effect on our supply chain. In 2023, we renewed our ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement certification and rolled out Supply Chain Race 2 Zero, our project for rallying our worldwide suppliers around our goal of being net zero by no later than 2050, offering them resources, guidance and environmental training. This initiative is part of our new environmental roadmap which echoes and expands on the targets set in our 2025 Strategic Plan and establishes new steps towards climate neutrality.\n\nLast year we accompanied our customers with their efforts to decarbonise transport by investing in technology projects aimed at reducing the weight of our parts and improving material circularity. We also participated in a number of research programmes related with the electrification of transport, including Basquevolt, the Basque alliance for the creation of solid-state lithium batteries.\n\nAll these activities favour progress in society and development in our business communities, which we supported in 2023 by contributing €497 million of tax and participating in community projects that benefitted over 41,500 people, projects we are certain will have a multiplier effect in the long term.\n\nIn 2023 we demonstrated that the future is not preordained, that it is our actions that mark the difference. We know that much remains to be done to create the fair, prosperous and sustainable world we all long for but we are convinced that we are taking steps in the right direction and that is something we are proud of.\n\nThanks to all for your support,\n\n**Antón Pradera**\n\nChairman\n\n#### **Jesús Mª Herrera**\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nOur responsible doings have a domino effect on the supply chain: In 2023, **we renewed our ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement certification and rolled out our Supply Chain Race 2 Zero programme**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/14 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Although the concerns about the supply chain did not fade entirely, the situation improved gradually: chip delivery times came down, raw material prices remained in check and the transport logistics issues were resolved.**\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/11 description: The image is a graph that shows global production from 2020 to 2026. The y-axis on the left shows the global production in millions, ranging from 0 to 100. The y-axis on the right shows the year-over-year change, ranging from -20% to 25%. The x-axis shows the years from 2020 to 2026. The global production in 2020 was 74.6 million, in 2021 was 77.2 million, in 2022 was 82.3 million, in 2023 was 90.3 million, in 2024 was 90.0 million, in 2025 was 91.7 million, and in 2026 was 93.3 million. The year-over-year change in 2020 was -16%, in 2021 was 3%, in 2022 was 7%, in 2023 was 10%, in 2024 was 0%, in 2025 was 2%, and in 2026 was 2%.

This permanent scrutiny allows it to mitigate the key market risks and leverage its competitive advantages.**\n\nNext is a description of the main challenges and opportunities, with further information provided in \"Risk management - Market risks\":\n\n### **Economic slowdown**\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund's estimates, the global economy grew at a moderate rate of 3% in 2023 and will slow to 2.9% in 2024, well below the 3.5% recorded in 2022 and average growth of 3.8% between 2000 and 2019. Prospects are, however, very difference between the advanced economies, where the slowdown is expected to be more pronounced, and emerging and developing economies, which are expected to register higher growth.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/10 description: The image shows a black and white icon of an electric car with a euro symbol above it. The car has a charging cable plugged into its side. The euro symbol is a circle with a horizontal line through the center.\n\n#### **Heavy investment in electric vehicles**\n\nThe transition to electric mobility is requiring heavy investments in new technology around batteries, vehicle autonomy and electric propulsion systems. The OEMs need to design specific vehicle platforms, requiring significant investment in engineering and design. Automotive suppliers need to improve their production lines to adapt them for electric vehicles which implies, in addition to capital expenditure, investing in skills.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/30 description: The image shows a black circle with a white Euro symbol inside it. Above the circle is a black arrow pointing upwards. The background is a light peach color.\n\n### **Increase in borrowing costs**\n\nThe automotive sector players were faced by an increase in borrowing costs as a result of the successive interest rate increases implemented to curb inflation. The increase in the cost of money left many OEMs and suppliers, which had leveraged up to deal with the fallout from the pandemic and/or invest in vehicle electrification, in a precarious position.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/15 description: The image shows a black and white icon of an electric car being charged. The car is depicted in silhouette with a charging cable plugged into its side. Above the car are two euro symbols with a lightning bolt in between them, suggesting the cost of electricity. The overall design is simple and graphic, likely intended for use as a symbol or sign related to electric vehicles and charging costs.\n\n.\n\n#### **Price war in electric vehicle segment**\n\nGrowth in electric vehicles is driving the OEMs to cut prices aggressively in order build a position in the market. A price war broke out in January when one of the electric vehicle segment leaders cut the price of its cheaper models in a move that was quickly followed by the other OEMs, worried they would be left out of this niche; discounts went as high as 15% on some models in China. In fact, the Chinese electric vehicle makers are making major inroads, exporting very cheap models to Europe.\n\n### **CHALLENGES**\n\nDespite the sector's strong performance in 2023 in the wake of global supply chain normalisation, the business faced certain challenges that could well become more pressing in the years to come:\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/7 description: The image shows a black and white icon of a euro symbol inside a circle.

The arrow is pointing clockwise, suggesting a cycle or rotation of people.\n\n**Shift in demand composition**\n\nThe economic slowdown, coupled with an ageing fleet in developed economies and growth in developing economies, could change the market's composition. While demand is expected to remain steady in terms of volumes, the outlook is for a higher share of sales in the mass market segment and in sales in developing economies.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/8 description: The image shows a black and white icon of an electric car with three people standing behind it. The car has a charging plug symbol on its side, indicating that it is an electric vehicle. The people are represented by simple stick figures, suggesting a group or shared transportation concept.\n\n**Ageing global vehicle fleet** \n\nThe advanced age of the stock of vehicles on the road implies potential demand via substitution. The OEMs can tap this demand by offering updated models with enhanced features, more modern technology and more efficient performance. There is pent-up demand in the US and Europe among buyers who are not shopping for secondhand cars, suggesting they are waiting to buy a new car.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/13 description: The image shows a sign indicating a low emission zone. The sign features a black car with two downward-pointing arrows above it, all enclosed in a rectangular frame attached to a pole. To the right of the sign, the text \"Low emission device\" is displayed.\n\n### **Public interest in the new electric vehicles**\n\nGrowing environmental awareness and emerging regulations restricting the use of less environmentally-friendly cars are whetting consumers' interest in electric vehicles. As prices come down, the number of charging stations rises and autonomy improves, the share of electric vehicles is bound to increase.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/10 description: The image shows a black and white icon of a damaged car with a globe above it, next to the text \"Ageing vehicle f\".\n\n### **Low vehicle penetration in certain development economies**\n\nDeveloping economies with low vehicle penetration rates are ripe for healthy growth in vehicle sales. These countries often present transport infrastructure limitations, economic barriers and very limited access to credit. As these obstacles are surmounted, their populations will start to buy more cars, as is already happening in India and Brazil.\n\n#### **AVERAGE AGE OF THE VEHICLE FLEET IN 2023 MOTORISATION RATE BY COUNTRY**\n\n*Source: ACEA, Anfavea, JPM, ANFAC, IHS, GiPA, OICA, INEGI, NTS Source: ACEA, Anfavea, JPM, ANFAC, IHS, GiPA, OICA, INEGI, NTS*\n\n|        | 2021       | 2022       |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| Europe | 11.8 years | 12.1 years |\n| US     | 13.1 years | 13.6 years |\n| Mexico | 12.6 years | 10.1 years |\n| Brazil | 10.3 years | 10.7 years |\n| India  | 25 years   | 25 years   |\n| China  | 5.1 years  | 7 years    |\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/22 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The resulting price war is putting the weaker parts suppliers in a tough situation, negotiating prices that leave their EBIT margins at under 5%. Faced by this situation, while Brussels has officially started an anti-subsidy investigation on electric cars from China, the various national governments are rolling out initiatives to protect their industries. For this and other strategic reasons, the Chinese OEMs are looking into options for setting up manufacturing in Europe down the line. For example, in December BYD formally announced plans to build a factory in Hungary in phases.\n\nThe Europe\ncoming year\nlosing share\n\nThe European market is forecast to remain flat in the coming years, as is expected of a mature market that is losing share to other areas of the world.\n\n### **North America:**\n\nVehicle production in North America totalled 15.7 million units, up 9.7% from 2022. This growth, considered high for a mature market, is attributable to the positive impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides electric vehicle buyers a tax credit of up to \\$7,500 if the car meets certain regional production requirements.\n\nA flat evolution is expected in the coming years, typical of an already mature market that is losing weight in favor of other markets.\n\nOne negative development was the simultaneous strike at three OEMs - General Motors, Stellantis and Ford - in the US and Canada. Production foregone during the stoppages is estimated at 203,793 vehicles.\n\nUnlike Europe and despite the market's maturity, vehicle production in the US is expected to increase by 1% in 2024, in large part, but not entirely, due to the recovery in volumes in the wake of the strike. Medium term, the market is expected to revisit its pre-pandemic levels by 2026, again setting it apart from the European market.\n\n### *Vehicle purchase incentives*\n\nIn August 2022, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes \\$369bn in clean energy investments as well as provisions that will lower the cost of prescription drugs and increase taxes on large corporations. Of particular interest for the automotive sector is the vehicle purchase incentive and the infrastructure tax credit. Overall, the bill is projected to help cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% from 2005 levels by the end of the decade.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act contains financial incentives to encourage the purchase of electric and hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles as well as the deployment of charging stations. Provisions in the IRA provide a tax credit for the purchase of the vehicle itself and a tax credit for the purchase and installation of charging assets or charging infrastructure.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Tax breaks mitigated the pronounced rise in interest rates in 2023.\n\nThe big announcement last year was BYD's acquisition of the old Ford factory in Bahía, which is now expected to produce two electric cars and one hybrid model, as well as electric trucks and buses. Production is expected to start in the second half of 2024 with initial annual capacity of 150,000 units, a figure expected to double to 300,000 from 2025.\n\nGrowth in production is expected to accelerate in 2024, to 3% and, most notably in 2025 and 2026, when production growth is forecast at 6% and 7%, respectively. Some of the anticipated growth is attributable to the fact that the Brazilian central bank has already started to cut interest rates.\n\n#### **India:**\n\nDemand for vehicles in India broke new records in 2023. Production increased by 4.4% to 5.4 million units, despite strong levels already in 2022. As well as a strong performance in the passenger vehicle segment, other segments with even greater growth potential started to recover: commercial vehicles (+0%); motorcycles (+4%) and tractors (-2%).\n\nNotably electrification also started to make inroads in this market: in early October, Tata announced it would launch eight electric models in 2030. This growth is expected to get a further injection from public initiatives designed to draw investments related with electric vehicles. In 2023, electric car sales volumes increased by around 90% (88% as of November). However, combustion-engine vehicles are expected to continue to dominate this market.\n\nAs for the outlook for light vehicle production, growth is expected to take a breather in 2024, consolidating the sharp growth recorded last year before going on to regain traction, with growth of 4/5% forecast for both 2025 and 2026.\n\n### **China:**\n\nThe world's largest vehicle maker increased production by 10.0% in 2023. Although domestic demand appears to be slowing, Chinese production was boosted by the extension of tax relief for electric vehicles until 2027. Moreover, the Chinese OEMs are growing in foreign markets thanks to a price-based growth strategy.\n\nAnnual growth to 2026 is forecast at 3%.\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/23 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Climate change regulations are tackling two key fronts. Firstly, they are requiring the use of greener energy sources, focused primarily on electrification. Secondly, all sector players must mitigate their carbon footprints taking a lifecycle approach.\n\n### **Demographic trends**\n\nThere are many opposing demographic trends unfolding simultaneously around the world whose ultimate overall effect on the automotive sector is expected to be clearly positive.\n\n- More than half of forecast population growth is concentrated in Africa, but the most of the world's population is located in Asia (60%), with Europe losing share (10%.)\n- Life expectancies are rising and birth rates dropping, driving population ageing.\n- Urbanisation is a parallel trend and we are also seeing - mainly regional - migratory displacements of populations.\n\n#### **Technological change**\n\nThe world is moving towards a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will change our lives and make productive processes, including those of the automotive sector, more efficient.\n\nThe emerging improved and more efficient vehicle architectures are based on the use of the right materials and their correct application, which means that different technologies will have a role to play in the next-generation, multi-material vehicles.\n\n### **Macroeconomics and geopolitics**\n\n- Emerging market opportunities: the Chinese, Indian and Brazilian economies, to name a few, are expected to experience sharp growth in the coming years.\n- National protectionism: initially perceived as a threat, protectionism strategies are no longer expected to have a significant impact on the automotive sector.\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/20 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Despite those efforts, EV penetration rates vary significantly from one market to the next and we are likely to see vehicles fuelled by different sources of\n\nenergy coexist for some time.\n\n### **User experience**\n\nCar buyers' preferences have shifted. Nowadays they are looking for aspects related with comfort, such as spaciousness, driver assistance and smart infrastructure, to the detriment of other attributes such as power, aerodynamics and external aesthetics. Within the comfort thrust, the penetration of roof systems is outpacing the general automotive market.\n\n### **Safety and protection**\n\nVehicle safety prioritisation is making manufacturing more complex and increasing the number of parts and their added value. Today's cars are being fitted with sophisticated driver assistance systems that prevent accidents and other passive safety systems designed to mitigate damage and injuries in the event of a collision; those systems are being embedded in the chassis and bodywork, for example, as well as shaping seatbelt and airbag development. Growing safety and protection requirements for passengers and other road users is requiring the introduction of more complex solutions involving different materials, reinforcing the astuteness of the multitechnology approach.\n\n#### **Autonomous and connected car**\n\nMajor progress has been made on autonomous driving in recent years, thanks to which important driver assistance features have been introduced to new cars. However, the mainstreaming of the autonomous car in the coming years continues to face obstacles. In parallel, users are demanding greater connectivity between their cars and the outside world (virtual assistants, automation, etc.), all of which requires establishing high-speed connections. The OEMs are therefore expected to partner with technology, telephony and infrastructure providers.\n\nImage /page/26/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The text \"CIE Automotive\" is written in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Geographical balance\n\n**Since its creation in 1996, CIE Automotive has been strategically expanding its geographic reach, locating its manufacturing facilities close to the vehicle assembly platforms in the main automotive markets: Europe, North America, Asia and Brazil. Thanks to the acquisition of a number of companies, the construction of greenfield facilities and strategic alliances with other companies, CIE Automotive has built itself up to include 108 manufacturing (including 3 multitechnology factories) and 10 research centres located in 17 countries.** \n\nThis geographical diversification positions it a leading supplier for the platforms worldwide, enabling it to maintain a healthy sales and earnings mix across the various regions. Geographic diversification is a crucial defensive tool in moments of crisis, as slowdowns in production in some markets are often mitigated by stronger momentum in others.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, specifically to direct its financial and managerial resources to markets with higher growth potential, such as India, and other technologies in greater demand and tied to its decarbonisation strategy, in 2023 the company sold Mutares its German forging business, the subsidiaries of CIE Forging Germany GmbH.\n\n#### North America\n\n# 31%\n\nThe company entered the Mexican market two decades ago and over the last 10 years expanded into the US by means of mergers and acquisitions. It currently has 13 manufacturing facilities in Mexico and five in the US.\n\n#### Europe\n\n36%\n\nHaving sold its German forging business in October 2023, CIE Automotive has 39 manufacturing facilities in western and eastern Europe and one factory in\n\nMorocco.\n\nBrazil\n\n9%\n\nIn Brazil, CIE Automotive has 14 manufacturing facilities following the acquisition of Iber-Oleff, which specialises in plastic parts. It commands a noteworthy position in this market in the wake of the consolidation of the automotive parts market in recent years.\n\nAsia\n\n# 24%\n\nCIE Automotive has 25 manufacturing facilities in India and 12 in China. The company entered the Indian market, the world's fastest-growing automotive market, through its alliance with the local business group Mahindra & Mahindra, later cementing its position in the country by acquiring Bill Forge and AEL (now CIE Aluminium Casting). In China, the company's growth is the result of its acquisition of Inteva's roof systems division.\n\n#### **CIE AUTOMOTIVE FACTORIES AROUND THE WORLD**\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/20 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Not only does this strategic approach strengthen the company's price negotiation power, it has been key to the growth achieved during times of crisis.\n\n**MAIN CUSTOMERS** \n\nImage /page/30/Picture/6 description: The image shows the word \"Jeep\" in a bold, sans-serif font.

This approach allows it to respond to its customers' demands and the growing body of legislation around sustainability, while also locking in profitable, long-term growth by driving efficiency and innovation so as to minimise its negative impacts.** \n\n### **Global Compact**\n\nCIE Automotive's public commitment to sustainable development dates back to 2015, when it signed its endorsement of the United Nations Global Compact. That endorsement implied the public assumption of responsibility in key areas including human and labour rights, environmental protection and anti-corruption. Eight years later, as a Signatory of the Spanish Chapter of the Global Compact, the group has moved beyond its respect for the Company's 10 universally recognised principles and become an agent of systematic change in the shift towards a sustainable economy.\n\nImage /page/37/Picture/13 description: The image contains the logo of the UN Global Compact. The logo features a globe encircled by the text \"UN GLOBAL COMPACT\" in a circular arrangement. Below the globe, there are two olive branches forming a semi-circle. To the right of the globe, there are two large letters \"U\" and \"G\" stacked vertically.\n\nUnited Nations\nGlobal Compact\n\n### **ESG Policy**\n\nAt the forefront o\nBoard of Director\nan ESG Policy, wh\nmembers of the\nprinciples and ge\npractices into the\nEffective applicat\nrisks associated v\nManagement an\n\nAt the forefront of the company's gradual transformation is the Board of Directors, which in 2017 championed the formulation of an ESG Policy, which was updated in 2021, that is binding on all members of the company. This policy defines the fundamental principles and general framework for building sustainability practices into the company's business model and strategy. Effective application of these principles and the potential risks associated with it are addressed in CIE Automotive's Risk Management and Control Policy.\n\n### **Management monitoring**\n\nSupervision of ESG and sustainability management falls to the Board of Director's ESG Committee, which delegates oversight of application of the principles in the Cross-Group ESG Committee. This monitoring process takes the form of 79 ESG indicators that measure performance in different areas. The KPIs are in turn included in each factory's management plans and are used to track delivery of the sustainability aspects of the 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\nThe group's social responsibility extends to its supply chain. Indeed, CIE Automotive was the first company in its sector to create a supplier platform devoted solely to managing and evaluating ESG matters.\n\nImage /page/37/Picture/21 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

It sets ambitious and quantifiable business and ESG targets and details the specific lines of work for achieving them. The two blocks are interdependent and necessary to attain sustainable profitability.**\n\n### **BUSINESS STRATEGY**\n\nCIE Automotive's business strategy is articulated around the generation of operating cash flow and so translates into significant deleveraging over its time horizon, enabling it to invest up to €1.5 billion without its leverage (net debt-to-EBITDA) rising above 2x. The momentum in operating cash flow is being driven by margin expansion, which more than offset the rise in interest rates in 2023.\n\nThe amount set aside for investments may be used for any type of transaction that maximises the company's returns, including M&A deals, share buybacks, the purchase of minority interests, etc. The criteria will always be to prioritise transactions that maximise value generation at a given point in time.\n\n#### **ORGANIC\\* COMMITMENTS EMBEDDED IN THE 2025 STRATEGIC PLAN**\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/11 description: The image shows a black and white icon representing financial growth in euros.

There is a gray quotation mark to the left of the number 23.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **BUSINESS LINES OF INITIATIVE**\n\nIn order to deliver its commitments, CIE Automotive has defined four lines of initiative around the key automotive sector trends (refer to \"Sector background\"): electrification, Industry 4.0, comfort and international expansion. These lines of initiative likewise respond to the market changes identified as a risk factor, as detailed in the \"Risk management\" chapter.\n\n**Electrification**\n\nThe company wants to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by decarbonisation of the transport sector to create new value-added products for electric vehicles, particularly in EV motors, power electronics, gearboxes and batteries. At present, 80% of the products made by CIE Automotive are compatible with both electrified and combustionpowered vehicles.\n\n#### **Industry 4.0**\n\nImmersed in the fourth industrial revolution, CIE Automotive is gradually adopting smart manufacturing tools and different enabling technologies. These tools interact with and learn from each other and feature sensorisation capabilities that make it possible to capture data which is later analysed using algorithms.\n\nImplementation of these technologies is not only making our processes more efficient but is also reducing our environmental impact by cutting prototype volumes, energy and raw material consumption, product rejects and scrap generation.\n\n#### **International expansion**\n\nThe company seeks geographical diversification by investing in countries where vehicle penetration is low and growth expectations are high. Broadly speaking, until 2025, the plan is for all the divisions to add capacity and develop new products that add more value and address their existing customers' emerging needs. In parallel, the sales teams are working intensely to bring in new customers.\n\n#### **Comfort**\n\nCIE Automotive's strategy in the comfort area is concentrated at its roof systems division. More specifically, it is looking to consolidate its position in bottomloaded roofs and fixed glass roofs with shades. It also wants to be able to incorporate panoramic roofs into both fixed and movable sunroofs, addressing all ranges. The company is also focusing on thinner roofs equipped with flat roller blind technology, which are particularly necessary in the electric vehicle segment. Lastly, it is working on ambient comfort by adding spot lighting to both its roofs and their shades.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/20 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

These indicators are part of the management plans at all of the company's factories, which report to the corporate areas quarterly, half-yearly or annually, depending on the stipulated frequency.\n\nAll of that information gets consolidated into a global ESG dashboard hosted within the group's corporate intranet. Progress on the various indicators is reported to the Board's ESG Committee and the CEO, who has tasked the Cross-Group ESG Committee with overseeing delivery of various KPIs.\n\nThe KPIs are reviewed periodically and realigned with the most updated context assessment, which factors in the latest trends in the automotive industry, stakeholder demands and regulatory developments, among other aspects\n\nThe targets and the work being done by the corporate areas driving their attainment are articulated around four strategic lines of initiative: CIE culture, ethical commitment, eco-efficiency and active listening.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/14 description: The image is a close-up of a green and white graphic.

In 2023 it continued to innovate and invest approximately 2% of its revenue, through its 10 research centres and the productive units, with a view to facilitating delivery of its 2025 Strategic Plan targets. Its 10 R&D centres and its engineering and R&D areas are working on improvement projects, following a roadmap articulated around four strategic lines of action: ecoefficiency, Industry 4.0, new mobility concepts and safety. Innovation also plays a crucial role in moving the company towards climate neutrality.**\n\nImage /page/49/Figure/4 description: The image shows a green icon of a lightning bolt inside of a circular arrow. The arrow is pointing in a clockwise direction.\n\n### **ECO-EFFICIENCY AND CIRCULARITY**\n\nWith the aim of becoming net zero by 2050, the R&D area is focusing hard on reducing consumption and emissions.\n\nIn parallel, the company is working on projects in the electric motor, battery and power electronics systems in order to continue to penetrate the electrified vehicle segment and so contribute to the decarbonisation of transportation in the use phase.\n\nCIE Automotive collaborates with a range of research programmes targeting decarbonisation at both the regional and international levels. Those programmes are looking at systems for zero-emission vehicles, whether battery-powered or fuel-cell electric vehicles.\n\nIn batteries, CIE Automotive is also participating in the Basque initiative for the production of solid-state batteries, which is planning to build 10 GWh of capacity. Basquevolt plans to commission a production line in four years' time, entailing €700 million of investment and generating more than 800 direct jobs. Solid-state batteries will deliver a substantial increase in battery autonomy, while lowering their costs and reducing dependence on certain critical materials. That will also lead to democratisation of the electric vehicle, paving the way for costs of €15,000 per vehicle, making them accessible to most citizens. This project considers the life cycle of the new batteries, including disassembly, recycling or reuse.\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/11 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Here the engineering area is working on a number of different projects:\n\n- Introduction of new product functions, so reducing the number of parts. In the roof systems division, this means including lighting, display screens and photovoltaic cells in the systems.\n- Launch of eco-design tools for incorporation into new product and project processes. In 2023 this project emphasised the incorporation of disassembly and recycling criteria at the product design phase.\n- Projects to increase the circularity of polymer transformation technologies.\n- Introduction of recycled materials into roofing textiles that can help cut product emissions up to three-fold.\n- Innovation in technologies that reduce the use of fuel and chemical products, such as ESG+ technology, in roofs and side windows, delivering a consideration reduction in waste generation and the products' environmental footprints.\n- Continuation of the multi-year projects aimed at rationalising the use of raw materials, which are being rolled out across all technologies and regions, developing new process concepts with the potential to directly reduce our scope 3 emissions.\n\n#### **Vehicle light-weighting**\n\nHelping make vehicles lighter is a key thrust of CIE Automotive's innovation strategy due to its contribution to reducing the use of raw materials, lowering fuel consumption in an internal combustion vehicle while in use or increasing the autonomy of an electric vehicle:\n\n- Aluminium forging for chassis and suspension parts, achieving very compelling mechanical property ratios relative to weight\n- Technology shift marked by increased use of polymer materials, reducing the bill of materials by adding functions\n- Development of the new thin roof concept which weighs less and takes up less space\n- Reducing roof weights by using resin transfer moulding (RTM) frames\n\n## **Helping make vehicles lighter is a key thrust** of CIE Automotive's\n\ninnovation strategy\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive. The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" in a sans-serif font.

The number of data control and capture sensors embedded in its equipment and production is growing all the time. In parallel, collaborative robots (cobots) are popping up on its production lines, providing employees with real-time information over new interfaces. In addition, data analytics is being used in a growing number of technologies, underpinned by increasingly efficient deep learning algorithms available in tools requiring lowcode programming.\n\nIn 2023, the company finished the demo for a new intralogistics platform for the automation of the transportation of finished products with the goal of establishing a continuous loop for the delivery and collection of finished product packaging for storage up high in the warehouse.\n\nCurrent mobility trends point to improving the user experience shaped by a keen interest in comfort and connectivity. Against this backdrop, CIE Automotive is innovating intensely in its roof systems area, specifically:\n\nThis solution adds flexibility, efficiency and traceability to the logistics processes by means of the smart management of different sensors and mobile devices, including automotive guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). These devices are being integrated into the factories' existing management systems and other sensors to give users visibility and control in real time using 5G technology. The 5G standard is crucial on account of the massive volumes of data involved, the density of the devices, the broad coverage required in spaces like these and the immediacy needed for the entire intralogistics ecosystem to work optimally.\n\nIn tandem the company has added cobots in assembly and inspection operations and when using chemical products. The use of these collaborative robots enables more precise product dosing and delivers a significant reduction in their environmental impact.\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/16 description: The image shows a light orange car icon with rounded edges. The car has a simple, cartoonish design with two circular headlights and a curved line representing a smile or grill. The car's body is a single, solid color, and the background is white.\n\n- Integrating lighting into glass or shading.\n- Reducing noise by means of the use of brushless motors.\n- Adding shading-glass.\n- Improving user ergonomics by electrifying side windows and shades and introducing self-opening luggage covers.\n- Improving aesthetics and style by means of flush door panes.\n- Adding solutions featuring photochromatic glass.\n- Introducing panoramic screens.\n- Making roofs that take up less space.\n- Improving the compartment space.\n\n### **INDUSTRY 4.0**\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/20 description: The image contains the words \"NEW\", \"MOBILITY\", and \"CONCEPT\" stacked vertically.

At present it is working on a number of projects designed to provide, from the development phase, more accurate predictions of how parts and systems will perform throughout their use phase in a number of possible scenarios.\n\nMore specifically, the company is working to improve product performance in terms of noise and vibrations considering frequency dependent characteristics so as to enhance prediction from the design phase.\n\nIt is also optimising the design process around crash events by improving how it models the joins and interactions between parts to make vehicles safer in the event of accidents or impacts.\n\nLastly, new requirements have been added throughout the entire process with the aim\n\nof achieving zero defects and ultimately maximising product safety and customer satisfaction.\n\nUsing widely accepted sector methodologies, all the possible ways a product could become a risk are identified every step of the way, from product conception to manufacture, prioritising those sources of risk and generating action plans to reduce their likelihood of occurrence and severity, radically mitigating any potential malfunction in the products we deliver our customers.\n\n### **SAFETY**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/10 description: The image shows a shield with a check mark inside a circle.

It delivered a profit of €320.2 million, up 6.7% from 2022, having lifted its revenue to €3.96 billion, against the backdrop of recovering vehicle production volumes, high interest rates and persistent inflation.**\n\nTopline growth, of 3.1% from 2022, combined with efficient team management, unlocked double-digit growth in operating profit: EBITDA increased by 12.6% to €713.2 million, while EBIT was 18.1% higher at €527.7 million.\n\nThese figures highlight the solidity of the business model, articulated around geographic, customer and technological diversification, and the merits of focusing on cash generation. The company's healthy earnings performance was also helped by the disappearance of less competitive suppliers unable to withstand the supply chain friction, firstly, and the rise in borrowing costs after that.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

These factories were specialised in truck parts for the European market, a business that was less profitable for the group. After 10 years of continuous improvements to increase their profitability, CIE Automotive was able to sell the factories for €55.5 million, equivalent to 5 times their EBITDA.\n\nThe main rationale for the disposal is to redirect financial and managerial resources to more profitable markets, including regions with higher growth potential and technologies in greater demand from the group's customers, in line with the sector megatrends (decarbonisation, vehicle light-weighting, comfort, etc.).\n\n#### **2023 EARNINGS**\n\n## **CIE Automotive acquired Iber-Oleff Brasil for €20 million**, a multiple of 6.7 times its EBITDA\n\n*(\\*) EBITDA: Net operating result + Amortization, EBIT: Net operating result, Net profit: Result attributable to the shareholders of the parent company.*\n\n*(\\*\\*) The percentage operating margins are not comparable to those of previous years due to the inflationary environment and its derivatives.*\n\nIn 2023 the company generated €447.4 million of operating cash flow, which is equivalent to 65% of EBITDA, in line with the 2025 Strategic Plan target. Thanks to this healthy cash flow, the group was able to pay out more than €100 million of dividends to its shareholders and resume its longstanding M&A strategy, acquiring Iber-Oleff in Brazil.\n\n| € m                | 2022    | 2023    | Chg. %   |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Revenue            | 3,838.6 | 3,959.5 | 3.1%     |\n| EBITDA *           | 633.4   | 713.2   | 12.6%    |\n| EBITDA margin % ** | 16.5%   | 18.0%   | 1.5 p.p. |\n| EBIT *             | 446.7   | 527.7   | 18.1%    |\n| EBIT margin % *    | 11.6%   | 13.3%   | 1.7 p.p. |\n| Net profit **      | 300.1   | 320.2   | 6.7%     |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n| 2 | Ready<br>for change                               |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 3 | Record<br>earnings                                |\n| 4 | Common<br>responsibility,<br>shared benefits      |\n| 5 | Our response to<br>the environmental<br>challenge |\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n**3.2**\n\n# **Earnings performance by region**\n\n**All of the group's markets made a positive contribution in 2023, delivering doubledigit EBITDA and EBIT margins, despite very different conditions from one region to another.

Faced with higher borrowing costs on the back of successive interest rate increases, which put the weakest suppliers in serious jeopardy, the company locked in the liquidity and term structure needed by refinancing its debt and increasing the share of its borrowings at fixed rates to 54.5%. In parallel, it continued to honour its sustainability commitments by tying its borrowing costs to delivery of those pledges.**\n\nCIE Automotive's net debt came down by approximately €143.5 million in 2023 for an adjusted year-end balance of €1.13 billion, implying a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.56x. That leaves the company in a comfortable position for undertaking new strategic investments designed to further its profitable growth and reinforce its position in highgrowth markets.\n\nThe reduction in net debt was enabled by the generation of €447.4 million of operating cash flow (which is around 65% of EBITDA, in line with the 2025 Strategic Plan targets), which translated into €276.5 million of cash flow (after growth CAPEX, working capital and other items).\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 1highlights**\n\n**Ready 2for change**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-60-0\"></span>**ANNUAL REPORT**\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **COMPARATIVE BALANCE SHEET**\n\n#### **DEBT STRUCTURE**\n\n#### **FINANCIAL RATIOS**\n\n*(\\*) Net debt and EBITDA figures adjusted for the group's 50% interest in the Chinese JV, SAMAP.*\n\n#### **Diversification of financing sources**\n\nCIE Automotive works with a number of banks to finance its activities. As a result, its credit risk is not concentrated. At year-end 2023, CIE Automotive had undrawn credit lines totalling €78 million (total limit under these facilities: €768 million).\n\n## • Loan in euros • Price band based on net debt/EBITDA • 250

The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The letter \"C\" is formed by two curved lines that do not fully connect, creating an incomplete circle. The text \"CIE Automotive\" is written in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" in black, with a gray quotation mark above the \"2\". A dashed line runs horizontally through the middle of the \"2\".\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/9 description: The image contains two line charts. The first line chart shows data points ranging from approximately -0.25 to 4.0. The x-axis is labeled with dates from 01-07-22 to 01-12-23. The y-axis ranges from -0.5 to 4.5. The second line chart shows data points ranging from approximately 2.3 to 5.6. The x-axis is labeled with dates from 01-07-22 to 01-12-23. The y-axis ranges from 2.0 to 6.0.\n\n#### **DEBT MATURITY PROFILE**\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/7 description: The image contains two text labels. The first label reads \"3-MONTH EURIBOR (July 2022 - December 2023)\". The second label reads \"SOFR + 3M SPREAD\\*\".\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/8 description: The image contains the text \"SOFR + 3M SPREAD\" in a bold, sans-serif font. The text is arranged on a single line and appears to be the primary focus of the image.\n\n *(\\*) The SOFR Overnight plus a spread of 0.2616% (the 3-month spread)*\n\n#### **Trend in interest rates**\n\nInterest rates were once again a unique force in 2023. Whereas official rates were increased further in the US and Europe, market rates took a different course. 12-month Euribor increased slightly and longer-term rates, using the 5-year IRS as proxy, ended the year lower, as did the equivalent American proxy.\n\nTherefore, it looks as if the actions taken by the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve have effectively anchored inflation expectations, prompting the market to decouple from the increases in official rates and even start to discount rate cuts in 2024. Favourable conditions in the equity and fixed-income markets went a long way to facilitating this performance.\n\n| € m                     | 2022           | 2023           |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Within one year         | 472.0          | 511.7          |\n| Between 1 and 2 years   | 701.3          | 315.6          |\n| Between 3 and 5 years   | 820.7          | 1,266.3        |\n| More than 5 years       | 147.1          | 75.9           |\n| <b>Total borrowings</b> | <b>2,141.1</b> | <b>2,169.5</b> |\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Since then it has been working to standardise its financing arrangements so that all new agreements include a sustainability clause whereby the rate of interest comes down if the company meets its ESG targets.\n\nMoody's is the independent agency tasked with certifying compliance with these commitments.\n\nCIE Automotive renewed and extended its syndicated loan from 2027 to 2028 **with the backing of all of the banks in the pool**\n\nS\nt\ns\n\ne\nng\n\ne\ny\n\n#### **Strategy**\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/11 description: The image contains text describing how central banks' interest rate increases have led CIE Automotive to take measures to minimize the impact on its financing strategy.\n\nThe fact that its liquidity buffer stood at €1.73 billion at year-end 2023 is evidence of the merit of the financial management undertaken by the company to safeguard its solvency in the face of potential market risks.\n\nIn addition, in 2023 the company continued to increase the volume of gross borrowings arranged at fixed rates to mitigate the risk of even higher interest rates, while leaving margin for benefitting from potential rate cuts in the near term.\n\nBy way of illustration, at year-end 2021, 35% of the group's gross debt were fixed-rate borrowings, a level which increased to 50% by the end of 2022 and stood at 55% by yearend 2023.\n\nImage /page/63/Figure/15 description: The image shows a gray icon of a calendar with a euro symbol on the lower left side.

The y-axis represents percentage change, ranging from -80% to 60%. In 2023, CIE Automotive shows a 20% change, STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts shows a 2% change, and IBEX 35 shows a 1% change.\n\n*(\\*) PER: relationship between the share price and profit.*\n\n## Share price performance\n\n#### **CIE AUTOMOTIVE'S STOCK MARKET INDICATORS**\n\n#### **SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE, 2018-2023**\n\nCIE Automotive's shares gained 7% in 2023 to end the year at €25.72. This moderate performance contrasts with stronger gains in the Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts (+19%) and Ibex 35 (+23%), due, in part, to a more stringent base effect in the case of the company's shares. Over the past five years, CIE Automotive's share price has increased by 20%, significantly outperforming the Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts (which gained 2% over that timeframe) and the Ibex 35 (just 1%). Comparing CIE Automotive's share price with the corrections sustained by most of the parts makers included in the broader sector index, the difference is even more striking.\n\nOver the course of 2023, however, there continued to be a lag between CIE Automotive's fundamentals and its share price performance. Specifically, its share price remained well below the consensus target price of €31.38 assigned by the universe of analysts that follow the company. In contrast to other automotive parts makers, the company has not had to issue any profit warnings in the face of the recent sector complexity, remaining among the top three sector players in terms of profitability and growth prospects.\n\nHowever, these achievements have not been priced in by the market. The automotive industry is not currently attractive to investors and mediumcap stocks are not managing to attract funds from the major investment funds, a combination that is not helping CIE Automotive. On top of this, liquidity fell in 2022, particularly after the company exited the Ibex 35 index.\n\nThe company's share price performance over the last year should not cloud its performance over a longer time horizon. Over the last five years, for example, CIE Automotive's share price has staged a stellar performance by comparison with its sector peers. CIE Automotive's share price has gained 20% over that period, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts has traded sideways.\n\n|                                         | 2021        | 2022        | 2023        |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of shares at year-end            | 122,550,000 | 122,550,000 | 119,807,484 |\n| Share price at year-end (€)             | 27.36       | 24.06       | 25.72       |\n| Market capitalisation at year-end (€ m) | 3,352.9     | 2,948.6     | 3,081.4     |\n| Average trading volume                  | 183,009     | 160,965     | 50,429      |\n| P/E multiple*                           | 12.6        | 9.7         | 9.6         |\n\n|                                         | 2021        | 2022        | 2023        |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of shares at year-end            | 122,550,000 | 122,550,000 | 119,807,484 |\n| Share price at year-end (€)             | 27.36       | 24.06       | 25.72       |\n| Market capitalisation at year-end (€ m) | 3,352.9     | 2,948.6     | 3,081.4     |\n| Average trading volume                  | 183,009     | 160,965     | 50,429      |\n| P/E multiple*                           | 12.6        | 9.7         | 9.6         |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n|   | Common          |\n|---|-----------------|\n| 4 | responsibility, |\n|   | shared benefits |\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/73/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

On the BSE, the Indian company's share price rallied by 34.4% to end the year at INR 470.65, marking a high for the year of INR 549.25; on the NSE the share price gained 34.5% to end the year at INR 470.70, having peaked during the year at INR 549.45. The share price spiked on the back of the company name change to CIE Automotive India, completion of the disposal of the truck parts forging business in Germany and the company's steady earnings momentum. It cooled from annual highs due to the slowdown in some end user segments.\n\nDemand in the Indian automotive market was mixed: growth was healthy in the light vehicle segment, while the tractor and twowheel segments were flat. The European automotive market had a good year although the two wars along its borders left investors feeling uncertain. In general, automotive related stocks performed well in India.

Most notably, it once again attended the J.P. Morgan European Automotive Conference and the Santander Autos Day, along with players of the calibre of BMW, Mercedes or Renault. For the first time it also participated in the ESN/Gaesco Conference, which took place in Paris.\n\nFramed by its mission of helping more potential investors get to know the company, it also organised six site visits, bringing investors for the first time to the CIE Vilanova factory, the group's largest aluminium casting facility in terms of sales.\n\nIn parallel, the team stayed in constant contact with the analysts that cover the company, a total of 15 this year. The Investor Relations Department responded to their enquiries about different aspects of CIE Automotive's business and strategy, including the Indian market's potential, the company's strategy in China and its M&A activity, among other matters.\n\nIt also fielded interest in ESG aspects, most notably the independence of the Board of Directors and the use of ESG criteria to determine remuneration.\n\nIn addition to its recurring communication and outreach efforts, the Investor Relations Department analysed a number of different investment segments with a view to broadening the shareholder base and boosting trading volumes. The actions taken and segments studied were the following:\n\nstudied the matter with two brokers with a strong presence in Spain, the conclusion reached was that this investor universe is currently focused\n\n• Analysis of a potential dual listing with the help of the IEAF IR Club, which specialises in listed Spanish companies.

CIE Automotive stood out again in the Small & Midcap category.\n\n#### **Analyst breakfast**\n\nThe company held its traditional Analyst Day in November, which was attended this year by the CEO, Jesús Mari Herrera. During a breakfast event, the CEO went over all of the topics of current interest at the company, highlighting the ease with which it is delivering its ambitious strategic targets for 2025, in spite of the significant deterioration in the macroeconomic and sector environments, as well as signalling the likely intensification in M&A activity during the second half of the Strategic Plan's time horizon. The event was attended by all of the houses that cover CIE Automotive.\n\n#### **Analyst survey**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive conducted an Analyst Satisfaction Survey in which 13 analysts participated. The main goal was to evaluate the transparency and effectiveness of the Investor Relations Department's communication effort. The 29 aspects assessed, including team availability, feedback received and response times, were positively rated by all of the participants.\n\nThe idea is to use this feedback to strengthen relations with analysts and investors in 2024, ensuring clear and timely communication and greater transparency when disclosing important developments.\n\nThe recent analyst survey has yielded valuable insight, painting a very positive overall picture, while highlighting certain areas for improvement. The highest rated aspects included the availability, flexibility and sector knowledge displayed by the IR team, qualities that facilitate the analysts' work. The analysts also valued the participation by management in earnings presentations and investor meetings. The main area for improvement flagged by the analysts relates to additional disclosures in the financial information published, an aspect which the company is analysing and working on.\n\n## In 2023, CIE Automotive conducted an analyst satisfaction survey **to evaluate 29 aspects of the IR Department's transparency and communication effort**\n\n**CC**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

This certification rewards the factory for its performance in terms of quality and logistics and allows it to opt for new tenders as Ford is rationalising its supplier portfolio and prioritising those with Q1 certification.\n\n### **Brazil**\n\n• Customer diversification in this region, with a presence in active projects and new orders for Asian, European and American automotive sector customers, is positioning CIE Automotive as a benchmark supplier of automotive parts for all the OEMs present in the region.\n\n#### **Asia**\n\n• Start of line production for a series of projects using different technologies focused on key parts for electric vehicles in India.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Its reputation is underpinned by constant improvement of its products and processes by means of prevention, systematic revision, training and know-how sharing, framed by its Environment Policy.\n\nFocused on excellence, the company complies with the IATF 16949 quality standard, which is specific to the automotive industry and harmonises the different assessment and certification systems in the supply chain. It is also working to obtain environmental management (ISO 14001) and occupational health and safety management (ISO 45001) certification at all its factories. To manage these three standards, the company has a global certification agreement with TÜV RHEINLAND until 2024.\n\nCompliance with IATF 16949 implies compliance with the associated consumer health and safety measures, even though as a B2B company, CIE Automotive does not have any contact with end vehicle\n\nThat technical specification pass-through to suppliers such as CIE Automotive means that reparability, disassembly and recyclability criteria that improve vehicle end life are also taken into consideration.\n\nIn 2023, the company did not incur any significant fines related with consumer safety or with incidents of non-compliance with product information and labelling requirements.\n\nusers. Nevertheless the OEMs pass on to CIE Automotive their product and project technical specifications and requirements to ensure that each part contributes to guaranteeing the safety of the vehicles ultimately put on the market.\n\nImage /page/85/Figure/13 description: The image shows five icons, each with a title below it.

Under this programme, projects are being ranked by geography for close monitoring. Last year the company also organised internal communication seminars, shared best practices and developed new procedures for scaling up incidents with the goal of avoiding not only legal noncompliance but indeed any source of customer dissatisfaction.\n\nThe company focused on the prevention of possible defects, an effort that included the reinforcement of procedures and controls, enhanced traceability of all products, analysis of the causes of potential defects and constant communication with its customers.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is one of CIE's key success factors. To that end, the company has a satisfaction control system that measures, tracks and analyses customer feedback with the aim of proposing improvements at the various factories, where needed.\n\nThis system is used to assess each factory's performance and to quantify customer perceptions on the basis of audits, assessments and current data. That information is then used to compile an annual report and draw up corrective action plans as necessary.\n\n### **Consumer claims, complaints and grievance systems**\n\nDespite its best efforts on the product quality front, both preventive during the design and industrialisation phases and corrective during manufacturing, on occasion deviations lead to customer claims.\n\nWhen that happens, it is vital to react immediately to prevent the supply of nonconforming parts and conduct in-depth analysis of the root causes. The solutions provided are shared with and applied to all potentially affected facilities and technologies.\n\nThe company did not receive any significant fines or penalties as a result of legal proceedings related with incidents of noncompliance with product information or labelling in 2023.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/22 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Given the nature of this work, it is vital to duly guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive information at the corporate and individual division levels. To that end the company is working on an information safekeeping project guided by the following standards:\n\n- Compliance with benchmark international standards, including ISO 27001, ISO 27005 and ISO/IEC 27002/2005. In 2021, CIE Automotive's Engineering Centre in Spain obtained the TISAX Label, which is based on ISO 27001 criteria, and in 2022 and 2023 it extended the seal to new countries.\n- Process re-engineering and social engineering adapted for the organisation's specific needs.\n- Real-time management of information security.\n\nThe company did not receive any significant fines for non-compliance with data protection laws or regulations in 2023.\n\nNor did it receive any significant fines or penalties as a result of legal proceedings related with incidents of non-compliance with product information or labelling during the reporting period.\n\nThe Systems Manager is the executive ultimate responsible for security, also carrying out information security director functions.\n\n### **Eco-design**\n\nThe introduction of eco-design criteria at the earliest stages of product development helps minimise the impact of CIE Automotive's products during the manufacturing process and also when the end vehicles are in use. At this stage, and in collaboration with its customers, the company builds reparability,\n\ndisassembly and final recycling criteria into its designs in order to improve the circularity of the end product; despite the fact that disassembly and recycling are the responsibility of its customers, CIE Automotive contributes its know-how in materials, processes and certain products.\n\n#### **Certifications and accolades**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive was named best supplier by a number of market-leading OEMs and organisations. Those accolades encourage it to press ahead with its continuous improvement and customer satisfaction efforts.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/16 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In addition, the company is tapping and nurturing young talent under internship and scholarship programmes.\n\nAs for its employees' education levels, reflecting its manufacturing profile, 68% are tradesmen and women, 28% are university graduates and 4% hold management positions.\n\nCIE Automotive values talent no matter where it hails from. That is evident in the fact that 89% of its factory managers are nationals from the country in which the factory is located. In addition, 92% of the members of its factory management committees are local professionals.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/7 description: The image shows the number 5 and the text \"Our response to the environmental challenge\".\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/90/Picture/20 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Inclusion of these people is heavily influenced by the sensitivities and legislation of each country. Europe and Brazil stand out, reporting considerably higher percentages.\n\nExcluding the impact of the discontinuation of the German forging businesses, which impacts this indicator notably as the number of employees with differing abilities at those factories was relatively high, the number of employees in this category would have increased by 20 year-on-year, implying growth in the number of people with differing abilities at the group of 7.5%.\n\nNote that this analysis relates only to employees with differing abilities that are directly hired by the group. In addition to its employees, CIE Automotive purchases a range of services from special employment centres and similar entities that support the integration of people with differing abilities into the workforce.\n\n### **Gender diversity**\n\nAs for gender diversity, 20% of the group's employees are women. It is common for this figure to be low in the world of manufacturing; nevertheless, CIE Automotive has been managing to bring this percentage slowly higher in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, helped by the completion of diversity assessments at nearly all of the group's facilities, a number of awareness and training drives and execution of factory-level equality plans that go beyond the group's legal requirements, the share of female employees increased by two points, from 18% to 20%. Indeed, the 2023 figure is the highest in the entire series, having increased by four points in recent years.\n\nCIE Automotive's predominantly male workforce is attributable to tradition in the automotive sector and restrictions on women accessing technical training at schools and universities. There are also cultural barriers in some countries that impede higher female representation at the factories as is evident in the differences between North America, where women hold 35% of all jobs, for example, and China, where they hold only 5%.\n\nThat b\nof fem\ngroup,\nEurope\nBrazil o\n\nThat being said, the two-point increase in the percentage of female employees in 2023 was felt across the entire group, albeit most pronounced in the Americas and Europe, increasing by three points in Europe, seven in Brazil and two in Mexico.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\nImage /page/91/Figure/6 description: The image shows the number 4 on the left, followed by the words \"Common responsibility, shared benefits\" on the right.\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/24 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

A dark gray shape, resembling a stylized letter 'D' or a partial circle, dominates the left side of the image. Inside this shape, there is a white, curved area that creates a sense of depth. To the right, a light orange shape forms a corner, intersecting with the gray shape and creating a sense of overlap. The overall effect is a modern and minimalist design with a focus on form and color.\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/8 description: The image is an abstract composition featuring a gray area on the left and a brown area on the right. A gradient orange circle is positioned between the two areas, partially overlapping both. The bottom of the image has a white strip.\n\nThe situation also varies by job category and level of seniority. Forty per cent of the members of the Management Committee are women, while female boardroom representation stands at 36%; five of the 14 directors are women.\n\n> In order to encourage more women to look at manufacturing positions in the long term, CIE Automotive is championing the provision of technical training to women from school age through its participation in the CIE STEM Planet project and, together with Innobasque, in the STEM careers chapter of the public sector \"Committed to talent\" initiative.\n\n|                                                   | 2022  | 2023  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| % of female employees                             | 18%   | 20%   |\n| % of new hires                                    | 19%   | 23%   |\n| % of women on the group's<br>Management Committee | 40%   | 40%   |\n| % of women on the Board of<br>Directors           | 36%   | 36%   |\n| % gender pay gap*                                 | 94.9% | 92.4% |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready for change**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\n**CIE Automotive**\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in black, with a large gray quotation mark and the number \"23\" in black to the right of the words.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n**GENDER PAY GAP**\n\n#### **GENDER PAY GAP BY SIGNIFICANT LOCATIONS**\n\n**SPAIN**\n\n**GER**\n\nSLO\n\nCZE\n\n**ROM**\n\n**US**\n\nMEX\n\nDDA\n\n**INDIA**\n\nASIA\n\n#### **Gender pay gap**\n\nThe gender pay gap increased by around two percentage points in 2023 from 2022. The average earnings of the company's female employees amounted to 92.4% of what the men earn on average, compared to 94.9% in 2022.\n\nSpecifically, female employees earned €17,510 on average, compared to the €18,960 earned by the men. It is important to note that the salaries were converted to euros at yearend exchange rates and include the salaries of all of the group's factories and offices, so that the indicator considers people from different regions, with different technical skills and from countries with markedly different levels of economic, social and labour market development.\n\nThe increase in the gender pay gap in 2023 is primarily attributable to two factors:\n\nImage /page/93/Figure/29 description: This image is a bar chart comparing data from 2022 and 2023 for CIE Automotive in different regions and countries. The chart includes data for Europe, specifically Spain, Germany, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Romania. It also includes data for Asia, specifically China and India, and North America, specifically the US and Mexico. Finally, it includes data for Brazil. The data for 2022 is as follows: Europe: 94.9%, Spain: 78%, Germany: 94%, Slovakia: 89%, Czech Republic: 77%, Romania: 80%, China: 88%, India: 77%, US: 78%, Mexico: 71%, and Brazil: 77%. The data for 2023 is as follows: Europe: 92.4%, Spain: 81%, Germany: 87%, Slovakia: 88%, Czech Republic: 75%, Romania: 85%, China: 89%, India: 79%, US: 76%, Mexico: 65%, and Brazil: 74%.\n\n- The first, which is not entirely within the group's control, is the situation at the factories newly acquired in Hungary and Brazil, where the pay gap before their acquisition was above the group average, so bringing the 2023 group average down.\n- The second relates to a development within the group, which is working hard to bring more women to work at its factories. These new hires are concentrated in entry-level positions, where starting salaries are lower, so that comparisons between male and female pay without considering job categories increases the pay gap. It is likely, however, that as these new female employees develop their careers at the group, gaining experience and taking on new responsibilities, the pay gap in these lower categories will narrow. As shown in the table below, female wages are only lower than male wages in the lower job categories (tradespeople).\n\n|                                     |               |                  | 2022  |  |               |                  |       |  | 2023 |  |  |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|--|---------------|------------------|-------|--|------|--|--|\n| AGGREGATE pay gap                   | No. of people | Average earnings | % gap |  | No. of people | Average earnings | % gap |  |      |  |  |\n| Men                                 | 20,332        | 18,969           |       |  | 20,580        | 18,960           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Women                               | 4,573         | 17,997           | 94.9% |  | 4,945         | 17,510           | 92.4% |  |      |  |  |\n| Gender pay gap BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY |               |                  |       |  |               |                  |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Executives - M                      | 871           | 65,747           |       |  | 894           | 64,797           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Executives - W                      | 112           | 63,713           | 97%   |  | 118           | 66,443           | 103%  |  |      |  |  |\n| Graduates - M                       | 5,731         | 22,059           |       |  | 5,771         | 22,268           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Graduates - W                       | 1,169         | 24,214           | 110%  |  | 1,210         | 25,108           | 113%  |  |      |  |  |\n| Tradesmen                           | 13,730        | 14,711           |       |  | 13,915        | 14,642           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Tradeswomen                         | 3,292         | 14,229           | 97%   |  | 3,617         | 13,371           | 91%   |  |      |  |  |\n\nEUR\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/27 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

As a result, the 2025 Strategic Plan sets the target of carrying out diversity & inclusion assessments at 100% of its factories so as to get a global snapshot of diversity across the group and take the opportune measures.\n\nAt year-end 2023, those assessments had been completed at 98 factories around the world, 93% of the 105 factories under the scope of the Plan (all except those acquired after 2020). Each factory establishes an action plan on the basis of the information obtained and conclusions it yields. Note that CIE Automotive manages diversity using the same decentralised approach as it applies to the rest\n\nof its management efforts and it is therefore up to each factory, based on the hard data, the environment in which it operates and the knowledge of the local managers to establish which areas of diversity they want to work on and set their own measures and action plans. Execution of the action plans is monitored by the factories themselves and by the corporate Human Resources Department.\n\n#### **EUROPE**\n\n### *Factory level assessments and action plans*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

 |\n\nA good place to work\n\nCIE Automotive offers its employees decent working conditions, remuneration in line with the work they perform and the training and safety conditions needed to do their jobs. It respects its employees' right to exercise freedom of association and to collective bargaining, regardless of the country they are working in.\n\nThese commitments are formally enshrined in the company's Human Rights Policy, which is signed by all factory and HR managers, and is worded in conformity with the International Labor Organization's fundamental conventions and the labour principles set down in the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nTo ensure those rights are upheld, the company conducts a survey every year to identify the factories at risk of breaching them, taking opportune measures as necessary. In 2023, 100% of the group's factories reported that they had identified no such risks.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/17 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

By region, permanent contracts represent 96% of the total in Europe and Brazil, compared to 79% in North America and 71% in Asia.\n\nThe large majority of CIE Automotive employees work full-time, with just 112 employees working part-time.\n\n#### **Wages**\n\nCIE Automotive is committed to providing a living wage to all its employees, regardless of where they work. That commitment is duly enshrined in its Human Rights Policy, which, in addition to pledging to protect its people's health, prevent discrimination and reject the use of compulsory or child labour, promises to provide decent work, specifically committing to paying them in accordance with their skills and knowledge, complying with labour legislation in all its markets, guaranteeing its employees' right to rest irrespective of prevailing labour laws and, to the extent possible, providing flexible working hours.\n\nAmong the controls performed around the provision of a living wage, CIE Automotive verifies the pay situation at the companies it acquires during the first year of integration to ensure that the lowest wages paid exceed the minimum wage and obtain evidence, albeit limited, that the wages paid by the companies acquired are at least reasonable for the market in\n\nquestion.

Nearly 7,000 employees also received a bonus in 2023 as a result of delivery of set targets and/ or excellent or improved performances.\n\nAside from wages, the company supports its employees with a series of company benefits which enhance their and their families' quality of living and generate a sense of belonging. These benefits entailed an investment of close to €35 million in 2023.\n\n| By contract type | Year-end 2022* | Year-end 2023 |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Permanent        | 21,112         | 20,859        |\n| Temporary        | 3,874          | 4,435         |\n| Total            | 24,986         | 25,294        |\n| Full-time        | 24,843         | 25,182        |\n| Part-time        | 143            | 112           |\n| Total            | 24,986         | 25,294        |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The image is divided into two columns. The left column contains a list of topics: Chairman and CEO's statement, 2023 highlights, Ready for change, Record earnings, Common responsibility, shared benefits, Our response to the environmental challenge, Responsible management, About this report, and Data tables. The right column contains information about the company's health insurance, food services, transport assistance, and education programs. The health insurance program provides €21 million in health insurance or in-house medical services. The food services program provides €7 million earmarked to food services. The transport assistance program provides €7 million of transport assistance. The education program provides €0.5 million earmarked to education.\n\n### **Organisation of working hours**\n\nIn keeping with its decentralised management approach, CIE Automotive introduces flexibility and work-life balance measures suited to the needs of each factory, division or country.\n\nThe most common measures across the group include staggered work start and end times; adjustment of working hours to protect family time; the possibility of working from home; days of maternity and paternity leave beyond the legally stipulated minimum; and specific care for pregnant employees.\n\nAmong those widespread initiatives it is worth highlighting those designed to facilitate work-life balance and encourage joint responsibility for parenting; these measures were in place at over 80% of the group's workplaces in 2023.\n\n#### **EMPLOYEE SUPPORT**\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

This percentage is relatively stable and is only partially manageable by the company as it is influenced by exogenous factors such as the age of specific groups of factory workers and the general economic situation in the regions where the company has operations.\n\n#### **Communication**\n\nThe main channels used to reach out to employees are the dashboard and corporate intranet. There is also a six-monthly newsletter in which the company shares the most significant financial and business developments, as well as reporting on social and environmental aspects.\n\nTo learn what is of concern to its employees, CIE Automotive conducts a workplace climate survey at every factory every two years. It carried out 38 such surveys in 2023, obtaining an average score of 7 points out of 10.\n\n#### Improved facility maintenance in Mexico and Morocco\n\nImplementation of facility improvements in the lunchroom and water dispensers to ensure a comfortable and functional work climate.\n\nRefurbishment of the bathrooms and provision of lockers to factory workers, as well as enhancement of the changing rooms and storage areas.\n\n#### Improved employee listening and grievance mechanisms in Mexico and Morocco\n\nOngoing publicity of the channels for voicing grievances and suggestions with regular publication of their status and outcome monitoring sessions in a bid to improve internal communication.\n\n#### Introduction of flexibility and work-life balance measures in Spain\n\nIntroduction of flexible working arrangements to allow employees to manage their working hours, so fostering a healthy balance between work and home life.\n\n#### Team-building activities at several Mexican factories\n\nOrganisation of regular team-building activities to foster a sense of belonging and collaboration, so improving relations within the company.\n\n#### Noise safety awareness drive at CIE Matic\n\nRollout of an awareness campaign addressing the importance of using personnel protection gear (PPE) to improve noise conditions in specific positions.\n\n#### Design and implementation of recognition mechanisms at severak Mexican factories\n\nDevelopment and execution of new mechanisms for acknowledging employees, so fostering a positive workplace climate.\n\n#### Reinforcement of information about internal vacancies at several factories\n\nPublication and publicity of vacancies on the various internal communication platforms which can be searched by specific skills and position criteria.\n\nThe results of those surveys are used to draw up annual or two-year plans for improving employee satisfaction. The initiatives set in motion in 2023 to improve the workplace climate included:\n\nChairman and CEO's\n\n[statement](#page-2-0) **2023**\n\n**[highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**[for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Ready 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n| 5 | Our response to the environmental challenge |\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/26 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The breakdown by employee category was more than 96,000 hours for executives, over 228,000 hours for university graduates and over 483,000 hours for factory workers.\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/23 description: The image contains three tables. The first table, titled \"TRAINING HOURS BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY\", shows the number of training hours and the number of employees receiving training in 2022 and 2023. For Executives, the training hours were 25,015 in 2022 and 96,142 in 2023, with 726 employees receiving training in 2022 and 678 in 2023. For Graduates, the training hours were 223,042 in 2022 and 228,425 in 2023, with 5,888 employees receiving training in 2022 and 5,782 in 2023. For Tradesmen and women, the training hours were 564,275 in 2022 and 483,239 in 2023, with 13,970 employees receiving training in 2022 and 13,823 in 2023. The total training hours were 812,332 in 2022 and 807,806 in 2023, with 20,584 employees receiving training in 2022 and 20,283 in 2023. The second table, titled \"TRAINING IN 2023\", shows the hours and employees trained by gender. For hours, men had 599,973 and women had 207,833, totaling 807,806. For employees trained, men had 15,763 and women had 4,520, totaling 20,283. The third table, titled \"EMPLOYEES RECEIVING TRAINING BY GENDER, %\", shows the percentage of employees receiving training in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, 82% of employees received training, while in 2023, 80% of employees received training.\n\nAlthough the majority of employees who benefitted from training programme were men, reflecting the company's predominantly male workforce, the number of training hours received by female employees (46 hours per female employee trained) was higher compared to their male colleagues (38 hours per male employee trained). That phenomenon was common to all regions.\n\n|                            | Men     | Women   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Hours                      | 599,973 | 207,833 | 807,806 |\n| Employees trained          | 15,763  | 4,520   | 20,283  |\n| CIE Automotive people      | 20,169  | 5,125   | 25,294  |\n| Hours per employee trained | 38.1    | 46.0    | 39.8    |\n| Hours per employee         | 29.7    | 40.6    | 32.0    |\n\n|                                           | 2022 | 202 |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|-----|--|\n| Employees receiving<br>training, %        | 82%  | 80% |  |\n| Male employees<br>receiving training, %   | 80%  | 78% |  |\n| Female employees<br>receiving training, % | 85%  | 88% |  |\n\n| Female employees<br>receiving training, % | 85% | 88% |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----|-----|\n\n|                     |         | Number of training<br>hours | No. of employees<br>receiving training |        |\n|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|\n| EMPLOYEE CATEGORY   | 2022    | 2023                        | 2022                                   | 2023   |\n| Executives          | 25,015  | 96,142                      | 726                                    | 678    |\n| Graduates           | 223,042 | 228,425                     | 5,888                                  | 5,782  |\n| Tradesmen and women | 564,275 | 483,239                     | 13,970                                 | 13,823 |\n| TOTAL               | 812,332 | 807,806                     | 20,584                                 | 20,283 |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

A good part of the company's training effort is decentralised, taking place at each factory, in keeping with the guidelines set down in the Training Plan Procedure. That plan indicates the phases each factory's training programmes need to follow: identification of training needs, planning, definition, execution, evaluation and feedback.\n\nEvery year the corporate Human Resources Department also presents a comprehensive plan for CIE Automotive factories covering centralised training initiatives targeting advanced management skills, interpersonal skills, sustainability, corporate ethics and other core aspects.\n\nThe training provided in 2023 emphasised traditional core areas of people management (health and safety, soft skills, and technical training) and other subjects that are relatively new in the world of business, such as ESG and human rights.\n\n#### **ESG training**\n\nESG training is one of the group's top\n\n## priorities.

Thanks to this initiative, young professionals from different plants and of different nationalities attend an excellence training centre in the Basque region before going on to build their skills at the group's emblematic factories in Spain and Italy.\n\nThis programme delivers four key objectives: embedding the group's values; facilitating cross-country communication going\n\nforward; fostering intragroup relationships; and providing the group with highly skilled professionals.\n\nSince resuming the programme in the wake of the pandemic, it has been expanded to the point of exceeding the Strategic Plan target. Currently, 17 students from four countries (Brazil, Czech Republic, India and Mexico) are participating in the newest edition of the Ulysses Programme, which began in October 2023, so topping the figures established in the 2025 Strategic Plan, which called for 15 participants from three different markets. Moreover, the retention rate, two years after completing the programme, currently stands at 90% for the first edition and 100% for the second edition, likewise delivering the related Strategic Plan retention rate target of at least 80%.\n\n#### **TARGET DELIVERY**\n\nThe Ulysses Programme **combines mobility and talent attraction**\n\n#### **Phases of the programme**\n\nThe Ulysses programme is structured into two distinct phases:\n\n#### **Phase 1:**\n\nDepending on the originating factory, the students participate in different technology modules (polymers, metal and metal injection). There are also two common modules addressing key soft skills and the company's lean management philosophy: Entrepreneurship & Innovation and Lean Manufacturing.\n\n#### **Phase 2:**\n\nThe students spend several months at a factory. A large number of CIE Automotive's legacy plants are involved in this training initiative, including CIE Orbelan, CIE Inyectametal, CIE Udalbide, CIE Egaña and CIE Galfor, among others, as well as the corporate Engineering Department, the corporate Controller Department and the Laboratory located in AIC - Amorebieta.\n\nNew this year was the incorporation of youths from Eastern Europe and the provision of training development of structural staff, unlike previous exercises that focused only on production plant personnel.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 1 2 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/18 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In 2023, 56% of the group's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nOver the course of the year, the company entered into 39 collective bargaining agreements (regional, sectoral and some factory-specific) at a number of facilities in the following countries: Mexico, Brazil, Spain, France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Romania, India and China.\n\nThese agreements feature specific obligations on the part of the company negotiated with the workers' representatives at each factory although they all tend to emphasise essential matters such as occupational health and safety.\n\n*(\\*) Includes 676 employees at the German operations classified as discontinued in 2022.*\n\n#### **EMPLOYEES COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BY COUNTRY**\n\n| Country

The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The \"C\" is formed by two curved shapes, one above the other, creating a circular form with a gap in the middle. The text \"CIE Automotive\" is in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"ANNUAL REPORT\" on the left side and the number \"23\" on the right side. The number 23 has a dashed line through it and a quotation mark above it.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Prevention of discriminatory practices**\n\nCIE Automotive introduced its Protocol for Preventing and Handling Workplace Harassment, which is binding upon all group facilities, in 2020. This protocol addresses the prevention of mobbing and of sexual or gender harassment and includes several preventive measures, such as zero-tolerance towards harassment, shared employee responsibility for monitoring workplace conduct and the implementation of communication programmes. The full text of the protocol is available for consultation on the corporate website.\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive received and managed 17 complaints related with matters addressed in the protocol, which is one more than in 2022. In the wake of these complaints, the group took significant disciplinary action, even laying off one of the employees involved.\n\nIt is important to note that when CIE Automotive integrates new companies, as it did in Hungary (CIE Salgglas) and Brazil (Iberoleff- CIE Autometal Salto) last year, the factory managers and HR heads are asked to sign the group's Harassment Protocol and Human Rights Policy by way of endorsement. As a result, the group's protocol and policy are binding upon all factories from the outset.\n\n#### **HOURS OF TRAINING ON HUMAN RIGHTS MATTERS**\n\nIn 2023 CIE Automotive imparted **25,000 hours of human rights training**\n\n#### **Fostering respect for human rights as a culture**\n\nCIE Automotive champions tolerance, dignity and fundamental human rights. To reinforce that, in 2023 it imparted 25,000 hours of related training. That means that roughly one in four employees received training on human rights last year.\n\n#### **Zero-tolerance stance on compulsory or child labour**\n\nCIE Automotive works to ensure there is no compulsory or child labour at its factories. Its hiring controls include preventive measures and minimum age controls in keeping with the ILO's standards or local legislation if more stringent. No instances of compulsory or child labour were detected in 2023.\n\n|                   | Men    | Women | Total  |\n|-------------------|--------|-------|--------|\n| 2022              |        |       |        |\n| Hours             | 13,193 | 6,438 | 19,631 |\n| Employees trained | 3,700  | 2,116 | 5,816  |\n| 2023              |        |       |        |\n| Hours             | 17,818 | 7,688 | 25,506 |\n| Employees trained | 4,820  | 2,255 | 7,075  |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready for change**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout\n\n[this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Expansion of this policy has yielded very encouraging results, as borne out by the fact that the group achieved record safety results in 2022, and then again in 2023.\n\n#### **HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY PRINCIPLES**\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/5 description: The image shows three shield icons. The first shield icon contains a white image of a group of people. The second shield icon contains a white image of a monitor. The third shield icon contains a white image of a gavel.\n\nConsideration of safety across all activities, tasks and levels. The physical, mental and emotional health of all of the people populating the value chain, including their psychological and social well-being, are unwavering and fundamental objectives for the group.\n\nPersonal safety always prevails. As a result, the company trains and raises awareness among all members of the organisation.\n\nSafety is intrinsic to the group's activities. To achieve it, CIE Automotive complies with prevailing legislation in all its markets, meets its stakeholders' expectations, while taking on other safety goals it seems fit.\n\nIt guarantees the health and safety of everyone working at the organisation and at any subcontractors coming to its places of work, involving them tirelessly in the continuous improvement effort by means of systematic reviews, consultation and participation, as well as defining objectives measured using our safety dashboard.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n109\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

To the right of the words is a large gray quotation mark and the number \"23\" in bold, black letters.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Figure/32 description: The image shows a flowchart with three levels. The top level is a black rounded rectangle containing the text \"Corporate OHS Department\". A line connects this to the second level, which is a white rounded rectangle containing the text \"Factory level OHS areas (one or more technicians)\". A line connects this to the third level, which is a white rounded rectangle containing the text \"Outside safety services as a preventive modality\".\n\nThe Health and Safety Policy is publicised at all levels of the organisation via direct delivery or email to all executives, heads, middle managers and workers' representatives. It also includes prevention plans that reach all levels of the organisation via manuals containing information about risks, preventive measures and emergency measures that are delivered to employees; they are also posted in visible places (such as notice boards or specially designated spaces) and publicised in other ways thought up by the various factory managers who are responsible for making sure the Health and Safety Policy is broadcast, understood, applied and kept updated.\n\nThe policy can be modified by management in light of contextual developments, changes in legal requirements, safety plan revisions or the results of the continuous improvement process.\n\n### **Occupational health and safety framework**\n\nThe company has devised an occupational health and safety (OHS) framework (process no. 12) in order to effectively manage all of the risks that could jeopardise delivery of the its targets.\n\nThe documents comprising this framework or system include:\n\n- The reported OHS Policy and OHS Target documents.\n- The documented procedures required under benchmark applicable regulations.\n- The documents needed to ensure effective process planning, operation and control.\n- The legally applicable requirements and other standards adopted by the group.\n- The registers required under benchmark applicable regulations.\n\nCIE Automotive has 15 corporate procedures and 'formats' related with delivery of the targets set in the OHS area.\n\n Those specific procedures establish the occupational health and safety requirements to be upheld in all activities. The 'formats' compile relevant information about the controls, measures and, in general, data yielded by an activity or a methodology for carrying it out.\n\n#### **Model and structure**\n\nEach factory has its own health and safety plan, which is put together on the basis of a framework system that is subjected to continual audit as part of the group's workplace safety management systems.\n\nThis structure enables the company to adapt safety measures for each factory and evaluate the measures taken by it on this front as a whole. Individual action plans are formulated every year to deliver the targeted level of improvement defined on the basis of the prior year's performance.\n\nEvery facility has a health and safety officer who, in addition to monitoring accidents and safety indicators, is tasked with ergonomics, avoiding exposure to harmful substances and managing psychosocial risks, as well as coordinating health monitoring.\n\nThe factories have an outside safety service that covers the four legally-stipulated areas of accident prevention expertise and a health and safety officer at each of its productive facilities.\n\nThe corporate Health And Safety Department regularly audits the factories, maintains the corporate intranet and serves as contact point for issues related with occupational health and safety.\n\nAt the factory level, the safety staff inspect the adequacy of the company's facilities, conduct emergency evacuation drills, provide training, assist with incident investigations and carry out awareness drives.\n\n#### **STRUCTURE**\n\nThe company has an **occupational health and safety framework**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 1 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/30 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo. The logo consists of a stylized letter C on the left and the words \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The letter C is made up of two curved shapes that do not quite meet, forming an incomplete circle. The words \"CIE Automotive\" are in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a large gray quotation mark, followed by the number \"23\" in bold, black letters.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Joint management–worker health and safety committees**\n\nThe factories frequently have joint management-worker health and safety committees under the scope of their collective bargaining agreements, particularly in markets with tighter health and safety regulations, as is the case in Europe.\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nUnder its 2025 Strategic Plan, CIE Automotive is aiming to have 100% of its factories ISO 45001-certified by 2025. This is the benchmark international occupational health and safety management system standard designed to protect workers and visitors from accidents and workplace illnesses.\n\nIn 2023 the group certified four factories in Portugal, India and China, bringing the total number of factories certified to 95, which is 94% of the total.\n\n#### **Indicators and assessment**\n\nCIE Automotive has been using three key OHS indicators to track its safety record for over 15 years: the injury frequency rate, the injury severity rate and the number of lost-time injuries.\n\nIt also conducts an annual survey at each factory, called CIE Safety, the goal being for the facilities to score at least 85%. In 2023, all plants surpassed the target except one, which already has a corrective action plan in place.\n\n#### **Continuous improvement in accident metrics**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive recorded 345 injuries, 23 less than in 2022. Of the total, 339 were mild, six were serious and there no fatalities.\n\nThe injury frequency and severity rates continued to come down, marking record lows. In 2023 the severity rate fell to 0.11 and the frequency rate, to 6.19.\n\nAs for work-related illnesses, the group recorded 27 cases, compared to 22 in 2022. Note that there were no injuries affecting subcontracted workers.\n\nImage /page/110/Picture/30 description: The image shows a peach-colored shield with a white circle in the center.

The white elements appear to form a stylized, geometric pattern, possibly resembling letters or symbols. The design is simple yet visually striking due to the contrast between the colors and the clean lines.\n\n#### **INJURY METRICS**\n\n| Lost-time injuries*              |

Between 2017 and 2021, the US firefighter forces responded to an estimated annual average of 3,396 structure fires related with hot work, according to the most recent NFPA report. These fires caused average annual fatalities and civilian injuries of 19 and 120, respectively. The statistics regarding worker injuries and fatalities related with hot work paint an even darker picture.\n\nFaced with that reality, in 2023 CIE Automotive introduced a new procedure for controlling and regulating hot work at all group factories (CIE CO PR P 16) which is expected to become fully operational over the course of 2024. Under this procedure all internal or external work requiring the use of fire or combustion will be verified.\n\n### **Fire safety self-inspections**\n\nBeyond the emergency measures in place across the factories, the group is planning to introduce a systematic method for performing regular fire safety inspections.\n\nSpecifically, inspections will take place at least monthly at all group factories covered by the new hot work procedure - CIE CO PR P 16 - verifying their critical facilities and establishing action plans to address all deviations detected.\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/19 description: The image contains the words \"Business Activity\" on the first line and \"Coordination\" on the second line. The text is in a bold, sans-serif font.\n\nCIE Automotive guarantees the health and safety of the workers of all companies entering its places of work. The so-called Business Activity Coordination unit is therefore one of the most important areas of the health and safety effort.\n\nThe vast volumes of documents and large number of companies and workers involved mean that this unit needs to be digitalised to perform its coordination work more effectively.\n\nThe resulting coordination software platform is intended to reduce workplace risks, ensure compliance with applicable regulations and increase cooperation between contracting and subcontractor firms, as well as reduce the costs associated with workplace accidents.\n\nThe idea is to integrate internal and external health and safety management and, if correctly applied, guarantee compliance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/23 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Thanks this responsible and unique approach to the management of its approximately 23,000\\* suppliers, it renewed its ISO 20400 Sustainable procurement certification, remaining the only automotive parts maker in Spain to boast this certification.**\n\n*(\\*) 740 suppliers were from the discontinued German forging companies.*\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready 2 Ready for change**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/33 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

That threw up the challenge of involving its suppliers in the company's commitment to becoming climate neutral by 2050. So began the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project.\n\nThe first step in this race to decarbonisation was to understand its suppliers' real GHG emission figures, their level of commitment to reducing them and their advances to date. The idea was also to identify suppliers that need help tackling this challenge.\n\nThe group surveyed its main suppliers in all its geographies regarding their engagement around decarbonisation. The suppliers were selected on the basis of their emissions impact and/or procurement volume. They represent 41% of the group's total purchases (57% of productive suppliers), which amounted to €2.95\\* billion in 2023.\n\nThe study reveals that there is still ample room for improvement: only a minority of the suppliers surveyed have become aware of the need to reduce their carbon footprint:\n\nWith this information in hand, CIE Automotive will set deadlines for its suppliers to offer decarbonised technical solutions, so minimising its emissions and multiplying its positive impact, even in countries with lax environmental regulations.\n\nThe goal of Supply Chain Race 2 Zero is to focus on helping in the weakest areas. In general, the smaller and more local suppliers need support in the form of resources, guidance or environmental knowledge. This partnership includes information about energy efficiency, technical solutions and identification of areas for improvement, among other forms of assistance.\n\nFrom 2024, the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero programme's new roadmap will involve:\n\n*(\\*) 75 million euros correspond to the business of discontinued German forges.*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n### **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n| 5 | Our response to the environmental challenge |\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/26 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The goal of this event was to share CIE India's ESG targets and expectations with suppliers so as to rally them around delivery of the ESG targets that in turn form part of CIE Automotive's overall Strategic Plan. To encourage and motivate the best-performing suppliers in terms of quality, delivery, cost and ESG aspects, the management team provided them with a distinction.\n\nIn Brazil, meanwhile, the company organised an online training session explaining how to register properly for the ESG Supplier Portal in May and a workshop for suppliers to CIE Durametal addressing ESG practices and stakeholder relations.\n\nLastly, in Mexico, the company awarded a prize to its Best ESG Supplier.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Ready for change 1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nTHE BEST SUP\n\nAWARD ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL\n\nMPP\n\nPEMSA Celaya\n\nONLINE AO VIVO VIA MICROSOFT TEAMS\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/16 description: The image contains the words \"WORKSHOP PARA FORNECEDORES\" in bold, black font.

In parallel it works with its suppliers on initiatives related with energy self-consumption, reducing the use of coolant and onsite waste management.\n\nThe following stand out among the projects championed and managed by the procurement area:\n\n- Solar panels\n- Switch from combustion to electric forklifts\n- Chemistry driven waste reduction projects\n- Carbon offset projects with airlines\n\n#### **Collaboration on social issues**\n\nBeyond the scope of these environmental efforts, CIE Automotive also carried out a number of community projects involving CIE Automotive staff and supply chain employees. These initiatives include efforts designed to spur the transfer of technology and skills to developing economies and maximise its operations' positive impact on local economies.\n\nFor example, the company participated in research and training projects with local schools and universities and industry associations in developing countries, providing or supporting education, including the Lakshya and Gems projects in India, to name a few.\n\nCIE Automotive entered into agreements for the **purchase of renewable energy and the implementation of collaborative energy efficiency projects**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/23 description: The image shows a green and white logo.

The audit confirmed that the company had met the requirements formulated the previous year.\n\nWith this renewal, CIE Automotive ratified the operational excellence of its Procurement Department and the contribution being made by the latter to the company's broader sustainability and social responsibility policies. To achieve this certification, which is based on UNE-15896 Value added purchasing management, the following parameters were appraised:\n\n- Purchasing policy.\n- Selection and monitoring of suppliers.\n- Purchasing processes, ESG requirements in all group purchases.\n- Buyer training.\n- Risk management, purchase specifications and internal organisation.\n- Alignment with new regulations and requirements in the areas of due diligence, taxonomy and diversity and inclusion.\n\nBeyond the recognition that comes with the certification, it represents a challenge for the procurement teams as it not only requires compliance with ISO 20400 by the company but also with ESG standards by its suppliers. So, for example, the company cannot make an acquisition without a positive assessment of the target's management.\n\nIn this way, ISO 20400 certification reinforces the company's sustainability policies by extending them to the entire supply chain and lays the groundwork for making further progress in ESG as it requires:\n\n- Ensuring supply chain security.\n- Avoiding financial, environmental and reputational risks.\n- Inspiring confidence among investors, consumers and other stakeholders.\n- Fostering employee wellbeing and contributing to opening new markets for products and services.\n- Being prepared to achieve the decarbonisation targets CIE Automotive has set for itself, its supply chain constituting its main source of emissions (Scope 3).\n\n## **CIE Automotive is the only Spanish** automotive parts maker to boast **ISO 20400 certification**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n| 2 | Ready for change |\n|---|------------------|\n|---|------------------|\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n| 5 | Our response to the environmental challenge |\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/30 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Existing and prospective suppliers of products and services to CIE Automotive can register.\n\nBy year-end 2023, a total of 8,000 suppliers populated the company's supplier base. Any candidates that did not complete or\n\npass the assessment received a message encouraging them to complete the process and/or improve their scores with the help of CIE Automotive.\n\nFor the first time in 2023, non-productive, or indirect suppliers, with annual procurement volume of over €500,000 are now required to register with the Portal and submit to an ESG assessment, an obligation previously limited to suppliers of productive materials, or direct suppliers.\n\n#### A **productive or direct purchase** is the\n\npurchase of products or services that form part of the final products received by the group's customers. The raw materials used in any of its technologies, the parts included in its end products (rubber, textiles, fasteners) and even subcontracting processes (heat treatments, machining) therefore fall into this category.\n\nExceptionally, the tooling used in productive processes is also included within productive purchasing. In short, productive purchases account for over 70% of the group's total procurement spend and are the biggest source of Scope 3 emissions for CIE Automotive.\n\nIn contrast a **non-productive or indirect purchase** is one that facilitates the production process but is not an integral part of the end products delivered to its customers.\n\n#### *[Refer to the Procurement families]*\n\n### **Enhanced management**\n\nIn addition to facilitating assessment, the Suppliers Portal is a source of reference and valuable information for our procurement managers.\n\nFollowing its redesign in 2022, a new interface was developed in 2023 to visualise, manage and extract information related with the audits conducted by CIE Automotive on current or prospective suppliers. This new feature enhances the procurement teams' management efforts and adds exclusive ESG audits to the range of traditional audits. The company's traditional audits also include a pass/fail ESG section.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/24 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Aligned with the decentralised management model, the local procurement teams were asked to lead execution of this initiative, evidencing an increase in their commitment and awareness around these matters.\n\n**100% of the suppliers registered on the portal report to not using** \n\n**mineral conflicts** or, in the event they use them in their productive processes, guarantee they are not sourced from conflict-affected areas\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/14 description: The image shows the number 125 in a simple, sans-serif font.

This requires additional supply chain management and document updates so as to reflect its targets, in line with prevailing legislation, and multiply its impact.\n\n# Management system and inclusion of ESG aspects\n\n#### **Living documents in response to evolving ESG challenges**\n\nThe OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers' growing sensitivity around ESG matters is forcing CIE Automotive to revise its supply chain procedures, policies and standards every year.\n\nIn 2023, it updated its Global Supply Chain Manual and General Purchasing Terms and Conditions to include its customers' chief demands. Together these two documents guide the company's suppliers.\n\n#### **Global Supply Chain Manual**\n\nThis manual is a true reflection of the supply chain system and procedures. It details graphically and in plain language the Mission, Purchasing Policy, the various product and service purchasing categories, the purchasing flowchart and the associated internal procedures and the ESG requirements suppliers must meet in order to work with CIE Automotive.\n\nNew commitments were added in 2023, specifically addressing:\n\n- Due diligence\n- Emissions reduction requirements\n- Decarbonisation targets\n\n#### **General Purchasing Terms and Conditions | Supplier ESG Document**\n\nThe company's General Purchasing Terms and Conditions require group suppliers to endorse the company's ESG commitments if they want to work with CIE Automotive, no matter where in the world they are located.\n\nNew conditions were added in 2023, specifically:\n\n- \n- \n\n• Modern slavery: CIE Automotive wants to ensure that there is no place for modern slavery in its supply chain, in other words, that no person is forced to work in subhuman conditions they cannot refuse on account of coercion, threats or the abuse of power.\n\n• Use of private of public security forces: Suppliers may not hire or use private or public security forces to protect the company if, due to a lack of training or control by the supplier, their deployment could give rise to human rights violations.\n\nCIE Automotive revised and updated its **supply chain ESG procedures, policies and requirements in 2023**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/29 description: The image is mostly white with a blurry green shape on the left side.\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/30 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" in black, with a gray quotation mark above it.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe company regularly reviews and updates other documents, such as its Procurement Policy and Conflict Minerals Policy.\n\n#### **Conflict Minerals Policy**\n\nThe Conflict Minerals Policy was introduced in 2021 to reinforce the company's requirements around this issue, even though the Global Supply Chain Manual and General Purchasing Terms and Conditions already stipulated the ban, which it enforced via the \"Mineral Conflicts\" questionnaire within the Suppliers Portal.\n\nThe company revised the policy in 2023 to specify Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs).\n\nIn 2023, 100% of the suppliers CIE Automotive works with who are registered in the Suppliers Portal reported to either not using mineral conflicts or, if used in their productive processes, to being able to guarantee that they were not sourced from conflict regions.\n\n### *Alignment with the due diligence directive*\n\nAligned with the EU's new corporate sustainability due diligence directive and following the recommendations issued by the OECD, CIE Automotive has begun to learn about and develop a due diligence process in order to identify, prevent and manage the impact the company's operations could have on human rights and the environment along the supply chain, including its suppliers in a specific protocol.\n\nTo that end it has included a specific section within the Ethics Framework section of its Global Supply Chain Manual urging its suppliers to participate in this process, introducing a due diligence report and five guidelines for correct compliance: establishing robust business management systems; identifying suppliers that supply mineral conflicts; designing a strategy for mitigating the risks detected; carrying out an external audit; and reporting on due diligence efforts in the group's annual reports.\n\nThe due diligence response is currently in the process of being implemented, as follows:\n\n**1. Developing a control list** for identifying internal and external human rights and environmental risks.\n\n**2. Prioritising risks** as a function of their severity, probability and urgency.\n\n**3. Defining mitigating actions** as a function of the results of the monitoring effort.\n\n**4. Documenting the process**, defining the internal and external risks and providing training across the affected areas of the firm and to third parties.\n\n**5. Integrating human rights and environmental risks** into the overall supply chain risk map with a view to subsequently\n\ncontrolling them.\n\nThe company will prioritise development of its response to this directive in 2024.\n\n## **Due diligence will be a cornerstone of supplier**\n\nmanagement in 2024\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/21 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

In 2022, the percentage is 78.5%. In 2023, the percentage is 78.2%.\n\nCIE Automotive uses a GLOCAL (global management with local application) procurement model, spearheaded by the corporate procurement function and executed by the various buyer teams that furnish the company with goods and services sourced locally (onshoring) and regionally (nearshoring).\n\nThis decentralised approach is highly efficient as it reduces logistics costs and tariffs, mitigates foreign currency risk and favours flows by overcoming cultural, linguistic and time zone differences. In parallel it favours sustainable procurement by reducing the emissions derived from transportation.\n\nThanks to this management approach, at year-end 2023, 92.2% of the suppliers used by CIE Automotive were local firms and accounted for 78.2% of the total procurement volume.\n\n## The GLOCAL procurement model **generates value locally and reduces the group's environmental impact**\n\n# GLOCAL procurement model\n\n#### **SHARE OF LOCAL SUPPLIERS**\n\n**SHARE OF PROCUREMENT VOLUME SOURCED FROM LOCAL SUPPLIERS** \n\n*(\\*) 96.0% in discontinued German forging companies.

ESG aspects are playing an increasingly important role in that process.\n\n### **Supplier audits**\n\nCIE Automotive assesses its suppliers' financial health in order to ensure their ability to deliver throughout the duration of its projects.\n\nSupplier evaluations take the form of process audits that assess and score them on several parameters, including planning, reception, training and skills, process, maintenance, inspection, packaging, storage, continuous improvement and environmental performance, customer satisfaction, documentation and ESG criteria.\n\nThe results of the audits may be shared with the supplier. On other occasions it is the supplier that conducts a self-assessment which is then corroborated by qualified CIE Automotive professionals.\n\nThanks to this system of self-assessment and onsite audits, in 2023 the company conducted 698\\* audits, compared to 582 in 2022, an increase of 20%.\n\nIn 2024, the group has set itself the target of increasing that figure by 10%, stepping up the number of onsite audits in particular.\n\n### *External verification of ESG health using artificial intelligence*\n\nBetween self-assessments and onsite audits, **in 2023 the company conducted 698 audits, growth of 20% from 2022**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive reached an agreement with the one of world's most important ESG ratings companies for the verification of supplier ESG compliance covering over 50% of its global procurement spend. The scope of this exercise, which began in 2022 when it was associated exclusively with governance considerations, has been widened to include:\n\n• The Red Flags Grid (fines, human rights, environment, business\n\nl predictive\n\n- conduct, corporate governance)\n- Country risk\n- Default risk\n- ESG scoring: analytic and predictive\n- Scope1 & 2 emissions\n\nThe information provided by this rating company, which uses artificial intelligence and internal and external databases to check the suppliers' information, allows the group to contrast and complement the information it obtains from its Suppliers Portal.\n\nBy way of conclusion, just 3 of all the suppliers evaluated presented risks in any of the above-listed areas; an action plan has been established to monitor their progress and the company is searching for alternative for these suppliers in the event the risks cannot be addressed.\n\n*(\\*) One of them was carried out in the business of discontinued German forging companies.*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/25 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The x-axis represents the 'Impact index', ranging from 0 to 1.0, while the y-axis represents 'Compliance ESG', ranging from 0% to 120%. Each category is represented by a data point with a label indicating the category name and its corresponding 'Compliance ESG' percentage. The categories and their respective 'Compliance ESG' percentages are as follows: Logistics (83%), MRO (89%), Investements (80%), Subcontracts (98%), Tooling (93%), Energy (73%), Other consumption (72%), Prof. services (56%), Components (98%), and Raw material (97%). The size of the data points may vary, possibly indicating another dimension of data. The plot also includes the note 'Considered purchasing value >0.5MM€/year by supplier'.\n\nTo prevent and mitigate potential risks, CIE Automotive updates its supply chain ESG risk matrix every year. This exercise revealed growing commitment by suppliers in 2023.\n\nThe companies that supply CIE Automotive with raw materials, parts, subcontracted services and tooling, i.e., the productive procurement families, are the most committed, with all of them presenting ESG compliance scores of over 92%, unchanged from 2022.\n\n### *Supply chain ESG risk matrix*  Chairman **ESG RISK MATRIX**\n\nIn 2023 it is worth highlighting the significant improvement recorded in indirect procurement families such as energy (where ESG compliance jumped from 63% to 73% in 2023) and MRO (from 73% to 89%).\n\nIn 2023, the population of critical direct or raw material suppliers (by virtue of representing over 50% of total purchases) numbered 250.\n\nThe ESG risk mapping process in 2023 revealed growing **commitment by suppliers**\n\nand CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/133/Picture/19 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

It encompasses all the efforts made by various sectors to enhance their scientific, technological, research, cultural and academic interests in India and to promote economic, trade and business cooperation between the two countries, promoting initiatives, networking and specific activities considered priorities by the Trustees.\n\n## CIE Automotive sought to strengthen its ties to India, **where it has 25 factories**\n\n#### **Government grants received**\n\nIn 2023 CIE Automotive received €1.7 million of grants related to income, 0.2% more/less than in 2022. Of the total received, it obtained €0.6 million in Spain and €1.1 million between Italy, Portugal, China and Hungary.\n\nThe receipt of grants is also contemplated in CIE Automotive's Code of Conduct, which prohibits applying for subsidies, tax exemptions or government funds on a fraudulent basis..\n\n#### **Policy advocacy and relations with local authorities**\n\nIn the course of its activities, CIE Automotive engages with the public authorities. These interactions are at all times framed by strict observance of prevailing legislation and the utmost transparency, in keeping with the principles laid down in its Code of Professional Conduct.\n\nThe company is not associated with any form of political ideology in Spain or anywhere else and it forbids contributions to political parties or their representatives or candidates in the name or on behalf of the company that could have or be seen to have political implications.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/8 description: The image shows a gray flag waving in the wind.

On the right side, there is a large white number \"23\" with a dashed line underneath it.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY PRIORITIES**\n\n#### **Environmental management model**\n\nCIE Automotive's approach to environmental management is decentralised: the corporate Environmental Department is tasked with setting the standards and supervising implementation of the environmental strategy worldwide, while the productive facilities are in charge of strategy execution by means of annual risk assessments factory by factory under ISO 14001 and monitoring of the KPIs established in the Strategic Plan. In 2023, 95% of CIE Automotive's factories were ISO 14001-certified.\n\nCIE Automotive's environmental challenge extends beyond its perimeter. It collaborates with its suppliers to reduce their emissions, purchases and generates renewable energy and cooperates with its customers to develop and manufacture parts targeted at electric vehicles, so helping to decarbonise transport.\n\nFramed by its commitment to making low-emission vehicles, CIE Automotive is developing new parts and subassembly solutions to support the OEMs with this process. As a result of its sustainability strategy and R&D initiatives, the company is already supplying specific products for the manufacture and assembly of zero- or lowemission vehicles. In collaboration with its customers it is taking a life cycle approach, building in end of life and parts reparability criteria into its designs.\n\nIn addition, CIE Automotive is working on a number of R&D projects together with other companies in its value chain with a view to reducing its environmental footprint. For\n\nexample, it is redesigning forged items to reduce their use of energy and extend the useful life of the machining tools. It is also redefining its packaging specifications so as to be able to use returnable cardboard boxes and introducing biomaterials and recycled plastic.\n\n#### **Membership of associations that champion climate neutrality**\n\nOn the institutional front, from the Management Board of Sernauto (Spain's automotive suppliers association), CIE Automotive is encouraging climate neutrality initiatives and is collaborating to set more ambitious targets in the sector.\n\nImage /page/144/Figure/3 description: The image shows a list of environmental protection measures. The list includes protecting the environment, fighting climate change, protecting people's health, using natural resources rationally, preventing the pollution of air, water and other natural resources, reducing carbon emissions, and protecting biodiversity, forests, rivers and oceans. On the left side of the image, there are some texts including Chairman and CEO's statement, 2023 highlights, Ready for change, Record earnings, Common responsibility, shared benefits, Our response to the environmental challenge, Responsible management, About this report, and Data tables.\n\nThe group is a founding partner of the Basque Ecodesign Center, where it collaborates with a number of government agencies and different industrial sectors to promote circularity, decarbonisation and climate action.\n\nCIE Automotive gets involved in new mobility solutions focused on zero-emissions vehicles from the earliest stages of development. As a result of this approach, it has been participating in Basquevolt, the Basque initiative for the production of solid-state batteries, since 2021.\n\nIt also belongs to Forética's Climate Change Cluster, a business platform whose mandate is to mainstream the main global climate change trends and debates in to the Spanish business community.\n\nLastly, it is a member of AEC, the Spanish Quality Association, which has a number of taskforces in the environmental area to influence the development of new legislation and provide guidelines and training to help Spanish industry manage climate change.\n\n#### **Involvement of senior management**\n\nThe company's Board of Directors and Management Committee are involved in the effort to fight climate change. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for activities related with the environment. The Board's ESG Committee is in charge of environmental issues. The chairwoman of this committee has climate change management experience and knowledge.\n\nThe company's CEO is engaged with the sustainable growth impetus and ultimately responsible for execution of the Strategic Plan, of which the ESG Plan is an integral part.\n\nThe Cross-Group ESG Committee reports and makes proposals to CIE Automotive's Board's ESG Committee. The HSEQ Director sits on the committee and manages the deployment of the environmental aspects of the Business Strategy. By bringing its engineering and environmental areas under the same Director, CIE Automotive ensures that all its environmental targets get analysed from the earliest phases of the research and development effort.\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/144/Picture/17 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The background is white, and there is a green triangle in the lower left corner of the image.\n\n# **Climate neutrality roadmap**\n\n**At the heart of CIE Automotive's environmental strategy lies the goal of achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions before 2050. The new roadmap, rolled out in 2023, sets overall targets for the medium and long term and the steps the factories need to take to achieve them. To become net zero it is vital to collaborate with the company's suppliers, an effort reinforced last year with the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero programme.** \n\nIn 2022, CIE Automotive took a qualitative leap in its climate change effort by endorsing the Paris Agreement, which commits it to setting a series of science-based environmental targets based on an ambitious long-term goal: generating net zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050, so contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5º C with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. The company has further committed to having the above-mentioned targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) to ensure they are based on science and aligned with the goal of keeping global warming within 1.5 o C.\n\nWith that end goal in mind, in 2023 the company embarked on a new environmental roadmap, approved by the Board of Directors in December 2022, which echoes and extends the targets set in its 2025 Business Plan and establishes the steps the factories need to take to achieve climate neutrality.\n\nTo deliver the commitment of having its medium-term targets certified by SBTi, the group needs to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by around 67% by 2035 and its Scope 3 emissions also by at least two-thirds, around 67%.\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready for change**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>Image /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" on the left side of the image.

The second icon has a lightning bolt symbol in a green circle in front of the building. The third icon has the letters \"R&D\" in a green circle in front of the building.\n\n#### **Compliance with standards and regulations**\n\nCIE Automotive stays ahead of and finances compliance with all climate change-related regulations in all of the countries it operates in by using outside consultants to keep it abreast of any regulatory developments that could affect its activities.\n\n#### **Budget earmarked to energy efficiency**\n\nEach factory's business plan includes a specific budget allocation for enhancing its approach to climate change, including energy efficiency.\n\nThere are currently 31 energy efficiency projects which are being tracked over the Intranet to ensure that the initiatives succeed.\n\n#### **Budget earmarked to low carbon products R&D**\n\nCIE Automotive has identified light-weighting, electrification and lower-carbon products during the production phase as the key demands coming from the market and its customers. Based on an analysis of those factors it has rolled out a portfolio of R&D projects and assigned them a specific budget.\n\n#### **Decarbonisation plans**\n\nWork has begun on drawing up decarbonisation plans factory by factory in order to ensure that all of CIE Automotive's policies, guidelines and commitments materialise at the operating level.\n\n#### **Environmental investments**\n\nThe new climate change strategy and the need to adapt the various facilities for new legislation country by country involves a series of investments and expenses.\n\nTo that end, in 2023, the company invested in minimising its environmental impact and in environmental protection and restoration work, in addition to incurring expenditure on waste removal and environmental consultancy, measurement and certification work.\n\nThe combined amounts of investments and expenses accrued in 2023 in relation to environmental protection work totalled €9.7 million (€11.6 million in 2022).\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/19 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The diagram includes the following elements: Eco-design, taking a life cycle approach; Eco-efficiency; Electrification of the vehicle fleet; Photovoltaic facilities; Use of recycled/secondary materials; Supply Chain Race 2 Zero; Improvement in the gross to net weight ratio; Reduced waste generation; Industry 4.0; Renewable electricity; and Replacement of forklifts.\n\n## To execute the environmental roadmap, **best practices from all regions were shared**\n\n### **Coordination**\n\nThe rollout of the new roadmap required an intense communication and coordination effort with all of the factories around the world. To ensure the company continues to hit its energy efficiency and emissions, water consumption and waste reduction targets, among others, the company presented the new roadmap and shared best environmental practices in all of its markets.\n\nAs is shown, energy measures are a core part of the work plan. From step one, eco-design, the idea is to reduce the use of materials and energy during the manufacturing process and the product's life.\n\nOne of the main focuses of introducing Industry 4.0 technology is to achieve energy efficiency and optimise processes. Logically, ecoefficiency is its own separate line of initiative.\n\nThe efforts to install photovoltaic power and electrify the company's fleet are similarly directed.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/10 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

According to its recent measurements, 80% of its carbon footprint stems from the raw materials it uses.\n\nTo address this issue, the company launched the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero initiative under which its suppliers share their emissions data and abatement efforts with CIE Automotive, while the company mentors them and provides them with technical solutions in the event of difficulties. The goal is to identify and anticipate potential technical barriers in the supply chain and set deadlines for shaping a decarbonised offering.\n\n*[Further information in Carbon footprint measurement and suppliers]*\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/16 description: The image shows a green truck with a plant symbol on its side.

The background is white.\n\n#### **Environmental performance awards**\n\nAmong the steps taken to galvanise the factories around achievement of climate neutrality, it is worth highlighting the newly created Environmental Awards. The goal is to reward the factories that stood out during the year for bringing down their emissions in\n\nline with the targets set in the 2025 Strategic Plan, inspiring others to join them in their decarbonisation pathways.\n\nA total of fourteen companies received awards in two categories.\n\nThe company did not receive any significant fines for non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations in 2023. Significant fines are those of €30,000 or more. In India, the group had to compensate for environmental impacts in the amount of INR 3,135 million (approximately €34,000)\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The reasons for not continuing downstream to the end of the products' useful life are multiple and are related with the supply and supplier structure in the automotive sector:\n\n- In most of our sales agreements with customers, it is the customer who is tasked with collecting the product at the CIE Automotive factory in question, using its own logistics flows, over which CIE Automotive has neither control, responsibility or information.\n- The OEMs work around platforms. In other words, a given part is used in different models, with different characteristics and, therefore, different emissions. In addition, a given part of the propulsion or transmission system is used in different models, making it impossible to determine its performance in use.\n- Lastly, the vehicles assembled by the OEMs are, often, supplied to different countries and markets with totally different end-of-life regulations and strategies. CIE Automotive has no control over that distribution and therefore is not able to calculate the footprint associated with this step in its products' life cycle.\n\nCIE Automotive's customers ask it for environmental footprint data up to the company's gates and include those figures in their full measurements with the rest of the downstream phases without any double counting.\n\nThe company uses the ReCIPE life cycle impact methodology to calculate its environmental footprint, to which end it is receiving assistance from the Basque regional government's environmental management company, IHOBE.\n\nWithin the universe of activities of each company, based on the assessment that their impact is smaller, the following aspects were excluded from the analysis:\n\n#### **Upstream**\n\n- Consumption at central/sales offices outside of manufacturing facilities.\n- Capital goods (vehicles, machinery, tools, etc.).\n- Displacement of employees to go to work.\n- Business travel.\n- Upstream assets leased.\n- Trips to the organisation by visitors or customers.\n\n#### **Downstream**\n\n- Transport and distribution.\n- Processing of products sold.\n- Use of products sold.\n- End-of-life treatment of products sold.\n- Assets leased in subsequent phases.\n- Franchises.\n- Investments.\n\n## To calculate the environmental footprint, **the company uses the ReCIPE methodology and has the collaboration of IHOBE**\n\nThe downstream exclusions are not really exclusions as they are not included in CIE Automotive's footprint scope (from cradle to gate) for the reasons itemised earlier and in order to prevent double counting by the customer, who is the party with the information and responsibility for the downstream phases of our production.\n\nThe company currently uses widely acknowledged databases such as Ecoinvent. For its electricity emissions factors, it uses updated databases in each country where it consumes electricity. One of the goals of the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project is to compile real information about each significant product or service directly from our suppliers. However, the large majority of our suppliers are not yet prepared to provide robust, real data that they can regularly update. Note that a one-off figure is not sufficient; supplier emissions information needs to be updated as they advance on their decarbonisation and emissions-abatement plans. This is part of the coaching and mentoring work we are doing under the umbrella of this supplier programme.\n\nIn 2023 surveys were undertaken in at least two factories per region in order to assess the volume of emissions associated with employee commutes to work. The analysis performed in 2023, such that the calculations are based on emissions data for 2022, indicate commute-related emissions ranging from 3.10% of the total in Europe to 0.11% in Asia.\n\n|   | Chairman<br>and<br>CEO's<br>statement             |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | 2023<br>highlights                                |\n| 2 | Ready<br>for change                               |\n| 3 | Record<br>earnings                                |\n| 4 | Common<br>responsibility,<br>shared benefits      |\n| 5 | Our response to<br>the environmental<br>challenge |\n| 6 | Responsible<br>management                         |\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/154/Picture/33 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Since 2021, the base year for comparative purposes, energy efficiency gains have reduced relative emissions by 52%,**  to 337,937.72 metric tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup>e per €1,000 **of revenue.**\n\nCIE Automotive's environmental management systems are based on the ISO 14001 standard and ensure pollution does not exceed the thresholds stipulated in prevailing regulations. To control pollution and make the company more efficient and competitive, it carries out audits and works to reduce energy consumption across its facilities.\n\nThe company includes environmental cost as a function of revenue as a key performance indicator in its global dashboard. That indicator includes the cost of emissions calculated in terms of emission allowances (EUA), even though the company does not participate in the global emission trading scheme.\n\nIn 2023, the company conducted energy audits at different factories, marking the first step in rationalising their real consumption levels, cutting nominal consumption levels using new technology and detecting incidents and inefficiencies.\n\nAn agreement has also been reached to certify factories in Europe, Asia and the Americas under ISO50001 so as to make energy efficiency a key component of the company's strategy.\n\nImage /page/155/Picture/19 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Specifically, it tackled a number of Industry 4.0 projects to boost energy efficiency and took steps to electrify its internal vehicles. It created an in-house taskforce to analyse the roadmap for\n\nreplacing natural gas at the furnaces used by CIE Automotive, some of the options being to replace gas-fired furnaces with electric furnaces or to use biogas, oxy-combustion or green hydrogen. It also looked at replacing gas heating with heat pumps or electric heating systems.\n\n*[For further information on energy consumption by region, refer to the detailed table provided in \"Data tables\"]*\n\n*The criteria used to calculate the percentage of renewable energy consumed was modified in 2023 to make it more restrictive: in markets with standardised and official guarantee of origin certificates, the percentages only include the renewable energy backed by such certificates, plus energy purchases under PPAs. and self-generation.*\n\n*(\\*) Includes emissions from discontinued German forging companies until June 30, 2023.*\n\n| Gigajoules                                                              | 2021         | 2022         | 2023*        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Direct energy<br>consumption                                            | 1,922,653.06 | 1,695,060.74 | 1,760,684.76 |\n| Indirect energy consumption from renewable<br>and non-renewable sources | 3,885,073.74 | 3,932,206.88 | 4,196,857.92 |\n| Indirect energy consumption from<br>non-renewable sources               | 1,971,005.79 | 1,695,803.31 | 1,816,574.38 |\n| Indirect energy consumption from renewable<br>sources                   | 1,914,067.96 | 2,236,403.56 | 2,380,283.54 |\n| TOTAL                                                                   | 5,807,726.80 | 5,627,267.62 | 5,957,542.68 |\n\n| CO2e ™                      | 2021       | 2022       | 2023*      |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Indirect emissions foregone | 139,340.49 | 216,814.45 | 228,707.23 |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record 2**\n\n**[earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/21 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In Spain, Portugal and Lithuania, 100% of the power consumed is green. In 2023 it forwent emissions equivalent to 228.707,23 CO2e ™ thanks to the purchase of power generated from renewable sources.\n\n### **Self-generation**\n\nFramed by that same goal or reducing harmful emissions and lowering its energy bills, the company is developing a number of selfgeneration projects in Europe and India by installing photovoltaic solar panels.\n\nIn India, the group is taking strategic steps to shore up its use of green energy. Since 2023, 63% of all the energy used at the factories in the Indian region of Maharashtra is solar power, thanks to CIE Automotive's investment in Strongsun Solar - for the supply of photovoltaic power to CIE India's forging division in Urse and its magnetic products division in Bhosari, respectively - and in INR, for supply to the forging division.\n\nNote also that in the state of Karnataka (India), where Bill Forge has its factories, around 85% of the energy consumed comes from green sources, specifically a mix of wind and sun.\n\n| Factory                                            | Country |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| CIE Aluminium Casting<br>Aurangabad plant 3 (HPDC) | IN      |\n| CIE Aluminium Casting Pantnagar<br>plant 1 (HPDC)  | IN      |\n| CIE India Composites Kanhe                         | IN      |\n| CIE India Forging Division (Pune)                  | IN      |\n| CIE India -

It is only contemplates offsets in the exceptional cases in which there is no technical alternative; for example, it purchases offsets from the airlines to mitigate the CO2 emissions associated with\n\nits business travel.\n\nNote that the commitments assumed and short- and medium-term targets set do not contemplate the company's carbon offsets.\n\n### **Noise pollution**\n\nNoise pollution can be a relevant issue, depending on factory technologies and locations. However, CIE Automotive's factories are located in industrial areas at a sufficient distance from residential districts so as not to pose a problem.\n\nLight pollution is not a relevant consequence of CIE Automotive's activities.\n\n### **Biodiversity**\n\nGiven that CIE Automotive carries out its business activities in industrial areas/estates, it believes that its impact on biodiversity is not significant and therefore not material for the purpose of the group's reporting effort. No information is therefore provided with respect to biodiversity in this report.\n\nHowever, in collaboration with the Basque Ecodesign Center, a project is underway to generate more advanced methodology for analysing biodiversity risks, which is expected to add value in 2025.\n\n**[for change](#page-15-0)**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready 1 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n160\n\nImage /page/159/Picture/17 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

In choosing materials, the company relies on guides and lessons learned and specifically complies with regulations regarding the labelling of polymeric materials to facilitate their sorting and recycling.\n\nImage /page/160/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram of a circular economy. The diagram has two main flows: a circular flow and a linear flow. The circular flow is represented by green arrows, and the linear flow is represented by gray arrows. The diagram also shows a company boundary, which is represented by an orange square. Inside the company boundary, there are three arrows: a green arrow representing circular inflow, a gray arrow representing linear inflow, and a black arrow representing waste. The diagram also shows the percentage of circular inflow, the percentage of recovery potential, and the percentage of actual recovery. The text in the image includes the following: \"CIRCULAR ECONOMY\", \"Circular inflow\", \"Linear inflow\", \"Non-renewable virgin resource\", \"Company boundary\", \"% circular inflow\", \"% recovery potential\", \"% actual recovery\", \"Circular outflow\", \"Linear outflow\", and \"Non-recoverable products and waste streams\".\n\nTo enhance its circular economy strategy, the 2025 Strategic Plan contemplates a series of circularity-specific KPIs, based on the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and its Circular Transition Indicators. The information gathered will tell the company, for example, how many times the water drawn gets used, which waste can be recycled and which cannot and what effects the factories' manufacturing activities have on biodiversity.\n\n*[For further information, refer to section eco-efficiency and circularity]*\n\n**CIE AUTOMOTIVE AND THE**\n\n**Production at CIE Automotive follows circular economy criteria: its products are designed with circularity in mind, resources are used efficiently and waste is minimised and recycled.

The use of water at its factories is not relevant by comparison with other manufacturing industries. Although the company has a clear commitment to reducing water consumption as a general KPI, the ratio of water consumption per product made is actually very low.\n\nIn order to minimise water discharges, the company has proprietary water treatment systems that enable its recirculation and recovery. The wastewater that reaches public treatment plants through wastewater pipes has therefore already been treated by the company.\n\nOne of the circular transition indicators calculated by CIE Automotive is the volume of water reused in the production facilities. That recirculation is concentrated primarily in the refrigeration circuits.\n\nWater consumption totalled 1,625,246.72 megalitres/year in 2023, and water intensity was 0.40, compared to 0.41 in 2022.\n\nThe CAPEX and OPEX related with water are very low and are not subject to any specific monitoring. However, the company does have several water minimisation projects underway in collaboration with customers, related for example with dry machining.\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/28 description: The image shows a partial view of a clock face with a hand pointing towards the upper right.

A good example of this practice is the concerted effort to reduce the gross weight of the products it makes. That effort translates into the use of fewer materials and lowers the generation of waste and consumption of energy and other products needed in the manufacturing process.\n\nAt present, 35% of the raw materials used by the group are recycled.\n\n### **Plastic**\n\nSome of the company's parts are made from thermoplastics (PP, PA, PC, ABS, PC/ABS, joints, etc.) and others, fewer, from thermostable plastics. The company also uses plastic to wrap its products In total, the company used 61,243.65 MT of plastic\\*.\n\nTo reduce the use of plastic in its packaging, the company is working on projects with its customers for the use of returnable boxes. These initiatives will be included in the companies' decarbonisation plans.\n\n#### **MATERIAL CONSUMPTION**\n\n*[For further information on consumption by region, refer to the detailed table provided in the \"Data tables and glossary\" appendix]*\n\n## To reduce the use of plastic in its packaging, the company is working on **projects for the use of returnable boxes**\n\n*(\\*) Includes emissions from discontinued German forging companies until June 30, 2023.*\n\nTo reduce the use of p\nthe\n**projects for the u**\n\n| Kg                      | 2021            | 2022            | 2023*           |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Raw materials used      | 1,448,043,709.2 | 1,230,298,192.7 | 1,532,506,681.7 |\n| Raw materials recovered | 1,230,298,192.7 | 551,193,852.4   | 417,722,719.8   |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/162/Picture/11 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

At the top is the \"Annual General Meeting\" which feeds into the \"Board of Directors\". The Board of Directors feeds into three committees: \"Appointments and Remuneration Committee\", \"Audit and Compliance Committee\", and \"ESG Committee (Environmental, Social and Governance)\". The ESG Committee and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee feed into the \"Chief Executive Officer\". The Chief Executive Officer feeds into the \"Executive Committee\" and the \"Cross-Group ESG Committee\". The Executive Committee and the Cross-Group ESG Committee feed into \"CIE Automotive\". CIE Automotive is fed by \"Network Services + Business units\". The diagram also includes \"Authorisation and reporting\", \"Implementation\", \"Policy\", \"Environmental Risks\", and \"Performance monitoring\". The diagram also includes a list of items: \"Chairman and CEO's statement\", \"2023 highlights\", \"Ready for change\", \"Record earnings\", \"Common responsibility, shared benefits\", \"Our response to the environmental challenge\", \"Responsible management\", \"About this report\", and \"Data tables\". The diagram also includes a list of KPIs: \"KPIs\", \"Environmental footprint\", \"ISO standard\", and \"Decarbonisation guidelines\".\n\nIt shows how the regime involves every part of the company, from the company's shareholders to the business units. The details of the system and how it works are set down in the regulations of the Board and its committees, including the ESG Committee, which are available for public consultation on the company's website, within the corporate governance section.\n\nThis governance model is the upper layer in the climate risk management model described next.\n\nImage /page/168/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Specifically, in 2023, the company assessed 12 risks, gathering input from\n\n145 professionals in total.\n\nThe climate risk map is integrated within CIE Automotive's enterprise risk management (ERM) system, which follows ISO 31000 methodology, so as to provide reasonable assurance that all significant climate risks are duly identified, evaluated, prevented and continuously monitored. Those risks are approved at the board level and managed in keeping with defined risk\n\ntolerance thresholds.\n\nThe climate risk assessment contemplates transition and physical risks and also focuses on the opportunities that climate change could generate.\n\nThe accompanying chart depicts the classification of risks and opportunities considered in this process so that they can be assessed, including their financial impact, and subsequently managed and mitigated. The\n\nprocess of measuring the financial impact of these risks is currently under development so as to cater to the needs and requirements brought to us by our stakeholders in recent years and those we expect to face in the coming years.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/169/Picture/19 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" with a quotation mark above it.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/170/Figure/19 description: The image is a diagram illustrating a risk assessment process. It starts with \"Regulations\" and \"Analysis\" (split into \"Internal\" and \"External\"), both feeding into a \"Risk list\". A table labeled \"SCENARIOS\" with columns \"OPTIM\", \"MED\", and \"PESSIM\" and rows for the years 2020, 2030, and 2050 is connected to the \"Risk list\". The \"Risk list\" also connects to \"Variable\" (Transition Physical), which in turn leads to \"Risks\" (Transition Physical). \"Governance\" is positioned at the top, influencing the \"Variable\". Several factors feed into \"Governance\", including \"IPCC\", \"WWF\", \"AIE\", \"Internal\", and \"Regulatory\". \"Sector\" (with \"Sernauto\", \"ACICAE\", \"S&P IHS\", and \"EGVIA\"), \"GDP\" (with \"Car ownership\", \"Exchange rate\", \"Age of vehicle fleet\", and \"Purchasing power\"), and \"Studies\" (Public and private in collaboration with anlaysts) also feed into \"Governance\". \"Governance\" also influences \"Opportunities\". The \"Risks\" branch out into two paths: one involving \"Key individual\", \"Weighting\", \"Map\", and \"Mitigation measures\", and another involving \"Key individual\", \"Weighting\", \"Map\", and \"Mitigation measures\", as well as \"Exposure + Vulnerability\", \"Adaptability\", \"Risk ranking\", \"Financial impact\", and \"Under development\". Text at the bottom provides definitions for \"IPCC\", \"WWF\", \"IEA\", and \"GDP\".\n\nThe risk and opportunity assessment process is depicted schematically in the chart above. It shows the types of physical and transition risks, the method used to identify risks and how they are modelled for different scenarios.\n\nThose scenarios cover quantitative variables, such as the trend in GDP by country, car ownership indices and S&P IHS production data in the case of transition risks. They also contemplate qualitative variables. Other quantitative variables such as temperature changes, heat stress, changes in precipitation types and patterns (rain, hail, snow and ice) and water stress are used for physical and transition risks but are more important to the former.\n\nThe scenarios contemplate time horizons that start from current data or from 2020 in the absence of more recent data and run to 2030 and 2050, the deadline by which CIE Automotive has pledged to be climate neutral.\n\nThe process also considers qualitative variables derived from sector analyses and studies sourced from organisations such as ACICAE, SERNAUTO and EGVIA, and from public and private studies by different consultancy firms and analysts who collaborate with CIE Automotive.\n\nBased on this information, the Environment Department selects and describes the risks identified as most material for the company. The entire process is supervised by the governance layer outlined above.\n\nTo categorise the risks, the organisation identifies key individuals with different backgrounds and duties and deep knowledge and involvement at the local or factory levels and at the country or regional levels and at the overall group level. Once the weightings are applied, the climate risk map takes shape *[refer to section \"Climate risks evaluated in 20223\"]* and the corresponding mitigation\n\nmeasures are presented and duly and coherently associated with the Strategic Plan, which is available on the website in both standard format and in the form of streamed presentation by management.\n\nA detailed procedure is being drawn up for tackling physical risks so as to consider exposure and vulnerability separately (this aspect was prioritised in 2023). Adaptability criteria will be layered in subsequently to create a ranking of risks and the last step will be to assess the financial impact of the various climate risks. Note that the financial impact assessment aspect has yet to be comprehensively regulated so that this process will also need to factor in the definitive regulations.\n\nChairman and CEO's\n\n[statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\nImage /page/170/Figure/7 description: The image shows the number 5 in gray on the left side of the image.

The process begins with two types of variables: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative variables include GDP, car ownership, S&P IHS, age of vehicle fleet, and purchasing power. Qualitative variables include the world is changing, the automotive world is changing, and the world of suppliers is changing. The variables feed into risk variables, which then feed into weighting at CIE Central. The output of weighting at CIE Central is a risk assessment matrix, which plots probability against impact. The matrix is divided into three zones: low risk, medium risk, and high risk. The risk assessment matrix is used to determine the financial impact and risk mitigation strategies. The process is overseen by governance, which is informed by the divisional, CEO, and strategic plan.\n\nThe transition risk assessment is based on an internal and external context analysis. This analysis considers qualitative and quantitative variables, the latter mostly external. The qualitative factors analysed were classified as follows:\n\n- The world is changing\n- The automotive world is changing\n- The supplier world is changing\n\nThis is evident in the 2025 Strategic Plan documents and in section 2.1 of this report, where the associated opportunities are also analysed.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/18 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

As a result, some technologies could lose share in the overall business mix, potentially intensifying competition for the remaining volumes and, by extension, driving a reduction in volumes or margins in certain products or technologies.\n\nIt is still too early to tell when the automotive sector will revisit prepandemic production and sales levels, all the more so considering the various market developments mentioned throughout this report and the fact that market changes are currently unfolding with such great speed. The company plans to reinforce the flexibility of its model to adapt to unfolding and future customer needs and emerging trends. Product portfolio diversification will give it a unique ability to adapt relative to its competitors. A portfolio in which more than eight out of every 10 products are independent of a vehicle's propulsion system and therefore not impacted by the sector electrification trend. For the rest of its parts, the company is working from the technological and market standpoints to make the most of the opportunities emerging in the battery, engine/motor, power electronics and gearshift areas. As for the risk associated with products for which there is no clear substitute in zero-emission cars, CIE Automotive plans to increase its presence in those that have a bigger role to play in the vehicle light-weighting trend (forged chassis and suspension parts) and in machined shafts and gears. It also wants to actively pursue business in technologies that customers are likely to outsource in order to focus on new challenges, such as connectivity, automated driving and the provision of embedded software solutions. In parallel, the company will continue to focus on its innovation effort in these same areas which is expected to give the company a winning edge in the coming years, positioning it to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate the resulting market. The transition towards a low-carbon economy will highlight the efforts companies like CIE Automotive have been making for years to introduce eco-design concepts from the earliest stages of product development\n\nand build circularity into all of their processes. What does look likely is that over a medium-term horizon the automotive companies stand to emerge stronger from the crisis to the extent they can adapt to the new scenario, foreseeably characterised by the following factors, on which CIE Automotive is already specifically working:\n\n• Concentration processes: fewer players but companies that are larger, more diversified and more resilient in the face of future\n\n- Reduction of surplus capacity.\n- crises.\n- prepare for sector transformation.\n- Greater financial control and discipline.\n- Eco-efficiency and circularity.\n- Commitment to mitigating environmental impacts.\n\n• Strategic alliances designed to share the investment needed to\n\nCIE Automotive's business model has already proven its resilience and counter-cyclical credentials in the face of numerous crises thanks to the combination of geographic, technological and customer diversification, framed by a decentralised management model and strict financial discipline. Lastly, in the shorter term, the company is currently focused on locking in access to the raw materials it needs, to which end it is reinforcing its GLOCAL (global management with local application) purchasing model, coupled with its multi-location footprint, to be close to the OEMs and not have to depend on global supply chains.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n> **Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/17 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Next to the icon are the words \"INVESTMENT RISKS\" and \"TECHNOLOGY RISKS\".\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/25 description: The image shows a green icon with a triangle containing an exclamation point, and a speedometer. To the right of the icon is the text \"ACUTE RI\".\n\nRisks associated with greater uncertainty regarding returns on investment: the changes needed to achieve carbon neutrality could spell higher investments in different volume and margin scenarios to those navigated to date. Those investments may make it possible to process more sustainable materials, use more sustainable and climate-neutral sources of energy, devise more circular manufacturing processes or deliver parts with better eco-design and sustainability attributes. Manufacturing technology is what CIE Automotive does. That is why it is essential to monitor how it evolves, that being one of the most recurring and important tasks performed by each division. Thanks to that constant monitoring, the company sees a bright future for the technologies it is active in. In some of those technologies, the challenge lies with taking advantage of the growth opportunities being thrown up by emerging trends; in others, they key lies with maximising competitiveness by leveraging innovation, Industry 4.0 tools and the cost efficiency that sets the group apart. In sum, to turn the risk posed by new trends into an opportunity to attain leadership.\n\nIn all areas of the group, CIE Automotive implements cuttingedge technology into its facilities and management models with the aim of rendering its productive processes more efficient and responding to the automotive sector's needs by embracing ecoefficiency, circularity and climate mitigation measures. Also as a result of that monitoring, when designing its investment plans, the company contemplates the various trends that are shaping the automotive sector, such as emission standard requirements, new\n\ncomfort-driven mobility concepts and vehicle electrification. To fund those investments in R&D, to which the group earmarks around 2% of revenue each year, CIE Automotive has a number of different sources of financing at the regional, national and supranational levels. Moreover, the company hopes to avail of Next Generation EU funds to finance specific projects related with green transition and digital transformation, specifically including projects to develop new battery structure, fuel cell and range extender concepts and materials; new concepts and features related with the refashioning of car interiors, led by the CIE Comfort division; and certain Industry 4.0 projects.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\n**ACUTE RISKS** These risks arise as a result of extreme climate events (such as prolonged droughts or flooding).\n\nThe risk of accidents is covered by the company's civil liability insurance. In December 2019, the company began to specifically underwrite gradual pollution risk for certain factories in Spain, with a claims limit of €3 million. To reinforce the management of its environmental and safety risks, the company has embarked on a joint project with the technical experts from its insurance firms. Specifically, a series of risks are being evaluated and monitored in accordance with criteria established by the various participating companies with the idea of formulating plans for their elimination or at least mitigation.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n- **Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n- **Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n- **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Each factory has a box plot showing the range of temperatures. The box plots are colored in black, gray, and orange.\n\n**CHRONIC RISKS**\n\nThese are the risks of more gradual changes with long-lasting effects, such as global warming, rising sea levels, protracted heatwaves or droughts, loss of biodiversity and changes in land or soil productivity.\n\nThis is another example of the utility provided by quantitative variables: the chart depicts the change in temperature in our locations, on average and at the extremes (2 metres above ground).\n\n> CIE Automotive has set specific environmental targets to be met by each of its facilities and\n\noperating regions. Those targets are aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda and recent Spanish legislation on climate change and the energy transition (Law 7/2021, of 20 May 2021) and are based\n\non the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. In addition, in support of the Paris Agreement's targets for curbing global warming, it belongs to Forética's Climate Change Cluster, a platform whose mission is to get Spanish businesses to address the main global climate change trends and debates and become an authority on corporate environmental matters.\n\n**Action plan** \n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/11 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The world map is a heat map, with areas colored from yellow to red, indicating varying levels of intensity. The line graphs each display three lines labeled 'Min', 'Average', and 'Max' from 2020 to 2050. The Optimistic Pathway graph has green lines, the Current Trend Pathway graph has orange lines, and the Pessimistic Pathway graph has red lines. All three graphs have a y-axis ranging from 0 to 6.\n\n**WATER STRESS RISKS**\n\nRisks that affect the availability of water for production processes, i.e., the possibility that, given the availability of water, there could be a shortage for manufacturing and auxiliary processes (cooling, cleaning, etc.). Climate change in particularly vulnerable areas could lead to chronic water stress, impeding access to quality water.\n\nThis risk is a clear example of how new variables can inject robustness into our assessment: using the WWF tool (*https://riskfilter.org/water/home*), we were able to analyse the physical risk scenarios related with water. Below is the risk weighting for CIE Automotive's sites for a combination of physical risks: water scarcity, flooding, water quality, and ecosystem services status.\n\nThe chart above shows the trend in this risk over time in three scenarios: the optimistic pathway, the current pathway and the pessimistic pathway.\n\nThe company has analysed the situation across its various factories and at the water basins near their locations. In addition, in order to increase circularity, particularly with respect to the use of water,\n\neach factory has launched initiatives to reduce the use of water and increase its reuse by installing filtering and treatment facilities, some of which have resulted in drastic improvements in circularity.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\n**2050 HORIZON**\n\nCurrent pathway trend.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/181/Picture/19 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

These tests are in turn complemented and rounded out by the universe of corporate policies approved at the Board level.\n\nCIE Automotive reviews its rules and regulations regularly in order to keep them aligned with the securities market regulator's requirements and recommendations, prevailing legislation and best practices in the corporate governance field. In 2023, it modified the Whistleblowing Channel Rules to facilitate the notification of breaches and guarantee the confidentiality of whistleblowers, in line with new legislation, and updated its Director Remuneration Policy to align it with market trends.\n\nTowards the end of 2023, it also embarked on a project to enable it to comply with all of the parameters proposed by Transparency International Spain (the leading organisation in transparency) in the areas of compliance, anti-corruption and good governance, a task that involves changes in the following areas:\n\n- The Whistleblowing Channel and system at the global level, in accordance with Law 2/2023 in Spain, with the goal of establishing a common system for all group companies, albeit with scope for catering to idiosyncratic circumstances in appendices.\n- The criminal risk map and the criminal risk, fraud and corruption prevention policies.\n- A new basic anti-trust guide.\n- Identification and introduction of a range of recommendations for preventing the various kinds of harassment.\n- Review and improvement where necessary of the corporate governance policies and ESG.\n\nIn parallel, the controls over the risk management system were revised, expanding the risk map with input from a\n\nBoth the rules and regulations formulated by the group and its Annual Corporate Governance Reports and Annual Director Remuneration Reports are published on the corporate website, in keeping with the technical and legal formalities and specifications stipulated by Spain's securities market regulator, the CNMV, in Circular 3/2015 (of 23 June 2015).\n\nhigher number of professionals. Lastly, the company deployed its criminal risk map in new markets, including Italy, Romania and Slovakia, and carried out its criminal risk assessment in Portugal, leaving only preparation of the country's criminal risk map outstanding for early 2024.

Two are executive directors, three are independent and nine are proprietary.\n\nThe balance between independent and proprietary directors in the boardroom is correlated with the breakdown between floating capital (in the hands of ordinary shareholders) and stable capital (shares held by significant shareholders). The independent directors chair and represent the majority of members of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the ESG Committee.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\nImage /page/189/Picture/11 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Although that percentage has been increasing in recent years with the newest additions, the company has yet to reach the 40% recommended in the Code of Good Governance for Listed Companies.\n\nTwelve of the directors are Spanish and two are Indian.\n\n### **Board functioning**\n\nThe Board of Directors' modus operandi is set down in the company's Articles of Association and Board Regulations. In 2023, the Board of Directors met on 6 occasions and all the meetings were presided by its Chairman.\n\n#### **Audit and Compliance Committee**\n\nComprised of five members (three independent directors and two proprietary directors), this committee's purview is to oversee the financial and non-financial reporting process and ensure the independence and effectiveness of the internal audit function. Its duties include revising the internal control and financial, tax and non-financial risk management systems, selecting, appointing and replacing the auditor and taking receipt of information from the auditor, whose independence it must safeguard..\n\nThis committee held 5 meetings in 2023.\n\n#### **Appointments and Remuneration Committee**\n\nMade up of four directors (three independent and one proprietary), this committee is tasked, among other duties, with formulating and reviewing the criteria for selecting director candidates, evaluating the directors' performance, proposing and monitoring the director remuneration system, in particular the amounts of their annual pay, and overseeing new director selection procedures.\n\nIt met on 4 occasions in 2023.\n\n#### **ESG Committee**\n\nThis committee is made up of five members (three independent directors and two proprietary directors) and its mission is to push through CIE Automotive's ESG strategy.\n\nIt met on 3 occasions in 2023.\n\nTo optimise its efficiency, the Board of Directors organises its work through committees.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/190/Picture/17 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The quality and efficiency of the functioning of the Board\n- 2. Boardroom composition\n- 3. The composition and functioning of the Board committees\n- 4. ESG aspects\n- 5. Communication policy\n- 6. Succession planning\n- 7. The performance of the Chairman and CEO\n- 8. The performance and contribution of each director\n- 9. Other aspects\n\nThe assessment report compiled in January 2023 by the appraiser Evaluación de Consejos (EdC) (whose methodology and findings were outlined in detail in the 2022 Annual Report) concluded that the aggregate quantitative results indicated strong satisfaction with the performance of the Board of Directors and its committees, higher than the average at similar companies. The individual areas identified in the report as presenting more room for improvement, even though the results were better than are customary for comparable companies, were:\n\n- Succession planning\n- Communication policy\n\nThe findings of that report were shared with the Board of Directors during its meeting on 24 February 2023, as a result of which the CEO was put in charge of the company's communication policy. In addition, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee drew up CIE Automotive, S.A.'s Succession and Contingency Plan for submission to the Board of Directors for approval. That plan was approved by the Board of Directors on 14 December 2023.\n\nElsewhere, the Lead Independent Director, duly exercising her duties, communicated constantly with the rest of the independent directors throughout the year, echoing any concerns they had and sharing them with the Chairman or Vice Chairman.\n\nIn 2023 the company also focused on director training around sustainability matters in general, governance and the latest reporting, taxonomy and environmental regulations, without neglecting company issues. A specific session was provided to all members of the Board, another more generalist session was given online to the entire organisation, including the directors, and the members of the ESG Committee, along with the members of the Cross-Group ESG Committee received a separate exclusive session. All of which in line with the company's commitment to making firm progress on integrating these aspects into its business model and corporate strategy.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The goal of the new text is once again to ensure that the remuneration earned by CIE Automotive's directors is proportionate to the dedication and responsibilities assumed and aligned with market practices at comparable companies in Spain and abroad and with the long-term interests of all of the company's shareholders.\n\n#### **Director remuneration**\n\nAlthough the new Director Remuneration Policy is similar in structure to the outgoing policy, there have been a few changes. The terms of the long-term bonus tied to the company's share price performance accrued by the CEO have been adjusted to reflect the radical change in the socio-economic context and the company's share price performance since 2018, when the bonus was approved.\n\nThe Director Remuneration Policy stipulates that the fixed annual stipend for directors shall only be paid to non-executive directors that are particularly dedicated to the company, i.e., the chairman of the Board of Directors and the independent directors. The ceiling on director remuneration was increased at the 2023 AGM.\n\nAs under the outgoing policy, the full-time executive directors' remuneration regime is similar to that of the company's executives. Their remuneration comprises: fixed remuneration, a short-term, results-based bonus and, in the case of the CEO, a longterm bonus, conditional upon staying in the post for 10 years. The executive directors may also receive in-kind remuneration in the form of use of a company car.\n\nThe remuneration earned by the executive directors varies along with their responsibilities and the specific characteristics of the duties they perform and is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors at the recommendation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nIt is up to the Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee (based on prior verification of attainment of the established targets), to determine the level of delivery of the short-term bonuses and their amount.\n\nThe executive directors' remuneration may be topped up by health and life insurance, in line with market practice at comparable companies in terms of market capitalisation, size, ownership structure and international presence.\n\nIt should be noted that the variable remuneration of the group formed by the most important members of the Group's management includes a % of it linked to ESG performance. This group is included in Note 22 \"Expenses for employee benefits\" of the 2023 Consolidated Annual Accounts, as beneficiaries of a long-term incentive.\n\nhttps://\n\nFor further details, refer to the notes headed Employee benefits expense and Related-party transactions in the group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 and to the 2023 Annual Director Remuneration Report and the Remuneration Policy itself, all of which are published on the corporate website:\n\n|      | Total no. of people        | Men | Average remuneration € | Women | Average remuneration € |\n|------|----------------------------|-----|------------------------|-------|------------------------|\n| 2022 | Directors* 6               | 3   | 2,751,906              | 3     | 100,000                |\n|      | Key management personnel 9 | 5   | 1,607,112              | 4     | 480,214                |\n| 2023 | Directors* 6               | 3   | 8,494,919              | 3     | 100,000                |\n|      | Key management personnel 9 | 5   | 1,112,086              | 4     | 383,883                |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/198/Picture/17 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

In 2023 the company enhanced its Whistleblowing Channel by implementing a notification platform on its website so that whistleblowers can communicate possible breaches in a confidential manner.

All of its employees are required to familiarise themselves with it and failure to comply with it can lead to penalties, as prescribed under applicable legislation.\n\nAside from its employees, the company expects its business partners (joint venturers, suppliers, customers, contractors and other partners) to align their behaviour with the Code of Professional Conduct and apply equivalent standards of ethics to those upheld by CIE Automotive.\n\nThe Code of Professional Conduct itself contemplates how its implementation should be supervised and how to proceed in the event of breaches. Specifically, it tasks the Board of Director's ESG Committee with due oversight of implementation of the Code of Professional Conduct and details how to make enquiries and report improprieties and breaches through the Whistleblowing Channel.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\nImage /page/200/Picture/10 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In 2023 it reinforced this internal reporting channel by integrating an IT platform into its corporate website to secure the reporting process and simplify case management by the company.\n\nThis cutting-edge platform is user-friendly and available in all the languages of the company's markets. If gives users the possibility of opening up a secure communication channel for filing a report and providing additional information in different formats (in writing, voice messages, etc.). All of the information is confidential and if the whistleblower so wishes, anonymous.\n\nThe new online channel meets all the stipulations of Spanish Law 2/2023, of 20 February 2023, on the protection of persons reporting regulatory breaches and incidents of corruption and aligned with applicable international legal requirements derived from the European Whistleblowing Directive.\n\nAdaptation for this new piece of legislation has involved modification of the Whistleblowing Channel Rules, which set down the system's general principles and procedures.\n\nIn 2023 the company received 56 complaints through its Whistleblowing Channel, 21 more than in 2022. Those complaints were related with:\n\n- People management with respect to work scheduling for everyday factory work purposes (20 complaints).\n- Workplace harassment (16): inappropriate attitudes on the part of managers vis-a-vis factory workers.\n- Fraud and corruption (seven): malpractice at several factories by procurement, engineering and production staff who breached CIE Automotive's general purchasing terms for their own benefit. Although the amounts involved were not material and the scale of the contracts with the suppliers in question did not have a material impact on earnings at the factories involved, the events harmed the group's image and violated its ethics commitment.\n- Breach of the Code of Professional Conduct (six): failure on the part of certain employees to uphold the rules of conduct.\n- Business management (four): related with the company's dealings with its stakeholders.\n- Discrimination (two): failure to guarantee equal opportunities.\n- Sexual harassment (one): inappropriate attitudes on the part of managers vis-a-vis factory workers.\n\nIn 2022, by comparison, the reports were related with workplace harassment (13), people management with respect to work scheduling (nine), fraud and corruption (five), sexual harassment (three), business management (two), breaches of the Code of Professional Conduct (two) and discrimination (one).\n\nIn all of the cases reported in 2023 and notified to the ESG Committee, the opportune actions were taken to analyse, monitor and remedy or close the cases.\n\nThose actions included nine dismissals: three related with the cases of fraud and corruption reported, two with the Code of Professional Conduct breaches, two with the business management cases, as well as one person who participated in the workplace harassment cases and one person involved in the discrimination reports.\n\nIn addition, executives and HR professionals intervened to address the workplace and sexual harassment and discrimination reports and prevent their recurrence via enhanced education on the company's values and Code of Professional Conduct rules.\n\nChairman\n\nand CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 1 2 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/201/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Those policies are binding upon all members of the organisation. These policies were approved by the Board of Directors for the first time in December 2015 and revised, updated and reapproved between 2019 and February 2021. In 2023 the company approved a new Director Remuneration Policy, which is in force until 2026, and at year-end was immersed in the process of reviewing and updating the universe of corporate policies comprising its ethics framework, which is nearly complete and will finalise when the updated policies are presented to the Board of Directors for approval in early 2024.\n\nAll of CIE Automotive's corporate policies can be accessed via the corporate website.\n\n**[shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, 1 2 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\nImage /page/202/Picture/20 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

That commitment is tangible in its endorsement of the ten principles enshrined in the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nIn addition to the Code of Professional Conduct, whose calls for tackling fraud and corruption, the company has an official Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Policy which stipulates that dealings with public officials and authorities must be governed by the principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, impartiality and lawfulness.\n\nThe company is politically neutral and does not finance, either directly or indirectly, political parties or their representatives or candidates, either in Spain or abroad.\n\nOne of the Internal Audit Department's duties is to oversee that the group companies are operating lawfully and in keeping with the defined corporate values.\n\nAs was the case in 2022, no public legal cases were brought against the organisation or its employees in relation with corruption in 2023.\n\n#### **Measures to combat money laundering**\n\nThe group introduced its Corporate Crime Prevention Model in 2015 and updated it in October 2019 to introduce a Support Unit with independent intervention and control powers within the organisation, whose mandate is to oversee compliance therewith. The company leverages that model to articulate its effort to thwart money laundering, as well as providing training on the Code of Professional Conduct and application of the various corporate policies.\n\nIn order to prevent or minimise the probability of occurrence of inappropriate or illicit conduct and ensure that any such conduct is brought to a halt, if detected, and accountability duly sought, in 2021, CIE Automotive drew up a Compliance and Criminal Risk Prevention Policy.\n\n### **Measures to prevent corruption and bribery**\n\nEach country has its own local Corporate Crime Prevention Manual, which is aligned with the corporate version.\n\nEvery time the criminal risk map is introduced to a new market, specific training is provided to brief employees about the company's policies and procedures and remind the factories about applicable local legislation.\n\nIn 2023 the company deployed its criminal risk map in new markets, specifically Italy, Romania and Slovakia. The year before it had extended the map to Spain, France and Germany, in Europe, and to India, and completed the annual updates of its risk maps in the US, Mexico, Brazil, China and the Czech Republic, thus completing coverage of the countries that account for the bulk of the group's business activities. CIE Automotive, S.A. is committed to complying stringently with anti-trust law. To that end is promises to achieve its business objectives by ethical, legitimate, faultless and lawful means, complying with all applicable laws. CIE Automotive did not receive any fines related with anti-trust infringements or derived from cartel operations, price-setting, exclusivity agreements, monopolistic practices or other\n\nIn 2023, following updates to local legislation in some of the company's business markets, new crimes, such as attacks on moral integrity, were added to the maps.\n\n#### **Anti-trust law**\n\nconduct that could limit free competition in 2023.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/203/Picture/25 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

These risks, which are approved at the Board level, are managed in keeping with defined risk appetite and tolerance thresholds.\n\nThe ERM, framed by the Risk Control and Management Policy, follows ISO 31000 methodology and is supervised by the Board of Directors, which delegates its supervision and correct functioning in its Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThanks to the unflagging support of the senior executives and management team, and underpinned by rigorous strategic planning, CIE Automotive seeks to create an environment conducive to working with risks in check. The goal is to manage these risks actively with the aim of, by means of correct management and value creation, allowing new opportunities to rise.\n\nImage /page/206/Figure/16 description: The image shows four triangular icons, each paired with a text description.

Below the title is a line graph in orange, and the text \"CHANGE IN MARKET TRENDS\".\n\nThe automotive industry is undergoing disruptive changes for which the company needs to be prepared by maintaining the flexibility required to adapt to customers' unfolding or future demands, suppliers' needs and increasingly stringent regulations.\n\nNew automotive technologies (e.g. in the area of connectivity and autonomous driving) are reducing demand for some of our core products while creating demand for new systems and parts.\n\n*[For more detailed information about the key market trends, refer to chapter 2. Sector background]*\n\nThroughout the pages of this report, the reader has been told about CIE Automotive's distinctive\n\nbusiness model which has proven highly consistent in dynamic and challenging environments over the past several years and is expected to remain similarly resilient in the face of the challenges that loom. The key to tackling the current trend shifts lies with coordinating all of the group's departments end to end. The unit that handles R&D and market studies analyses the trends that are shaping the sector exhaustively and continually (for more information, refer to chapter 2.1.3) and shares its findings with the sales area and the various divisions. That enables an informed assessment of their potential impact and formulation of the action plans that the company has been feeding into its strategic plans since 2015. That assessment also factors in the challenges highlighted in chapter 2, specifically:\n\n- Economic slowdown.\n- Increase in borrowing costs.\n- Significant CAPEX in EVs.\n- Price war in EVs.\n\nThis process also taps the opportunities itemised in that same chapter.\n\nCollaboration on R&D projects, sometimes on a standalone basis and other times in partnership with customers, has proven crucial in areas such as electrification, the circular economy, vehicle light-weighting,\n\nsafety and Industry 4.0. These projects have led to major collaboration with traditional customers and kept the company aligned with market trends. In tandem the sales area has worked intensely to penetrate the sector's newcomers, adapting its approach to their idiosyncrasies. This effort has paid off with the company already producing at scale for customers with business models that are radically different from those of its traditional customer base and new developments in the pipeline.\n\nThe company has also responded proactively to the growing importance of climate action, as is evident in its unification of the engineering and environmental departments. As a result it now builds sustainability, decarbonisation, circular economy and ecodesign considerations in at the earliest stages of new product and project development.\n\nCIE Automotive constantly reinforces the flexibility of its model characterised by geographical, customer and technology diversification - to adapt to its customers' current and future needs and emerging automotive trends. Portfolio diversification, with over 80% of products independent of the vehicle propulsion system, gives it an ability to adapt that sets it apart from its competitors.\n\nIn terms of the risk associated with products with no clear substitute in zero-emission vehicles, the company is looking to increase its presence in areas that make a significant contribution to vehicle light-weighting such as forged chassis and suspension parts. It also plans to focus on axle and gear machining and to outsource traditional technologies in order to free up resources to focus on new challenges such as connectivity, autonomous driving and software solutions.\n\n### **Action plan**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/211/Picture/29 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" with a quotation mark above it.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nCIE Automotive has set itself annual sales targets with a specific focus on new-energy vehicles (NEV). The 2025 Strategic Plan focuses on comfort, tapping the growing importance of this feature in users' buying decisions.\n\nThe company has invested in employee training and skill-building in order to tackle the sector's digitalisation and is working with technology firms and training centres to attract talent with these skillsets. It is also worth highlighting the boost given to the training area within the Pilot Testing Advanced Manufacturing Taskforce led by the Basque regional government.\n\nCIE Automotive stands out for its commitment to decarbonisation and circularity in all processes, aligning itself with the push for a more sustainable economy. Its Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project is working to help decarbonise the supply chain and achieve net zero\n\nemissions by 2050.\n\nCIE Automotive's business model, underpinned by its geographic diversity and decentralised management model, has proven its resilience throughout a succession of crises. The company engages its entire supply chain, detecting opportunities with customers and bringing those needs and opportunities to its suppliers.\n\nIn the near term it is focused on ensuring a smooth supply of raw materials, reinforcing its GLOCAL (global management with local application) procurement model and continuing with its multilocation footprint so as to reduce dependence on global supply chains and stay close to the OEMs.\n\n**FINANCIAL**\n\n**RISK**\n\nThe group's business activities expose it to various types of financial risk: market risk (including exchange rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk.\n\n> The group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial\n\nmarkets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The group arranges derivative financial instruments to hedge certain exposures.\n\nIn the broadest sense, financial risk management is designed to control exposure to variations in interest and exchange rates and commodity prices. This effort, supervised by the group's Finance Department,\n\ntranslates into the purchase of financial instruments that allow it, to the extent possible, benefit from favourable movements in exchange and interest rates while limiting some or all of its exposure to unfavourable developments.\n\n*[For further information, refer to the group's consolidated financial statements and directors' report for the year ended 31 December* \n\n*2023]*\n\n**Action plan** \n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\nImage /page/212/Picture/24 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The integration of new firms into the group requires an initial effort in order to adjust their respective cultures and ways of doing things to align them with CIE Automotive's management methods and profitability thresholds. In addition, the fact of having local partners (joint ventures and/or alliances with private and public companies and organisations) could generate conflict and wariness that can affect business performance directly or generate international compliance vulnerabilities.\n\n> CIE Automotive works hard to embed its business model and corporate culture at newly\n\n- \n- acquired companies. The most noteworthy initiatives on this front include:\n- Involving the management team in M&A transactions.\n\n• Defining and implementing a clear management model designed to enable the company to assume\n\n- control over new acquirees rapidly.\n- \n\n• Fostering the readiness and availability of key internal managers to tackle new integrations.\n\n2023 once again showed how a long list of potential external shocks, ranging from extreme meteorological phenomena, inflation fuelled by energy price volatility and migratory and demographic challenges, to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tensions between the US and China, expose governments to litany of risks they may not be ready to handle amidst social and institutional weaknesses.\n\nStates under financial pressure as a result of the above-listed shocks could seek budget balance by passing laws and introducing levies to stem their fiscal deficits. Those forces are pushing interest rates and inflation higher, affecting GDP and employment and, as a result, the population's purchasing power and access to credit, ultimately denting consumer spending and the purchase of cars.\n\n**MANAGEMENT OF M&A-LED GROWTH GEOPOLITICAL RISK** Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nFurthermore, in a new global geopolitical order, legal and compliance teams will be forced to deal across borders with regulatory requirements that are ambiguous, and/or conflicting, and/or uneconomical.\n\n> The company is focused on locking in access to the raw materials it needs, to which end it is reinforcing\n\nits GLOCAL (global management with local application) purchasing model, coupled with its multi-location footprint, to be close to the OEMs and not have to depend on global supply chains. In other words, a \"local production for local supply\" strategy.\n\nThe GLOCAL approach brings other advantages such as a reduction in the company's carbon footprint, a lower reverse logistics (returns) impact and reduced vulnerability to regulatory changes due to their application over different time horizons and swings.\n\nCIE Automotive's decentralised management approach ensures its decision-making is quick, simple and direct. Each region and division takes the decisions that best serve their prevailing interests at any given time with the support of the firm's Corporate Areas and Network Services vested with a group-wide remit: Europe, North America, Brazil and Asia.\n\nDespite classification into major regions and divisions (the main technologies), the factories, albeit guided by the company's strategy, have full operational autonomy and are managed by local teams, so dissipating business continuity risks for the company as a whole as a result of armed conflicts, the related international sanctions or other similar risks.\n\n**Action plan**\n\n### **Action plan**\n\nImage /page/213/Picture/21 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Lastly, to encourage awareness of IT security risks across the organisation, the company continued to provide group-wide training in 2023, an effort that will carry over to 2024.\n\n**CYBERSECURITY** Cybersecurity, understood as the shielding of IT assets by handling threats that could jeopardise the information that is processed, stored and distributed over interconnected IT systems, has emerged as one of the biggest risks facing companies today. Customers are making increasing security demands of their suppliers. It is vital to pay particular attention to users and possible improper usage; service outsourcing and potential sources of loss or damage (theft, fire, etc.).\n\nThe shift to more flexible working arrangements is leaving communication networks more exposed to potential attacks.\n\n**Action plan**\n\n**Action plan** CIE Automotive launched a cybersecurity consultancy project to map out the potential IT system risks to which the group is exposed in 2021.\n\nChairman and\n\nCEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\nImage /page/214/Picture/26 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Also an opportunity for the procurement managers, guided by ongoing implementation of the successful GLOCAL supply chain management model, to work even harder to encourage suppliers to meet ESG compliance requirements. The ultimate goal is to create a solid, flexible and resilient supply chain aligned with the SDGs.\n\nRisk mitigation involves:\n\n- Renewing ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement certification annually so obtaining external verification of correct management of ESG matters.\n- Continuing to apply common procedures aligned with each country's legal requirements and the group's ESG strategy.\n- Providing the organisation with an objective ESG scoring system for the supply chain via the Supplier Portal and specific indicators.\n\n• Monitoring the supply chain's ESG indicators quarterly. Each factory has to identify additional actions to implement in order to\n\n• Continuing to provide all buyer teams with ongoing training.\n\n• Providing local suppliers with ESG training via specific sessions\n\n• Encouraging ESG audits worldwide. Each factory conducts physical audits of their critical suppliers as part of the effort to\n\n- achieve the group's targets.\n- \n- and meetings.\n- verify actual compliance.\n- targets aligned with the 2050 goals.\n- aligned with the OECD standards.\n\n• Supply Chain Race 2 Zero.

More specifically, in 2023 we continued to provide our people with additional training to give them the skills needed to take on new challenges; we evaluated our partners using our internal professional development tool; we stepped up international exchanges (including the Ulysses programme); and each factory manager actively managed its staff with a view to ensuring a flow of future-proof backgrounds. Indeed, generational\n\ndiversity was one of the classes of diversity analysed in the diversity assessments which have already been conducted at over 90% of our\n\nlocations.\n\nLastly, we actively managed two acquisitions, one in Hungary and the other in Brazil, bringing new profiles and backgrounds into the group which are bound to be key to its future, as has been the case so often in the past.\n\n*[For further information, refer to Our TEAM: the people behind the* \n\n*transformation]*\n\n**HUMAN CAPITAL FOR GROWTH**\n\nManagement of the current and projected pace of growth requires consolidation and development of the company's finest asset, its people. That is why it is fundamental to agree a unified training and promotion plan with the aim of planning, appraising and enhancing professionals' current and future skillsets so as to facilitate delivery of CIE Automotive's strategic objectives.\n\nThanks to the actions taken in 2023, CIE Automotive managed to mitigate the probability of materialisation of the following risk, ranked as a priority in 2022, and, therefore, no longer deemed in need of priority attention in the 2023 risk map.\n\n### **Mitigation actions**\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\nImage /page/216/Picture/6 description: The image shows the number 4, followed by the words \"Common responsibility, shared benefits\".\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/216/Picture/21 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

These awards, which are sponsored by Deloitte Legal and Iberdrola, with Esade as academic partner, reward globally applicable projects that facilitate efficient and suitable management of an organisation's existing global risks, allowing it to tackle common and specific risks faced.\n\nIn selecting CIE Automotive as finalist, the jurors rated the scope and scale of the criminal compliance initiative, the technology used, the applicable rules and the oversight and monitoring model.\n\n*Finalist in the Expansión Compliance Awards*\n\n• Notifying the Audit and Compliance Committee clearly and immediately of any Model breaches that come to light in the course of its review work.\n\nCIE Automotive analyses the level of maturity attained by Model from time to time. During the last update, carried out between 2019 and 2020, it decided to identify the most significant subsidiaries in terms of criminal compliance, analyse the differences with respect to the legislation applicable in Spain and adapt the model to suit each country's characteristics. Since then, the Model has been introduced in most of the company's business markets: Spain, France, Germany, Czechia, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, US, Mexico, Brazil, India and China.\n\nIn 2023 the Model was implemented in Italy, Slovakia and Romania and the regulatory framework in Portugal was analysed. Except in Portugal, where this will happen in 2024, an individual criminal risk map was prepared, joining and consolidating the body of risk maps for the other countries that have been added to its scope since 2020.\n\nAs in 2022, this work began with a regulatory benchmarking exercise to map out the regulations applicable in each jurisdiction, followed by the design of the corporate standards for controlling the main criminal risks to which the various regions are exposed.\n\nTo design the new versions, the company started from the Model developed and implemented in Spain, the various mandatory requirements under local legislation, best national and international practices and suggestions for improving the Model gathered from the various jurisdictions. Once that was done a series of questionnaires were sent to the subsidiaries to identify criminal risks, individuals/functions and controls for subsequent analysis and inclusion, along with the suggestions for improvement and other specific considerations.\n\nIn addition, new criminal risk controls were launched in 2023 to cover newly added risks and reflect the global rollout of the Model between 2020 and 2023.\n\n## **In 2023 the Model was implemented in Italy, Slovakia and Romania** and\n\nthe regulatory framework in Portugal was analysed\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Common** \n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 2 3**\n\n**responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/218/Picture/23 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

It estimates, in euros, the impact on EBITDA (framed by the defined parameters) of the potential materialisation of each risk and includes all of the controls launched at each factory during the year, indicating their current performance status, along with the corresponding evidence. The entire process is monitored via the internal management tool, SAP GRC.\n\nA total of 271 people participated in drawing up the criminal risk map, 38 more than in 2022, and the exercise involved 12 countries, three more than in 2022: the US, Mexico, Brazil, India, China and the European markets - Spain, France, Germany, Czechia, Italy, Romania and Slovakia. Each respondent considered a time horizon of 2025 and their\n\nspecific area of geographic influence. The company's aim is to come up with a national assessment for each country in which it has business operations within the horizon of its 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\nThe criminal risks assessed in 2023 are the result of benchmarking exercises to identify the regulations applicable in each national jurisdiction. To design this new version of the risk map, the company started from the Model developed and implemented in Spain, the various mandatory requirements under local legislation, best national and international practices and suggestions for improving the Model gathered from the various jurisdictions.\n\nFollowing that analysis, 37 potential crimes were evaluated by the various professionals identified for that task; some but not all of them are offences itemised in Spain's Criminal Code. Given that the company still has to analyse some of its markets, the aggregate 2023 map is not quite yet a global map but rather a map that rolls up the 37 offences identified in the 12 countries where this work has been completed. The global risk map, assuming the group's current footprint, will be a reality by 2025, so delivering the target set down in the 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\n# Criminal risk map\n\nOn the basis of the boundary described above and the residual risk assessment approach, the map reveals that none of the criminal risks evaluated presents a medium or high probability of materialisation or would have a significant or severe impact on EBITDA if they were to materialise. Indeed, most of the assessments highlight the credibility of the existing Model, based on global monitoring of the controls performed at the factory, technology and country levels, as well as on continuous specific training.\n\nImage /page/220/Picture/20 description: The image shows a white scale of justice against a gray background.

The plant has a single stem and two leaves. The color scheme is a gradient of orange, with the bottom of the circle and the ground area being a lighter shade, gradually darkening towards the plant and the upper part of the circle. The overall design is simple and clean, suggesting themes of growth, nature, or sustainability.\n\nImage /page/221/Picture/14 description: The image shows two folders, one slightly behind the other, with a padlock icon superimposed on the front folder. The folders are depicted in a light orange gradient, while the padlock is a solid orange color. The padlock is positioned in the lower right corner of the front folder, suggesting security or restricted access to the folder's contents.\n\nExercising the due control required under Spain's Criminal Code requires the\n\ncompany to implement continuous control mechanisms and to appoint internal control bodies to follow up on the controls implemented and any possible criminal risks. Framed by those legislative requirements, CIE Automotive has defined a control structure made up of: (i) the Board of Directors, as the highest decision-making body; (ii) the Audit and Compliance Committee, as oversight and control body; and (iii) the Support Unit.\n\nCIE Automotive has vested the control and oversight duties in the Audit and Compliance Committee, as it has the autonomy and independence in terms of control powers and the ability to act required under the control framework.\n\nThe Compliance Department is responsible for continuously reviewing and updating the internal control system and ensuring compliance with internal and external regulations and the policies and procedures in place for mitigating the main corruption and fraud risks. It is also in charge of the Model and establishment, development and updating CIE Automotive's ethics framework.\n\nAll of CIE Automotive factories use an IT tool to guarantee performance of the required internal controls. That tool is the SAP GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) suite, which permits the automated and manual analysis of the level of performance of the controls conducted at the factory level and tracks incidents\n\nand any resulting action plans, enabling traceability, as outlined in greater detail in the Internal Control Systems section.\n\nNew internal controls were launched in 2023 to mitigate some of the main criminal risks identified in the regions with a tailored risk map and training was undertaken in the following areas:\n\n• Corporate liability and anti-corruption, launched between the end of 2020 and 2021, provided to 600 people in total, including the company's directors, key management personnel, the global management team and the members of the local management committees. Since then, all newcomers to those groups have also been receiving the corporate liability and anti-corruption training.\n\n• Code of Professional Conduct, provided to over 6,000 people online in 2021 and to the rest of CIE Automotive's people worldwide in the form of brochures and a final assessment.\n\n• ESG training, provided to over 6,500 people online in 2023 and to the rest of CIE Automotive's people worldwide in the form of brochures\n\n- \n- \n- and a final assessment.\n\nIt is important to note that each time the Model is introduced into a new country, specific criminal risk training is provided to all of the people it applies to. That refresher training involves a reminder of the company's in-house policies, manuals, procedures and controls and provides an update on applicable local legislation and related\n\ndevelopments.\n\nDISCRIMINATION\n\nDAMAGE TO NATURAL RESOURCES\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY BREACHES\n\n### **Action plan**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/221/Picture/31 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In all, the Compliance Department supervises over 250 controls, applied at the individual factory, business division and corporate office levels, under the scope of its internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) and internal control over non-financial reporting (ICNFR) systems. The ICNFR system includes controls over ESG, criminal, compliance, IT and data protection risks.\n\nImage /page/224/Figure/3 description: This image shows a diagram of the lines of defense in a company. The diagram is divided into four sections: the first line of defense, the second line of defense, the third line of defense, and external audit. The first line of defense is operational management. The second line of defense is governance and operational. Governance includes ethical framework, statutory compliance, and criminal liability. Operational includes risk management, internal control (ICFR\\* & NFRS\\*\\*), operational corporate crime, ESG, and GDPR\\*\\*\\*. The third line of defense is internal audit. The external audit is external audit. The diagram also includes text that describes the responsibilities of each line of defense. The first line of defense must assess, control, and mitigate risks and implement effective internal controls. The second line of defense facilitates and supervises the Operational Management Unit's implementation of effective internal control and risk management. The third line of defense proves the effectiveness of internal control and risk management mechanisms to government agencies, including how the 1st and 2nd line defenses work. The diagram also includes the text \"BOARD OF DIRECTORS / AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE / ESG COMMITTEE\" and \"SENIOR MANAGEMENT\" at the top. On the left side of the image are the following items: Chairman and CEO's statement, 2023 highlights, Ready for change, Record earnings, Common responsibility, shared benefits, Our response to the environmental challenge, Responsible management, and About this report. The numbers 1 through 6 are next to the items 2023 highlights through Responsible management. At the bottom of the image are the following notes: (\\*) ICFR: Internal control over financial reporting, (\\*\\*) NFRS: Internal control over non-financial reporting, and (\\*\\*\\*) GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nThe results are reviewed as part of the Internal Audit Department's annual audit plan as well as being submitted to senior management for review and approval.\n\nAll of the internal audit work is performed through the Audit Management module within SAP GRC, in place across the various local internal audit areas in Brazil, Mexico, India and Europe. Having risk management, internal control and internal audit integrated within the same control tool (i.e., SAP GRC) creates synergies by unlocking work efficiencies and generating value for the business divisions by sharing experiences and success stories.\n\n**LINES OF DEFENCE** \n\n## The Compliance Department **supervises over 250 controls**\n\n#### [Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/224/Picture/7 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

With process mining, aided by artificial intelligence, it is possible to quickly visualise, identify and quantify bottlenecks and inefficiencies across the business, so delivering the following benefits, among others:\n\n- Increased efficiency by removing bottlenecks, improving cycle times and streamlining processes.\n- Cost reduction associated with duplicity, rework and manual processes.\n- Improved compliance by detecting non-compliant processes or possible cases fraud.\n- ¡Continuous business optimisation by improving processes and monitoring them in real-time.\n\nIn 2023, with the aim of making the company's internal control system more efficient, CIE Automotive embarked on a process mining project with Celonis (the tool provider) and the consultancy, Deloitte.\n\nThe goal of this project is to establish use cases that, by interconnecting all of the company's ERPs around the world, help generate value in the company's business processes by detecting inefficiencies and optimising processes. In short, the idea is to improve processes by detecting bottlenecks, identifying the best routes to achieving a given objective, as well as flagging any potential cases of fraud. . This translates into the establishment of numerical indicators and scorecards that make it easier for the business and corporate managers to understand and monitor the data.\n\nIn 2023 the company managed to implement process mining in the production SAP environments in Europe and at Datasul in Brazil and the tool is\n\nunder development in the S/4 HANA environment of the roof systems division (with global reach) and the SAP environments in Mexico, India and in other environments in Europe.\n\nImage /page/225/Figure/18 description: The image shows a gray rectangle with two check marks at the top and four circles in a vertical line below them.

The companies are listed on the left side of the image, and the scores are displayed on the right side of the image. The bar graphs are color-coded, with green representing high scores and red representing low scores. The companies listed are CDP, Ecovadis, Moody's, MSCI, Sustainalytics, FTSE Russell, ISS-Corporate, Glass Lewis, Clarity AI, and Bloomberg. The scores for each company are as follows: CDP (Solicited. Clients' request), Ecovadis (68, Solicited. Clients' request), Moody's (95, Solicited. Linked to financial facilities), MSCI (82, Unsolicited), Sustainalytics (47, Unsolicited), FTSE Russell (94, Unsolicited), ISS-Corporate (97, Unsolicited), Glass Lewis (n.a, Unsolicited), Clarity AI (n.a, Unsolicited), and Bloomberg (65, Unsolicited), (70, Unsolicited).\n\nIn 2023 the company made fresh progress on a number of its ESG targets, while delivering the 79 specific KPIs set down in its 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\n- **New SDG 7:** CIE Automotive added SDG 7 \"Affordable and clean energy\" to its contributions to the 2030 Agenda in 2023. This commitment has translated into investments in clean energy, the implementation of technology to reduce energy consumption across its facilities and a constant search for energy efficiencies.\n- **ESG training at the global level.** To get everyone at CIE Automotive to see and understand the importance of its ESG goals, the company has an online platform that explains its strategic approach and provides ESG training to its employees (to more than 6,500 online and to everyone worldwide via printed brochures).\n- **New Whistleblowing channel:** In 2023 CIE Automotive rolled out a new online platform to make it easier for its employees and other stakeholders to confidentially report inappropriate or criminal conduct, so complying with Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law and its transposition into law in the various European jurisdictions where the Company operates on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law.\n- **Expansion of the international criminal risk map.** In 2023 the company took new steps in building a truly global criminal risk map by adding three new markets: Italy, Romania and Slovakia. The analysis has also been completed in Portugal where the map will be implemented in the first quarter of 2024.\n- **Expansion of the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project:** This is the company's effort to help its suppliers decarbonise by supporting and monitoring suppliers who are having difficulties reducing their emissions.\n- **Update of the materiality matrix:** The matrix was updated in 2023 thanks to the feedback gleaned from over 1,500 employee surveys and information collected from customers, analysts and investors.\n\n| SECTOR<br>POSITIONING<br>ON ESG<br>(PERCENTILE) | ESG<br>ADVISORS   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                 |                   |\n|                                                 | PROXY<br>ADVISORS |\n|                                                 | ESG<br>DATASET    |\n\n### ESG achievements in 2023 Chairman [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Sector outperformance on ESG scores**\n\nCIE Automotive's ESG performance is tangible in the scores awarded by a number of independent sustainability agencies. Most of these scores, except for those associated with financing operations, have not been solicited by the company. These specialists rate CIE Automotive on aspects related with its environmental impact, social practices and governance structure.\n\nCIE Automotive's scores are strong and reflect outperformance relative to most of its sector peers. The results confirm the effectiveness of the measures taken in recent years to address crucial ESG matters.\n\nNote that CIE Automotive climbed a whole notch on the CDP's ESG ratings, from C to B, on the basis of the data for 2023, implying an increase in score of over 30 points, from 34 to 68.\n\nand CEO's\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/228/Picture/24 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The scope of the financial and non-financial information is, therefore, global.\n\nIn order to facilitate comparability, the document also provides information for prior years. The reader should note that in October 2023 the group sold the German forging business that was owned by Forging Germany GmbH (formerly, Mahindra Forgings Europe AG) and its subsidiaries, to an investee of Mutares United Gmbh.\n\nAnd in May 2023 it completed the acquisition, through Autometal, of 100% of Iber-Oleff Brasil Lda. in Brazil.\n\nIn 2023 the group also acquired the Hungarian company Salgglas, which specialises in the manufacture of safety glass for cars.\n\nChairman\n\n**[highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\nand CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 1**\n\n**Ready Ready for change 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> *About this report*\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/229/Picture/16 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The Chinese joint venture, SAMAP, is excluded from the scope as it is accounted for using the equity method.\n\nHowever, in order to confirm that, despite being an equity-accounted investee, the ESG risks to which the group is exposed through its joint venture in China are not material for CIE Automotive, a self-assessment was conducted on the basis of the contents of Spanish Law 11/2018 on non-financial and diversity reporting. That assessment revealed the existence of a working methodology at the joint venture around ESG matters, with specific targets and indicators, that is aligned with CIE Automotive's methodology.\n\nThe non-financial disclosures were prepared in keeping with Spanish Law 11/2018 and the non-binding guidelines on nonfinancial reporting issued by the European Commission on 5 July 2017 (EU Guidelines 2017/C 215/01) and the GRI Standards.\n\nThe non-financial statement, which is part of this Annual Report, was assured KPMG Auditores, S.L., which also audited the group's annual financial statements. The Audit and Compliance Committee is tasked with ensuring that firm's independence.\n\nThe non-financial information, which is part of the NFS, included in this report was compiled with the input and oversight of the heads of all of the various departments and areas:\n\n- The Compliance Department is ultimately responsible for its preparation and coordination, albeit ably assisted by the Cross-Group ESG Committee.\n- The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for approving its issue, along with the management report. The Board of Directors is kept regularly abreast of the most significant environmental, social and governance matters by the ESG Committee.\n\nTo round out the information about the group's activities throughout the year, a number of other statutory reports are available for download on the corporate website: separate and consolidated annual financial statements and management report, Annual Corporate Governance Report and Annual Report on Board Remuneration, along with all of the presentations published about different aspects of the group or in the specific website tabs devoted to specific stakeholder groups.\n\nThe scope of the social and environmental impact information included in this Report is the same as the financial scope considered in CIE Automotive, S.A.'s consolidated financial statements, in addition to the forged parts business in Germany (carried on by Schöneweiss & Co. GmbH, Gesekschmiede Schneider GmbH, Falkenroth Umformtechnik GmbH and Jeco Jellinghaus GmbH ), assets classified as held for sale in 2023 that were part of the group until July 2023.\n\nTherefore, **all of the tables containing non-financial information throughout the report (except those providing year-end data) include the data for the discontinued German forging operations until 30 June 2023.**\n\n**For a better understanding of the information, the \"Data tables\" section discloses the information for the discontinued German operations separately.**\n\nf\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 1 2 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\nImage /page/230/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" on the left side of the image.

In 2023, the company updated its materiality assessment so as to identify the matters of greatest importance for the company and its stakeholders. During that process it consulted internal and external sources and considered a time horizon aligned with the current 2025 ESG Plan.\n\nTo update the assessment, the group analysed internally the topics considered material for CIE Automotive, sector and customer sustainability trends and commitments, regulatory developments and the demands of analysts, investors and other stakeholders.\n\nReview of sustainability trends and\n\n#### **ANALYST AND INVESTOR DEMANDS**\n\nReview of the information requested by analysts and investors\n\nImage /page/231/Figure/8 description: The image shows a diagram with a central circle containing the letters \"C\" and \"E\".

In line with growing regulations and stakeholder demands (mainly the sector and public organisations), new forms of mobility (closely related with the latest market trends), geopolitics (both of which are risks flagged in the risk map) and sustainable supply chain management emerged as more significant and now occupy prominent spots on the ranking of material ESG topics.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\n*About [this report](#page-229-0)*\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\nImage /page/232/Picture/7 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The x-axis represents \"MANAGEMENT\" and ranges from 2.7 to 3.4, while the y-axis represents \"IMPORTANCE\" and ranges from 2.0 to 4.0. The plot contains 23 numbered data points, each representing a different factor. These factors are:\n1. Responsible supply chain management\n2. Expert talent management\n3. Customer satisfaction\n4. New forms of mobility\n5. Geopolitics\n6. Innovation to drive efficiency\n7. Risk management\n8. Strong corporate governance\n9. Circular economy: efficient use of resources and waste management\n10. Respect for human rights\n11. Workplace health and safety\n12. Climate change\n13. Ethics and compliance\n14. Employee wellbeing\n15. Environmental impact\n16. Equality, diversity and inclusion\n17. Privacy and data protection\n18. Community relations\n19. Product quality and safety\n20. Growth and responsible investment\n21. Stakeholder engagement\n22. Reputation\n23. Transparency\n\nThe data points are color-coded based on their area: environmental (green), governance (red), and social (blue). The positions of the points on the plot indicate their relative importance and management level. For example, point 3 (Customer satisfaction) is located at the top-right corner, indicating high importance and high management, while point 22 (Reputation) is located at the bottom-left corner, indicating low importance and low management.\n\n#### The importance ascribed to each **MATERIALITY MATRIX** material topic, coupled with the perception of how well each one is being managed, yielded the following materiality matrix, which in turn formed the basis of the 2025 Strategic Plan and the contents of this Annual Report.\n\nAll ESG topics that lie above the dividing line are matters whose importance is greater than the level of attention they are currently receiving and therefore constitute the ESG matters the company needs to focus on. The greater the distance between the ESG topic in question and the dividing line, the more the company needs to prioritise it.\n\n*Explanatory note of the matrix: in the questionnaires for updating the materiality analysis, the minimum scale score is 1 and the maximum is 4. Given the results atomized between scores 2 and 3, without extremes, the resulting matrix is shown on their axes starting from a value of 2.7, which means that all issues have been valued on that scale from 1 to 4, above 2.7*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n#### *About [this report](#page-229-0)*\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/233/Picture/11 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The report is titled \"Independent Assurance Report on the Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement of CIE Automotive, S.A. and subsidiaries for 2023\". The report is from KPMG Auditores, S.L., and the address is Paseo de la Castellana, 259 C, 28046 Madrid. The report includes a statement from the Chairman and CEO, and highlights from 2023. The highlights include being ready for change, record earnings, common responsibility and shared benefits, a response to the environmental challenge, and responsible management. The report also includes a section about the report itself.\n\n- Meetings with the Group's personnel to gain an understanding of the business model, policies and management approaches applied, the principal risks related to these matters and to obtain the information necessary for the external review.\n- Analysis of the scope, relevance and completeness of the content of the NFIS for 2023 based on the materiality analysis performed by the Group and described in the \"Materiality\" section of\n- \"About this report\", considering the content required by prevailing mercantile legislation. – Analysis of the processes for compiling and validating the data presented in the NFIS for 2023.\n\n#### 3 (Translation from the original in Spanish.

Consequently, no comparative information on eligibility has been included in the accompanying Report in relation to the other environmental objectives listed above or to the new activities included in the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. \nFurthermore, as much as the information on 2022 was not required to be as detailed as in 2023, the disclosures included in the accompanying Report are not strictly comparable. Additionally, the \nDirectors of CIE Automotive, S.A. have included information on the criteria that, in their opinion, \nallow them to comply better with the aforementioned obligations, and which are defined in the \"Compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 regarding climate-related taxonomy\" section of the accompanying Report.

The following pages explain how we took decisions and how we embarked on pathways that not only served to consolidate our financial success but also impacted the people and organisations around us and will ultimately benefit society and the planet in the long term.\n\nWe are living in challenging times: the sector is faced with making heavy investments to decarbonise vehicles and increase their connectivity and comfort; it is being drawn into a price war in the electric vehicle segment; and inflation and higher costs are putting pressure on our earnings. There are also, however, encouraging signs that we are on the cusp of a new automotive cycle. Ageing vehicle fleets around the world, low penetration in emerging economies, and growing sensitivity around more environmentally-friendly cars are some of the most promising factors.\n\n**Antón Pradera** Chairman\n\n**Jesús Mª Herrera** Chief Executive Officer\n\n# **We are transforming the world, we are making a difference**\n\nChairman and CEO's statement\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 1 2 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/2/Picture/9 description: The image shows a road with yellow lines in the middle, leading towards a bright sunset.

We posted a net profit of €320.2 million, growth of 6.7% from 2022. Our bottom line was driven by topline growth of 3.1% to €3.96 billion and a stronger performance across all our markets, lifting the group's EBITDA to €713.2 million, implying a margin of 18.0%. We converted €447.4 million of that EBITDA into cash flow and brought our net debt down to €1.13 billion. In parallel, we paid our shareholders over €100 million, so delivering our commitment to paying out one-third of our net profit in dividends.\n\nAs you can see, these are truly extraordinary numbers, especially considering the environment, which is why we want to thank and congratulate the entire CIE Automotive team for making them possible.\n\nWe are optimistic about the future. We are ready to take advantage of the opportunities thrown up by the current market trends to surmount the challenges looming and continue to generate value for our shareholders, both through dividend payments and share price gains, as we have been doing for over 25 years.\n\nTo do that, we have a unique business model, which has proven its worth in very tough times, articulated around six pillars: multiple locations, customer diversification, a multi-technology approach, disciplined investing, decentralised management and embedded sustainability standards. A model that will allow us to meet the ambitious targets set down in our 2025 Strategic Plan, which position us among the three most profitable automotive parts makers.\n\nWith that in mind, in 2023 we redirected our financial and managerial resources to the businesses and markets offering most growth potential and highest returns. We acquired Iber-Oleff Brasil in a transaction that has reinforced our position in a growth market and allowed us to diversify our local customer base, and we sold our German forging factories specialised in the European truck market.\n\nFinancial returns are not, however, our only ambition. Throughout last year we met all our compliance requirements and continued to engage all our professionals in the task of embedding ESG matters into our day-to-day operations. As signatories of the United Nations Global Compact, we aspire to contribute to delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals contemplated in the Agenda 2030 to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that everyone can live in peace and prosperity. We are well aware that with 10 R&D centers and 108 plants in 17 countries, we are in a privileged position to do that.\n\nIn 2023 we once again marked new records in revenue, profitability and cash generation. **We posted a net profit of €320.2 million, growth of 6.7% from 2022**\n\n### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/11 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

It is thanks to their dedication that we were able to continue to grow in 2023, generate wealth and mobilise other people so that they too become agents of change. In exchange, we provided them with €35 million worth of support measures (health insurance, food, transportation, etc.) and offered them as safe, stimulating and fair a place to work as possible, regardless of where they carry out their work.\n\nWe lifted the percentage of women in our workforce by two points and by year-end had completed diversity and inclusion assessments at 93% of our factories, generating action plans for including people of different cultures, genders, generations and abilities. This is a particularly important milestone in countries whose populations are not sensitive to these matters and where there is no legislation around them.\n\nOur responsible doings have a domino effect on our supply chain. In 2023, we renewed our ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement certification and rolled out Supply Chain Race 2 Zero, our project for rallying our worldwide suppliers around our goal of being net zero by no later than 2050, offering them resources, guidance and environmental training. This initiative is part of our new environmental roadmap which echoes and expands on the targets set in our 2025 Strategic Plan and establishes new steps towards climate neutrality.\n\nLast year we accompanied our customers with their efforts to decarbonise transport by investing in technology projects aimed at reducing the weight of our parts and improving material circularity. We also participated in a number of research programmes related with the electrification of transport, including Basquevolt, the Basque alliance for the creation of solid-state lithium batteries.\n\nAll these activities favour progress in society and development in our business communities, which we supported in 2023 by contributing €497 million of tax and participating in community projects that benefitted over 41,500 people, projects we are certain will have a multiplier effect in the long term.\n\nIn 2023 we demonstrated that the future is not preordained, that it is our actions that mark the difference. We know that much remains to be done to create the fair, prosperous and sustainable world we all long for but we are convinced that we are taking steps in the right direction and that is something we are proud of.\n\nThanks to all for your support,\n\n**Antón Pradera**\n\nChairman\n\n#### **Jesús Mª Herrera**\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nOur responsible doings have a domino effect on the supply chain: In 2023, **we renewed our ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement certification and rolled out our Supply Chain Race 2 Zero programme**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/14 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The euro symbol is a circle with a horizontal line through the center.\n\n#### **Heavy investment in electric vehicles**\n\nThe transition to electric mobility is requiring heavy investments in new technology around batteries, vehicle autonomy and electric propulsion systems. The OEMs need to design specific vehicle platforms, requiring significant investment in engineering and design. Automotive suppliers need to improve their production lines to adapt them for electric vehicles which implies, in addition to capital expenditure, investing in skills.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/30 description: The image shows a black circle with a white Euro symbol inside it. Above the circle is a black arrow pointing upwards. The background is a light peach color.\n\n### **Increase in borrowing costs**\n\nThe automotive sector players were faced by an increase in borrowing costs as a result of the successive interest rate increases implemented to curb inflation. The increase in the cost of money left many OEMs and suppliers, which had leveraged up to deal with the fallout from the pandemic and/or invest in vehicle electrification, in a precarious position.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/15 description: The image shows a black and white icon of an electric car being charged. The car is depicted in silhouette with a charging cable plugged into its side. Above the car are two euro symbols with a lightning bolt in between them, suggesting the cost of electricity. The overall design is simple and graphic, likely intended for use as a symbol or sign related to electric vehicles and charging costs.\n\n.\n\n#### **Price war in electric vehicle segment**\n\nGrowth in electric vehicles is driving the OEMs to cut prices aggressively in order build a position in the market. A price war broke out in January when one of the electric vehicle segment leaders cut the price of its cheaper models in a move that was quickly followed by the other OEMs, worried they would be left out of this niche; discounts went as high as 15% on some models in China. In fact, the Chinese electric vehicle makers are making major inroads, exporting very cheap models to Europe.\n\n### **CHALLENGES**\n\nDespite the sector's strong performance in 2023 in the wake of global supply chain normalisation, the business faced certain challenges that could well become more pressing in the years to come:\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/7 description: The image shows a black and white icon of a euro symbol inside a circle. A line graph with an upward trend is superimposed on the circle, with an arrow pointing to the right.\n\n# Challenges and opportunities\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/25 description: The image shows a stylized letter 'C' in black, set against a peach-colored background. The 'C' is not a complete circle; it has a break in the curve.

The arrow is pointing clockwise, suggesting a cycle or rotation of people.\n\n**Shift in demand composition**\n\nThe economic slowdown, coupled with an ageing fleet in developed economies and growth in developing economies, could change the market's composition. While demand is expected to remain steady in terms of volumes, the outlook is for a higher share of sales in the mass market segment and in sales in developing economies.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/8 description: The image shows a black and white icon of an electric car with three people standing behind it. The car has a charging plug symbol on its side, indicating that it is an electric vehicle. The people are represented by simple stick figures, suggesting a group or shared transportation concept.\n\n**Ageing global vehicle fleet** \n\nThe advanced age of the stock of vehicles on the road implies potential demand via substitution. The OEMs can tap this demand by offering updated models with enhanced features, more modern technology and more efficient performance. There is pent-up demand in the US and Europe among buyers who are not shopping for secondhand cars, suggesting they are waiting to buy a new car.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/13 description: The image shows a sign indicating a low emission zone. The sign features a black car with two downward-pointing arrows above it, all enclosed in a rectangular frame attached to a pole. To the right of the sign, the text \"Low emission device\" is displayed.\n\n### **Public interest in the new electric vehicles**\n\nGrowing environmental awareness and emerging regulations restricting the use of less environmentally-friendly cars are whetting consumers' interest in electric vehicles. As prices come down, the number of charging stations rises and autonomy improves, the share of electric vehicles is bound to increase.\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/10 description: The image shows a black and white icon of a damaged car with a globe above it, next to the text \"Ageing vehicle f\".\n\n### **Low vehicle penetration in certain development economies**\n\nDeveloping economies with low vehicle penetration rates are ripe for healthy growth in vehicle sales. These countries often present transport infrastructure limitations, economic barriers and very limited access to credit. As these obstacles are surmounted, their populations will start to buy more cars, as is already happening in India and Brazil.\n\n#### **AVERAGE AGE OF THE VEHICLE FLEET IN 2023 MOTORISATION RATE BY COUNTRY**\n\n*Source: ACEA, Anfavea, JPM, ANFAC, IHS, GiPA, OICA, INEGI, NTS Source: ACEA, Anfavea, JPM, ANFAC, IHS, GiPA, OICA, INEGI, NTS*\n\n|        | 2021       | 2022       |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| Europe | 11.8 years | 12.1 years |\n| US     | 13.1 years | 13.6 years |\n| Mexico | 12.6 years | 10.1 years |\n| Brazil | 10.3 years | 10.7 years |\n| India  | 25 years   | 25 years   |\n| China  | 5.1 years  | 7 years    |\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/22 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The resulting price war is putting the weaker parts suppliers in a tough situation, negotiating prices that leave their EBIT margins at under 5%. Faced by this situation, while Brussels has officially started an anti-subsidy investigation on electric cars from China, the various national governments are rolling out initiatives to protect their industries. For this and other strategic reasons, the Chinese OEMs are looking into options for setting up manufacturing in Europe down the line. For example, in December BYD formally announced plans to build a factory in Hungary in phases.\n\nThe Europe\ncoming year\nlosing share\n\nThe European market is forecast to remain flat in the coming years, as is expected of a mature market that is losing share to other areas of the world.\n\n### **North America:**\n\nVehicle production in North America totalled 15.7 million units, up 9.7% from 2022. This growth, considered high for a mature market, is attributable to the positive impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides electric vehicle buyers a tax credit of up to \\$7,500 if the car meets certain regional production requirements.\n\nA flat evolution is expected in the coming years, typical of an already mature market that is losing weight in favor of other markets.\n\nOne negative development was the simultaneous strike at three OEMs - General Motors, Stellantis and Ford - in the US and Canada. Production foregone during the stoppages is estimated at 203,793 vehicles.\n\nUnlike Europe and despite the market's maturity, vehicle production in the US is expected to increase by 1% in 2024, in large part, but not entirely, due to the recovery in volumes in the wake of the strike. Medium term, the market is expected to revisit its pre-pandemic levels by 2026, again setting it apart from the European market.\n\n### *Vehicle purchase incentives*\n\nIn August 2022, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes \\$369bn in clean energy investments as well as provisions that will lower the cost of prescription drugs and increase taxes on large corporations. Of particular interest for the automotive sector is the vehicle purchase incentive and the infrastructure tax credit. Overall, the bill is projected to help cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% from 2005 levels by the end of the decade.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act contains financial incentives to encourage the purchase of electric and hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles as well as the deployment of charging stations. Provisions in the IRA provide a tax credit for the purchase of the vehicle itself and a tax credit for the purchase and installation of charging assets or charging infrastructure.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Tax breaks mitigated the pronounced rise in interest rates in 2023.\n\nThe big announcement last year was BYD's acquisition of the old Ford factory in Bahía, which is now expected to produce two electric cars and one hybrid model, as well as electric trucks and buses. Production is expected to start in the second half of 2024 with initial annual capacity of 150,000 units, a figure expected to double to 300,000 from 2025.\n\nGrowth in production is expected to accelerate in 2024, to 3% and, most notably in 2025 and 2026, when production growth is forecast at 6% and 7%, respectively. Some of the anticipated growth is attributable to the fact that the Brazilian central bank has already started to cut interest rates.\n\n#### **India:**\n\nDemand for vehicles in India broke new records in 2023. Production increased by 4.4% to 5.4 million units, despite strong levels already in 2022. As well as a strong performance in the passenger vehicle segment, other segments with even greater growth potential started to recover: commercial vehicles (+0%); motorcycles (+4%) and tractors (-2%).\n\nNotably electrification also started to make inroads in this market: in early October, Tata announced it would launch eight electric models in 2030. This growth is expected to get a further injection from public initiatives designed to draw investments related with electric vehicles. In 2023, electric car sales volumes increased by around 90% (88% as of November). However, combustion-engine vehicles are expected to continue to dominate this market.\n\nAs for the outlook for light vehicle production, growth is expected to take a breather in 2024, consolidating the sharp growth recorded last year before going on to regain traction, with growth of 4/5% forecast for both 2025 and 2026.\n\n### **China:**\n\nThe world's largest vehicle maker increased production by 10.0% in 2023. Although domestic demand appears to be slowing, Chinese production was boosted by the extension of tax relief for electric vehicles until 2027. Moreover, the Chinese OEMs are growing in foreign markets thanks to a price-based growth strategy.\n\nAnnual growth to 2026 is forecast at 3%.\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/23 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Climate change regulations are tackling two key fronts. Firstly, they are requiring the use of greener energy sources, focused primarily on electrification. Secondly, all sector players must mitigate their carbon footprints taking a lifecycle approach.\n\n### **Demographic trends**\n\nThere are many opposing demographic trends unfolding simultaneously around the world whose ultimate overall effect on the automotive sector is expected to be clearly positive.\n\n- More than half of forecast population growth is concentrated in Africa, but the most of the world's population is located in Asia (60%), with Europe losing share (10%.)\n- Life expectancies are rising and birth rates dropping, driving population ageing.\n- Urbanisation is a parallel trend and we are also seeing - mainly regional - migratory displacements of populations.\n\n#### **Technological change**\n\nThe world is moving towards a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will change our lives and make productive processes, including those of the automotive sector, more efficient.\n\nThe emerging improved and more efficient vehicle architectures are based on the use of the right materials and their correct application, which means that different technologies will have a role to play in the next-generation, multi-material vehicles.\n\n### **Macroeconomics and geopolitics**\n\n- Emerging market opportunities: the Chinese, Indian and Brazilian economies, to name a few, are expected to experience sharp growth in the coming years.\n- National protectionism: initially perceived as a threat, protectionism strategies are no longer expected to have a significant impact on the automotive sector.\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/20 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Despite those efforts, EV penetration rates vary significantly from one market to the next and we are likely to see vehicles fuelled by different sources of\n\nenergy coexist for some time.\n\n### **User experience**\n\nCar buyers' preferences have shifted. Nowadays they are looking for aspects related with comfort, such as spaciousness, driver assistance and smart infrastructure, to the detriment of other attributes such as power, aerodynamics and external aesthetics. Within the comfort thrust, the penetration of roof systems is outpacing the general automotive market.\n\n### **Safety and protection**\n\nVehicle safety prioritisation is making manufacturing more complex and increasing the number of parts and their added value. Today's cars are being fitted with sophisticated driver assistance systems that prevent accidents and other passive safety systems designed to mitigate damage and injuries in the event of a collision; those systems are being embedded in the chassis and bodywork, for example, as well as shaping seatbelt and airbag development. Growing safety and protection requirements for passengers and other road users is requiring the introduction of more complex solutions involving different materials, reinforcing the astuteness of the multitechnology approach.\n\n#### **Autonomous and connected car**\n\nMajor progress has been made on autonomous driving in recent years, thanks to which important driver assistance features have been introduced to new cars. However, the mainstreaming of the autonomous car in the coming years continues to face obstacles. In parallel, users are demanding greater connectivity between their cars and the outside world (virtual assistants, automation, etc.), all of which requires establishing high-speed connections. The OEMs are therefore expected to partner with technology, telephony and infrastructure providers.\n\nImage /page/26/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The text \"CIE Automotive\" is written in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Geographical balance\n\n**Since its creation in 1996, CIE Automotive has been strategically expanding its geographic reach, locating its manufacturing facilities close to the vehicle assembly platforms in the main automotive markets: Europe, North America, Asia and Brazil. Thanks to the acquisition of a number of companies, the construction of greenfield facilities and strategic alliances with other companies, CIE Automotive has built itself up to include 108 manufacturing (including 3 multitechnology factories) and 10 research centres located in 17 countries.** \n\nThis geographical diversification positions it a leading supplier for the platforms worldwide, enabling it to maintain a healthy sales and earnings mix across the various regions. Geographic diversification is a crucial defensive tool in moments of crisis, as slowdowns in production in some markets are often mitigated by stronger momentum in others.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, specifically to direct its financial and managerial resources to markets with higher growth potential, such as India, and other technologies in greater demand and tied to its decarbonisation strategy, in 2023 the company sold Mutares its German forging business, the subsidiaries of CIE Forging Germany GmbH.\n\n#### North America\n\n# 31%\n\nThe company entered the Mexican market two decades ago and over the last 10 years expanded into the US by means of mergers and acquisitions. It currently has 13 manufacturing facilities in Mexico and five in the US.\n\n#### Europe\n\n36%\n\nHaving sold its German forging business in October 2023, CIE Automotive has 39 manufacturing facilities in western and eastern Europe and one factory in\n\nMorocco.\n\nBrazil\n\n9%\n\nIn Brazil, CIE Automotive has 14 manufacturing facilities following the acquisition of Iber-Oleff, which specialises in plastic parts. It commands a noteworthy position in this market in the wake of the consolidation of the automotive parts market in recent years.\n\nAsia\n\n# 24%\n\nCIE Automotive has 25 manufacturing facilities in India and 12 in China. The company entered the Indian market, the world's fastest-growing automotive market, through its alliance with the local business group Mahindra & Mahindra, later cementing its position in the country by acquiring Bill Forge and AEL (now CIE Aluminium Casting). In China, the company's growth is the result of its acquisition of Inteva's roof systems division.\n\n#### **CIE AUTOMOTIVE FACTORIES AROUND THE WORLD**\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/20 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

This approach allows it to respond to its customers' demands and the growing body of legislation around sustainability, while also locking in profitable, long-term growth by driving efficiency and innovation so as to minimise its negative impacts.** \n\n### **Global Compact**\n\nCIE Automotive's public commitment to sustainable development dates back to 2015, when it signed its endorsement of the United Nations Global Compact. That endorsement implied the public assumption of responsibility in key areas including human and labour rights, environmental protection and anti-corruption. Eight years later, as a Signatory of the Spanish Chapter of the Global Compact, the group has moved beyond its respect for the Company's 10 universally recognised principles and become an agent of systematic change in the shift towards a sustainable economy.\n\nImage /page/37/Picture/13 description: The image contains the logo of the UN Global Compact. The logo features a globe encircled by the text \"UN GLOBAL COMPACT\" in a circular arrangement. Below the globe, there are two olive branches forming a semi-circle.

This policy defines the fundamental principles and general framework for building sustainability practices into the company's business model and strategy. Effective application of these principles and the potential risks associated with it are addressed in CIE Automotive's Risk Management and Control Policy.\n\n### **Management monitoring**\n\nSupervision of ESG and sustainability management falls to the Board of Director's ESG Committee, which delegates oversight of application of the principles in the Cross-Group ESG Committee. This monitoring process takes the form of 79 ESG indicators that measure performance in different areas. The KPIs are in turn included in each factory's management plans and are used to track delivery of the sustainability aspects of the 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\nThe group's social responsibility extends to its supply chain. Indeed, CIE Automotive was the first company in its sector to create a supplier platform devoted solely to managing and evaluating ESG matters.\n\nImage /page/37/Picture/21 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

It sets ambitious and quantifiable business and ESG targets and details the specific lines of work for achieving them. The two blocks are interdependent and necessary to attain sustainable profitability.**\n\n### **BUSINESS STRATEGY**\n\nCIE Automotive's business strategy is articulated around the generation of operating cash flow and so translates into significant deleveraging over its time horizon, enabling it to invest up to €1.5 billion without its leverage (net debt-to-EBITDA) rising above 2x. The momentum in operating cash flow is being driven by margin expansion, which more than offset the rise in interest rates in 2023.\n\nThe amount set aside for investments may be used for any type of transaction that maximises the company's returns, including M&A deals, share buybacks, the purchase of minority interests, etc. The criteria will always be to prioritise transactions that maximise value generation at a given point in time.\n\n#### **ORGANIC\\* COMMITMENTS EMBEDDED IN THE 2025 STRATEGIC PLAN**\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/11 description: The image shows a black and white icon representing financial growth in euros.

These lines of initiative likewise respond to the market changes identified as a risk factor, as detailed in the \"Risk management\" chapter.\n\n**Electrification**\n\nThe company wants to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by decarbonisation of the transport sector to create new value-added products for electric vehicles, particularly in EV motors, power electronics, gearboxes and batteries. At present, 80% of the products made by CIE Automotive are compatible with both electrified and combustionpowered vehicles.\n\n#### **Industry 4.0**\n\nImmersed in the fourth industrial revolution, CIE Automotive is gradually adopting smart manufacturing tools and different enabling technologies. These tools interact with and learn from each other and feature sensorisation capabilities that make it possible to capture data which is later analysed using algorithms.\n\nImplementation of these technologies is not only making our processes more efficient but is also reducing our environmental impact by cutting prototype volumes, energy and raw material consumption, product rejects and scrap generation.\n\n#### **International expansion**\n\nThe company seeks geographical diversification by investing in countries where vehicle penetration is low and growth expectations are high. Broadly speaking, until 2025, the plan is for all the divisions to add capacity and develop new products that add more value and address their existing customers' emerging needs. In parallel, the sales teams are working intensely to bring in new customers.\n\n#### **Comfort**\n\nCIE Automotive's strategy in the comfort area is concentrated at its roof systems division. More specifically, it is looking to consolidate its position in bottomloaded roofs and fixed glass roofs with shades. It also wants to be able to incorporate panoramic roofs into both fixed and movable sunroofs, addressing all ranges. The company is also focusing on thinner roofs equipped with flat roller blind technology, which are particularly necessary in the electric vehicle segment. Lastly, it is working on ambient comfort by adding spot lighting to both its roofs and their shades.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/20 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

These indicators are part of the management plans at all of the company's factories, which report to the corporate areas quarterly, half-yearly or annually, depending on the stipulated frequency.\n\nAll of that information gets consolidated into a global ESG dashboard hosted within the group's corporate intranet. Progress on the various indicators is reported to the Board's ESG Committee and the CEO, who has tasked the Cross-Group ESG Committee with overseeing delivery of various KPIs.\n\nThe KPIs are reviewed periodically and realigned with the most updated context assessment, which factors in the latest trends in the automotive industry, stakeholder demands and regulatory developments, among other aspects\n\nThe targets and the work being done by the corporate areas driving their attainment are articulated around four strategic lines of initiative: CIE culture, ethical commitment, eco-efficiency and active listening.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/14 description: The image is a close-up of a green and white graphic.

In 2023 it continued to innovate and invest approximately 2% of its revenue, through its 10 research centres and the productive units, with a view to facilitating delivery of its 2025 Strategic Plan targets. Its 10 R&D centres and its engineering and R&D areas are working on improvement projects, following a roadmap articulated around four strategic lines of action: ecoefficiency, Industry 4.0, new mobility concepts and safety. Innovation also plays a crucial role in moving the company towards climate neutrality.**\n\nImage /page/49/Figure/4 description: The image shows a green icon of a lightning bolt inside of a circular arrow. The arrow is pointing in a clockwise direction.\n\n### **ECO-EFFICIENCY AND CIRCULARITY**\n\nWith the aim of becoming net zero by 2050, the R&D area is focusing hard on reducing consumption and emissions.\n\nIn parallel, the company is working on projects in the electric motor, battery and power electronics systems in order to continue to penetrate the electrified vehicle segment and so contribute to the decarbonisation of transportation in the use phase.\n\nCIE Automotive collaborates with a range of research programmes targeting decarbonisation at both the regional and international levels. Those programmes are looking at systems for zero-emission vehicles, whether battery-powered or fuel-cell electric vehicles.\n\nIn batteries, CIE Automotive is also participating in the Basque initiative for the production of solid-state batteries, which is planning to build 10 GWh of capacity. Basquevolt plans to commission a production line in four years' time, entailing €700 million of investment and generating more than 800 direct jobs. Solid-state batteries will deliver a substantial increase in battery autonomy, while lowering their costs and reducing dependence on certain critical materials. That will also lead to democratisation of the electric vehicle, paving the way for costs of €15,000 per vehicle, making them accessible to most citizens. This project considers the life cycle of the new batteries, including disassembly, recycling or reuse.\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/11 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Here the engineering area is working on a number of different projects:\n\n- Introduction of new product functions, so reducing the number of parts. In the roof systems division, this means including lighting, display screens and photovoltaic cells in the systems.\n- Launch of eco-design tools for incorporation into new product and project processes. In 2023 this project emphasised the incorporation of disassembly and recycling criteria at the product design phase.\n- Projects to increase the circularity of polymer transformation technologies.\n- Introduction of recycled materials into roofing textiles that can help cut product emissions up to three-fold.\n- Innovation in technologies that reduce the use of fuel and chemical products, such as ESG+ technology, in roofs and side windows, delivering a consideration reduction in waste generation and the products' environmental footprints.\n- Continuation of the multi-year projects aimed at rationalising the use of raw materials, which are being rolled out across all technologies and regions, developing new process concepts with the potential to directly reduce our scope 3 emissions.\n\n#### **Vehicle light-weighting**\n\nHelping make vehicles lighter is a key thrust of CIE Automotive's innovation strategy due to its contribution to reducing the use of raw materials, lowering fuel consumption in an internal combustion vehicle while in use or increasing the autonomy of an electric vehicle:\n\n- Aluminium forging for chassis and suspension parts, achieving very compelling mechanical property ratios relative to weight\n- Technology shift marked by increased use of polymer materials, reducing the bill of materials by adding functions\n- Development of the new thin roof concept which weighs less and takes up less space\n- Reducing roof weights by using resin transfer moulding (RTM) frames\n\n## **Helping make vehicles lighter is a key thrust** of CIE Automotive's\n\ninnovation strategy\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive. The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" in a sans-serif font.

The number of data control and capture sensors embedded in its equipment and production is growing all the time. In parallel, collaborative robots (cobots) are popping up on its production lines, providing employees with real-time information over new interfaces. In addition, data analytics is being used in a growing number of technologies, underpinned by increasingly efficient deep learning algorithms available in tools requiring lowcode programming.\n\nIn 2023, the company finished the demo for a new intralogistics platform for the automation of the transportation of finished products with the goal of establishing a continuous loop for the delivery and collection of finished product packaging for storage up high in the warehouse.\n\nCurrent mobility trends point to improving the user experience shaped by a keen interest in comfort and connectivity. Against this backdrop, CIE Automotive is innovating intensely in its roof systems area, specifically:\n\nThis solution adds flexibility, efficiency and traceability to the logistics processes by means of the smart management of different sensors and mobile devices, including automotive guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). These devices are being integrated into the factories' existing management systems and other sensors to give users visibility and control in real time using 5G technology. The 5G standard is crucial on account of the massive volumes of data involved, the density of the devices, the broad coverage required in spaces like these and the immediacy needed for the entire intralogistics ecosystem to work optimally.\n\nIn tandem the company has added cobots in assembly and inspection operations and when using chemical products. The use of these collaborative robots enables more precise product dosing and delivers a significant reduction in their environmental impact.\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/16 description: The image shows a light orange car icon with rounded edges. The car has a simple, cartoonish design with two circular headlights and a curved line representing a smile or grill. The car's body is a single, solid color, and the background is white.\n\n- Integrating lighting into glass or shading.\n- Reducing noise by means of the use of brushless motors.\n- Adding shading-glass.\n- Improving user ergonomics by electrifying side windows and shades and introducing self-opening luggage covers.\n- Improving aesthetics and style by means of flush door panes.\n- Adding solutions featuring photochromatic glass.\n- Introducing panoramic screens.\n- Making roofs that take up less space.\n- Improving the compartment space.\n\n### **INDUSTRY 4.0**\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/20 description: The image contains the words \"NEW\", \"MOBILITY\", and \"CONCEPT\" stacked vertically.

At present it is working on a number of projects designed to provide, from the development phase, more accurate predictions of how parts and systems will perform throughout their use phase in a number of possible scenarios.\n\nMore specifically, the company is working to improve product performance in terms of noise and vibrations considering frequency dependent characteristics so as to enhance prediction from the design phase.\n\nIt is also optimising the design process around crash events by improving how it models the joins and interactions between parts to make vehicles safer in the event of accidents or impacts.\n\nLastly, new requirements have been added throughout the entire process with the aim\n\nof achieving zero defects and ultimately maximising product safety and customer satisfaction.\n\nUsing widely accepted sector methodologies, all the possible ways a product could become a risk are identified every step of the way, from product conception to manufacture, prioritising those sources of risk and generating action plans to reduce their likelihood of occurrence and severity, radically mitigating any potential malfunction in the products we deliver our customers.\n\n### **SAFETY**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/10 description: The image shows a shield with a check mark inside a circle.

It delivered a profit of €320.2 million, up 6.7% from 2022, having lifted its revenue to €3.96 billion, against the backdrop of recovering vehicle production volumes, high interest rates and persistent inflation.**\n\nTopline growth, of 3.1% from 2022, combined with efficient team management, unlocked double-digit growth in operating profit: EBITDA increased by 12.6% to €713.2 million, while EBIT was 18.1% higher at €527.7 million.\n\nThese figures highlight the solidity of the business model, articulated around geographic, customer and technological diversification, and the merits of focusing on cash generation. The company's healthy earnings performance was also helped by the disappearance of less competitive suppliers unable to withstand the supply chain friction, firstly, and the rise in borrowing costs after that.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

These factories were specialised in truck parts for the European market, a business that was less profitable for the group. After 10 years of continuous improvements to increase their profitability, CIE Automotive was able to sell the factories for €55.5 million, equivalent to 5 times their EBITDA.\n\nThe main rationale for the disposal is to redirect financial and managerial resources to more profitable markets, including regions with higher growth potential and technologies in greater demand from the group's customers, in line with the sector megatrends (decarbonisation, vehicle light-weighting, comfort, etc.).\n\n#### **2023 EARNINGS**\n\n## **CIE Automotive acquired Iber-Oleff Brasil for €20 million**, a multiple of 6.7 times its EBITDA\n\n*(\\*) EBITDA: Net operating result + Amortization, EBIT: Net operating result, Net profit: Result attributable to the shareholders of the parent company.*\n\n*(\\*\\*) The percentage operating margins are not comparable to those of previous years due to the inflationary environment and its derivatives.*\n\nIn 2023 the company generated €447.4 million of operating cash flow, which is equivalent to 65% of EBITDA, in line with the 2025 Strategic Plan target. Thanks to this healthy cash flow, the group was able to pay out more than €100 million of dividends to its shareholders and resume its longstanding M&A strategy, acquiring Iber-Oleff in Brazil.\n\n| € m                | 2022    | 2023    | Chg. %   |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Revenue            | 3,838.6 | 3,959.5 | 3.1%     |\n| EBITDA *           | 633.4   | 713.2   | 12.6%    |\n| EBITDA margin % ** | 16.5%   | 18.0%   | 1.5 p.p. |\n| EBIT *             | 446.7   | 527.7   | 18.1%    |\n| EBIT margin % *    | 11.6%   | 13.3%   | 1.7 p.p. |\n| Net profit **      | 300.1   | 320.2   | 6.7%     |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n| 2 | Ready<br>for change                               |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 3 | Record<br>earnings                                |\n| 4 | Common<br>responsibility,<br>shared benefits      |\n| 5 | Our response to<br>the environmental<br>challenge |\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n**3.2**\n\n# **Earnings performance by region**\n\n**All of the group's markets made a positive contribution in 2023, delivering doubledigit EBITDA and EBIT margins, despite very different conditions from one region to another.

Faced with higher borrowing costs on the back of successive interest rate increases, which put the weakest suppliers in serious jeopardy, the company locked in the liquidity and term structure needed by refinancing its debt and increasing the share of its borrowings at fixed rates to 54.5%. In parallel, it continued to honour its sustainability commitments by tying its borrowing costs to delivery of those pledges.**\n\nCIE Automotive's net debt came down by approximately €143.5 million in 2023 for an adjusted year-end balance of €1.13 billion, implying a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.56x. That leaves the company in a comfortable position for undertaking new strategic investments designed to further its profitable growth and reinforce its position in highgrowth markets.\n\nThe reduction in net debt was enabled by the generation of €447.4 million of operating cash flow (which is around 65% of EBITDA, in line with the 2025 Strategic Plan targets), which translated into €276.5 million of cash flow (after growth CAPEX, working capital and other items).\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 1highlights**\n\n**Ready 2for change**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-60-0\"></span>**ANNUAL REPORT**\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **COMPARATIVE BALANCE SHEET**\n\n#### **DEBT STRUCTURE**\n\n#### **FINANCIAL RATIOS**\n\n*(\\*) Net debt and EBITDA figures adjusted for the group's 50% interest in the Chinese JV, SAMAP.*\n\n#### **Diversification of financing sources**\n\nCIE Automotive works with a number of banks to finance its activities. As a result, its credit risk is not concentrated. At year-end 2023, CIE Automotive had undrawn credit lines totalling €78 million (total limit under these facilities: €768 million).\n\n## • Loan in euros • Price band based on net debt/EBITDA • 250

The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The letter \"C\" is formed by two curved lines that do not fully connect, creating an incomplete circle. The text \"CIE Automotive\" is written in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" in black, with a gray quotation mark above the \"2\". A dashed line runs horizontally through the middle of the \"2\".\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/9 description: The image contains two line charts. The first line chart shows data points ranging from approximately -0.25 to 4.0. The x-axis is labeled with dates from 01-07-22 to 01-12-23. The y-axis ranges from -0.5 to 4.5. The second line chart shows data points ranging from approximately 2.3 to 5.6. The x-axis is labeled with dates from 01-07-22 to 01-12-23. The y-axis ranges from 2.0 to 6.0.\n\n#### **DEBT MATURITY PROFILE**\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/7 description: The image contains two text labels. The first label reads \"3-MONTH EURIBOR (July 2022 - December 2023)\". The second label reads \"SOFR + 3M SPREAD\\*\".\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/8 description: The image contains the text \"SOFR + 3M SPREAD\" in a bold, sans-serif font. The text is arranged on a single line and appears to be the primary focus of the image.\n\n *(\\*) The SOFR Overnight plus a spread of 0.2616% (the 3-month spread)*\n\n#### **Trend in interest rates**\n\nInterest rates were once again a unique force in 2023. Whereas official rates were increased further in the US and Europe, market rates took a different course. 12-month Euribor increased slightly and longer-term rates, using the 5-year IRS as proxy, ended the year lower, as did the equivalent American proxy.\n\nTherefore, it looks as if the actions taken by the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve have effectively anchored inflation expectations, prompting the market to decouple from the increases in official rates and even start to discount rate cuts in 2024. Favourable conditions in the equity and fixed-income markets went a long way to facilitating this performance.\n\n| € m                     | 2022           | 2023           |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Within one year         | 472.0          | 511.7          |\n| Between 1 and 2 years   | 701.3          | 315.6          |\n| Between 3 and 5 years   | 820.7          | 1,266.3        |\n| More than 5 years       | 147.1          | 75.9           |\n| <b>Total borrowings</b> | <b>2,141.1</b> | <b>2,169.5</b> |\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Since then it has been working to standardise its financing arrangements so that all new agreements include a sustainability clause whereby the rate of interest comes down if the company meets its ESG targets.\n\nMoody's is the independent agency tasked with certifying compliance with these commitments.\n\nCIE Automotive renewed and extended its syndicated loan from 2027 to 2028 **with the backing of all of the banks in the pool**\n\nS\nt\ns\n\ne\nng\n\ne\ny\n\n#### **Strategy**\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/11 description: The image contains text describing how central banks' interest rate increases have led CIE Automotive to take measures to minimize the impact on its financing strategy.\n\nThe fact that its liquidity buffer stood at €1.73 billion at year-end 2023 is evidence of the merit of the financial management undertaken by the company to safeguard its solvency in the face of potential market risks.\n\nIn addition, in 2023 the company continued to increase the volume of gross borrowings arranged at fixed rates to mitigate the risk of even higher interest rates, while leaving margin for benefitting from potential rate cuts in the near term.\n\nBy way of illustration, at year-end 2021, 35% of the group's gross debt were fixed-rate borrowings, a level which increased to 50% by the end of 2022 and stood at 55% by yearend 2023.\n\nImage /page/63/Figure/15 description: The image shows a gray icon of a calendar with a euro symbol on the lower left side.

The y-axis represents percentage change, ranging from -80% to 60%. In 2023, CIE Automotive shows a 20% change, STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts shows a 2% change, and IBEX 35 shows a 1% change.\n\n*(\\*) PER: relationship between the share price and profit.*\n\n## Share price performance\n\n#### **CIE AUTOMOTIVE'S STOCK MARKET INDICATORS**\n\n#### **SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE, 2018-2023**\n\nCIE Automotive's shares gained 7% in 2023 to end the year at €25.72. This moderate performance contrasts with stronger gains in the Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts (+19%) and Ibex 35 (+23%), due, in part, to a more stringent base effect in the case of the company's shares. Over the past five years, CIE Automotive's share price has increased by 20%, significantly outperforming the Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts (which gained 2% over that timeframe) and the Ibex 35 (just 1%). Comparing CIE Automotive's share price with the corrections sustained by most of the parts makers included in the broader sector index, the difference is even more striking.\n\nOver the course of 2023, however, there continued to be a lag between CIE Automotive's fundamentals and its share price performance. Specifically, its share price remained well below the consensus target price of €31.38 assigned by the universe of analysts that follow the company. In contrast to other automotive parts makers, the company has not had to issue any profit warnings in the face of the recent sector complexity, remaining among the top three sector players in terms of profitability and growth prospects.\n\nHowever, these achievements have not been priced in by the market. The automotive industry is not currently attractive to investors and mediumcap stocks are not managing to attract funds from the major investment funds, a combination that is not helping CIE Automotive. On top of this, liquidity fell in 2022, particularly after the company exited the Ibex 35 index.\n\nThe company's share price performance over the last year should not cloud its performance over a longer time horizon. Over the last five years, for example, CIE Automotive's share price has staged a stellar performance by comparison with its sector peers. CIE Automotive's share price has gained 20% over that period, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts has traded sideways.\n\n|                                         | 2021        | 2022        | 2023        |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of shares at year-end            | 122,550,000 | 122,550,000 | 119,807,484 |\n| Share price at year-end (€)             | 27.36       | 24.06       | 25.72       |\n| Market capitalisation at year-end (€ m) | 3,352.9     | 2,948.6     | 3,081.4     |\n| Average trading volume                  | 183,009     | 160,965     | 50,429      |\n| P/E multiple*                           | 12.6        | 9.7         | 9.6         |\n\n|                                         | 2021        | 2022        | 2023        |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of shares at year-end            | 122,550,000 | 122,550,000 | 119,807,484 |\n| Share price at year-end (€)             | 27.36       | 24.06       | 25.72       |\n| Market capitalisation at year-end (€ m) | 3,352.9     | 2,948.6     | 3,081.4     |\n| Average trading volume                  | 183,009     | 160,965     | 50,429      |\n| P/E multiple*                           | 12.6        | 9.7         | 9.6         |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n|   | Common          |\n|---|-----------------|\n| 4 | responsibility, |\n|   | shared benefits |\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/73/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

On the BSE, the Indian company's share price rallied by 34.4% to end the year at INR 470.65, marking a high for the year of INR 549.25; on the NSE the share price gained 34.5% to end the year at INR 470.70, having peaked during the year at INR 549.45. The share price spiked on the back of the company name change to CIE Automotive India, completion of the disposal of the truck parts forging business in Germany and the company's steady earnings momentum. It cooled from annual highs due to the slowdown in some end user segments.\n\nDemand in the Indian automotive market was mixed: growth was healthy in the light vehicle segment, while the tractor and twowheel segments were flat. The European automotive market had a good year although the two wars along its borders left investors feeling uncertain. In general, automotive related stocks performed well in India.

Most notably, it once again attended the J.P. Morgan European Automotive Conference and the Santander Autos Day, along with players of the calibre of BMW, Mercedes or Renault. For the first time it also participated in the ESN/Gaesco Conference, which took place in Paris.\n\nFramed by its mission of helping more potential investors get to know the company, it also organised six site visits, bringing investors for the first time to the CIE Vilanova factory, the group's largest aluminium casting facility in terms of sales.\n\nIn parallel, the team stayed in constant contact with the analysts that cover the company, a total of 15 this year. The Investor Relations Department responded to their enquiries about different aspects of CIE Automotive's business and strategy, including the Indian market's potential, the company's strategy in China and its M&A activity, among other matters.\n\nIt also fielded interest in ESG aspects, most notably the independence of the Board of Directors and the use of ESG criteria to determine remuneration.\n\nIn addition to its recurring communication and outreach efforts, the Investor Relations Department analysed a number of different investment segments with a view to broadening the shareholder base and boosting trading volumes. The actions taken and segments studied were the following:\n\nstudied the matter with two brokers with a strong presence in Spain, the conclusion reached was that this investor universe is currently focused\n\n• Analysis of a potential dual listing with the help of the IEAF IR Club, which specialises in listed Spanish companies.

CIE Automotive stood out again in the Small & Midcap category.\n\n#### **Analyst breakfast**\n\nThe company held its traditional Analyst Day in November, which was attended this year by the CEO, Jesús Mari Herrera. During a breakfast event, the CEO went over all of the topics of current interest at the company, highlighting the ease with which it is delivering its ambitious strategic targets for 2025, in spite of the significant deterioration in the macroeconomic and sector environments, as well as signalling the likely intensification in M&A activity during the second half of the Strategic Plan's time horizon. The event was attended by all of the houses that cover CIE Automotive.\n\n#### **Analyst survey**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive conducted an Analyst Satisfaction Survey in which 13 analysts participated. The main goal was to evaluate the transparency and effectiveness of the Investor Relations Department's communication effort. The 29 aspects assessed, including team availability, feedback received and response times, were positively rated by all of the participants.\n\nThe idea is to use this feedback to strengthen relations with analysts and investors in 2024, ensuring clear and timely communication and greater transparency when disclosing important developments.\n\nThe recent analyst survey has yielded valuable insight, painting a very positive overall picture, while highlighting certain areas for improvement. The highest rated aspects included the availability, flexibility and sector knowledge displayed by the IR team, qualities that facilitate the analysts' work. The analysts also valued the participation by management in earnings presentations and investor meetings. The main area for improvement flagged by the analysts relates to additional disclosures in the financial information published, an aspect which the company is analysing and working on.\n\n## In 2023, CIE Automotive conducted an analyst satisfaction survey **to evaluate 29 aspects of the IR Department's transparency and communication effort**\n\n**CC**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

This certification rewards the factory for its performance in terms of quality and logistics and allows it to opt for new tenders as Ford is rationalising its supplier portfolio and prioritising those with Q1 certification.\n\n### **Brazil**\n\n• Customer diversification in this region, with a presence in active projects and new orders for Asian, European and American automotive sector customers, is positioning CIE Automotive as a benchmark supplier of automotive parts for all the OEMs present in the region.\n\n#### **Asia**\n\n• Start of line production for a series of projects using different technologies focused on key parts for electric vehicles in India.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Its reputation is underpinned by constant improvement of its products and processes by means of prevention, systematic revision, training and know-how sharing, framed by its Environment Policy.\n\nFocused on excellence, the company complies with the IATF 16949 quality standard, which is specific to the automotive industry and harmonises the different assessment and certification systems in the supply chain. It is also working to obtain environmental management (ISO 14001) and occupational health and safety management (ISO 45001) certification at all its factories. To manage these three standards, the company has a global certification agreement with TÜV RHEINLAND until 2024.\n\nCompliance with IATF 16949 implies compliance with the associated consumer health and safety measures, even though as a B2B company, CIE Automotive does not have any contact with end vehicle\n\nThat technical specification pass-through to suppliers such as CIE Automotive means that reparability, disassembly and recyclability criteria that improve vehicle end life are also taken into consideration.\n\nIn 2023, the company did not incur any significant fines related with consumer safety or with incidents of non-compliance with product information and labelling requirements.\n\nusers. Nevertheless the OEMs pass on to CIE Automotive their product and project technical specifications and requirements to ensure that each part contributes to guaranteeing the safety of the vehicles ultimately put on the market.\n\nImage /page/85/Figure/13 description: The image shows five icons, each with a title below it.

Under this programme, projects are being ranked by geography for close monitoring. Last year the company also organised internal communication seminars, shared best practices and developed new procedures for scaling up incidents with the goal of avoiding not only legal noncompliance but indeed any source of customer dissatisfaction.\n\nThe company focused on the prevention of possible defects, an effort that included the reinforcement of procedures and controls, enhanced traceability of all products, analysis of the causes of potential defects and constant communication with its customers.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is one of CIE's key success factors. To that end, the company has a satisfaction control system that measures, tracks and analyses customer feedback with the aim of proposing improvements at the various factories, where needed.\n\nThis system is used to assess each factory's performance and to quantify customer perceptions on the basis of audits, assessments and current data. That information is then used to compile an annual report and draw up corrective action plans as necessary.\n\n### **Consumer claims, complaints and grievance systems**\n\nDespite its best efforts on the product quality front, both preventive during the design and industrialisation phases and corrective during manufacturing, on occasion deviations lead to customer claims.\n\nWhen that happens, it is vital to react immediately to prevent the supply of nonconforming parts and conduct in-depth analysis of the root causes. The solutions provided are shared with and applied to all potentially affected facilities and technologies.\n\nThe company did not receive any significant fines or penalties as a result of legal proceedings related with incidents of noncompliance with product information or labelling in 2023.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/22 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Given the nature of this work, it is vital to duly guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive information at the corporate and individual division levels. To that end the company is working on an information safekeeping project guided by the following standards:\n\n- Compliance with benchmark international standards, including ISO 27001, ISO 27005 and ISO/IEC 27002/2005. In 2021, CIE Automotive's Engineering Centre in Spain obtained the TISAX Label, which is based on ISO 27001 criteria, and in 2022 and 2023 it extended the seal to new countries.\n- Process re-engineering and social engineering adapted for the organisation's specific needs.\n- Real-time management of information security.\n\nThe company did not receive any significant fines for non-compliance with data protection laws or regulations in 2023.\n\nNor did it receive any significant fines or penalties as a result of legal proceedings related with incidents of non-compliance with product information or labelling during the reporting period.\n\nThe Systems Manager is the executive ultimate responsible for security, also carrying out information security director functions.\n\n### **Eco-design**\n\nThe introduction of eco-design criteria at the earliest stages of product development helps minimise the impact of CIE Automotive's products during the manufacturing process and also when the end vehicles are in use. At this stage, and in collaboration with its customers, the company builds reparability,\n\ndisassembly and final recycling criteria into its designs in order to improve the circularity of the end product; despite the fact that disassembly and recycling are the responsibility of its customers, CIE Automotive contributes its know-how in materials, processes and certain products.\n\n#### **Certifications and accolades**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive was named best supplier by a number of market-leading OEMs and organisations. Those accolades encourage it to press ahead with its continuous improvement and customer satisfaction efforts.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/16 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In addition, the company is tapping and nurturing young talent under internship and scholarship programmes.\n\nAs for its employees' education levels, reflecting its manufacturing profile, 68% are tradesmen and women, 28% are university graduates and 4% hold management positions.\n\nCIE Automotive values talent no matter where it hails from. That is evident in the fact that 89% of its factory managers are nationals from the country in which the factory is located. In addition, 92% of the members of its factory management committees are local professionals.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/7 description: The image shows the number 5 and the text \"Our response to the environmental challenge\".\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/90/Picture/20 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Inclusion of these people is heavily influenced by the sensitivities and legislation of each country. Europe and Brazil stand out, reporting considerably higher percentages.\n\nExcluding the impact of the discontinuation of the German forging businesses, which impacts this indicator notably as the number of employees with differing abilities at those factories was relatively high, the number of employees in this category would have increased by 20 year-on-year, implying growth in the number of people with differing abilities at the group of 7.5%.\n\nNote that this analysis relates only to employees with differing abilities that are directly hired by the group. In addition to its employees, CIE Automotive purchases a range of services from special employment centres and similar entities that support the integration of people with differing abilities into the workforce.\n\n### **Gender diversity**\n\nAs for gender diversity, 20% of the group's employees are women. It is common for this figure to be low in the world of manufacturing; nevertheless, CIE Automotive has been managing to bring this percentage slowly higher in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, helped by the completion of diversity assessments at nearly all of the group's facilities, a number of awareness and training drives and execution of factory-level equality plans that go beyond the group's legal requirements, the share of female employees increased by two points, from 18% to 20%. Indeed, the 2023 figure is the highest in the entire series, having increased by four points in recent years.\n\nCIE Automotive's predominantly male workforce is attributable to tradition in the automotive sector and restrictions on women accessing technical training at schools and universities. There are also cultural barriers in some countries that impede higher female representation at the factories as is evident in the differences between North America, where women hold 35% of all jobs, for example, and China, where they hold only 5%.\n\nThat b\nof fem\ngroup,\nEurope\nBrazil o\n\nThat being said, the two-point increase in the percentage of female employees in 2023 was felt across the entire group, albeit most pronounced in the Americas and Europe, increasing by three points in Europe, seven in Brazil and two in Mexico.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\nImage /page/91/Figure/6 description: The image shows the number 4 on the left, followed by the words \"Common responsibility, shared benefits\" on the right.\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/24 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

A dark gray shape, resembling a stylized letter 'D' or a partial circle, dominates the left side of the image. Inside this shape, there is a white, curved area that creates a sense of depth. To the right, a light orange shape forms a corner, intersecting with the gray shape and creating a sense of overlap. The overall effect is a modern and minimalist design with a focus on form and color.\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/8 description: The image is an abstract composition featuring a gray area on the left and a brown area on the right. A gradient orange circle is positioned between the two areas, partially overlapping both. The bottom of the image has a white strip.\n\nThe situation also varies by job category and level of seniority. Forty per cent of the members of the Management Committee are women, while female boardroom representation stands at 36%; five of the 14 directors are women.\n\n> In order to encourage more women to look at manufacturing positions in the long term, CIE Automotive is championing the provision of technical training to women from school age through its participation in the CIE STEM Planet project and, together with Innobasque, in the STEM careers chapter of the public sector \"Committed to talent\" initiative.\n\n|                                                   | 2022  | 2023  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| % of female employees                             | 18%   | 20%   |\n| % of new hires                                    | 19%   | 23%   |\n| % of women on the group's<br>Management Committee | 40%   | 40%   |\n| % of women on the Board of<br>Directors           | 36%   | 36%   |\n| % gender pay gap*                                 | 94.9% | 92.4% |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready for change**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\n**CIE Automotive**\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in black, with a large gray quotation mark and the number \"23\" in black to the right of the words.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n**GENDER PAY GAP**\n\n#### **GENDER PAY GAP BY SIGNIFICANT LOCATIONS**\n\n**SPAIN**\n\n**GER**\n\nSLO\n\nCZE\n\n**ROM**\n\n**US**\n\nMEX\n\nDDA\n\n**INDIA**\n\nASIA\n\n#### **Gender pay gap**\n\nThe gender pay gap increased by around two percentage points in 2023 from 2022. The average earnings of the company's female employees amounted to 92.4% of what the men earn on average, compared to 94.9% in 2022.\n\nSpecifically, female employees earned €17,510 on average, compared to the €18,960 earned by the men. It is important to note that the salaries were converted to euros at yearend exchange rates and include the salaries of all of the group's factories and offices, so that the indicator considers people from different regions, with different technical skills and from countries with markedly different levels of economic, social and labour market development.\n\nThe increase in the gender pay gap in 2023 is primarily attributable to two factors:\n\nImage /page/93/Figure/29 description: This image is a bar chart comparing data from 2022 and 2023 for CIE Automotive in different regions and countries. The chart includes data for Europe, specifically Spain, Germany, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Romania. It also includes data for Asia, specifically China and India, and North America, specifically the US and Mexico. Finally, it includes data for Brazil. The data for 2022 is as follows: Europe: 94.9%, Spain: 78%, Germany: 94%, Slovakia: 89%, Czech Republic: 77%, Romania: 80%, China: 88%, India: 77%, US: 78%, Mexico: 71%, and Brazil: 77%. The data for 2023 is as follows: Europe: 92.4%, Spain: 81%, Germany: 87%, Slovakia: 88%, Czech Republic: 75%, Romania: 85%, China: 89%, India: 79%, US: 76%, Mexico: 65%, and Brazil: 74%.\n\n- The first, which is not entirely within the group's control, is the situation at the factories newly acquired in Hungary and Brazil, where the pay gap before their acquisition was above the group average, so bringing the 2023 group average down.\n- The second relates to a development within the group, which is working hard to bring more women to work at its factories. These new hires are concentrated in entry-level positions, where starting salaries are lower, so that comparisons between male and female pay without considering job categories increases the pay gap. It is likely, however, that as these new female employees develop their careers at the group, gaining experience and taking on new responsibilities, the pay gap in these lower categories will narrow. As shown in the table below, female wages are only lower than male wages in the lower job categories (tradespeople).\n\n|                                     |               |                  | 2022  |  |               |                  |       |  | 2023 |  |  |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|--|---------------|------------------|-------|--|------|--|--|\n| AGGREGATE pay gap                   | No. of people | Average earnings | % gap |  | No. of people | Average earnings | % gap |  |      |  |  |\n| Men                                 | 20,332        | 18,969           |       |  | 20,580        | 18,960           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Women                               | 4,573         | 17,997           | 94.9% |  | 4,945         | 17,510           | 92.4% |  |      |  |  |\n| Gender pay gap BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY |               |                  |       |  |               |                  |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Executives - M                      | 871           | 65,747           |       |  | 894           | 64,797           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Executives - W                      | 112           | 63,713           | 97%   |  | 118           | 66,443           | 103%  |  |      |  |  |\n| Graduates - M                       | 5,731         | 22,059           |       |  | 5,771         | 22,268           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Graduates - W                       | 1,169         | 24,214           | 110%  |  | 1,210         | 25,108           | 113%  |  |      |  |  |\n| Tradesmen                           | 13,730        | 14,711           |       |  | 13,915        | 14,642           |       |  |      |  |  |\n| Tradeswomen                         | 3,292         | 14,229           | 97%   |  | 3,617         | 13,371           | 91%   |  |      |  |  |\n\nEUR\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/27 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

As a result, the 2025 Strategic Plan sets the target of carrying out diversity & inclusion assessments at 100% of its factories so as to get a global snapshot of diversity across the group and take the opportune measures.\n\nAt year-end 2023, those assessments had been completed at 98 factories around the world, 93% of the 105 factories under the scope of the Plan (all except those acquired after 2020). Each factory establishes an action plan on the basis of the information obtained and conclusions it yields. Note that CIE Automotive manages diversity using the same decentralised approach as it applies to the rest\n\nof its management efforts and it is therefore up to each factory, based on the hard data, the environment in which it operates and the knowledge of the local managers to establish which areas of diversity they want to work on and set their own measures and action plans. Execution of the action plans is monitored by the factories themselves and by the corporate Human Resources Department.\n\n#### **EUROPE**\n\n### *Factory level assessments and action plans*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

 |\n\nA good place to work\n\nCIE Automotive offers its employees decent working conditions, remuneration in line with the work they perform and the training and safety conditions needed to do their jobs. It respects its employees' right to exercise freedom of association and to collective bargaining, regardless of the country they are working in.\n\nThese commitments are formally enshrined in the company's Human Rights Policy, which is signed by all factory and HR managers, and is worded in conformity with the International Labor Organization's fundamental conventions and the labour principles set down in the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nTo ensure those rights are upheld, the company conducts a survey every year to identify the factories at risk of breaching them, taking opportune measures as necessary. In 2023, 100% of the group's factories reported that they had identified no such risks.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/17 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

By region, permanent contracts represent 96% of the total in Europe and Brazil, compared to 79% in North America and 71% in Asia.\n\nThe large majority of CIE Automotive employees work full-time, with just 112 employees working part-time.\n\n#### **Wages**\n\nCIE Automotive is committed to providing a living wage to all its employees, regardless of where they work. That commitment is duly enshrined in its Human Rights Policy, which, in addition to pledging to protect its people's health, prevent discrimination and reject the use of compulsory or child labour, promises to provide decent work, specifically committing to paying them in accordance with their skills and knowledge, complying with labour legislation in all its markets, guaranteeing its employees' right to rest irrespective of prevailing labour laws and, to the extent possible, providing flexible working hours.\n\nAmong the controls performed around the provision of a living wage, CIE Automotive verifies the pay situation at the companies it acquires during the first year of integration to ensure that the lowest wages paid exceed the minimum wage and obtain evidence, albeit limited, that the wages paid by the companies acquired are at least reasonable for the market in\n\nquestion.

Nearly 7,000 employees also received a bonus in 2023 as a result of delivery of set targets and/ or excellent or improved performances.\n\nAside from wages, the company supports its employees with a series of company benefits which enhance their and their families' quality of living and generate a sense of belonging. These benefits entailed an investment of close to €35 million in 2023.\n\n| By contract type | Year-end 2022* | Year-end 2023 |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Permanent        | 21,112         | 20,859        |\n| Temporary        | 3,874          | 4,435         |\n| Total            | 24,986         | 25,294        |\n| Full-time        | 24,843         | 25,182        |\n| Part-time        | 143            | 112           |\n| Total            | 24,986         | 25,294        |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The image is divided into two columns. The left column contains a list of topics: Chairman and CEO's statement, 2023 highlights, Ready for change, Record earnings, Common responsibility, shared benefits, Our response to the environmental challenge, Responsible management, About this report, and Data tables. The right column contains information about the company's health insurance, food services, transport assistance, and education programs. The health insurance program provides €21 million in health insurance or in-house medical services. The food services program provides €7 million earmarked to food services. The transport assistance program provides €7 million of transport assistance. The education program provides €0.5 million earmarked to education.\n\n### **Organisation of working hours**\n\nIn keeping with its decentralised management approach, CIE Automotive introduces flexibility and work-life balance measures suited to the needs of each factory, division or country.\n\nThe most common measures across the group include staggered work start and end times; adjustment of working hours to protect family time; the possibility of working from home; days of maternity and paternity leave beyond the legally stipulated minimum; and specific care for pregnant employees.\n\nAmong those widespread initiatives it is worth highlighting those designed to facilitate work-life balance and encourage joint responsibility for parenting; these measures were in place at over 80% of the group's workplaces in 2023.\n\n#### **EMPLOYEE SUPPORT**\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

This percentage is relatively stable and is only partially manageable by the company as it is influenced by exogenous factors such as the age of specific groups of factory workers and the general economic situation in the regions where the company has operations.\n\n#### **Communication**\n\nThe main channels used to reach out to employees are the dashboard and corporate intranet. There is also a six-monthly newsletter in which the company shares the most significant financial and business developments, as well as reporting on social and environmental aspects.\n\nTo learn what is of concern to its employees, CIE Automotive conducts a workplace climate survey at every factory every two years. It carried out 38 such surveys in 2023, obtaining an average score of 7 points out of 10.\n\n#### Improved facility maintenance in Mexico and Morocco\n\nImplementation of facility improvements in the lunchroom and water dispensers to ensure a comfortable and functional work climate.\n\nRefurbishment of the bathrooms and provision of lockers to factory workers, as well as enhancement of the changing rooms and storage areas.\n\n#### Improved employee listening and grievance mechanisms in Mexico and Morocco\n\nOngoing publicity of the channels for voicing grievances and suggestions with regular publication of their status and outcome monitoring sessions in a bid to improve internal communication.\n\n#### Introduction of flexibility and work-life balance measures in Spain\n\nIntroduction of flexible working arrangements to allow employees to manage their working hours, so fostering a healthy balance between work and home life.\n\n#### Team-building activities at several Mexican factories\n\nOrganisation of regular team-building activities to foster a sense of belonging and collaboration, so improving relations within the company.\n\n#### Noise safety awareness drive at CIE Matic\n\nRollout of an awareness campaign addressing the importance of using personnel protection gear (PPE) to improve noise conditions in specific positions.\n\n#### Design and implementation of recognition mechanisms at severak Mexican factories\n\nDevelopment and execution of new mechanisms for acknowledging employees, so fostering a positive workplace climate.\n\n#### Reinforcement of information about internal vacancies at several factories\n\nPublication and publicity of vacancies on the various internal communication platforms which can be searched by specific skills and position criteria.\n\nThe results of those surveys are used to draw up annual or two-year plans for improving employee satisfaction. The initiatives set in motion in 2023 to improve the workplace climate included:\n\nChairman and CEO's\n\n[statement](#page-2-0) **2023**\n\n**[highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**[for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Ready 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n| 5 | Our response to the environmental challenge |\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/26 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The breakdown by employee category was more than 96,000 hours for executives, over 228,000 hours for university graduates and over 483,000 hours for factory workers.\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/23 description: The image contains three tables. The first table, titled \"TRAINING HOURS BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY\", shows the number of training hours and the number of employees receiving training in 2022 and 2023. For Executives, the training hours were 25,015 in 2022 and 96,142 in 2023, with 726 employees receiving training in 2022 and 678 in 2023. For Graduates, the training hours were 223,042 in 2022 and 228,425 in 2023, with 5,888 employees receiving training in 2022 and 5,782 in 2023. For Tradesmen and women, the training hours were 564,275 in 2022 and 483,239 in 2023, with 13,970 employees receiving training in 2022 and 13,823 in 2023. The total training hours were 812,332 in 2022 and 807,806 in 2023, with 20,584 employees receiving training in 2022 and 20,283 in 2023. The second table, titled \"TRAINING IN 2023\", shows the hours and employees trained by gender. For hours, men had 599,973 and women had 207,833, totaling 807,806. For employees trained, men had 15,763 and women had 4,520, totaling 20,283. The third table, titled \"EMPLOYEES RECEIVING TRAINING BY GENDER, %\", shows the percentage of employees receiving training in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, 82% of employees received training, while in 2023, 80% of employees received training.\n\nAlthough the majority of employees who benefitted from training programme were men, reflecting the company's predominantly male workforce, the number of training hours received by female employees (46 hours per female employee trained) was higher compared to their male colleagues (38 hours per male employee trained). That phenomenon was common to all regions.\n\n|                            | Men     | Women   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Hours                      | 599,973 | 207,833 | 807,806 |\n| Employees trained          | 15,763  | 4,520   | 20,283  |\n| CIE Automotive people      | 20,169  | 5,125   | 25,294  |\n| Hours per employee trained | 38.1    | 46.0    | 39.8    |\n| Hours per employee         | 29.7    | 40.6    | 32.0    |\n\n|                                           | 2022 | 202 |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|-----|--|\n| Employees receiving<br>training, %        | 82%  | 80% |  |\n| Male employees<br>receiving training, %   | 80%  | 78% |  |\n| Female employees<br>receiving training, % | 85%  | 88% |  |\n\n| Female employees<br>receiving training, % | 85% | 88% |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----|-----|\n\n|                     |         | Number of training<br>hours | No. of employees<br>receiving training |        |\n|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|\n| EMPLOYEE CATEGORY   | 2022    | 2023                        | 2022                                   | 2023   |\n| Executives          | 25,015  | 96,142                      | 726                                    | 678    |\n| Graduates           | 223,042 | 228,425                     | 5,888                                  | 5,782  |\n| Tradesmen and women | 564,275 | 483,239                     | 13,970                                 | 13,823 |\n| TOTAL               | 812,332 | 807,806                     | 20,584                                 | 20,283 |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

A good part of the company's training effort is decentralised, taking place at each factory, in keeping with the guidelines set down in the Training Plan Procedure. That plan indicates the phases each factory's training programmes need to follow: identification of training needs, planning, definition, execution, evaluation and feedback.\n\nEvery year the corporate Human Resources Department also presents a comprehensive plan for CIE Automotive factories covering centralised training initiatives targeting advanced management skills, interpersonal skills, sustainability, corporate ethics and other core aspects.\n\nThe training provided in 2023 emphasised traditional core areas of people management (health and safety, soft skills, and technical training) and other subjects that are relatively new in the world of business, such as ESG and human rights.\n\n#### **ESG training**\n\nESG training is one of the group's top\n\n## priorities.

Thanks to this initiative, young professionals from different plants and of different nationalities attend an excellence training centre in the Basque region before going on to build their skills at the group's emblematic factories in Spain and Italy.\n\nThis programme delivers four key objectives: embedding the group's values; facilitating cross-country communication going\n\nforward; fostering intragroup relationships; and providing the group with highly skilled professionals.\n\nSince resuming the programme in the wake of the pandemic, it has been expanded to the point of exceeding the Strategic Plan target. Currently, 17 students from four countries (Brazil, Czech Republic, India and Mexico) are participating in the newest edition of the Ulysses Programme, which began in October 2023, so topping the figures established in the 2025 Strategic Plan, which called for 15 participants from three different markets. Moreover, the retention rate, two years after completing the programme, currently stands at 90% for the first edition and 100% for the second edition, likewise delivering the related Strategic Plan retention rate target of at least 80%.\n\n#### **TARGET DELIVERY**\n\nThe Ulysses Programme **combines mobility and talent attraction**\n\n#### **Phases of the programme**\n\nThe Ulysses programme is structured into two distinct phases:\n\n#### **Phase 1:**\n\nDepending on the originating factory, the students participate in different technology modules (polymers, metal and metal injection). There are also two common modules addressing key soft skills and the company's lean management philosophy: Entrepreneurship & Innovation and Lean Manufacturing.\n\n#### **Phase 2:**\n\nThe students spend several months at a factory. A large number of CIE Automotive's legacy plants are involved in this training initiative, including CIE Orbelan, CIE Inyectametal, CIE Udalbide, CIE Egaña and CIE Galfor, among others, as well as the corporate Engineering Department, the corporate Controller Department and the Laboratory located in AIC - Amorebieta.\n\nNew this year was the incorporation of youths from Eastern Europe and the provision of training development of structural staff, unlike previous exercises that focused only on production plant personnel.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 1 2 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/18 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In 2023, 56% of the group's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nOver the course of the year, the company entered into 39 collective bargaining agreements (regional, sectoral and some factory-specific) at a number of facilities in the following countries: Mexico, Brazil, Spain, France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Romania, India and China.\n\nThese agreements feature specific obligations on the part of the company negotiated with the workers' representatives at each factory although they all tend to emphasise essential matters such as occupational health and safety.\n\n*(\\*) Includes 676 employees at the German operations classified as discontinued in 2022.*\n\n#### **EMPLOYEES COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BY COUNTRY**\n\n| Country

The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The \"C\" is formed by two curved shapes, one above the other, creating a circular form with a gap in the middle. The text \"CIE Automotive\" is in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"ANNUAL REPORT\" on the left side and the number \"23\" on the right side. The number 23 has a dashed line through it and a quotation mark above it.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Prevention of discriminatory practices**\n\nCIE Automotive introduced its Protocol for Preventing and Handling Workplace Harassment, which is binding upon all group facilities, in 2020. This protocol addresses the prevention of mobbing and of sexual or gender harassment and includes several preventive measures, such as zero-tolerance towards harassment, shared employee responsibility for monitoring workplace conduct and the implementation of communication programmes. The full text of the protocol is available for consultation on the corporate website.\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive received and managed 17 complaints related with matters addressed in the protocol, which is one more than in 2022. In the wake of these complaints, the group took significant disciplinary action, even laying off one of the employees involved.\n\nIt is important to note that when CIE Automotive integrates new companies, as it did in Hungary (CIE Salgglas) and Brazil (Iberoleff- CIE Autometal Salto) last year, the factory managers and HR heads are asked to sign the group's Harassment Protocol and Human Rights Policy by way of endorsement. As a result, the group's protocol and policy are binding upon all factories from the outset.\n\n#### **HOURS OF TRAINING ON HUMAN RIGHTS MATTERS**\n\nIn 2023 CIE Automotive imparted **25,000 hours of human rights training**\n\n#### **Fostering respect for human rights as a culture**\n\nCIE Automotive champions tolerance, dignity and fundamental human rights. To reinforce that, in 2023 it imparted 25,000 hours of related training. That means that roughly one in four employees received training on human rights last year.\n\n#### **Zero-tolerance stance on compulsory or child labour**\n\nCIE Automotive works to ensure there is no compulsory or child labour at its factories. Its hiring controls include preventive measures and minimum age controls in keeping with the ILO's standards or local legislation if more stringent. No instances of compulsory or child labour were detected in 2023.\n\n|                   | Men    | Women | Total  |\n|-------------------|--------|-------|--------|\n| 2022              |        |       |        |\n| Hours             | 13,193 | 6,438 | 19,631 |\n| Employees trained | 3,700  | 2,116 | 5,816  |\n| 2023              |        |       |        |\n| Hours             | 17,818 | 7,688 | 25,506 |\n| Employees trained | 4,820  | 2,255 | 7,075  |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready for change**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout\n\n[this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Expansion of this policy has yielded very encouraging results, as borne out by the fact that the group achieved record safety results in 2022, and then again in 2023.\n\n#### **HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY PRINCIPLES**\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/5 description: The image shows three shield icons. The first shield icon contains a white image of a group of people. The second shield icon contains a white image of a monitor. The third shield icon contains a white image of a gavel.\n\nConsideration of safety across all activities, tasks and levels. The physical, mental and emotional health of all of the people populating the value chain, including their psychological and social well-being, are unwavering and fundamental objectives for the group.\n\nPersonal safety always prevails. As a result, the company trains and raises awareness among all members of the organisation.\n\nSafety is intrinsic to the group's activities. To achieve it, CIE Automotive complies with prevailing legislation in all its markets, meets its stakeholders' expectations, while taking on other safety goals it seems fit.\n\nIt guarantees the health and safety of everyone working at the organisation and at any subcontractors coming to its places of work, involving them tirelessly in the continuous improvement effort by means of systematic reviews, consultation and participation, as well as defining objectives measured using our safety dashboard.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n109\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

To the right of the words is a large gray quotation mark and the number \"23\" in bold, black letters.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Figure/32 description: The image shows a flowchart with three levels. The top level is a black rounded rectangle containing the text \"Corporate OHS Department\". A line connects this to the second level, which is a white rounded rectangle containing the text \"Factory level OHS areas (one or more technicians)\". A line connects this to the third level, which is a white rounded rectangle containing the text \"Outside safety services as a preventive modality\".\n\nThe Health and Safety Policy is publicised at all levels of the organisation via direct delivery or email to all executives, heads, middle managers and workers' representatives. It also includes prevention plans that reach all levels of the organisation via manuals containing information about risks, preventive measures and emergency measures that are delivered to employees; they are also posted in visible places (such as notice boards or specially designated spaces) and publicised in other ways thought up by the various factory managers who are responsible for making sure the Health and Safety Policy is broadcast, understood, applied and kept updated.\n\nThe policy can be modified by management in light of contextual developments, changes in legal requirements, safety plan revisions or the results of the continuous improvement process.\n\n### **Occupational health and safety framework**\n\nThe company has devised an occupational health and safety (OHS) framework (process no. 12) in order to effectively manage all of the risks that could jeopardise delivery of the its targets.\n\nThe documents comprising this framework or system include:\n\n- The reported OHS Policy and OHS Target documents.\n- The documented procedures required under benchmark applicable regulations.\n- The documents needed to ensure effective process planning, operation and control.\n- The legally applicable requirements and other standards adopted by the group.\n- The registers required under benchmark applicable regulations.\n\nCIE Automotive has 15 corporate procedures and 'formats' related with delivery of the targets set in the OHS area.\n\n Those specific procedures establish the occupational health and safety requirements to be upheld in all activities. The 'formats' compile relevant information about the controls, measures and, in general, data yielded by an activity or a methodology for carrying it out.\n\n#### **Model and structure**\n\nEach factory has its own health and safety plan, which is put together on the basis of a framework system that is subjected to continual audit as part of the group's workplace safety management systems.\n\nThis structure enables the company to adapt safety measures for each factory and evaluate the measures taken by it on this front as a whole. Individual action plans are formulated every year to deliver the targeted level of improvement defined on the basis of the prior year's performance.\n\nEvery facility has a health and safety officer who, in addition to monitoring accidents and safety indicators, is tasked with ergonomics, avoiding exposure to harmful substances and managing psychosocial risks, as well as coordinating health monitoring.\n\nThe factories have an outside safety service that covers the four legally-stipulated areas of accident prevention expertise and a health and safety officer at each of its productive facilities.\n\nThe corporate Health And Safety Department regularly audits the factories, maintains the corporate intranet and serves as contact point for issues related with occupational health and safety.\n\nAt the factory level, the safety staff inspect the adequacy of the company's facilities, conduct emergency evacuation drills, provide training, assist with incident investigations and carry out awareness drives.\n\n#### **STRUCTURE**\n\nThe company has an **occupational health and safety framework**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 1 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/30 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo. The logo consists of a stylized letter C on the left and the words \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The letter C is made up of two curved shapes that do not quite meet, forming an incomplete circle. The words \"CIE Automotive\" are in a simple, sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a large gray quotation mark, followed by the number \"23\" in bold, black letters.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Joint management–worker health and safety committees**\n\nThe factories frequently have joint management-worker health and safety committees under the scope of their collective bargaining agreements, particularly in markets with tighter health and safety regulations, as is the case in Europe.\n\n#### **Certification**\n\nUnder its 2025 Strategic Plan, CIE Automotive is aiming to have 100% of its factories ISO 45001-certified by 2025. This is the benchmark international occupational health and safety management system standard designed to protect workers and visitors from accidents and workplace illnesses.\n\nIn 2023 the group certified four factories in Portugal, India and China, bringing the total number of factories certified to 95, which is 94% of the total.\n\n#### **Indicators and assessment**\n\nCIE Automotive has been using three key OHS indicators to track its safety record for over 15 years: the injury frequency rate, the injury severity rate and the number of lost-time injuries.\n\nIt also conducts an annual survey at each factory, called CIE Safety, the goal being for the facilities to score at least 85%. In 2023, all plants surpassed the target except one, which already has a corrective action plan in place.\n\n#### **Continuous improvement in accident metrics**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive recorded 345 injuries, 23 less than in 2022. Of the total, 339 were mild, six were serious and there no fatalities.\n\nThe injury frequency and severity rates continued to come down, marking record lows. In 2023 the severity rate fell to 0.11 and the frequency rate, to 6.19.\n\nAs for work-related illnesses, the group recorded 27 cases, compared to 22 in 2022. Note that there were no injuries affecting subcontracted workers.\n\nImage /page/110/Picture/30 description: The image shows a peach-colored shield with a white circle in the center.

The white elements appear to form a stylized, geometric pattern, possibly resembling letters or symbols. The design is simple yet visually striking due to the contrast between the colors and the clean lines.\n\n#### **INJURY METRICS**\n\n| Lost-time injuries*              |

Between 2017 and 2021, the US firefighter forces responded to an estimated annual average of 3,396 structure fires related with hot work, according to the most recent NFPA report. These fires caused average annual fatalities and civilian injuries of 19 and 120, respectively. The statistics regarding worker injuries and fatalities related with hot work paint an even darker picture.\n\nFaced with that reality, in 2023 CIE Automotive introduced a new procedure for controlling and regulating hot work at all group factories (CIE CO PR P 16) which is expected to become fully operational over the course of 2024. Under this procedure all internal or external work requiring the use of fire or combustion will be verified.\n\n### **Fire safety self-inspections**\n\nBeyond the emergency measures in place across the factories, the group is planning to introduce a systematic method for performing regular fire safety inspections.\n\nSpecifically, inspections will take place at least monthly at all group factories covered by the new hot work procedure - CIE CO PR P 16 - verifying their critical facilities and establishing action plans to address all deviations detected.\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/19 description: The image contains the words \"Business Activity\" on the first line and \"Coordination\" on the second line. The text is in a bold, sans-serif font.\n\nCIE Automotive guarantees the health and safety of the workers of all companies entering its places of work. The so-called Business Activity Coordination unit is therefore one of the most important areas of the health and safety effort.\n\nThe vast volumes of documents and large number of companies and workers involved mean that this unit needs to be digitalised to perform its coordination work more effectively.\n\nThe resulting coordination software platform is intended to reduce workplace risks, ensure compliance with applicable regulations and increase cooperation between contracting and subcontractor firms, as well as reduce the costs associated with workplace accidents.\n\nThe idea is to integrate internal and external health and safety management and, if correctly applied, guarantee compliance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/23 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Thanks this responsible and unique approach to the management of its approximately 23,000\\* suppliers, it renewed its ISO 20400 Sustainable procurement certification, remaining the only automotive parts maker in Spain to boast this certification.**\n\n*(\\*) 740 suppliers were from the discontinued German forging companies.*\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready 2 Ready for change**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/33 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

That threw up the challenge of involving its suppliers in the company's commitment to becoming climate neutral by 2050. So began the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project.\n\nThe first step in this race to decarbonisation was to understand its suppliers' real GHG emission figures, their level of commitment to reducing them and their advances to date. The idea was also to identify suppliers that need help tackling this challenge.\n\nThe group surveyed its main suppliers in all its geographies regarding their engagement around decarbonisation. The suppliers were selected on the basis of their emissions impact and/or procurement volume. They represent 41% of the group's total purchases (57% of productive suppliers), which amounted to €2.95\\* billion in 2023.\n\nThe study reveals that there is still ample room for improvement: only a minority of the suppliers surveyed have become aware of the need to reduce their carbon footprint:\n\nWith this information in hand, CIE Automotive will set deadlines for its suppliers to offer decarbonised technical solutions, so minimising its emissions and multiplying its positive impact, even in countries with lax environmental regulations.\n\nThe goal of Supply Chain Race 2 Zero is to focus on helping in the weakest areas. In general, the smaller and more local suppliers need support in the form of resources, guidance or environmental knowledge. This partnership includes information about energy efficiency, technical solutions and identification of areas for improvement, among other forms of assistance.\n\nFrom 2024, the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero programme's new roadmap will involve:\n\n*(\\*) 75 million euros correspond to the business of discontinued German forges.*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n### **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n| 5 | Our response to the environmental challenge |\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/26 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The goal of this event was to share CIE India's ESG targets and expectations with suppliers so as to rally them around delivery of the ESG targets that in turn form part of CIE Automotive's overall Strategic Plan. To encourage and motivate the best-performing suppliers in terms of quality, delivery, cost and ESG aspects, the management team provided them with a distinction.\n\nIn Brazil, meanwhile, the company organised an online training session explaining how to register properly for the ESG Supplier Portal in May and a workshop for suppliers to CIE Durametal addressing ESG practices and stakeholder relations.\n\nLastly, in Mexico, the company awarded a prize to its Best ESG Supplier.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Ready for change 1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nTHE BEST SUP\n\nAWARD ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL\n\nMPP\n\nPEMSA Celaya\n\nONLINE AO VIVO VIA MICROSOFT TEAMS\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/16 description: The image contains the words \"WORKSHOP PARA FORNECEDORES\" in bold, black font.

In parallel it works with its suppliers on initiatives related with energy self-consumption, reducing the use of coolant and onsite waste management.\n\nThe following stand out among the projects championed and managed by the procurement area:\n\n- Solar panels\n- Switch from combustion to electric forklifts\n- Chemistry driven waste reduction projects\n- Carbon offset projects with airlines\n\n#### **Collaboration on social issues**\n\nBeyond the scope of these environmental efforts, CIE Automotive also carried out a number of community projects involving CIE Automotive staff and supply chain employees. These initiatives include efforts designed to spur the transfer of technology and skills to developing economies and maximise its operations' positive impact on local economies.\n\nFor example, the company participated in research and training projects with local schools and universities and industry associations in developing countries, providing or supporting education, including the Lakshya and Gems projects in India, to name a few.\n\nCIE Automotive entered into agreements for the **purchase of renewable energy and the implementation of collaborative energy efficiency projects**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/23 description: The image shows a green and white logo.

The audit confirmed that the company had met the requirements formulated the previous year.\n\nWith this renewal, CIE Automotive ratified the operational excellence of its Procurement Department and the contribution being made by the latter to the company's broader sustainability and social responsibility policies. To achieve this certification, which is based on UNE-15896 Value added purchasing management, the following parameters were appraised:\n\n- Purchasing policy.\n- Selection and monitoring of suppliers.\n- Purchasing processes, ESG requirements in all group purchases.\n- Buyer training.\n- Risk management, purchase specifications and internal organisation.\n- Alignment with new regulations and requirements in the areas of due diligence, taxonomy and diversity and inclusion.\n\nBeyond the recognition that comes with the certification, it represents a challenge for the procurement teams as it not only requires compliance with ISO 20400 by the company but also with ESG standards by its suppliers. So, for example, the company cannot make an acquisition without a positive assessment of the target's management.\n\nIn this way, ISO 20400 certification reinforces the company's sustainability policies by extending them to the entire supply chain and lays the groundwork for making further progress in ESG as it requires:\n\n- Ensuring supply chain security.\n- Avoiding financial, environmental and reputational risks.\n- Inspiring confidence among investors, consumers and other stakeholders.\n- Fostering employee wellbeing and contributing to opening new markets for products and services.\n- Being prepared to achieve the decarbonisation targets CIE Automotive has set for itself, its supply chain constituting its main source of emissions (Scope 3).\n\n## **CIE Automotive is the only Spanish** automotive parts maker to boast **ISO 20400 certification**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n| 2 | Ready for change |\n|---|------------------|\n|---|------------------|\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n| 5 | Our response to the environmental challenge |\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n|---|---------------------------------------------|\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/30 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Existing and prospective suppliers of products and services to CIE Automotive can register.\n\nBy year-end 2023, a total of 8,000 suppliers populated the company's supplier base. Any candidates that did not complete or\n\npass the assessment received a message encouraging them to complete the process and/or improve their scores with the help of CIE Automotive.\n\nFor the first time in 2023, non-productive, or indirect suppliers, with annual procurement volume of over €500,000 are now required to register with the Portal and submit to an ESG assessment, an obligation previously limited to suppliers of productive materials, or direct suppliers.\n\n#### A **productive or direct purchase** is the\n\npurchase of products or services that form part of the final products received by the group's customers. The raw materials used in any of its technologies, the parts included in its end products (rubber, textiles, fasteners) and even subcontracting processes (heat treatments, machining) therefore fall into this category.\n\nExceptionally, the tooling used in productive processes is also included within productive purchasing. In short, productive purchases account for over 70% of the group's total procurement spend and are the biggest source of Scope 3 emissions for CIE Automotive.\n\nIn contrast a **non-productive or indirect purchase** is one that facilitates the production process but is not an integral part of the end products delivered to its customers.\n\n#### *[Refer to the Procurement families]*\n\n### **Enhanced management**\n\nIn addition to facilitating assessment, the Suppliers Portal is a source of reference and valuable information for our procurement managers.\n\nFollowing its redesign in 2022, a new interface was developed in 2023 to visualise, manage and extract information related with the audits conducted by CIE Automotive on current or prospective suppliers. This new feature enhances the procurement teams' management efforts and adds exclusive ESG audits to the range of traditional audits. The company's traditional audits also include a pass/fail ESG section.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/24 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Aligned with the decentralised management model, the local procurement teams were asked to lead execution of this initiative, evidencing an increase in their commitment and awareness around these matters.\n\n**100% of the suppliers registered on the portal report to not using** \n\n**mineral conflicts** or, in the event they use them in their productive processes, guarantee they are not sourced from conflict-affected areas\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/14 description: The image shows the number 125 in a simple, sans-serif font.

This requires additional supply chain management and document updates so as to reflect its targets, in line with prevailing legislation, and multiply its impact.\n\n# Management system and inclusion of ESG aspects\n\n#### **Living documents in response to evolving ESG challenges**\n\nThe OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers' growing sensitivity around ESG matters is forcing CIE Automotive to revise its supply chain procedures, policies and standards every year.\n\nIn 2023, it updated its Global Supply Chain Manual and General Purchasing Terms and Conditions to include its customers' chief demands. Together these two documents guide the company's suppliers.\n\n#### **Global Supply Chain Manual**\n\nThis manual is a true reflection of the supply chain system and procedures. It details graphically and in plain language the Mission, Purchasing Policy, the various product and service purchasing categories, the purchasing flowchart and the associated internal procedures and the ESG requirements suppliers must meet in order to work with CIE Automotive.\n\nNew commitments were added in 2023, specifically addressing:\n\n- Due diligence\n- Emissions reduction requirements\n- Decarbonisation targets\n\n#### **General Purchasing Terms and Conditions | Supplier ESG Document**\n\nThe company's General Purchasing Terms and Conditions require group suppliers to endorse the company's ESG commitments if they want to work with CIE Automotive, no matter where in the world they are located.\n\nNew conditions were added in 2023, specifically:\n\n- \n- \n\n• Modern slavery: CIE Automotive wants to ensure that there is no place for modern slavery in its supply chain, in other words, that no person is forced to work in subhuman conditions they cannot refuse on account of coercion, threats or the abuse of power.\n\n• Use of private of public security forces: Suppliers may not hire or use private or public security forces to protect the company if, due to a lack of training or control by the supplier, their deployment could give rise to human rights violations.\n\nCIE Automotive revised and updated its **supply chain ESG procedures, policies and requirements in 2023**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**4**\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/29 description: The image is mostly white with a blurry green shape on the left side.\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/30 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" in black, with a gray quotation mark above it.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe company regularly reviews and updates other documents, such as its Procurement Policy and Conflict Minerals Policy.\n\n#### **Conflict Minerals Policy**\n\nThe Conflict Minerals Policy was introduced in 2021 to reinforce the company's requirements around this issue, even though the Global Supply Chain Manual and General Purchasing Terms and Conditions already stipulated the ban, which it enforced via the \"Mineral Conflicts\" questionnaire within the Suppliers Portal.\n\nThe company revised the policy in 2023 to specify Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs).\n\nIn 2023, 100% of the suppliers CIE Automotive works with who are registered in the Suppliers Portal reported to either not using mineral conflicts or, if used in their productive processes, to being able to guarantee that they were not sourced from conflict regions.\n\n### *Alignment with the due diligence directive*\n\nAligned with the EU's new corporate sustainability due diligence directive and following the recommendations issued by the OECD, CIE Automotive has begun to learn about and develop a due diligence process in order to identify, prevent and manage the impact the company's operations could have on human rights and the environment along the supply chain, including its suppliers in a specific protocol.\n\nTo that end it has included a specific section within the Ethics Framework section of its Global Supply Chain Manual urging its suppliers to participate in this process, introducing a due diligence report and five guidelines for correct compliance: establishing robust business management systems; identifying suppliers that supply mineral conflicts; designing a strategy for mitigating the risks detected; carrying out an external audit; and reporting on due diligence efforts in the group's annual reports.\n\nThe due diligence response is currently in the process of being implemented, as follows:\n\n**1. Developing a control list** for identifying internal and external human rights and environmental risks.\n\n**2. Prioritising risks** as a function of their severity, probability and urgency.\n\n**3. Defining mitigating actions** as a function of the results of the monitoring effort.\n\n**4. Documenting the process**, defining the internal and external risks and providing training across the affected areas of the firm and to third parties.\n\n**5. Integrating human rights and environmental risks** into the overall supply chain risk map with a view to subsequently\n\ncontrolling them.\n\nThe company will prioritise development of its response to this directive in 2024.\n\n## **Due diligence will be a cornerstone of supplier**\n\nmanagement in 2024\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/21 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

In 2022, the percentage is 78.5%. In 2023, the percentage is 78.2%.\n\nCIE Automotive uses a GLOCAL (global management with local application) procurement model, spearheaded by the corporate procurement function and executed by the various buyer teams that furnish the company with goods and services sourced locally (onshoring) and regionally (nearshoring).\n\nThis decentralised approach is highly efficient as it reduces logistics costs and tariffs, mitigates foreign currency risk and favours flows by overcoming cultural, linguistic and time zone differences. In parallel it favours sustainable procurement by reducing the emissions derived from transportation.\n\nThanks to this management approach, at year-end 2023, 92.2% of the suppliers used by CIE Automotive were local firms and accounted for 78.2% of the total procurement volume.\n\n## The GLOCAL procurement model **generates value locally and reduces the group's environmental impact**\n\n# GLOCAL procurement model\n\n#### **SHARE OF LOCAL SUPPLIERS**\n\n**SHARE OF PROCUREMENT VOLUME SOURCED FROM LOCAL SUPPLIERS** \n\n*(\\*) 96.0% in discontinued German forging companies.

ESG aspects are playing an increasingly important role in that process.\n\n### **Supplier audits**\n\nCIE Automotive assesses its suppliers' financial health in order to ensure their ability to deliver throughout the duration of its projects.\n\nSupplier evaluations take the form of process audits that assess and score them on several parameters, including planning, reception, training and skills, process, maintenance, inspection, packaging, storage, continuous improvement and environmental performance, customer satisfaction, documentation and ESG criteria.\n\nThe results of the audits may be shared with the supplier. On other occasions it is the supplier that conducts a self-assessment which is then corroborated by qualified CIE Automotive professionals.\n\nThanks to this system of self-assessment and onsite audits, in 2023 the company conducted 698\\* audits, compared to 582 in 2022, an increase of 20%.\n\nIn 2024, the group has set itself the target of increasing that figure by 10%, stepping up the number of onsite audits in particular.\n\n### *External verification of ESG health using artificial intelligence*\n\nBetween self-assessments and onsite audits, **in 2023 the company conducted 698 audits, growth of 20% from 2022**\n\nIn 2023, CIE Automotive reached an agreement with the one of world's most important ESG ratings companies for the verification of supplier ESG compliance covering over 50% of its global procurement spend. The scope of this exercise, which began in 2022 when it was associated exclusively with governance considerations, has been widened to include:\n\n• The Red Flags Grid (fines, human rights, environment, business\n\nl predictive\n\n- conduct, corporate governance)\n- Country risk\n- Default risk\n- ESG scoring: analytic and predictive\n- Scope1 & 2 emissions\n\nThe information provided by this rating company, which uses artificial intelligence and internal and external databases to check the suppliers' information, allows the group to contrast and complement the information it obtains from its Suppliers Portal.\n\nBy way of conclusion, just 3 of all the suppliers evaluated presented risks in any of the above-listed areas; an action plan has been established to monitor their progress and the company is searching for alternative for these suppliers in the event the risks cannot be addressed.\n\n*(\\*) One of them was carried out in the business of discontinued German forging companies.*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/25 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The x-axis represents the 'Impact index', ranging from 0 to 1.0, while the y-axis represents 'Compliance ESG', ranging from 0% to 120%. Each category is represented by a data point with a label indicating the category name and its corresponding 'Compliance ESG' percentage. The categories and their respective 'Compliance ESG' percentages are as follows: Logistics (83%), MRO (89%), Investements (80%), Subcontracts (98%), Tooling (93%), Energy (73%), Other consumption (72%), Prof. services (56%), Components (98%), and Raw material (97%). The size of the data points may vary, possibly indicating another dimension of data. The plot also includes the note 'Considered purchasing value >0.5MM€/year by supplier'.\n\nTo prevent and mitigate potential risks, CIE Automotive updates its supply chain ESG risk matrix every year. This exercise revealed growing commitment by suppliers in 2023.\n\nThe companies that supply CIE Automotive with raw materials, parts, subcontracted services and tooling, i.e., the productive procurement families, are the most committed, with all of them presenting ESG compliance scores of over 92%, unchanged from 2022.\n\n### *Supply chain ESG risk matrix*  Chairman **ESG RISK MATRIX**\n\nIn 2023 it is worth highlighting the significant improvement recorded in indirect procurement families such as energy (where ESG compliance jumped from 63% to 73% in 2023) and MRO (from 73% to 89%).\n\nIn 2023, the population of critical direct or raw material suppliers (by virtue of representing over 50% of total purchases) numbered 250.\n\nThe ESG risk mapping process in 2023 revealed growing **commitment by suppliers**\n\nand CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/133/Picture/19 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

It encompasses all the efforts made by various sectors to enhance their scientific, technological, research, cultural and academic interests in India and to promote economic, trade and business cooperation between the two countries, promoting initiatives, networking and specific activities considered priorities by the Trustees.\n\n## CIE Automotive sought to strengthen its ties to India, **where it has 25 factories**\n\n#### **Government grants received**\n\nIn 2023 CIE Automotive received €1.7 million of grants related to income, 0.2% more/less than in 2022. Of the total received, it obtained €0.6 million in Spain and €1.1 million between Italy, Portugal, China and Hungary.\n\nThe receipt of grants is also contemplated in CIE Automotive's Code of Conduct, which prohibits applying for subsidies, tax exemptions or government funds on a fraudulent basis..\n\n#### **Policy advocacy and relations with local authorities**\n\nIn the course of its activities, CIE Automotive engages with the public authorities. These interactions are at all times framed by strict observance of prevailing legislation and the utmost transparency, in keeping with the principles laid down in its Code of Professional Conduct.\n\nThe company is not associated with any form of political ideology in Spain or anywhere else and it forbids contributions to political parties or their representatives or candidates in the name or on behalf of the company that could have or be seen to have political implications.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/8 description: The image shows a gray flag waving in the wind.

On the right side, there is a large white number \"23\" with a dashed line underneath it.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY PRIORITIES**\n\n#### **Environmental management model**\n\nCIE Automotive's approach to environmental management is decentralised: the corporate Environmental Department is tasked with setting the standards and supervising implementation of the environmental strategy worldwide, while the productive facilities are in charge of strategy execution by means of annual risk assessments factory by factory under ISO 14001 and monitoring of the KPIs established in the Strategic Plan. In 2023, 95% of CIE Automotive's factories were ISO 14001-certified.\n\nCIE Automotive's environmental challenge extends beyond its perimeter. It collaborates with its suppliers to reduce their emissions, purchases and generates renewable energy and cooperates with its customers to develop and manufacture parts targeted at electric vehicles, so helping to decarbonise transport.\n\nFramed by its commitment to making low-emission vehicles, CIE Automotive is developing new parts and subassembly solutions to support the OEMs with this process. As a result of its sustainability strategy and R&D initiatives, the company is already supplying specific products for the manufacture and assembly of zero- or lowemission vehicles. In collaboration with its customers it is taking a life cycle approach, building in end of life and parts reparability criteria into its designs.\n\nIn addition, CIE Automotive is working on a number of R&D projects together with other companies in its value chain with a view to reducing its environmental footprint. For\n\nexample, it is redesigning forged items to reduce their use of energy and extend the useful life of the machining tools. It is also redefining its packaging specifications so as to be able to use returnable cardboard boxes and introducing biomaterials and recycled plastic.\n\n#### **Membership of associations that champion climate neutrality**\n\nOn the institutional front, from the Management Board of Sernauto (Spain's automotive suppliers association), CIE Automotive is encouraging climate neutrality initiatives and is collaborating to set more ambitious targets in the sector.\n\nImage /page/144/Figure/3 description: The image shows a list of environmental protection measures. The list includes protecting the environment, fighting climate change, protecting people's health, using natural resources rationally, preventing the pollution of air, water and other natural resources, reducing carbon emissions, and protecting biodiversity, forests, rivers and oceans. On the left side of the image, there are some texts including Chairman and CEO's statement, 2023 highlights, Ready for change, Record earnings, Common responsibility, shared benefits, Our response to the environmental challenge, Responsible management, About this report, and Data tables.\n\nThe group is a founding partner of the Basque Ecodesign Center, where it collaborates with a number of government agencies and different industrial sectors to promote circularity, decarbonisation and climate action.\n\nCIE Automotive gets involved in new mobility solutions focused on zero-emissions vehicles from the earliest stages of development. As a result of this approach, it has been participating in Basquevolt, the Basque initiative for the production of solid-state batteries, since 2021.\n\nIt also belongs to Forética's Climate Change Cluster, a business platform whose mandate is to mainstream the main global climate change trends and debates in to the Spanish business community.\n\nLastly, it is a member of AEC, the Spanish Quality Association, which has a number of taskforces in the environmental area to influence the development of new legislation and provide guidelines and training to help Spanish industry manage climate change.\n\n#### **Involvement of senior management**\n\nThe company's Board of Directors and Management Committee are involved in the effort to fight climate change. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for activities related with the environment. The Board's ESG Committee is in charge of environmental issues. The chairwoman of this committee has climate change management experience and knowledge.\n\nThe company's CEO is engaged with the sustainable growth impetus and ultimately responsible for execution of the Strategic Plan, of which the ESG Plan is an integral part.\n\nThe Cross-Group ESG Committee reports and makes proposals to CIE Automotive's Board's ESG Committee. The HSEQ Director sits on the committee and manages the deployment of the environmental aspects of the Business Strategy. By bringing its engineering and environmental areas under the same Director, CIE Automotive ensures that all its environmental targets get analysed from the earliest phases of the research and development effort.\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/144/Picture/17 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The background is white, and there is a green triangle in the lower left corner of the image.\n\n# **Climate neutrality roadmap**\n\n**At the heart of CIE Automotive's environmental strategy lies the goal of achieving zero net greenhouse gas emissions before 2050. The new roadmap, rolled out in 2023, sets overall targets for the medium and long term and the steps the factories need to take to achieve them. To become net zero it is vital to collaborate with the company's suppliers, an effort reinforced last year with the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero programme.** \n\nIn 2022, CIE Automotive took a qualitative leap in its climate change effort by endorsing the Paris Agreement, which commits it to setting a series of science-based environmental targets based on an ambitious long-term goal: generating net zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050, so contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5º C with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. The company has further committed to having the above-mentioned targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) to ensure they are based on science and aligned with the goal of keeping global warming within 1.5 o C.\n\nWith that end goal in mind, in 2023 the company embarked on a new environmental roadmap, approved by the Board of Directors in December 2022, which echoes and extends the targets set in its 2025 Business Plan and establishes the steps the factories need to take to achieve climate neutrality.\n\nTo deliver the commitment of having its medium-term targets certified by SBTi, the group needs to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by around 67% by 2035 and its Scope 3 emissions also by at least two-thirds, around 67%.\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready for change**\n\n**Record earnings**\n\n**Common responsibility, shared benefits**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 1[2](#page-15-0)[3](#page-53-0)[4](#page-64-0)56**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>Image /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" on the left side of the image.

The second icon has a lightning bolt symbol in a green circle in front of the building. The third icon has the letters \"R&D\" in a green circle in front of the building.\n\n#### **Compliance with standards and regulations**\n\nCIE Automotive stays ahead of and finances compliance with all climate change-related regulations in all of the countries it operates in by using outside consultants to keep it abreast of any regulatory developments that could affect its activities.\n\n#### **Budget earmarked to energy efficiency**\n\nEach factory's business plan includes a specific budget allocation for enhancing its approach to climate change, including energy efficiency.\n\nThere are currently 31 energy efficiency projects which are being tracked over the Intranet to ensure that the initiatives succeed.\n\n#### **Budget earmarked to low carbon products R&D**\n\nCIE Automotive has identified light-weighting, electrification and lower-carbon products during the production phase as the key demands coming from the market and its customers. Based on an analysis of those factors it has rolled out a portfolio of R&D projects and assigned them a specific budget.\n\n#### **Decarbonisation plans**\n\nWork has begun on drawing up decarbonisation plans factory by factory in order to ensure that all of CIE Automotive's policies, guidelines and commitments materialise at the operating level.\n\n#### **Environmental investments**\n\nThe new climate change strategy and the need to adapt the various facilities for new legislation country by country involves a series of investments and expenses.\n\nTo that end, in 2023, the company invested in minimising its environmental impact and in environmental protection and restoration work, in addition to incurring expenditure on waste removal and environmental consultancy, measurement and certification work.\n\nThe combined amounts of investments and expenses accrued in 2023 in relation to environmental protection work totalled €9.7 million (€11.6 million in 2022).\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/19 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The diagram includes the following elements: Eco-design, taking a life cycle approach; Eco-efficiency; Electrification of the vehicle fleet; Photovoltaic facilities; Use of recycled/secondary materials; Supply Chain Race 2 Zero; Improvement in the gross to net weight ratio; Reduced waste generation; Industry 4.0; Renewable electricity; and Replacement of forklifts.\n\n## To execute the environmental roadmap, **best practices from all regions were shared**\n\n### **Coordination**\n\nThe rollout of the new roadmap required an intense communication and coordination effort with all of the factories around the world. To ensure the company continues to hit its energy efficiency and emissions, water consumption and waste reduction targets, among others, the company presented the new roadmap and shared best environmental practices in all of its markets.\n\nAs is shown, energy measures are a core part of the work plan. From step one, eco-design, the idea is to reduce the use of materials and energy during the manufacturing process and the product's life.\n\nOne of the main focuses of introducing Industry 4.0 technology is to achieve energy efficiency and optimise processes. Logically, ecoefficiency is its own separate line of initiative.\n\nThe efforts to install photovoltaic power and electrify the company's fleet are similarly directed.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/10 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

According to its recent measurements, 80% of its carbon footprint stems from the raw materials it uses.\n\nTo address this issue, the company launched the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero initiative under which its suppliers share their emissions data and abatement efforts with CIE Automotive, while the company mentors them and provides them with technical solutions in the event of difficulties. The goal is to identify and anticipate potential technical barriers in the supply chain and set deadlines for shaping a decarbonised offering.\n\n*[Further information in Carbon footprint measurement and suppliers]*\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/16 description: The image shows a green truck with a plant symbol on its side.

The background is white.\n\n#### **Environmental performance awards**\n\nAmong the steps taken to galvanise the factories around achievement of climate neutrality, it is worth highlighting the newly created Environmental Awards. The goal is to reward the factories that stood out during the year for bringing down their emissions in\n\nline with the targets set in the 2025 Strategic Plan, inspiring others to join them in their decarbonisation pathways.\n\nA total of fourteen companies received awards in two categories.\n\nThe company did not receive any significant fines for non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations in 2023. Significant fines are those of €30,000 or more. In India, the group had to compensate for environmental impacts in the amount of INR 3,135 million (approximately €34,000)\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The reasons for not continuing downstream to the end of the products' useful life are multiple and are related with the supply and supplier structure in the automotive sector:\n\n- In most of our sales agreements with customers, it is the customer who is tasked with collecting the product at the CIE Automotive factory in question, using its own logistics flows, over which CIE Automotive has neither control, responsibility or information.\n- The OEMs work around platforms. In other words, a given part is used in different models, with different characteristics and, therefore, different emissions. In addition, a given part of the propulsion or transmission system is used in different models, making it impossible to determine its performance in use.\n- Lastly, the vehicles assembled by the OEMs are, often, supplied to different countries and markets with totally different end-of-life regulations and strategies. CIE Automotive has no control over that distribution and therefore is not able to calculate the footprint associated with this step in its products' life cycle.\n\nCIE Automotive's customers ask it for environmental footprint data up to the company's gates and include those figures in their full measurements with the rest of the downstream phases without any double counting.\n\nThe company uses the ReCIPE life cycle impact methodology to calculate its environmental footprint, to which end it is receiving assistance from the Basque regional government's environmental management company, IHOBE.\n\nWithin the universe of activities of each company, based on the assessment that their impact is smaller, the following aspects were excluded from the analysis:\n\n#### **Upstream**\n\n- Consumption at central/sales offices outside of manufacturing facilities.\n- Capital goods (vehicles, machinery, tools, etc.).\n- Displacement of employees to go to work.\n- Business travel.\n- Upstream assets leased.\n- Trips to the organisation by visitors or customers.\n\n#### **Downstream**\n\n- Transport and distribution.\n- Processing of products sold.\n- Use of products sold.\n- End-of-life treatment of products sold.\n- Assets leased in subsequent phases.\n- Franchises.\n- Investments.\n\n## To calculate the environmental footprint, **the company uses the ReCIPE methodology and has the collaboration of IHOBE**\n\nThe downstream exclusions are not really exclusions as they are not included in CIE Automotive's footprint scope (from cradle to gate) for the reasons itemised earlier and in order to prevent double counting by the customer, who is the party with the information and responsibility for the downstream phases of our production.\n\nThe company currently uses widely acknowledged databases such as Ecoinvent. For its electricity emissions factors, it uses updated databases in each country where it consumes electricity. One of the goals of the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project is to compile real information about each significant product or service directly from our suppliers. However, the large majority of our suppliers are not yet prepared to provide robust, real data that they can regularly update. Note that a one-off figure is not sufficient; supplier emissions information needs to be updated as they advance on their decarbonisation and emissions-abatement plans. This is part of the coaching and mentoring work we are doing under the umbrella of this supplier programme.\n\nIn 2023 surveys were undertaken in at least two factories per region in order to assess the volume of emissions associated with employee commutes to work. The analysis performed in 2023, such that the calculations are based on emissions data for 2022, indicate commute-related emissions ranging from 3.10% of the total in Europe to 0.11% in Asia.\n\n|   | Chairman<br>and<br>CEO's<br>statement             |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | 2023<br>highlights                                |\n| 2 | Ready<br>for change                               |\n| 3 | Record<br>earnings                                |\n| 4 | Common<br>responsibility,<br>shared benefits      |\n| 5 | Our response to<br>the environmental<br>challenge |\n| 6 | Responsible<br>management                         |\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/154/Picture/33 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Since 2021, the base year for comparative purposes, energy efficiency gains have reduced relative emissions by 52%,**  to 337,937.72 metric tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup>e per €1,000 **of revenue.**\n\nCIE Automotive's environmental management systems are based on the ISO 14001 standard and ensure pollution does not exceed the thresholds stipulated in prevailing regulations. To control pollution and make the company more efficient and competitive, it carries out audits and works to reduce energy consumption across its facilities.\n\nThe company includes environmental cost as a function of revenue as a key performance indicator in its global dashboard. That indicator includes the cost of emissions calculated in terms of emission allowances (EUA), even though the company does not participate in the global emission trading scheme.\n\nIn 2023, the company conducted energy audits at different factories, marking the first step in rationalising their real consumption levels, cutting nominal consumption levels using new technology and detecting incidents and inefficiencies.\n\nAn agreement has also been reached to certify factories in Europe, Asia and the Americas under ISO50001 so as to make energy efficiency a key component of the company's strategy.\n\nImage /page/155/Picture/19 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Specifically, it tackled a number of Industry 4.0 projects to boost energy efficiency and took steps to electrify its internal vehicles. It created an in-house taskforce to analyse the roadmap for\n\nreplacing natural gas at the furnaces used by CIE Automotive, some of the options being to replace gas-fired furnaces with electric furnaces or to use biogas, oxy-combustion or green hydrogen. It also looked at replacing gas heating with heat pumps or electric heating systems.\n\n*[For further information on energy consumption by region, refer to the detailed table provided in \"Data tables\"]*\n\n*The criteria used to calculate the percentage of renewable energy consumed was modified in 2023 to make it more restrictive: in markets with standardised and official guarantee of origin certificates, the percentages only include the renewable energy backed by such certificates, plus energy purchases under PPAs. and self-generation.*\n\n*(\\*) Includes emissions from discontinued German forging companies until June 30, 2023.*\n\n| Gigajoules                                                              | 2021         | 2022         | 2023*        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Direct energy<br>consumption                                            | 1,922,653.06 | 1,695,060.74 | 1,760,684.76 |\n| Indirect energy consumption from renewable<br>and non-renewable sources | 3,885,073.74 | 3,932,206.88 | 4,196,857.92 |\n| Indirect energy consumption from<br>non-renewable sources               | 1,971,005.79 | 1,695,803.31 | 1,816,574.38 |\n| Indirect energy consumption from renewable<br>sources                   | 1,914,067.96 | 2,236,403.56 | 2,380,283.54 |\n| TOTAL                                                                   | 5,807,726.80 | 5,627,267.62 | 5,957,542.68 |\n\n| CO2e ™                      | 2021       | 2022       | 2023*      |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Indirect emissions foregone | 139,340.49 | 216,814.45 | 228,707.23 |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record 2**\n\n**[earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/21 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In Spain, Portugal and Lithuania, 100% of the power consumed is green. In 2023 it forwent emissions equivalent to 228.707,23 CO2e ™ thanks to the purchase of power generated from renewable sources.\n\n### **Self-generation**\n\nFramed by that same goal or reducing harmful emissions and lowering its energy bills, the company is developing a number of selfgeneration projects in Europe and India by installing photovoltaic solar panels.\n\nIn India, the group is taking strategic steps to shore up its use of green energy. Since 2023, 63% of all the energy used at the factories in the Indian region of Maharashtra is solar power, thanks to CIE Automotive's investment in Strongsun Solar - for the supply of photovoltaic power to CIE India's forging division in Urse and its magnetic products division in Bhosari, respectively - and in INR, for supply to the forging division.\n\nNote also that in the state of Karnataka (India), where Bill Forge has its factories, around 85% of the energy consumed comes from green sources, specifically a mix of wind and sun.\n\n| Factory                                            | Country |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| CIE Aluminium Casting<br>Aurangabad plant 3 (HPDC) | IN      |\n| CIE Aluminium Casting Pantnagar<br>plant 1 (HPDC)  | IN      |\n| CIE India Composites Kanhe                         | IN      |\n| CIE India Forging Division (Pune)                  | IN      |\n| CIE India -

It is only contemplates offsets in the exceptional cases in which there is no technical alternative; for example, it purchases offsets from the airlines to mitigate the CO2 emissions associated with\n\nits business travel.\n\nNote that the commitments assumed and short- and medium-term targets set do not contemplate the company's carbon offsets.\n\n### **Noise pollution**\n\nNoise pollution can be a relevant issue, depending on factory technologies and locations. However, CIE Automotive's factories are located in industrial areas at a sufficient distance from residential districts so as not to pose a problem.\n\nLight pollution is not a relevant consequence of CIE Automotive's activities.\n\n### **Biodiversity**\n\nGiven that CIE Automotive carries out its business activities in industrial areas/estates, it believes that its impact on biodiversity is not significant and therefore not material for the purpose of the group's reporting effort. No information is therefore provided with respect to biodiversity in this report.\n\nHowever, in collaboration with the Basque Ecodesign Center, a project is underway to generate more advanced methodology for analysing biodiversity risks, which is expected to add value in 2025.\n\n**[for change](#page-15-0)**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready 1 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n160\n\nImage /page/159/Picture/17 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

In choosing materials, the company relies on guides and lessons learned and specifically complies with regulations regarding the labelling of polymeric materials to facilitate their sorting and recycling.\n\nImage /page/160/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram of a circular economy. The diagram has two main flows: a circular flow and a linear flow. The circular flow is represented by green arrows, and the linear flow is represented by gray arrows. The diagram also shows a company boundary, which is represented by an orange square. Inside the company boundary, there are three arrows: a green arrow representing circular inflow, a gray arrow representing linear inflow, and a black arrow representing waste. The diagram also shows the percentage of circular inflow, the percentage of recovery potential, and the percentage of actual recovery. The text in the image includes the following: \"CIRCULAR ECONOMY\", \"Circular inflow\", \"Linear inflow\", \"Non-renewable virgin resource\", \"Company boundary\", \"% circular inflow\", \"% recovery potential\", \"% actual recovery\", \"Circular outflow\", \"Linear outflow\", and \"Non-recoverable products and waste streams\".\n\nTo enhance its circular economy strategy, the 2025 Strategic Plan contemplates a series of circularity-specific KPIs, based on the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and its Circular Transition Indicators. The information gathered will tell the company, for example, how many times the water drawn gets used, which waste can be recycled and which cannot and what effects the factories' manufacturing activities have on biodiversity.\n\n*[For further information, refer to section eco-efficiency and circularity]*\n\n**CIE AUTOMOTIVE AND THE**\n\n**Production at CIE Automotive follows circular economy criteria: its products are designed with circularity in mind, resources are used efficiently and waste is minimised and recycled.

The use of water at its factories is not relevant by comparison with other manufacturing industries. Although the company has a clear commitment to reducing water consumption as a general KPI, the ratio of water consumption per product made is actually very low.\n\nIn order to minimise water discharges, the company has proprietary water treatment systems that enable its recirculation and recovery. The wastewater that reaches public treatment plants through wastewater pipes has therefore already been treated by the company.\n\nOne of the circular transition indicators calculated by CIE Automotive is the volume of water reused in the production facilities. That recirculation is concentrated primarily in the refrigeration circuits.\n\nWater consumption totalled 1,625,246.72 megalitres/year in 2023, and water intensity was 0.40, compared to 0.41 in 2022.\n\nThe CAPEX and OPEX related with water are very low and are not subject to any specific monitoring. However, the company does have several water minimisation projects underway in collaboration with customers, related for example with dry machining.\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/28 description: The image shows a partial view of a clock face with a hand pointing towards the upper right.

A good example of this practice is the concerted effort to reduce the gross weight of the products it makes. That effort translates into the use of fewer materials and lowers the generation of waste and consumption of energy and other products needed in the manufacturing process.\n\nAt present, 35% of the raw materials used by the group are recycled.\n\n### **Plastic**\n\nSome of the company's parts are made from thermoplastics (PP, PA, PC, ABS, PC/ABS, joints, etc.) and others, fewer, from thermostable plastics. The company also uses plastic to wrap its products In total, the company used 61,243.65 MT of plastic\\*.\n\nTo reduce the use of plastic in its packaging, the company is working on projects with its customers for the use of returnable boxes. These initiatives will be included in the companies' decarbonisation plans.\n\n#### **MATERIAL CONSUMPTION**\n\n*[For further information on consumption by region, refer to the detailed table provided in the \"Data tables and glossary\" appendix]*\n\n## To reduce the use of plastic in its packaging, the company is working on **projects for the use of returnable boxes**\n\n*(\\*) Includes emissions from discontinued German forging companies until June 30, 2023.*\n\nTo reduce the use of p\nthe\n**projects for the u**\n\n| Kg                      | 2021            | 2022            | 2023*           |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Raw materials used      | 1,448,043,709.2 | 1,230,298,192.7 | 1,532,506,681.7 |\n| Raw materials recovered | 1,230,298,192.7 | 551,193,852.4   | 417,722,719.8   |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/162/Picture/11 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The waste generated that cannot be recycled is collected by expert handlers which prioritise recycling over the landfill disposal method. In 2023\\*, 1.69% was sent to landfills 87.35% was reused and the remaining 10.96% was directed to other forms of disposal.\n\n### **Aluminium**\n\nThe injection moulding and machining processes generate sizeable amounts of remains such as sprue, risers, starting pieces, etc. from the injection moulding process and shavings from the machining process. In both instances, the company reuses these remnants in the casting process.\n\n#### **Plastic**\n\nThe plastics division recycles sprue and other remains returned by its injection moulding process.\n\n#### **Steel**\n\nThis is the material with the highest associated volume of waste. As it cannot be recycled in full within the group's factories, it is delivered to a number of different local suppliers for full reuse.\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/10 description: The image shows a gray recycling bin with a white recycling symbol on it. The recycling symbol is made up of three arrows that form a triangle.\n\nResponsibility for waste generation does not end when that waste is removed from CIE Automotive's facilities. In addition to its waste minimisation plans, the company has devised a new waste classification system sorted by method of elimination, thereby seeking to reduce its environmental impact.\n\n### **Food waste**\n\nRegardless of the fact that, due to the group's main activity as a manufacturer of automotive parts and components, this is not a material issue, CIE Automotive carries out different measures to avoid food waste. For example, the start-up of some biogas generation facilities from the food waste generated.\n\n*[For further information on waste generation by region, refer to the detailed table provided in the \"Data tables and glossary\" appendix]*\n\n#### **WASTE MANAGEMENT**\n\n*(\\*) Includes emissions from discontinued German forging companies until June 30, 2023.*\n\n| MT                                 | 2021      | 2022      | 2023*     |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hazardous waste<br>disposed of     | 17,457.9  | 17,462.1  | 21,441.7  |\n| Non-hazardous waste<br>disposed of | 355,293.2 | 324,307.3 | 358,629.6 |\n| TOTAL                              | 372,751.1 | 341,770.0 | 380,071.2 |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/16 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Manufacture of other parts and accessories for motor vehicles.\n\nThat economic activity is identified in Commission Delegated Regulation 2023/2485 of 27 June 2023, within the climate change mitigation objective, under code **3.18. Manufacture of automotive and mobility components**, which is defined as follows:\n\n*Manufacture, repair, maintenance, retrofitting, repurposing and upgrade of mobility components for zeroemission personal mobility devices and of automotive and mobility systems, components, separate technical units, parts and spare parts as defined in Article 3, points (18) to (21) and (23) of Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council, type approved, designed, and constructed for use only in vehicles and buses of category M1, M2, M3, N1, N2 and N3, and in Article 3, points (15) to (18) and (21) in Regulation (EU) 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, type approved, designed, and constructed for use only in vehicles of category L meeting the criteria set out in this Section and which are essential for delivering and improving the environmental performance of the vehicle.*\n\nAs a result, as defined in the Regulation, CIE Automotive's economic activity is Taxonomyeligible in 2023. Given that this activity is being reported for the first time this year, as prescribed in Article 5 of Commission\n\nDelegated Regulation 2023/2485 of 27 June 2023, this year the Group only has to report eligibility; the alignment disclosures will be mandatory next year.\n\nIn addition, in order to comply with the Regulation's requirements, the Group assessed the materiality of the three KPIs - turnover, CapEx and OPEX - in relation to the rest of the activities described in the Regulations, as outlined next.\n\n#### **TURNOVER**\n\nThe key performance indicator (KPI) related to turnover is calculated as the percentage of turnover derived from Taxonomy-aligned activities (numerator) over total company turnover (denominator). Turnover is defined as the revenue recognised pursuant to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82(a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008.\n\nCIE Automotive, S.A. reports an eligible turnover KPI associated with activity 3.18 equivalent to 13.4% (turnover of 531,588 thousand euros). This percentage is arrived at by assigning each automotive part made by each of our factories to each of the original equipment makers that exist in the world. To obtain the percentage of electric vehicles made by all the platforms, CIE Automotive relied on information reported by IHS Markit, one of the largest data and analytics providers for many industries, with a solid presence in the automotive sector. IHS Markit provides the percentages of pure electric vehicles manufactured globally by each platform. CIE Automotive uses those percentages and the sales figures by platform as the basis for estimating turnover associated with zeroemissions vehicles.\n\n### **COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 ON CLIMATE TAXONOMY** Chairman\n\nand CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 3 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/20 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive. The logo consists of a stylized letter \"C\" on the left, followed by the text \"CIE Automotive\" on the right. The \"C\" is formed by two curved black shapes that do not quite meet, creating an opening. The text \"CIE Automotive\" is in a simple, sans-serif font, with \"CIE\" in a bolder typeface than \"Automotive\".\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters. To the right of the words is a large gray quotation mark and the number 23 in black.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **CapEx**\n\nThe CapEx KPI is measured as the percentage of fixed assets invested in eligible economic activities (numerator) over total assets acquired in the course of 2023 (denominator). That denominator (Total CapEx) is defined as additions to tangible and intangible assets during the financial year considered before depreciation, amortisation and any remeasurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant financial year and excluding fair value changes. It also includes additions resulting from business combinations. Accordingly, Total CapEx covers the costs recognised in keeping with IAS 16, IAS 38, IAS 40, IAS 41 and IFRS 16. In 2023, the CIE Automotive Group's CapEx totalled 311,884 thousand euros.\n\nWith respect to activity 3.18. Manufacture of automotive and mobility components, the Group attempted to estimate how much of its CapEx is associated with that activity. That was not possible, however, since the physical assets used to make a part for use in an electric vehicle (eligible activity) are for the most part the same assets as are used to make parts for use in a non-electric vehicle (non-eligible activity). The company is working to develop and improve its methodology and technological toolkit to enable it to directly identify the CapEx associated directly with the eligible activity.\n\nAs for the rest of its CapEx, the Group assessed whether the activities described in the Regulations are activities carried out by CIE Automotive, concluding that the amount of associated CapEx is not material.\n\nLikewise, in an attempt to comply with the Regulation requirements, the Tables include the most significant activities, even though the KPI reported by the company is equivalent to 0%, specifically, activities 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment and 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies, which account for just 323 thousand euros, just 0.1% of the company's Total CapEx.\n\nIt was concluded, therefore, that eligible CapEx under the Taxonomy is equivalent to 0%, so that alignment was not assessed for these activities; nevertheless, the eligible figures are provided in the section titled \"Data tables and glossary\".\n\n### **OpEx**\n\nThe OpEx KPI is defined as the percentage of Taxonomy-eligible OpEx (numerator) over total qualifying OpEx (denominator). That denominator covers direct noncapitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.\n\nIn 2023, the CIE Automotive Group's qualifying OpEx amounted to 60,045 thousand euros, equivalent to 1.7% of the CIE Automotive Group's total OpEx in 2023 (3,567 million euros), so that the Group's qualifying OpEx is considered non-material and, as prescribed in section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Commission Delegated Regulation of 6 July 2021, the numerator is therefore disclosed as being equal to zero, although the denominator is disclosed.\n\n|   | Chairman<br>and<br>CEO's<br>statement             |  |\n|---|---------------------------------------------------|--|\n| 1 | 2023<br>highlights                                |  |\n| 2 | Ready<br>for change                               |  |\n| 3 | Record<br>earnings                                |  |\n| 4 | Common<br>responsibility,<br>shared benefits      |  |\n| 5 | Our response to<br>the environmental<br>challenge |  |\n| 6 | Responsible<br>management                         |  |\n|   | About                                             |  |\n\n[this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/15 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The overall tone of the image is soft and minimalist, with a focus on basic shapes and a muted color palette.\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" in bold, black letters. To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" with a gray quotation mark above the number.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n**5.7**\n\n# **Environmental risk management**\n\nThe risk of accidents is covered by the company's civil liability insurance, while the company underwrites gradual pollution risk for the following factories in Spain: CIE Alcasting (aluminium), CIE Amaya (machining), CIE Galfor (forging), CIE Inyectametal (aluminium) and CIE Vilanova (aluminium). The last three facilities have integrated pollution prevention control (IPPC) permits. The claims limit on that gradual pollution insurance policy for those five factories is €3 million.\n\nTo reinforce the management of its environmental and safety risks, CIE Automotive is working on a joint project with the technical department at its insurance broker, which is part of a bigger project addressed in the \"Customer satisfaction\" section. Specifically, a series of risks are being evaluated and prioritised in accordance with criteria established by the broker's risk engineers with the idea of formulating plans for their elimination, or at least mitigation. In 2023, this project focused on factories in North America, Brazil and India, prioritising the largest facilities or those with most assets involved. There were also follow-up visits to factories already inspected in prior years.\n\nClimate change also poses a threat to the company's ability to attain its strategic targets. To that end, CIE Automotive includes climate change risk in its risk mapping process, addressing not only the risks deriving from the company's impact on the environment and climate change, but also the risks posed to the company by the environment and climate change, and the interrelationship between the two.\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/16 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Specifically, in 2023, the company assessed 12 risks, gathering input from\n\n145 professionals in total.\n\nThe climate risk map is integrated within CIE Automotive's enterprise risk management (ERM) system, which follows ISO 31000 methodology, so as to provide reasonable assurance that all significant climate risks are duly identified, evaluated, prevented and continuously monitored. Those risks are approved at the board level and managed in keeping with defined risk\n\ntolerance thresholds.\n\nThe climate risk assessment contemplates transition and physical risks and also focuses on the opportunities that climate change could generate.\n\nThe accompanying chart depicts the classification of risks and opportunities considered in this process so that they can be assessed, including their financial impact, and subsequently managed and mitigated. The\n\nprocess of measuring the financial impact of these risks is currently under development so as to cater to the needs and requirements brought to us by our stakeholders in recent years and those we expect to face in the coming years.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/169/Picture/19 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

It starts with \"Regulations\" and \"Analysis\" (split into \"Internal\" and \"External\"), both feeding into a \"Risk list\". A table labeled \"SCENARIOS\" with columns \"OPTIM\", \"MED\", and \"PESSIM\" and rows for the years 2020, 2030, and 2050 is connected to the \"Risk list\". The \"Risk list\" also connects to \"Variable\" (Transition Physical), which in turn leads to \"Risks\" (Transition Physical). \"Governance\" is positioned at the top, influencing the \"Variable\". Several factors feed into \"Governance\", including \"IPCC\", \"WWF\", \"AIE\", \"Internal\", and \"Regulatory\". \"Sector\" (with \"Sernauto\", \"ACICAE\", \"S&P IHS\", and \"EGVIA\"), \"GDP\" (with \"Car ownership\", \"Exchange rate\", \"Age of vehicle fleet\", and \"Purchasing power\"), and \"Studies\" (Public and private in collaboration with anlaysts) also feed into \"Governance\". \"Governance\" also influences \"Opportunities\". The \"Risks\" branch out into two paths: one involving \"Key individual\", \"Weighting\", \"Map\", and \"Mitigation measures\", and another involving \"Key individual\", \"Weighting\", \"Map\", and \"Mitigation measures\", as well as \"Exposure + Vulnerability\", \"Adaptability\", \"Risk ranking\", \"Financial impact\", and \"Under development\". Text at the bottom provides definitions for \"IPCC\", \"WWF\", \"IEA\", and \"GDP\".\n\nThe risk and opportunity assessment process is depicted schematically in the chart above. It shows the types of physical and transition risks, the method used to identify risks and how they are modelled for different scenarios.\n\nThose scenarios cover quantitative variables, such as the trend in GDP by country, car ownership indices and S&P IHS production data in the case of transition risks. They also contemplate qualitative variables. Other quantitative variables such as temperature changes, heat stress, changes in precipitation types and patterns (rain, hail, snow and ice) and water stress are used for physical and transition risks but are more important to the former.\n\nThe scenarios contemplate time horizons that start from current data or from 2020 in the absence of more recent data and run to 2030 and 2050, the deadline by which CIE Automotive has pledged to be climate neutral.\n\nThe process also considers qualitative variables derived from sector analyses and studies sourced from organisations such as ACICAE, SERNAUTO and EGVIA, and from public and private studies by different consultancy firms and analysts who collaborate with CIE Automotive.\n\nBased on this information, the Environment Department selects and describes the risks identified as most material for the company. The entire process is supervised by the governance layer outlined above.\n\nTo categorise the risks, the organisation identifies key individuals with different backgrounds and duties and deep knowledge and involvement at the local or factory levels and at the country or regional levels and at the overall group level. Once the weightings are applied, the climate risk map takes shape *[refer to section \"Climate risks evaluated in 20223\"]* and the corresponding mitigation\n\nmeasures are presented and duly and coherently associated with the Strategic Plan, which is available on the website in both standard format and in the form of streamed presentation by management.\n\nA detailed procedure is being drawn up for tackling physical risks so as to consider exposure and vulnerability separately (this aspect was prioritised in 2023). Adaptability criteria will be layered in subsequently to create a ranking of risks and the last step will be to assess the financial impact of the various climate risks. Note that the financial impact assessment aspect has yet to be comprehensively regulated so that this process will also need to factor in the definitive regulations.\n\nChairman and CEO's\n\n[statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\nImage /page/170/Figure/7 description: The image shows the number 5 in gray on the left side of the image.

The process begins with two types of variables: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative variables include GDP, car ownership, S&P IHS, age of vehicle fleet, and purchasing power. Qualitative variables include the world is changing, the automotive world is changing, and the world of suppliers is changing. The variables feed into risk variables, which then feed into weighting at CIE Central. The output of weighting at CIE Central is a risk assessment matrix, which plots probability against impact. The matrix is divided into three zones: low risk, medium risk, and high risk. The risk assessment matrix is used to determine the financial impact and risk mitigation strategies. The process is overseen by governance, which is informed by the divisional, CEO, and strategic plan.\n\nThe transition risk assessment is based on an internal and external context analysis. This analysis considers qualitative and quantitative variables, the latter mostly external. The qualitative factors analysed were classified as follows:\n\n- The world is changing\n- The automotive world is changing\n- The supplier world is changing\n\nThis is evident in the 2025 Strategic Plan documents and in section 2.1 of this report, where the associated opportunities are also analysed.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/18 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

As a result, some technologies could lose share in the overall business mix, potentially intensifying competition for the remaining volumes and, by extension, driving a reduction in volumes or margins in certain products or technologies.\n\nIt is still too early to tell when the automotive sector will revisit prepandemic production and sales levels, all the more so considering the various market developments mentioned throughout this report and the fact that market changes are currently unfolding with such great speed. The company plans to reinforce the flexibility of its model to adapt to unfolding and future customer needs and emerging trends. Product portfolio diversification will give it a unique ability to adapt relative to its competitors. A portfolio in which more than eight out of every 10 products are independent of a vehicle's propulsion system and therefore not impacted by the sector electrification trend. For the rest of its parts, the company is working from the technological and market standpoints to make the most of the opportunities emerging in the battery, engine/motor, power electronics and gearshift areas. As for the risk associated with products for which there is no clear substitute in zero-emission cars, CIE Automotive plans to increase its presence in those that have a bigger role to play in the vehicle light-weighting trend (forged chassis and suspension parts) and in machined shafts and gears. It also wants to actively pursue business in technologies that customers are likely to outsource in order to focus on new challenges, such as connectivity, automated driving and the provision of embedded software solutions. In parallel, the company will continue to focus on its innovation effort in these same areas which is expected to give the company a winning edge in the coming years, positioning it to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate the resulting market. The transition towards a low-carbon economy will highlight the efforts companies like CIE Automotive have been making for years to introduce eco-design concepts from the earliest stages of product development\n\nand build circularity into all of their processes. What does look likely is that over a medium-term horizon the automotive companies stand to emerge stronger from the crisis to the extent they can adapt to the new scenario, foreseeably characterised by the following factors, on which CIE Automotive is already specifically working:\n\n• Concentration processes: fewer players but companies that are larger, more diversified and more resilient in the face of future\n\n- Reduction of surplus capacity.\n- crises.\n- prepare for sector transformation.\n- Greater financial control and discipline.\n- Eco-efficiency and circularity.\n- Commitment to mitigating environmental impacts.\n\n• Strategic alliances designed to share the investment needed to\n\nCIE Automotive's business model has already proven its resilience and counter-cyclical credentials in the face of numerous crises thanks to the combination of geographic, technological and customer diversification, framed by a decentralised management model and strict financial discipline. Lastly, in the shorter term, the company is currently focused on locking in access to the raw materials it needs, to which end it is reinforcing its GLOCAL (global management with local application) purchasing model, coupled with its multi-location footprint, to be close to the OEMs and not have to depend on global supply chains.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n> **Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/17 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Next to the icon are the words \"INVESTMENT RISKS\" and \"TECHNOLOGY RISKS\".\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/25 description: The image shows a green icon with a triangle containing an exclamation point, and a speedometer. To the right of the icon is the text \"ACUTE RI\".\n\nRisks associated with greater uncertainty regarding returns on investment: the changes needed to achieve carbon neutrality could spell higher investments in different volume and margin scenarios to those navigated to date. Those investments may make it possible to process more sustainable materials, use more sustainable and climate-neutral sources of energy, devise more circular manufacturing processes or deliver parts with better eco-design and sustainability attributes. Manufacturing technology is what CIE Automotive does. That is why it is essential to monitor how it evolves, that being one of the most recurring and important tasks performed by each division. Thanks to that constant monitoring, the company sees a bright future for the technologies it is active in. In some of those technologies, the challenge lies with taking advantage of the growth opportunities being thrown up by emerging trends; in others, they key lies with maximising competitiveness by leveraging innovation, Industry 4.0 tools and the cost efficiency that sets the group apart. In sum, to turn the risk posed by new trends into an opportunity to attain leadership.\n\nIn all areas of the group, CIE Automotive implements cuttingedge technology into its facilities and management models with the aim of rendering its productive processes more efficient and responding to the automotive sector's needs by embracing ecoefficiency, circularity and climate mitigation measures. Also as a result of that monitoring, when designing its investment plans, the company contemplates the various trends that are shaping the automotive sector, such as emission standard requirements, new\n\ncomfort-driven mobility concepts and vehicle electrification. To fund those investments in R&D, to which the group earmarks around 2% of revenue each year, CIE Automotive has a number of different sources of financing at the regional, national and supranational levels. Moreover, the company hopes to avail of Next Generation EU funds to finance specific projects related with green transition and digital transformation, specifically including projects to develop new battery structure, fuel cell and range extender concepts and materials; new concepts and features related with the refashioning of car interiors, led by the CIE Comfort division; and certain Industry 4.0 projects.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\n**ACUTE RISKS** These risks arise as a result of extreme climate events (such as prolonged droughts or flooding).\n\nThe risk of accidents is covered by the company's civil liability insurance. In December 2019, the company began to specifically underwrite gradual pollution risk for certain factories in Spain, with a claims limit of €3 million. To reinforce the management of its environmental and safety risks, the company has embarked on a joint project with the technical experts from its insurance firms. Specifically, a series of risks are being evaluated and monitored in accordance with criteria established by the various participating companies with the idea of formulating plans for their elimination or at least mitigation.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n- **Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n- **Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n- **Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n#### **Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Each factory has a box plot showing the range of temperatures. The box plots are colored in black, gray, and orange.\n\n**CHRONIC RISKS**\n\nThese are the risks of more gradual changes with long-lasting effects, such as global warming, rising sea levels, protracted heatwaves or droughts, loss of biodiversity and changes in land or soil productivity.\n\nThis is another example of the utility provided by quantitative variables: the chart depicts the change in temperature in our locations, on average and at the extremes (2 metres above ground).\n\n> CIE Automotive has set specific environmental targets to be met by each of its facilities and\n\noperating regions. Those targets are aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda and recent Spanish legislation on climate change and the energy transition (Law 7/2021, of 20 May 2021) and are based\n\non the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. In addition, in support of the Paris Agreement's targets for curbing global warming, it belongs to Forética's Climate Change Cluster, a platform whose mission is to get Spanish businesses to address the main global climate change trends and debates and become an authority on corporate environmental matters.\n\n**Action plan** \n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/11 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The line graphs each display three lines labeled 'Min', 'Average', and 'Max' from 2020 to 2050. The Optimistic Pathway graph has green lines, the Current Trend Pathway graph has orange lines, and the Pessimistic Pathway graph has red lines. All three graphs have a y-axis ranging from 0 to 6.\n\n**WATER STRESS RISKS**\n\nRisks that affect the availability of water for production processes, i.e., the possibility that, given the availability of water, there could be a shortage for manufacturing and auxiliary processes (cooling, cleaning, etc.). Climate change in particularly vulnerable areas could lead to chronic water stress, impeding access to quality water.\n\nThis risk is a clear example of how new variables can inject robustness into our assessment: using the WWF tool (*https://riskfilter.org/water/home*), we were able to analyse the physical risk scenarios related with water. Below is the risk weighting for CIE Automotive's sites for a combination of physical risks: water scarcity, flooding, water quality, and ecosystem services status.\n\nThe chart above shows the trend in this risk over time in three scenarios: the optimistic pathway, the current pathway and the pessimistic pathway.\n\nThe company has analysed the situation across its various factories and at the water basins near their locations. In addition, in order to increase circularity, particularly with respect to the use of water,\n\neach factory has launched initiatives to reduce the use of water and increase its reuse by installing filtering and treatment facilities, some of which have resulted in drastic improvements in circularity.\n\n### **Action plan and risk mitigation**\n\n**2050 HORIZON**\n\nCurrent pathway trend.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/181/Picture/19 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The quality and efficiency of the functioning of the Board\n- 2. Boardroom composition\n- 3. The composition and functioning of the Board committees\n- 4. ESG aspects\n- 5. Communication policy\n- 6.

Other aspects\n\nThe assessment report compiled in January 2023 by the appraiser Evaluación de Consejos (EdC) (whose methodology and findings were outlined in detail in the 2022 Annual Report) concluded that the aggregate quantitative results indicated strong satisfaction with the performance of the Board of Directors and its committees, higher than the average at similar companies. The individual areas identified in the report as presenting more room for improvement, even though the results were better than are customary for comparable companies, were:\n\n- Succession planning\n- Communication policy\n\nThe findings of that report were shared with the Board of Directors during its meeting on 24 February 2023, as a result of which the CEO was put in charge of the company's communication policy. In addition, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee drew up CIE Automotive, S.A.'s Succession and Contingency Plan for submission to the Board of Directors for approval. That plan was approved by the Board of Directors on 14 December 2023.\n\nElsewhere, the Lead Independent Director, duly exercising her duties, communicated constantly with the rest of the independent directors throughout the year, echoing any concerns they had and sharing them with the Chairman or Vice Chairman.\n\nIn 2023 the company also focused on director training around sustainability matters in general, governance and the latest reporting, taxonomy and environmental regulations, without neglecting company issues. A specific session was provided to all members of the Board, another more generalist session was given online to the entire organisation, including the directors, and the members of the ESG Committee, along with the members of the Cross-Group ESG Committee received a separate exclusive session. All of which in line with the company's commitment to making firm progress on integrating these aspects into its business model and corporate strategy.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/22 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The goal of the new text is once again to ensure that the remuneration earned by CIE Automotive's directors is proportionate to the dedication and responsibilities assumed and aligned with market practices at comparable companies in Spain and abroad and with the long-term interests of all of the company's shareholders.\n\n#### **Director remuneration**\n\nAlthough the new Director Remuneration Policy is similar in structure to the outgoing policy, there have been a few changes. The terms of the long-term bonus tied to the company's share price performance accrued by the CEO have been adjusted to reflect the radical change in the socio-economic context and the company's share price performance since 2018, when the bonus was approved.\n\nThe Director Remuneration Policy stipulates that the fixed annual stipend for directors shall only be paid to non-executive directors that are particularly dedicated to the company, i.e., the chairman of the Board of Directors and the independent directors. The ceiling on director remuneration was increased at the 2023 AGM.\n\nAs under the outgoing policy, the full-time executive directors' remuneration regime is similar to that of the company's executives. Their remuneration comprises: fixed remuneration, a short-term, results-based bonus and, in the case of the CEO, a longterm bonus, conditional upon staying in the post for 10 years. The executive directors may also receive in-kind remuneration in the form of use of a company car.\n\nThe remuneration earned by the executive directors varies along with their responsibilities and the specific characteristics of the duties they perform and is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors at the recommendation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nIt is up to the Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee (based on prior verification of attainment of the established targets), to determine the level of delivery of the short-term bonuses and their amount.\n\nThe executive directors' remuneration may be topped up by health and life insurance, in line with market practice at comparable companies in terms of market capitalisation, size, ownership structure and international presence.\n\nIt should be noted that the variable remuneration of the group formed by the most important members of the Group's management includes a % of it linked to ESG performance. This group is included in Note 22 \"Expenses for employee benefits\" of the 2023 Consolidated Annual Accounts, as beneficiaries of a long-term incentive.\n\nhttps://\n\nFor further details, refer to the notes headed Employee benefits expense and Related-party transactions in the group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 and to the 2023 Annual Director Remuneration Report and the Remuneration Policy itself, all of which are published on the corporate website:\n\n|      | Total no. of people        | Men | Average remuneration € | Women | Average remuneration € |\n|------|----------------------------|-----|------------------------|-------|------------------------|\n| 2022 | Directors* 6               | 3   | 2,751,906              | 3     | 100,000                |\n|      | Key management personnel 9 | 5   | 1,607,112              | 4     | 480,214                |\n| 2023 | Directors* 6               | 3   | 8,494,919              | 3     | 100,000                |\n|      | Key management personnel 9 | 5   | 1,112,086              | 4     | 383,883                |\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\n**6**\n\nImage /page/198/Picture/17 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

All of its employees are required to familiarise themselves with it and failure to comply with it can lead to penalties, as prescribed under applicable legislation.\n\nAside from its employees, the company expects its business partners (joint venturers, suppliers, customers, contractors and other partners) to align their behaviour with the Code of Professional Conduct and apply equivalent standards of ethics to those upheld by CIE Automotive.\n\nThe Code of Professional Conduct itself contemplates how its implementation should be supervised and how to proceed in the event of breaches. Specifically, it tasks the Board of Director's ESG Committee with due oversight of implementation of the Code of Professional Conduct and details how to make enquiries and report improprieties and breaches through the Whistleblowing Channel.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)** \n\n**challenge**\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0)**\n\nAbout [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\n**2**\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**5**\n\nImage /page/200/Picture/10 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In 2023 it reinforced this internal reporting channel by integrating an IT platform into its corporate website to secure the reporting process and simplify case management by the company.\n\nThis cutting-edge platform is user-friendly and available in all the languages of the company's markets. If gives users the possibility of opening up a secure communication channel for filing a report and providing additional information in different formats (in writing, voice messages, etc.). All of the information is confidential and if the whistleblower so wishes, anonymous.\n\nThe new online channel meets all the stipulations of Spanish Law 2/2023, of 20 February 2023, on the protection of persons reporting regulatory breaches and incidents of corruption and aligned with applicable international legal requirements derived from the European Whistleblowing Directive.\n\nAdaptation for this new piece of legislation has involved modification of the Whistleblowing Channel Rules, which set down the system's general principles and procedures.\n\nIn 2023 the company received 56 complaints through its Whistleblowing Channel, 21 more than in 2022. Those complaints were related with:\n\n- People management with respect to work scheduling for everyday factory work purposes (20 complaints).\n- Workplace harassment (16): inappropriate attitudes on the part of managers vis-a-vis factory workers.\n- Fraud and corruption (seven): malpractice at several factories by procurement, engineering and production staff who breached CIE Automotive's general purchasing terms for their own benefit. Although the amounts involved were not material and the scale of the contracts with the suppliers in question did not have a material impact on earnings at the factories involved, the events harmed the group's image and violated its ethics commitment.\n- Breach of the Code of Professional Conduct (six): failure on the part of certain employees to uphold the rules of conduct.\n- Business management (four): related with the company's dealings with its stakeholders.\n- Discrimination (two): failure to guarantee equal opportunities.\n- Sexual harassment (one): inappropriate attitudes on the part of managers vis-a-vis factory workers.\n\nIn 2022, by comparison, the reports were related with workplace harassment (13), people management with respect to work scheduling (nine), fraud and corruption (five), sexual harassment (three), business management (two), breaches of the Code of Professional Conduct (two) and discrimination (one).\n\nIn all of the cases reported in 2023 and notified to the ESG Committee, the opportune actions were taken to analyse, monitor and remedy or close the cases.\n\nThose actions included nine dismissals: three related with the cases of fraud and corruption reported, two with the Code of Professional Conduct breaches, two with the business management cases, as well as one person who participated in the workplace harassment cases and one person involved in the discrimination reports.\n\nIn addition, executives and HR professionals intervened to address the workplace and sexual harassment and discrimination reports and prevent their recurrence via enhanced education on the company's values and Code of Professional Conduct rules.\n\nChairman\n\nand CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 1 2 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/201/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Those policies are binding upon all members of the organisation. These policies were approved by the Board of Directors for the first time in December 2015 and revised, updated and reapproved between 2019 and February 2021. In 2023 the company approved a new Director Remuneration Policy, which is in force until 2026, and at year-end was immersed in the process of reviewing and updating the universe of corporate policies comprising its ethics framework, which is nearly complete and will finalise when the updated policies are presented to the Board of Directors for approval in early 2024.\n\nAll of CIE Automotive's corporate policies can be accessed via the corporate website.\n\n**[shared benefits](#page-64-0)**\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, 1 2 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\nImage /page/202/Picture/20 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

That commitment is tangible in its endorsement of the ten principles enshrined in the United Nations Global Compact.\n\nIn addition to the Code of Professional Conduct, whose calls for tackling fraud and corruption, the company has an official Anti-Corruption and Anti-Fraud Policy which stipulates that dealings with public officials and authorities must be governed by the principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, impartiality and lawfulness.\n\nThe company is politically neutral and does not finance, either directly or indirectly, political parties or their representatives or candidates, either in Spain or abroad.\n\nOne of the Internal Audit Department's duties is to oversee that the group companies are operating lawfully and in keeping with the defined corporate values.\n\nAs was the case in 2022, no public legal cases were brought against the organisation or its employees in relation with corruption in 2023.\n\n#### **Measures to combat money laundering**\n\nThe group introduced its Corporate Crime Prevention Model in 2015 and updated it in October 2019 to introduce a Support Unit with independent intervention and control powers within the organisation, whose mandate is to oversee compliance therewith. The company leverages that model to articulate its effort to thwart money laundering, as well as providing training on the Code of Professional Conduct and application of the various corporate policies.\n\nIn order to prevent or minimise the probability of occurrence of inappropriate or illicit conduct and ensure that any such conduct is brought to a halt, if detected, and accountability duly sought, in 2021, CIE Automotive drew up a Compliance and Criminal Risk Prevention Policy.\n\n### **Measures to prevent corruption and bribery**\n\nEach country has its own local Corporate Crime Prevention Manual, which is aligned with the corporate version.\n\nEvery time the criminal risk map is introduced to a new market, specific training is provided to brief employees about the company's policies and procedures and remind the factories about applicable local legislation.\n\nIn 2023 the company deployed its criminal risk map in new markets, specifically Italy, Romania and Slovakia. The year before it had extended the map to Spain, France and Germany, in Europe, and to India, and completed the annual updates of its risk maps in the US, Mexico, Brazil, China and the Czech Republic, thus completing coverage of the countries that account for the bulk of the group's business activities. CIE Automotive, S.A. is committed to complying stringently with anti-trust law. To that end is promises to achieve its business objectives by ethical, legitimate, faultless and lawful means, complying with all applicable laws. CIE Automotive did not receive any fines related with anti-trust infringements or derived from cartel operations, price-setting, exclusivity agreements, monopolistic practices or other\n\nIn 2023, following updates to local legislation in some of the company's business markets, new crimes, such as attacks on moral integrity, were added to the maps.\n\n#### **Anti-trust law**\n\nconduct that could limit free competition in 2023.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/203/Picture/25 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

These risks, which are approved at the Board level, are managed in keeping with defined risk appetite and tolerance thresholds.\n\nThe ERM, framed by the Risk Control and Management Policy, follows ISO 31000 methodology and is supervised by the Board of Directors, which delegates its supervision and correct functioning in its Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThanks to the unflagging support of the senior executives and management team, and underpinned by rigorous strategic planning, CIE Automotive seeks to create an environment conducive to working with risks in check. The goal is to manage these risks actively with the aim of, by means of correct management and value creation, allowing new opportunities to rise.\n\nImage /page/206/Figure/16 description: The image shows four triangular icons, each paired with a text description.

A new compliance risk was added: the reliability of the non-financial reporting process. The HR-related risks were updated and reduced from five in 2022 to four this year as talent attraction and retention were rolled into one.\n\n### **Society**\n\n- Reputational damage as a result of activities not linked directly to the company's operations.\n- Non-alignment of the supply chain with the group's ESG commitments.\n- \n- Change in market trends.

That is the case of risks classified as low probability and low impact.\n\nThe 2023 risk map once again reaffirmed the risk factor that is most intrinsic to the sector and its performance, namely shifting market trends, as well as one that is specific to the trajectory, growth and future of CIE Automotive, namely management of its M&Aled growth.\n\nThe 2023 mapping exercise also evidenced great concern within the organisation about geopolitical risk and its impact on delivery of its strategic targets.\n\nThe mapping exercise also highlighted concern over cybersecurity and the financial damage its mismanagement could pose, as well as importance of sustainable supply chain management.\n\nAnother development in 2023 was the return to the fore of financial risk, specifically the need to control exposure to variations in interest and exchange rates and commodity prices.\n\nNote, that the actions taken and controls applied in 2023 successfully mitigated one key risk factor, which was afforded priority treatment in recent years and no longer ranks among those of greatest concern, namely care for the company's most important asset, its people, along with the associated risks: having a sufficiently deep team of trained and well-prepared professionals and adequate succession planning.\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/210/Picture/15 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Below the title is a line graph in orange, and the text \"CHANGE IN MARKET TRENDS\".\n\nThe automotive industry is undergoing disruptive changes for which the company needs to be prepared by maintaining the flexibility required to adapt to customers' unfolding or future demands, suppliers' needs and increasingly stringent regulations.\n\nNew automotive technologies (e.g. in the area of connectivity and autonomous driving) are reducing demand for some of our core products while creating demand for new systems and parts.\n\n*[For more detailed information about the key market trends, refer to chapter 2. Sector background]*\n\nThroughout the pages of this report, the reader has been told about CIE Automotive's distinctive\n\nbusiness model which has proven highly consistent in dynamic and challenging environments over the past several years and is expected to remain similarly resilient in the face of the challenges that loom. The key to tackling the current trend shifts lies with coordinating all of the group's departments end to end. The unit that handles R&D and market studies analyses the trends that are shaping the sector exhaustively and continually (for more information, refer to chapter 2.1.3) and shares its findings with the sales area and the various divisions. That enables an informed assessment of their potential impact and formulation of the action plans that the company has been feeding into its strategic plans since 2015. That assessment also factors in the challenges highlighted in chapter 2, specifically:\n\n- Economic slowdown.\n- Increase in borrowing costs.\n- Significant CAPEX in EVs.\n- Price war in EVs.\n\nThis process also taps the opportunities itemised in that same chapter.\n\nCollaboration on R&D projects, sometimes on a standalone basis and other times in partnership with customers, has proven crucial in areas such as electrification, the circular economy, vehicle light-weighting,\n\nsafety and Industry 4.0. These projects have led to major collaboration with traditional customers and kept the company aligned with market trends. In tandem the sales area has worked intensely to penetrate the sector's newcomers, adapting its approach to their idiosyncrasies. This effort has paid off with the company already producing at scale for customers with business models that are radically different from those of its traditional customer base and new developments in the pipeline.\n\nThe company has also responded proactively to the growing importance of climate action, as is evident in its unification of the engineering and environmental departments. As a result it now builds sustainability, decarbonisation, circular economy and ecodesign considerations in at the earliest stages of new product and project development.\n\nCIE Automotive constantly reinforces the flexibility of its model characterised by geographical, customer and technology diversification - to adapt to its customers' current and future needs and emerging automotive trends. Portfolio diversification, with over 80% of products independent of the vehicle propulsion system, gives it an ability to adapt that sets it apart from its competitors.\n\nIn terms of the risk associated with products with no clear substitute in zero-emission vehicles, the company is looking to increase its presence in areas that make a significant contribution to vehicle light-weighting such as forged chassis and suspension parts. It also plans to focus on axle and gear machining and to outsource traditional technologies in order to free up resources to focus on new challenges such as connectivity, autonomous driving and software solutions.\n\n### **Action plan**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/211/Picture/29 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" with a quotation mark above it.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nCIE Automotive has set itself annual sales targets with a specific focus on new-energy vehicles (NEV). The 2025 Strategic Plan focuses on comfort, tapping the growing importance of this feature in users' buying decisions.\n\nThe company has invested in employee training and skill-building in order to tackle the sector's digitalisation and is working with technology firms and training centres to attract talent with these skillsets. It is also worth highlighting the boost given to the training area within the Pilot Testing Advanced Manufacturing Taskforce led by the Basque regional government.\n\nCIE Automotive stands out for its commitment to decarbonisation and circularity in all processes, aligning itself with the push for a more sustainable economy. Its Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project is working to help decarbonise the supply chain and achieve net zero\n\nemissions by 2050.\n\nCIE Automotive's business model, underpinned by its geographic diversity and decentralised management model, has proven its resilience throughout a succession of crises. The company engages its entire supply chain, detecting opportunities with customers and bringing those needs and opportunities to its suppliers.\n\nIn the near term it is focused on ensuring a smooth supply of raw materials, reinforcing its GLOCAL (global management with local application) procurement model and continuing with its multilocation footprint so as to reduce dependence on global supply chains and stay close to the OEMs.\n\n**FINANCIAL**\n\n**RISK**\n\nThe group's business activities expose it to various types of financial risk: market risk (including exchange rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk.\n\n> The group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial\n\nmarkets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The group arranges derivative financial instruments to hedge certain exposures.\n\nIn the broadest sense, financial risk management is designed to control exposure to variations in interest and exchange rates and commodity prices. This effort, supervised by the group's Finance Department,\n\ntranslates into the purchase of financial instruments that allow it, to the extent possible, benefit from favourable movements in exchange and interest rates while limiting some or all of its exposure to unfavourable developments.\n\n*[For further information, refer to the group's consolidated financial statements and directors' report for the year ended 31 December* \n\n*2023]*\n\n**Action plan** \n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\nImage /page/212/Picture/24 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The integration of new firms into the group requires an initial effort in order to adjust their respective cultures and ways of doing things to align them with CIE Automotive's management methods and profitability thresholds. In addition, the fact of having local partners (joint ventures and/or alliances with private and public companies and organisations) could generate conflict and wariness that can affect business performance directly or generate international compliance vulnerabilities.\n\n> CIE Automotive works hard to embed its business model and corporate culture at newly\n\n- \n- acquired companies. The most noteworthy initiatives on this front include:\n- Involving the management team in M&A transactions.\n\n• Defining and implementing a clear management model designed to enable the company to assume\n\n- control over new acquirees rapidly.\n- \n\n• Fostering the readiness and availability of key internal managers to tackle new integrations.\n\n2023 once again showed how a long list of potential external shocks, ranging from extreme meteorological phenomena, inflation fuelled by energy price volatility and migratory and demographic challenges, to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tensions between the US and China, expose governments to litany of risks they may not be ready to handle amidst social and institutional weaknesses.\n\nStates under financial pressure as a result of the above-listed shocks could seek budget balance by passing laws and introducing levies to stem their fiscal deficits. Those forces are pushing interest rates and inflation higher, affecting GDP and employment and, as a result, the population's purchasing power and access to credit, ultimately denting consumer spending and the purchase of cars.\n\n**MANAGEMENT OF M&A-LED GROWTH GEOPOLITICAL RISK** Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0)** About [this report](#page-229-0) [Data tables](#page-261-0) **1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\nFurthermore, in a new global geopolitical order, legal and compliance teams will be forced to deal across borders with regulatory requirements that are ambiguous, and/or conflicting, and/or uneconomical.\n\n> The company is focused on locking in access to the raw materials it needs, to which end it is reinforcing\n\nits GLOCAL (global management with local application) purchasing model, coupled with its multi-location footprint, to be close to the OEMs and not have to depend on global supply chains. In other words, a \"local production for local supply\" strategy.\n\nThe GLOCAL approach brings other advantages such as a reduction in the company's carbon footprint, a lower reverse logistics (returns) impact and reduced vulnerability to regulatory changes due to their application over different time horizons and swings.\n\nCIE Automotive's decentralised management approach ensures its decision-making is quick, simple and direct. Each region and division takes the decisions that best serve their prevailing interests at any given time with the support of the firm's Corporate Areas and Network Services vested with a group-wide remit: Europe, North America, Brazil and Asia.\n\nDespite classification into major regions and divisions (the main technologies), the factories, albeit guided by the company's strategy, have full operational autonomy and are managed by local teams, so dissipating business continuity risks for the company as a whole as a result of armed conflicts, the related international sanctions or other similar risks.\n\n**Action plan**\n\n### **Action plan**\n\nImage /page/213/Picture/21 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" in black, with a gray quotation mark above it.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe project comprises three phases:\n\n- Scenario identification (completed in 2021).\n- Risk quantification (completed in 2022).\n- ECOR assessment, methodology used by the consultant to calculate the financial impact of cybersecurity risks (scheduled for completion in the first half of 2024).\n\nNoteworthy from the work performed in 2023:\n\n- Specific risk-by-risk analysis as a function of probability of occurrence and impact for each IT group.\n- Definition of an IT security control plan with three stringency levels.\n- Mapping of the maturity level of the baseline controls of each IT group with the specific risks to calculate the residual risk.\n- Development of the associated scorecard in PowerBI.\n\nHaving completed the initially defined three phases, in 2024 the plan\n\nis to:\n\n• Execute the defined risk management methodology and gather information from the various IT group heads.\n\n• Develop the defined baseline controls, prioritising those with a bigger impact on each IT group's security.\n\n• Update the values used to calculate risk and the status of the\n\n• Assess the adequacy of the baseline controls for evaluating\n\n- \n- \n- controls applied.\n- potential acquisitions.\n\nAn IT security officer has been appointed as part of the group's reinforced commitment to this function. Lastly, to encourage awareness of IT security risks across the organisation, the company continued to provide group-wide training in 2023, an effort that will carry over to 2024.\n\n**CYBERSECURITY** Cybersecurity, understood as the shielding of IT assets by handling threats that could jeopardise the information that is processed, stored and distributed over interconnected IT systems, has emerged as one of the biggest risks facing companies today. Customers are making increasing security demands of their suppliers. It is vital to pay particular attention to users and possible improper usage; service outsourcing and potential sources of loss or damage (theft, fire, etc.).\n\nThe shift to more flexible working arrangements is leaving communication networks more exposed to potential attacks.\n\n**Action plan**\n\n**Action plan** CIE Automotive launched a cybersecurity consultancy project to map out the potential IT system risks to which the group is exposed in 2021.\n\nChairman and\n\nCEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\nImage /page/214/Picture/26 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

Also an opportunity for the procurement managers, guided by ongoing implementation of the successful GLOCAL supply chain management model, to work even harder to encourage suppliers to meet ESG compliance requirements. The ultimate goal is to create a solid, flexible and resilient supply chain aligned with the SDGs.\n\nRisk mitigation involves:\n\n- Renewing ISO 20400 Sustainable Procurement certification annually so obtaining external verification of correct management of ESG matters.\n- Continuing to apply common procedures aligned with each country's legal requirements and the group's ESG strategy.\n- Providing the organisation with an objective ESG scoring system for the supply chain via the Supplier Portal and specific indicators.\n\n• Monitoring the supply chain's ESG indicators quarterly. Each factory has to identify additional actions to implement in order to\n\n• Continuing to provide all buyer teams with ongoing training.\n\n• Providing local suppliers with ESG training via specific sessions\n\n• Encouraging ESG audits worldwide.

More specifically, in 2023 we continued to provide our people with additional training to give them the skills needed to take on new challenges; we evaluated our partners using our internal professional development tool; we stepped up international exchanges (including the Ulysses programme); and each factory manager actively managed its staff with a view to ensuring a flow of future-proof backgrounds. Indeed, generational\n\ndiversity was one of the classes of diversity analysed in the diversity assessments which have already been conducted at over 90% of our\n\nlocations.\n\nLastly, we actively managed two acquisitions, one in Hungary and the other in Brazil, bringing new profiles and backgrounds into the group which are bound to be key to its future, as has been the case so often in the past.\n\n*[For further information, refer to Our TEAM: the people behind the* \n\n*transformation]*\n\n**HUMAN CAPITAL FOR GROWTH**\n\nManagement of the current and projected pace of growth requires consolidation and development of the company's finest asset, its people. That is why it is fundamental to agree a unified training and promotion plan with the aim of planning, appraising and enhancing professionals' current and future skillsets so as to facilitate delivery of CIE Automotive's strategic objectives.\n\nThanks to the actions taken in 2023, CIE Automotive managed to mitigate the probability of materialisation of the following risk, ranked as a priority in 2022, and, therefore, no longer deemed in need of priority attention in the 2023 risk map.\n\n### **Mitigation actions**\n\n#### Chairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\nImage /page/216/Picture/6 description: The image shows the number 4, followed by the words \"Common responsibility, shared benefits\".\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/216/Picture/21 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

These awards, which are sponsored by Deloitte Legal and Iberdrola, with Esade as academic partner, reward globally applicable projects that facilitate efficient and suitable management of an organisation's existing global risks, allowing it to tackle common and specific risks faced.\n\nIn selecting CIE Automotive as finalist, the jurors rated the scope and scale of the criminal compliance initiative, the technology used, the applicable rules and the oversight and monitoring model.\n\n*Finalist in the Expansión Compliance Awards*\n\n• Notifying the Audit and Compliance Committee clearly and immediately of any Model breaches that come to light in the course of its review work.\n\nCIE Automotive analyses the level of maturity attained by Model from time to time. During the last update, carried out between 2019 and 2020, it decided to identify the most significant subsidiaries in terms of criminal compliance, analyse the differences with respect to the legislation applicable in Spain and adapt the model to suit each country's characteristics. Since then, the Model has been introduced in most of the company's business markets: Spain, France, Germany, Czechia, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, US, Mexico, Brazil, India and China.\n\nIn 2023 the Model was implemented in Italy, Slovakia and Romania and the regulatory framework in Portugal was analysed. Except in Portugal, where this will happen in 2024, an individual criminal risk map was prepared, joining and consolidating the body of risk maps for the other countries that have been added to its scope since 2020.\n\nAs in 2022, this work began with a regulatory benchmarking exercise to map out the regulations applicable in each jurisdiction, followed by the design of the corporate standards for controlling the main criminal risks to which the various regions are exposed.\n\nTo design the new versions, the company started from the Model developed and implemented in Spain, the various mandatory requirements under local legislation, best national and international practices and suggestions for improving the Model gathered from the various jurisdictions. Once that was done a series of questionnaires were sent to the subsidiaries to identify criminal risks, individuals/functions and controls for subsequent analysis and inclusion, along with the suggestions for improvement and other specific considerations.\n\nIn addition, new criminal risk controls were launched in 2023 to cover newly added risks and reflect the global rollout of the Model between 2020 and 2023.\n\n## **In 2023 the Model was implemented in Italy, Slovakia and Romania** and\n\nthe regulatory framework in Portugal was analysed\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0)**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0)**\n\n**Common** \n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 2 3**\n\n**responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/218/Picture/23 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

Those criminal risks are approved at the Board level and managed in keeping with defined risk appetite and tolerance thresholds.\n\nThe process is coordinated by the Compliance Department and the results are presented to the Audit and Compliance Committee for validation and approval; the Audit and Compliance Committee in turn reports on its assessment to the Board of Directors.\n\nImage /page/219/Picture/12 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

It estimates, in euros, the impact on EBITDA (framed by the defined parameters) of the potential materialisation of each risk and includes all of the controls launched at each factory during the year, indicating their current performance status, along with the corresponding evidence. The entire process is monitored via the internal management tool, SAP GRC.\n\nA total of 271 people participated in drawing up the criminal risk map, 38 more than in 2022, and the exercise involved 12 countries, three more than in 2022: the US, Mexico, Brazil, India, China and the European markets - Spain, France, Germany, Czechia, Italy, Romania and Slovakia. Each respondent considered a time horizon of 2025 and their\n\nspecific area of geographic influence. The company's aim is to come up with a national assessment for each country in which it has business operations within the horizon of its 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\nThe criminal risks assessed in 2023 are the result of benchmarking exercises to identify the regulations applicable in each national jurisdiction. To design this new version of the risk map, the company started from the Model developed and implemented in Spain, the various mandatory requirements under local legislation, best national and international practices and suggestions for improving the Model gathered from the various jurisdictions.\n\nFollowing that analysis, 37 potential crimes were evaluated by the various professionals identified for that task; some but not all of them are offences itemised in Spain's Criminal Code. Given that the company still has to analyse some of its markets, the aggregate 2023 map is not quite yet a global map but rather a map that rolls up the 37 offences identified in the 12 countries where this work has been completed. The global risk map, assuming the group's current footprint, will be a reality by 2025, so delivering the target set down in the 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\n# Criminal risk map\n\nOn the basis of the boundary described above and the residual risk assessment approach, the map reveals that none of the criminal risks evaluated presents a medium or high probability of materialisation or would have a significant or severe impact on EBITDA if they were to materialise. Indeed, most of the assessments highlight the credibility of the existing Model, based on global monitoring of the controls performed at the factory, technology and country levels, as well as on continuous specific training.\n\nImage /page/220/Picture/20 description: The image shows a white scale of justice against a gray background.

The plant has a single stem and two leaves. The color scheme is a gradient of orange, with the bottom of the circle and the ground area being a lighter shade, gradually darkening towards the plant and the upper part of the circle. The overall design is simple and clean, suggesting themes of growth, nature, or sustainability.\n\nImage /page/221/Picture/14 description: The image shows two folders, one slightly behind the other, with a padlock icon superimposed on the front folder. The folders are depicted in a light orange gradient, while the padlock is a solid orange color. The padlock is positioned in the lower right corner of the front folder, suggesting security or restricted access to the folder's contents.\n\nExercising the due control required under Spain's Criminal Code requires the\n\ncompany to implement continuous control mechanisms and to appoint internal control bodies to follow up on the controls implemented and any possible criminal risks. Framed by those legislative requirements, CIE Automotive has defined a control structure made up of: (i) the Board of Directors, as the highest decision-making body; (ii) the Audit and Compliance Committee, as oversight and control body; and (iii) the Support Unit.\n\nCIE Automotive has vested the control and oversight duties in the Audit and Compliance Committee, as it has the autonomy and independence in terms of control powers and the ability to act required under the control framework.\n\nThe Compliance Department is responsible for continuously reviewing and updating the internal control system and ensuring compliance with internal and external regulations and the policies and procedures in place for mitigating the main corruption and fraud risks. It is also in charge of the Model and establishment, development and updating CIE Automotive's ethics framework.\n\nAll of CIE Automotive factories use an IT tool to guarantee performance of the required internal controls. That tool is the SAP GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) suite, which permits the automated and manual analysis of the level of performance of the controls conducted at the factory level and tracks incidents\n\nand any resulting action plans, enabling traceability, as outlined in greater detail in the Internal Control Systems section.\n\nNew internal controls were launched in 2023 to mitigate some of the main criminal risks identified in the regions with a tailored risk map and training was undertaken in the following areas:\n\n• Corporate liability and anti-corruption, launched between the end of 2020 and 2021, provided to 600 people in total, including the company's directors, key management personnel, the global management team and the members of the local management committees. Since then, all newcomers to those groups have also been receiving the corporate liability and anti-corruption training.\n\n• Code of Professional Conduct, provided to over 6,000 people online in 2021 and to the rest of CIE Automotive's people worldwide in the form of brochures and a final assessment.\n\n• ESG training, provided to over 6,500 people online in 2023 and to the rest of CIE Automotive's people worldwide in the form of brochures\n\n- \n- \n- and a final assessment.\n\nIt is important to note that each time the Model is introduced into a new country, specific criminal risk training is provided to all of the people it applies to. That refresher training involves a reminder of the company's in-house policies, manuals, procedures and controls and provides an update on applicable local legislation and related\n\ndevelopments.\n\nDISCRIMINATION\n\nDAMAGE TO NATURAL RESOURCES\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY BREACHES\n\n### **Action plan**\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/221/Picture/31 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

In all, the Compliance Department supervises over 250 controls, applied at the individual factory, business division and corporate office levels, under the scope of its internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) and internal control over non-financial reporting (ICNFR) systems. The ICNFR system includes controls over ESG, criminal, compliance, IT and data protection risks.\n\nImage /page/224/Figure/3 description: This image shows a diagram of the lines of defense in a company. The diagram is divided into four sections: the first line of defense, the second line of defense, the third line of defense, and external audit. The first line of defense is operational management. The second line of defense is governance and operational. Governance includes ethical framework, statutory compliance, and criminal liability. Operational includes risk management, internal control (ICFR\\* & NFRS\\*\\*), operational corporate crime, ESG, and GDPR\\*\\*\\*. The third line of defense is internal audit. The external audit is external audit. The diagram also includes text that describes the responsibilities of each line of defense. The first line of defense must assess, control, and mitigate risks and implement effective internal controls. The second line of defense facilitates and supervises the Operational Management Unit's implementation of effective internal control and risk management. The third line of defense proves the effectiveness of internal control and risk management mechanisms to government agencies, including how the 1st and 2nd line defenses work. The diagram also includes the text \"BOARD OF DIRECTORS / AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE / ESG COMMITTEE\" and \"SENIOR MANAGEMENT\" at the top. On the left side of the image are the following items: Chairman and CEO's statement, 2023 highlights, Ready for change, Record earnings, Common responsibility, shared benefits, Our response to the environmental challenge, Responsible management, and About this report.

With process mining, aided by artificial intelligence, it is possible to quickly visualise, identify and quantify bottlenecks and inefficiencies across the business, so delivering the following benefits, among others:\n\n- Increased efficiency by removing bottlenecks, improving cycle times and streamlining processes.\n- Cost reduction associated with duplicity, rework and manual processes.\n- Improved compliance by detecting non-compliant processes or possible cases fraud.\n- ¡Continuous business optimisation by improving processes and monitoring them in real-time.\n\nIn 2023, with the aim of making the company's internal control system more efficient, CIE Automotive embarked on a process mining project with Celonis (the tool provider) and the consultancy, Deloitte.\n\nThe goal of this project is to establish use cases that, by interconnecting all of the company's ERPs around the world, help generate value in the company's business processes by detecting inefficiencies and optimising processes. In short, the idea is to improve processes by detecting bottlenecks, identifying the best routes to achieving a given objective, as well as flagging any potential cases of fraud. . This translates into the establishment of numerical indicators and scorecards that make it easier for the business and corporate managers to understand and monitor the data.\n\nIn 2023 the company managed to implement process mining in the production SAP environments in Europe and at Datasul in Brazil and the tool is\n\nunder development in the S/4 HANA environment of the roof systems division (with global reach) and the SAP environments in Mexico, India and in other environments in Europe.\n\nImage /page/225/Figure/18 description: The image shows a gray rectangle with two check marks at the top and four circles in a vertical line below them.

The companies are listed on the left side of the image, and the scores are displayed on the right side of the image. The bar graphs are color-coded, with green representing high scores and red representing low scores. The companies listed are CDP, Ecovadis, Moody's, MSCI, Sustainalytics, FTSE Russell, ISS-Corporate, Glass Lewis, Clarity AI, and Bloomberg. The scores for each company are as follows: CDP (Solicited. Clients' request), Ecovadis (68, Solicited. Clients' request), Moody's (95, Solicited. Linked to financial facilities), MSCI (82, Unsolicited), Sustainalytics (47, Unsolicited), FTSE Russell (94, Unsolicited), ISS-Corporate (97, Unsolicited), Glass Lewis (n.a, Unsolicited), Clarity AI (n.a, Unsolicited), and Bloomberg (65, Unsolicited), (70, Unsolicited).\n\nIn 2023 the company made fresh progress on a number of its ESG targets, while delivering the 79 specific KPIs set down in its 2025 Strategic Plan.\n\n- **New SDG 7:** CIE Automotive added SDG 7 \"Affordable and clean energy\" to its contributions to the 2030 Agenda in 2023. This commitment has translated into investments in clean energy, the implementation of technology to reduce energy consumption across its facilities and a constant search for energy efficiencies.\n- **ESG training at the global level.** To get everyone at CIE Automotive to see and understand the importance of its ESG goals, the company has an online platform that explains its strategic approach and provides ESG training to its employees (to more than 6,500 online and to everyone worldwide via printed brochures).\n- **New Whistleblowing channel:** In 2023 CIE Automotive rolled out a new online platform to make it easier for its employees and other stakeholders to confidentially report inappropriate or criminal conduct, so complying with Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law and its transposition into law in the various European jurisdictions where the Company operates on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law.\n- **Expansion of the international criminal risk map.** In 2023 the company took new steps in building a truly global criminal risk map by adding three new markets: Italy, Romania and Slovakia. The analysis has also been completed in Portugal where the map will be implemented in the first quarter of 2024.\n- **Expansion of the Supply Chain Race 2 Zero project:** This is the company's effort to help its suppliers decarbonise by supporting and monitoring suppliers who are having difficulties reducing their emissions.\n- **Update of the materiality matrix:** The matrix was updated in 2023 thanks to the feedback gleaned from over 1,500 employee surveys and information collected from customers, analysts and investors.\n\n| SECTOR<br>POSITIONING<br>ON ESG<br>(PERCENTILE) | ESG<br>ADVISORS   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                 |                   |\n|                                                 | PROXY<br>ADVISORS |\n|                                                 | ESG<br>DATASET    |\n\n### ESG achievements in 2023 Chairman [statement](#page-2-0)\n\n#### **Sector outperformance on ESG scores**\n\nCIE Automotive's ESG performance is tangible in the scores awarded by a number of independent sustainability agencies. Most of these scores, except for those associated with financing operations, have not been solicited by the company. These specialists rate CIE Automotive on aspects related with its environmental impact, social practices and governance structure.\n\nCIE Automotive's scores are strong and reflect outperformance relative to most of its sector peers. The results confirm the effectiveness of the measures taken in recent years to address crucial ESG matters.\n\nNote that CIE Automotive climbed a whole notch on the CDP's ESG ratings, from C to B, on the basis of the data for 2023, implying an increase in score of over 30 points, from 34 to 68.\n\nand CEO's\n\n**2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) 1**\n\n**Ready [for change](#page-15-0) 2**\n\n**Record [earnings](#page-53-0) 3**\n\n**Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n**Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/228/Picture/24 description: The image shows the CIE Automotive logo.

The Chinese joint venture, SAMAP, is excluded from the scope as it is accounted for using the equity method.\n\nHowever, in order to confirm that, despite being an equity-accounted investee, the ESG risks to which the group is exposed through its joint venture in China are not material for CIE Automotive, a self-assessment was conducted on the basis of the contents of Spanish Law 11/2018 on non-financial and diversity reporting. That assessment revealed the existence of a working methodology at the joint venture around ESG matters, with specific targets and indicators, that is aligned with CIE Automotive's methodology.\n\nThe non-financial disclosures were prepared in keeping with Spanish Law 11/2018 and the non-binding guidelines on nonfinancial reporting issued by the European Commission on 5 July 2017 (EU Guidelines 2017/C 215/01) and the GRI Standards.\n\nThe non-financial statement, which is part of this Annual Report, was assured KPMG Auditores, S.L., which also audited the group's annual financial statements. The Audit and Compliance Committee is tasked with ensuring that firm's independence.\n\nThe non-financial information, which is part of the NFS, included in this report was compiled with the input and oversight of the heads of all of the various departments and areas:\n\n- The Compliance Department is ultimately responsible for its preparation and coordination, albeit ably assisted by the Cross-Group ESG Committee.\n- The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for approving its issue, along with the management report. The Board of Directors is kept regularly abreast of the most significant environmental, social and governance matters by the ESG Committee.\n\nTo round out the information about the group's activities throughout the year, a number of other statutory reports are available for download on the corporate website: separate and consolidated annual financial statements and management report, Annual Corporate Governance Report and Annual Report on Board Remuneration, along with all of the presentations published about different aspects of the group or in the specific website tabs devoted to specific stakeholder groups.\n\nThe scope of the social and environmental impact information included in this Report is the same as the financial scope considered in CIE Automotive, S.A.'s consolidated financial statements, in addition to the forged parts business in Germany (carried on by Schöneweiss & Co. GmbH, Gesekschmiede Schneider GmbH, Falkenroth Umformtechnik GmbH and Jeco Jellinghaus GmbH ), assets classified as held for sale in 2023 that were part of the group until July 2023.\n\nTherefore, **all of the tables containing non-financial information throughout the report (except those providing year-end data) include the data for the discontinued German forging operations until 30 June 2023.**\n\n**For a better understanding of the information, the \"Data tables\" section discloses the information for the discontinued German operations separately.**\n\nf\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) 1 2 3 4**\n\n**Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge 5**\n\n> About [this report](#page-229-0)\n\n#### **Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 6**\n\nImage /page/230/Picture/0 description: The image shows the words \"ANNUAL REPORT\" on the left side of the image.

In 2023, the company updated its materiality assessment so as to identify the matters of greatest importance for the company and its stakeholders. During that process it consulted internal and external sources and considered a time horizon aligned with the current 2025 ESG Plan.\n\nTo update the assessment, the group analysed internally the topics considered material for CIE Automotive, sector and customer sustainability trends and commitments, regulatory developments and the demands of analysts, investors and other stakeholders.\n\nReview of sustainability trends and\n\n#### **ANALYST AND INVESTOR DEMANDS**\n\nReview of the information requested by analysts and investors\n\nImage /page/231/Figure/8 description: The image shows a diagram with a central circle containing the letters \"C\" and \"E\".

To the right of the words is a large number \"23\" with a quotation mark above the number 2.\n\n23 / About this report\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/233/Figure/8 description: The image is a scatter plot that maps different factors based on their importance and management level. The x-axis represents \"MANAGEMENT\" and ranges from 2.7 to 3.4, while the y-axis represents \"IMPORTANCE\" and ranges from 2.0 to 4.0. The plot contains 23 numbered data points, each representing a different factor. These factors are:\n1. Responsible supply chain management\n2. Expert talent management\n3. Customer satisfaction\n4. New forms of mobility\n5. Geopolitics\n6. Innovation to drive efficiency\n7. Risk management\n8. Strong corporate governance\n9. Circular economy: efficient use of resources and waste management\n10. Respect for human rights\n11. Workplace health and safety\n12. Climate change\n13. Ethics and compliance\n14. Employee wellbeing\n15. Environmental impact\n16. Equality, diversity and inclusion\n17. Privacy and data protection\n18. Community relations\n19. Product quality and safety\n20. Growth and responsible investment\n21. Stakeholder engagement\n22. Reputation\n23. Transparency\n\nThe data points are color-coded based on their area: environmental (green), governance (red), and social (blue). The positions of the points on the plot indicate their relative importance and management level. For example, point 3 (Customer satisfaction) is located at the top-right corner, indicating high importance and high management, while point 22 (Reputation) is located at the bottom-left corner, indicating low importance and low management.\n\n#### The importance ascribed to each **MATERIALITY MATRIX** material topic, coupled with the perception of how well each one is being managed, yielded the following materiality matrix, which in turn formed the basis of the 2025 Strategic Plan and the contents of this Annual Report.\n\nAll ESG topics that lie above the dividing line are matters whose importance is greater than the level of attention they are currently receiving and therefore constitute the ESG matters the company needs to focus on. The greater the distance between the ESG topic in question and the dividing line, the more the company needs to prioritise it.\n\n*Explanatory note of the matrix: in the questionnaires for updating the materiality analysis, the minimum scale score is 1 and the maximum is 4. Given the results atomized between scores 2 and 3, without extremes, the resulting matrix is shown on their axes starting from a value of 2.7, which means that all issues have been valued on that scale from 1 to 4, above 2.7*\n\nChairman and CEO's [statement](#page-2-0) **2023 [highlights](#page-5-0) Ready [for change](#page-15-0) Record [earnings](#page-53-0) Common responsibility, [shared benefits](#page-64-0) Our response to [the environmental](#page-141-0)  challenge Responsible [management](#page-183-0) 1 2 3 4 5 6**\n\n#### *About [this report](#page-229-0)*\n\n[Data tables](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/233/Picture/11 description: The image shows the logo for CIE Automotive.

The report is titled \"Independent Assurance Report on the Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement of CIE Automotive, S.A. and subsidiaries for 2023\". The report is from KPMG Auditores, S.L., and the address is Paseo de la Castellana, 259 C, 28046 Madrid. The report includes a statement from the Chairman and CEO, and highlights from 2023. The highlights include being ready for change, record earnings, common responsibility and shared benefits, a response to the environmental challenge, and responsible management. The report also includes a section about the report itself.\n\n- Meetings with the Group's personnel to gain an understanding of the business model, policies and management approaches applied, the principal risks related to these matters and to obtain the information necessary for the external review.\n- Analysis of the scope, relevance and completeness of the content of the NFIS for 2023 based on the materiality analysis performed by the Group and described in the \"Materiality\" section of\n- \"About this report\", considering the content required by prevailing mercantile legislation. – Analysis of the processes for compiling and validating the data presented in the NFIS for 2023.\n\n#### 3 (Translation from the original in Spanish.

Consequently, no comparative information on eligibility has been included in the accompanying Report in relation to the other environmental objectives listed above or to the new activities included in the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. \nFurthermore, as much as the information on 2022 was not required to be as detailed as in 2023, the disclosures included in the accompanying Report are not strictly comparable. Additionally, the \nDirectors of CIE Automotive, S.A. have included information on the criteria that, in their opinion, \nallow them to comply better with the aforementioned obligations, and which are defined in the \"Compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 regarding climate-related taxonomy\" section of the accompanying Report.
