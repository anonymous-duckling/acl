Our goal for this publication is to provide equal treatment for financial and non-financial information, including the corporate gover nance report.\n\n### **Reporting in accordance with the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act**\n\nEU Directive 2014/95/EU on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity-related information (NFI Guideline) was implemented in Austria through the Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (\"Nachhaltigkeits- und Diversitätsverbesserungsgesetz\"). In order to meet the related requirements, we selected the option to prepare a separate non-financial report for the 2022/23 consolidated financial statements and integrate this information in our full report. The disclosures required by the Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act on environmental, social and employee issues, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption are therefore presented under the section \"Non-financial report\" and listed separately in the table of contents for easier orientation.\n\n### **EU Taxonomy Regulation**\n\nTo fulfil the requirements of Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852), the \"Non-financial report\" also includes our reporting on the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n- For information on the reporting according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, see page 41ff\n### **Applied standards and guidelines**\n\nThis full report meets the high standards of the UN Global Compact and presents our progress in the related areas. The following corporate departments were responsible for the collection and calculation of data in accordance with national and international standards and with the guidelines for financial and sustainability reporting: accounting, controlling and human resources management as well as the staff department for innovation, sustainability and environmental protection. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with § 245a of the Austrian Commercial Code based on the requirements of the IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) which required mandatory application as of the balance sheet date and had been adopted by the European Union.\n\nNon-financial reporting for the 2022/23 financial year is based on the applicable standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \"in accordance with the GRI standards 2021\". The reported GRI indicators are summarised in the GRI content index to provide an overview of the subject matter.\n\n- For information on the GRI content index, see page 298ff\n### **Reporting principles and structure**\n\nAt EVN, we attach great importance to giving equal treatment to the interests and concerns of our various stakeholders. The selection of the non-financial reporting content is based on its relevance for sustainability and our goal to achieve a balanced and complete presentation of the most important current issues in line with the following principles:\n\n- **• Involvement of stakeholders:**  The reporting content is based on legal requirements and the information needs of our stakeholders, which were last identified through a stake-\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nholder survey in 2021. This structured survey process takes place every three years.\n\n- **• Materiality:** EVN's most important activity and subject areas are defined by the EVN materiality matrix based on the results of the stakeholder survey and are reflected in the structure for this full report. The classification by area of activity is intended to give equal treatment to the diverse and varied information needs of EVN's target groups. In agreement with the GRI reporting standards, information of low importance is not provided in order to maximise relevance and transparency by concentrating on the most significant issues.\n- **• Completeness:** This reporting meets applicable legal requirements as well as the applied GRI standards.\n- For information on EVN's materiality matrix, see page 17\n\n### **External verification**\n\nBDO Assurance GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft was responsible for an audit with limited assurance of the consolidated non-financial report for the 2022/23 financial year in agreement with the\n\nrequirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act and § 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code, the GRI standards 2021 and Article 8 and 9 letters a and b of the EU Taxonomy Directive (2020/852) in connection with Article 10 para. 4 of the Delegated Act of the European Commission (2021/2178) in connection with Article 1 of the Delegated Act of the European Commission (2023/2486).\n\n- The auditors' report can be found on page 292ff\n- For the independent assurance report on the consolidated non-financial report, see page 147ff\n\n### **Additional information**\n\nWe prepared this full report and verified the data with the greatest possible diligence. Nevertheless, rounding, typesetting and/or printing errors cannot be excluded. The use of automatic data processing equipment can lead to rounding differences in the addition of rounded amounts and percentage rates. This full report also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and assumptions which are based on the information available to us up to the editorial deadline. Such statements are typically connected with terms such as \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\" etc. We would like to point out that actual circumstances – and, in\n\nturn, the company's performance and results – may differ from the expectations and forward-looking statements contained in this report for a variety of reasons.\n\nWe use the following signs in this report:\n\n- Reference to additional information in this full report\n- Reference to content on the internet\n- Reference to GRI standards\n\nEVN is committed to equal treatment in references to all genders in its internal and external publications, i. e. also in this full report.\n\nThis full report is available in German and English. In case of doubt, the German version takes precedence.\n\nThe editorial deadline for this report was 21 November 2023.\n\n- For information on the Global Reporting Initiative, see [www.globalreporting.org](https://www.globalreporting.org/)\n- For information on the UN Global Compact, see [www.unglobalcompact.org](https://unglobalcompact.org/)\n- GRI indicators: GRI 1, GRI 3-1\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Our EVN – the company for energy, water and environmental services**\n\nEVN's headquarters are located in Lower Austria, further core markets are Bulgaria and North Macedonia. In total, EVN is currently active in 14 countries.\n\n**Business areas**\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/3 description: The image shows a green circular diagram representing renewable energy and climate change. The diagram includes symbols for solar panels, wind turbines, a thermometer, and power lines. These symbols are connected in a circular fashion, suggesting a closed-loop system. The overall design conveys the concept of sustainable energy and its role in addressing climate change.\n\n### **Energy business Environmental**\n\nOur integrated business model covers the entire value chain:\n\n- Energy generation\n- Operation of distribution networks\n- Supply of electricity, natural gas and heat to end customers (with different focal points in our individual markets)\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/9 description: The image shows a green line drawing of a circle with three teardrop shapes attached to the bottom and right side of the circle. Each teardrop shape has a smaller loop inside of it. The drawing is simple and minimalist. The background is white.\n\n### **services business**\n\nThe environmental services business covers the following activities:\n\n- Drinking water supplies in Lower Austria\n- In September 2023, a structured bidder process was initiated for the international project business which comprises the planning, construction, financing and operation of plants for drinking water supplies, wastewater disposal as well as thermal waste and sludge utilisation\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/14 description: The image shows a green circle with three puzzle pieces attached to it. The puzzle pieces are also green and are evenly spaced around the circle. The puzzle pieces appear to be connected to the circle by a thin, green line. The image is simple and has a clean design.\n\n### **Investments**\n\nInvestments in areas related to the core business supplement and hedge our value chain:\n\n- Verbund AG (12.63%)\n- Burgenland Holding (73.63%), which, in turn, holds 49.0% of Burgenland Energie • RAG (50.03%)\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n• Continued from page 17\n\nstrategy (which is also the responsibility of the Executive Board). Moreover, the Executive Board exchanges information on the sustainability strategy with the Supervisory Board on a regular basis and reports quarterly on the principal developments and measures involving ESG.\n\nThe staff department for innovation, sustainability and environmental protection, which reports directly to the Executive Board, is responsible for coordinating sustainability activities and for environmental and climate protection. Management conferences, in particular the biannual all-day innovation conferences, provide a platform for the department to report on the innovation and research projects under its direction. The primary objective of these projects is to make a positive contribution to environmental and climate protection and to customer benefits.\n\nThe innovation, sustainability and environmental protection department also coordinates an intradepartmental sustainability team which ensures compliance with our high sustainability standards and the operational development and implementation of new ESG aspects in our Group. The aspects of climate change that are relevant for our business activities also have high priority for this team.\n\nIn view of the high relevance of ESG issues and to further strengthen sustainability expertise, a sustainability expert was appointed to the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee in 2022/23.\n\nOur sustainability steering committee, which also meets four times each year, includes the members of the Executive Board, key managers from various areas of the company, the managing directors of the most important Austrian and international subsidiaries and the members of the intradepartmental sustainability team. This committee deals with current ESG issues, approves major ESG activities and, based on its broad composition, ensures that the strategies, measures and goals defined in these meetings are rolled out and implemented in operating activities throughout the EVN Group.\n\n### **Valuable external inputs**\n\nIn addition to the regular exchange of information with internal experts, our Executive Board and Supervisory Board are supported by various advisory boards. These panels include external experts from different disciplines who contribute their expertise and outside perspectives on the ESG aspects of our activities.\n\n- For the Sustainability Advisory Board, see page 115f\n- For the EVN Social Fund, see page 135\n- For the Sustainability Advisory Board, see [www.evn.at/sustainability-advisory-board](https://www.evn.at/home/investor-relations/corporate-governance/organe/nachhaltigkeitsbeirat)\n- For the EVN Social Fund, see [www.evn.at/social-fund](https://www.evn.at/home/nachhaltigkeit/unsere-werte-und-nachhaltigkeitsmanagement/evn-nachhaltigkeitsorganisation/stakeholder-dialog/sozialfonds)\n- For the EVN Art Advisory Board, see [www.evn-sammlung.at](https://www.evn-sammlung.at/) (German only)\n- GRI indicators: GRI 2-9, GRI 2-12, GRI 2-13, GRI 2-16, GRI 2-17, GRI 2-24\n\nImage /page/19/Figure/16 description: The image shows a diagram of advisory boards. The first level is the steering committee for sustainability, which coordinates with the executive board and managerial employees, close coordination with the supervisory board, and target-oriented coordination of ESG activities. The second level is the sustainability team, which coordinates by staff department for innovation, sustainability, and environmental protection, and ensures compliance with ESG standards within the Group. The third level is sustainability experts of the individual areas of the company, which implement sustainability activities in the individual areas of the company.\n\n### **EVN sustainability organisation**\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Impact of our business activities**\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act and the EU Taxonomy Directive, our annual risk inventory covers potential risks and the related effects of EVN's business activities and business relations on environmental, social and employee-related issues, the observance of human rights and the fight against corruption. It also includes an assessment of the resulting financial impact on the EVN Group.\n\nThis gives us a clearly structured and defined process to identify and analyse potential risks and their effects on various organisational and hierarchical levels and, in turn, develop suitable countermeasures. We ensure the involvement of the management and Executive Board levels by presenting and discussing the results and findings of the risk inventory in the risk working group and the Group Risk Committee.\n\nThe following table summarises the most important potential effects. It also includes examples of the instruments and measures used or taken – in agreement with the EVN Code of\n\nConduct and our overriding behavioural standards for compliance – to minimise any negative effects.\n\n### **Focus on sustainability and, above all, on climate risks**\n\nWe analyse climate risks based on climate scenarios in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Directive. As part of our risk inventory, we identify potential climate risks and the impact of our business activities on climate change. Climate risk is, however, intentionally not defined as a separate risk category but – where appropriate – assigned to the individual risk categories as an interdisciplinary issue. We differentiate between transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks represent the uncertainties resulting from the transformation towards a renewable energy system. Physical risks involve events and changes that are triggered directly by the climate.\n\nWe identify climate-related fluctuations in our earnings through our risk management and evaluate the potential\n\n**EVN Full Report 2022/23 21**\n\n**Non-financial report**\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nquantitative effects with sensitivity and scenario analyses as part of our planning process. Comparable issues also influence the selection of the scenarios for the future development of energy and primary energy prices. This information forms the basis for discussions on climate change and its impact on our business activities at the management, Executive Board and Supervisory Board levels.\n\nDamages caused by extreme weather events represent a threat to supply security. In a broader sustainability context, the risks in this area also include supply interruptions or physical dangers caused by explosions or accidents. In order to guarantee troublefree operations and the technical security of our power plants – both of which are essential to protect reliable supplies – we conduct regular inspections and maintenance work that also involves scheduled downtime. We measure and monitor actual interruptions in network electricity supplies with the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) – which shows\n\nthe mean supply interruption – and the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) – which shows the average annualised duration of unplanned power interruptions.\n\nOccupational safety and accident prevention are also prominent issues in all our business units. We guarantee the required high level of safety, above all, through training and by raising employees' awareness. In addition to legal requirements, we have developed an extensive set of internal rules, directives and guidelines. All work accidents in the EVN Group are recorded and analysed centrally by the occupational safety department. As shown in the following table under the area of activity \"sustainable increase in corporate value\", employee-related risks also cover the loss of highly qualified staff. We address this risk, among others, through the creation of an attractive work environment and flexible working time models. The risk analysis also includes the intended or unintended misrepresentation of transactions or positions in the annual financial statements, which we work to prevent with our internal control system (ICS).\n\nThe staff department for innovation, sustainability and environmental protection is responsible for the identification and analysis of the ecological impact of our business activities with regard to the use of resources, energy and water consumption, emissions, biodiversity and transport as well as wastewater and waste disposal (environmental risks). Based on its analyses, this department supports the operating units in preventing or minimising their impact on the environment.\n\n- For information on the Group-wide risk management process, which includes the identification of sustainability risks, see page 177ff\n- For information on SAIFI and SAIDI, see page 72\n- For information on occupational safety, accident prevention and compliance, see pages 103ff and 28ff\n- For information on the ecological impact of EVN's activities, see page 112ff\n- GRI indicators: GRI 2-22, GRI 2-23, GRI 2-24\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Overview of the major potential effects of our business activities (selected items)**\n\ndebt investors – Compliance violations + Stable development of dividends + Improvement of the infrastructure in countries/regions where projects are in progress or were carried out\n\n+ Job security\n\ncooperation\n\neconomic crises + Fair and transparent tenders\n\n**Impact assessment (excerpt) \"–\" = negative; \"+\" = positive**\n\n– Risk of a loss in value for equity and\n\n+ Regional added value through\n\n+ Solid capital base eases effects of\n\n### **EVN area of activity and definition**\n\n### **Sustainable increase in corporate value**\n\n… stands for entrepreneurial actions which, in connection with strategic decisions, are intended to maintain a balance between value-oriented investments and an attractive return for our shareholders.

The course content and methods are adapted to meet regional requirements in order to optimally reach the target groups.\n\nThe modules in this intensive learning path have a high degree of interaction and practical orientation. The in-house training, webinars and e-learning modules combine self-study units with knowledge checks and the opportunity for collaborative work on case studies. The compliance update webinar and refresher courses include case studies that are tailored to the employees' individual area of responsibility. That makes it possible to train for the specific challenges involved in the correct application of the EVN Code of Conduct, for example in connection\n\nwith the prevention of corruption. We offer special coaching for persons in areas exposed to increased risk, e.g. employees in highly competitive business fields or the international project business and employees with direct contacts to public authorities. Members of the Supervisory Board have also received additional comprehensive training from external experts.\n\nIn addition to this extensive training programme, CCM also relies on alternative communication channels (e.g. the Intranet or EVN's employee newsletter) and on know-how transfer from managers who are closely integrated in the strengthening and further development of our ethical principles as well as our compliance principles and rules. The content developed with these managers in multi-hour workshops is then regularly transferred to their staffs. In this way, the CMS is also supported by management.\n\n### **Human rights and minimum social protection**\n\nA central subject area in our Code of Conduct has always been the unlimited and unequivocal commitment to the respect, observance and protection of human rights and ethical principles in the interaction with our employees at all our locations and in all our business relations. The rejection of child labour and forced labour is an integral part of this subject area as are the prohibition of discrimination based on gender, age, ethnic origin, skin colour, sexual orientation, religion, ideology or any impairment. Other elements are the protection of co-determination rights, occupational safety measures and human rights issues along the supply chain (especially on international projects).\n\nThe framework for the observance of human rights and minimum social protection is created by internal policies which, in turn, are based on the relevant laws and international directives – above all on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and the guidelines issued by the OECD, the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation. As an international corporation, we are also active in countries with a different history and understanding of human rights issues. Although the respective governments are primarily responsible for protecting human rights, we consider it our responsibility to ensure the observance of human rights and – within our possibilities – to encourage compliance in this area outside our direct scope of operation.\n\nHuman rights and minimum social protection issues are dealt with as interdisciplinary subjects in the EVN Group and are the responsibility of different organisational units (in particular human resources, occupational safety, procurement and purchasing as well as the staff department for corporate compliance management). In 2021/22, we reviewed and improved our internal processes and guidelines\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/11 description: The image contains the text \"Participation in mandatory compliance training\".

In North Macedonia, there are 41 executive board and managers and 1,736 employees. In International project business, there are 68 executive board and managers and 455 employees.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n### FAIR TAX POLICY\n\nBased on the particularly high ethical standards defined by the EVN Code of Conduct, we have prepared a binding tax strategy for the EVN Group. We consider it an obligation towards business, the environment and society to make a fair contribution to tax revenue in all countries where we conduct business operations. This commitment – together with the observance of all relevant national and international tax laws and legal requirements – forms the basis for the following premises of the EVN Group's tax strategy:\n\n- High compliance standards with regard to taxation, in particular the legally compliant, timely and complete fulfilment reporting, clarification, submission and payment requirements\n- The exclusion of risks under financial criminal law, especially the risks arising from tax evasion or reduction\n- Fair, constructive, cooperative and transparent dialogue with the fiscal authorities\n- Proactive tax controls based on the evaluation of tax-relevant risks and tax risks\n\nthrough the identification, analysis and assessment of these risks (documentation via risk control matrix)\n\n- The avoidance of aggressive tax planning, in particular no use of artificial structures whose main purpose is tax reduction\n- GRI indicators: GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2, GRI 207-3\n\non human rights and minimum social protection – also with a view towards first-time reporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. In this way, we can ensure full compliance with all management approaches and organisational rules that have been developped for these subject areas. The organisational units which are particularly involved with human rights aspects were part of an intense dialogue on human rights issues during the past two financial years, which was also accompanied by external experts. The Executive Board and management were regularly informed of progress and newly implemented measures.\n\nIn addition, EVN prepared a human rights policy in 2022, which was approved by the Executive Board. A human rights officer was also appointed and installed in the corporate compliance management department. Further development measures are scheduled to start in 2023/24, which will begin with awareness measures and mandatory training. They are intended to create a deeper Group-wide understanding for the various aspects of human rights.\n\nAn impact assessment on human rights will also be carried out to identify potential risks and their effects, to assess these risks and to develop further measures where necessary.\n\nRisks related to non-compliance with human rights are identified and assessed throughout the Group as part of the annual risk inventory.\n\n- Additional principles to protect the human rights of our employees (especially non-discrimination, co-determination rights and occupational safety) are described on page 93ff\n- For information on EVN's human rights policy, see [www.evn.at/human-rights-policy](https://www.evn.at/en/home/investor-relations/corporate-governance)\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *Secure and sustainable supplies*\n\nOur entire procurement process is directed to maintaining high standards for economy, quality, sustainability and supply security.\n\n**EVN Full Report 2022/23**\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Energy procurement**\n\nWe cover the electricity supplies for our Austrian customers – via EnergieAllianz – through medium-term supply contracts and through purchases over the wholesale market. These supplies are purchased directly over the electricity exchange, through bilateral transactions with various trading partners or over-the-counter (OTC) platforms – and include the production from our own power plants. We also purchase green energy, which is allocated in accordance with the Green Electricity Act based on our share of electricity sales in the respective control area. In addition, we take over the surplus electricity produced by our customers' own generation equipment (especially photovoltaic equipment).\n\nFor information on electricity labelling, see page 84\n\nOur electricity supply subsidiaries in Bulgaria and North Macedonia are required by law to purchase the electricity for sale to customers in the regulated market segments from the state-owned producers, i. e. NEK and ESM respectively. The remainder of the electricity required for customers in previously liberalised segments is purchased over wholesale markets.\n\nLong-term supply contracts cover a large part of our natural gas purchases. The remaining volumes are purchased on wholesale markets over national and international OTC trading centres and exchanges, for example in Austria (CEGH) or Germany (NCG). Natural gas imports follow the international flows of pipeline and liquid gas volumes.\n\n### **Procurement of products and services**\n\nEVN's business activities as a whole and, above all, the investment focal points on network infrastructure, renewable generation and drinking water supplies require intensive cooperation with construction firms, plant, pipeline and cable line construction companies as well as suppliers of electrotechnical equipment and components, pipes, transmission and cable lines, meters, hardware, software and work clothing. WTE serves as a general contractor and commissions subcontractors, in particular construction firms and suppliers of machinery, electro-technical equipment and components, to perform additional services.\n\nThe procurement volume at our main locations in Austria, Bulgaria and North Macedonia totalled EUR 1,337.6m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 762.4m). In Austria, EVN maintained direct supplier relationships with 841 suppliers and contractors during this financial year.\n\nGRI indicator: GRI 2-6\n\n### **Organisation of procurement activities**\n\nResponsibilities for the procurement of products and services in the EVN Group are based on the relevant activity. All EVN purchase orders with a volume of EUR 10,000 or more are handled over a web-based procurement portal. The entire procurement process – from EU-wide announcement to the tender, submission of offers and contract award – is processed online. The broad-based roll-out of e-procurement over this new platform has not only increased transparency but also paved the way for the introduction of strategic procurement.\n\nGRI indicator: GRI 204-1\n\n### **Strategic supplier management at EVN**\n\n\"We are creating a systematic, standardised and sustainable procedure for the analysis and evaluation of current and potential suppliers. Its objective is to improve our performance with regard to economy, quality, sustainability and supply security along the entire procurement chain.\" This statement marked the beginning of an extensive project on strategic supplier management that was successfully concluded in March 2023. Strategic supplier management was rolled out across the Group in May 2023.\n\n### **Supply security and sustainability**\n\nThe primary objective of this new procurement strategy is to ensure the exact analysis and management of all procurement flows to improve performance – from an economic as well as a sustainability viewpoint. EVN wants to meet the high demands placed by ESG not only on its own business activities but also on its suppliers in their role as partners. At the same time, supplies of goods and services must always be available in sufficient quality and volumes. They represent the requirements for EVN's operations and the continuous expansion of its equipment and networks as well as key factors for meeting the Group's service mission. Supply security and sustainability are among the most important motives behind the new strategic supplier management.\n\nThe need to fundamentally analyse – and where necessary, refocus – procurement management was reinforced by the economic distortions and international supply chain interruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which were intensified by the war in Ukraine. Added factors were the increasingly new and further expected regulations from supranational and\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nnational lawmakers, additional reporting requirements like the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the CSRD, and the growing demands of sustainability-oriented investors.\n\n### **Ongoing development**\n\nThis strategy represents the continuation of a development that began a long time ago. In addition to conventional purchasing criteria – price, quality, volume, market environment and legal requirements – sustainability aspects have always been part of the Group's procurement processes. These involved the assessment of the ordered products as well as the selection of suppliers who were explicitly required to comply with environmentally compatible, ethical and social standards. The specific requirements are stated in the EVN Integrity Clause, which represents a fixed part of every procurement contract.\n\nThese two focal points – the analysis and evaluation of products, on the one hand, and of suppliers, on the other hand – as well as the connection of the resulting information are now available in an even more structured and detailed form following the conclusion of the strategic supplier management (SLM) project.\n\n### **Analysis and impact assessment for all products and services**\n\nAll products and services were aggregated into merchandise groups based on the standard European classification system for public procurement (Common Procurement Vocabulary structure) and, among others, evaluated for their sustainability impact and/or potential sustainability risks. This process was followed by the definition of the most important purchasing and decision criteria in close coordination with the involved departments. The same applies to the demands placed on the individual supplier. Each merchandise group was linked to a certificate\n\nwhich is required for consideration as a potential suppliers. As a result, every procurement procedure can be easily refined.\n\n### **Detailed supplier audits based on ESG criteria**\n\nAll suppliers – existing as well as potential – are evaluated in advance and, after that, regularly with a tool created by a well-known international rating provider based on defined ESG criteria. The criteria include greenhouse gas emissions, energy management, land use, biodiversity and waste management as well as community commitment, data protection, employee rights, ethical business practices, shareholders' rights and transparency. Any negative media reports also flow into the evaluation. Compensatory measures are implemented to deal with any identified risks.\n\nThis procedure is supplemented by the extensive self-declarations required from every EVN supplier as part of their on-boarding in the procurement portal, and as part of the ongoing contractual relationship. A special focus on ESG criteria and sustainability measures are an integral part of these self-evaluations.\n\n### **Definition of a precise procurement strategy**\n\nThe result of the detailed assessment of products and suppliers is a matrix that can be used to derive optimal procurement procedures for each merchandise group. A separate tool set gives employees all necessary instruments and templates – from the calculation of lifecycle costs to the definition of technical specifications, contract award criteria and the optimal processes for procurement and due diligence. Detailed training for the procurement staff is currently in progress as part of the transfer of the SLM projects to line responsibility, and follow-up courses are planned.\n\nIn addition to conventional procurement procedures, EVN also draws on innovative models and actively supports suppliers, e.g. in obtaining the necessary certification. \"Green\" tenders, which require compliance with specific sustainability criteria are also becoming more frequent.\n\n### **Full compliance**\n\nIt is an obvious fact that the standards and criteria defined by a tender are explicitly included in all awarded contracts and any violations will be sanctioned. A clear procedure was also defined to deal with any contract violations – from the requirement to remedy defects up to cancellation of the contract if necessary. EVN wants to ensure the fulfilment of all contracts in the mutual interest of the involved parties and develop long-standing cooperative business relationships. In its relations with suppliers, EVN relies on sustainable, responsible partnerships.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/1 description: The image shows a tall, modern building with many windows. The building has a white facade and is surrounded by green grass and trees. The text \"Sustainably\" is visible in the upper right corner of the image, along with some additional text about EVN's business and strategies.\n\n### **Shareholder structure1)**\n\nImage /page/36/Figure/3 description: This image is a pie chart showing the distribution of shares. NÖ Landesbeteiligungsholding GmbH holds the majority of the shares at 51.0%. Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH holds 28.4% of the shares, while 19.7% are free float shares. Treasury shares account for 0.9% of the total.\n\n## **attractive for our investors**\n\nEVN's business activities always reflect the economic interests of our investors. Not least for this reason, we concentrate on regulated and stable business areas. They form the basis not only for plannable cash flows, but also for continuity in our dividend policy. This clear strategic orientation is also crucial for the ratings which establish the conditions for our positioning on the debt market.\n\nOur strategic decisions are intended to balance value-oriented investments and an attractive return for our shareholders. In addition to economic aspects, ecological and social issues are firmly anchored in our core strategies. We are therefore increasingly positioning the EVN share as an alternative for sustainability-oriented investors. This orientation is underscored by our efforts to achieve good evaluations from sustainability rating agencies, with whom we also maintain a proactive dialogue. Our website includes content on environmental, social and governance issues which is edited for specific target groups to provide transparent information for sustainability analysts and investors.\n\n- Information for ESG investors and on ESG [ratings can be found under www.evn.at/](https://www.evn.at/en/home/nachhaltigkeit) sustainability and [www.evn.at/ESG-ratings](https://www.evn.at/en/home/nachhaltigkeit/esg-ratings)\nOur focus on a sustainable increase in EVN's value is also communicated by the core points of our investment story:\n\n- Integrated business model\n- High share of regulated and stable activities\n\n<sup>1)</sup> As at 30 September 2023\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Active role in the transformation of the energy system\n- A clear sustainability and climate strategy\n- Stable home market in Lower Austria\n- Solid capital structure\n- Attractive and reliable dividends\n\nWe attach immense importance to achieving and maintaining a position as a reliable partner on the capital market and meeting the expectations of our equity and debt investors. Our capital market operations are based on a commitment to providing timely, transparent, understandable and substantial information. We work to strengthen the confidence of the capital market in EVN through active, regular and target-group oriented communications with all capital market participants.\n\nAlso see [www.investor.evn.at](https://www.evn.at/en/home/investor-relations)\n\n### **Dividend policy**\n\nThe Executive Board will make a recommendation to the 95th Annual General Meeting which calls for the distribution of an ordinary dividend of EUR 0.52 plus a special dividend of EUR 0.62 per share, in total EUR 1.14 per share, for the 2022/23 financial year.\n\nOur future dividend policy is directed to paying an annual dividend of at least EUR 0.82 per share. We are also committed to appropriate participation for our shareholders in future earnings growth. In the medium term, we aim for a payout-ratio of 40% of Group net result, adjusted for extraordinary effects.\n\n### **External ratings**\n\nIndependent evaluations by the Moody's and Scope rating agencies represent an important part of EVN's financing strategy. Our goal is to maintain ratings in the solid A range. Both agencies confirmed the following ratings in April 2023 and May 2023:\n\n• Moody's: A1, outlook stable • Scope Ratings: A+, outlook stable\n\n### **Market environment and performance**\n\nDespite numerous global challenges and the sharp increase in interest rates triggered by central banks' restrictive monetary policies across the world, the performance of the international stock markets – without exception – was positive during the 2022/23 financial year. The German benchmark index DAX rose by 27% from October 2022 to September 2023, and Vienna's benchmark index ATX gained 18%. The US benchmark index Dow Jones increased by 17% during this same period.\n\nThe DJ Euro Stoxx Utilities, the relevant industry index for EVN, recorded an increase of 13% during the past financial year. The EVN share topped this performance with an increase of 49%.\n\nA steady trading volume of roughly 100,000 shares per day in the last months provides a comfortable margin for the continued inclusion of the EVN share in Vienna's ATX benchmark index.\n\nSchütz Stefan • 11/8/23 18:46\n\nok\n\n|                                            |        | 2022/23              | 2021/22 | 2020/21 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| EVN share                                  |        |                      |         |         |\n| Share price at 30 September                | EUR    | 25.30                | 17.04   | 22.95   |\n| Highest price                              | EUR    | 25.30                | 27.70   | 24.75   |\n| Lowest price                               | EUR    | 15.56                | 16.92   | 13.38   |\n| Price performance                          | %      | 48.47                | -25.8   | 60.7    |\n| Total shareholder return                   | %      | 51.53                | -23.5   | 64.2    |\n| Performance ATX                            | %      | 17.69                | -26.4   | 73.5    |\n| Performance Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Utilities | %      | 12.48                | -10.9   | 1.4     |\n| Value of shares traded1)                   | EURm   | 507.8                | 490.0   | 350.6   |\n| Average daily turnover1)                   | Shares | 99,237               | 84,288  | 72,753  |\n| Market capitalisation at 30 September      | EURm   | 4,551                | 3,065   | 4,128   |\n| Weighting ATX prime                        | %      | 2.50                 | 1.93    | 1.96    |\n| Earnings per share2)                       | EUR    | 2.97                 | 1.18    | 1.83    |\n| Dividend per share                         | EUR    | $0.52 + 0.62^{3)4)}$ | 0.52    | 0.52    |\n| Price/earnings per share                   |        | 8.5                  | 14.5    | 12.6    |\n| Dividend yield                             | %      | 4.5                  | 3.1     | 2.3     |\n\n1) Vienna Stock Exchange, single counting\n\n2) Shares outstanding at 30 September\n\n3) Proposal to the Annual General Meeting\n\n4) Special dividend of EUR 0.62 per share\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CAPITAL MARKETS DAY 2023\n\nOn 5 October 2023, we invited analysts and institutional investors to a Capital Markets Day, which was also transmitted via live webcast. The presentations by Stefan Szyszkowitz, Spokesman of the EVN Executive Board, and five members of senior management from the energy business and supply, renewable generation, networks, innovation and sustainability as well as controlling provided an update on the Strategy 2030. The most important topics were:\n\n- The focal points and growth drivers for EVN's Strategy 2030\n- Energy sector developments and market trends in EVN's core markets\n- Future developments in the energy supply business\n- E-mobility as a new business field\n- Expansion goals for renewable generation capacity (wind power and photovoltaics)\n- The expansion, modernisation and digitalisation of network infrastructure against the backdrop of current European climate policy and the regulatory framework in EVN's core markets\n- Pillars of the EVN Climate Initiative and CO2 reduction targets\n- Planned transition to a 1.5°C goal based on the Paris Climate Agreement\n- Innovative approaches and solutions for the development of new business fields\n- Investment programme and financial ambitions at the segment and Group level up to 2030\n- A video recording and the presentation documents are available under [www.evn.at/cmd.](https://www.evn.at/en/home/investor-relations/veranstaltungen/cmd)\n\nImage /page/38/Picture/14 description: In the image, Andrea Edelmann, the head of innovation, sustainability, and environmental protection, is standing on a stage.

Our most important stakeholder groups – shareholders, society as a whole, the public sector, employees, suppliers and debt investors – also receive a direct financial benefit from our activities.\n\nOn the revenue side, in particular the income generated by our business operations and investments contributes to the creation of value. This value is distributed primarily to our investors and lenders (dividends, interest), to the public sector (taxes, duties) and to society as a whole (donations, sponsoring, social programmes) as well as to our employees (wages, salaries, social security contributions) and suppliers\n\n(primary energy carriers, materials and purchased services). The table below shows the economic value generated by EVN as well as the composition of the distributed economic value. The difference between revenues and the amounts distributed represents economic value retained which is available, among others, for the further development of our company through important future-oriented investments.\n\nGRI indicator: GRI 201-1\n\n| <b>Direct economic value generated</b>         |         |         |         |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                           | 2022/23 | 2021/22 | 2020/21 |\n| Direct economic value generated                | 3,563.8 | 3,904.3 | 2,478.0 |\n| thereof economic value distributed             | 3,206.6 | 3,686.8 | 2,252.0 |\n| thereof economic value retained                | 357.2   | 217.4   | 226.0   |\n| <b>Economic value distributed</b>              |         |         |         |\n| 3,206.6                                        | 3,686.8 | 2,252.0 |         |\n| thereof energy suppliers                       | 1,632.1 | 2,278.2 | 1,064.7 |\n| thereof other suppliers                        | 777.6   | 806.9   | 595.0   |\n| thereof employees                              | 409.9   | 372.2   | 361.3   |\n| thereof providers of capital (equity and debt) | 313.0   | 158.1   | 173.0   |\n| thereof public sector                          | 70.1    | 69.3    | 56.2    |\n| thereof society                                | 3.9     | 2.0     | 1.8     |\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EU Taxonomy Regulation**\n\nTo implement the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and the Council as of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (\"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") on non-financial reporting, the EVN Group already launched a Groupwide project before the 2021/22 financial year which included legal, business and technical experts from the relevant Group companies as well as the responsible corporate functions and staff departments. This also applied analogously to the development of measures to meet the criteria for (social) minimum safeguards in accordance with Art.18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The project was divided into a number of working packages and steps in order to develop a uniform system for the collection and (technical) screening of EVN's economic activities. The Executive Board, management and the managing directors of the relevant Group companies were regularly informed of progress on the project and involved in the process.\n\n### **Identification and evaluation of economic activities**\n\nThe first step involved the identification of the economic activities carried out by the EVN Group. The basis for this identification was formed by the economic activities listed in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of the Commission as of 4 June 2021 concerning the environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaption\" and on Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council as of 20 December 2006 on the installation of the statistical system for economic sectors\n\ndefined by NACE Revision 2 and the amendment of Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of the Council as well as certain other regulations of the EC for specific areas of the economic activities listed in the statistics. For this purpose, technical experts in the subsidiaries carried out screenings based on the above regulations together with the managing directors.\n\nThis process was repeated in 2022/23 – again involving technical experts in the subsidiaries and managing directors – for the environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaption\" and, for the first time – based on the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 on the other four environmental objectives and on Annex 5 – also on the four environmental objectives \"sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\", \"transition to a circular economy\", \"pollution prevention and control\" and \"protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\". Reporting on the four additional environmental objectives is not yet mandatory for EVN's 2022/23 financial year. However, we decided to voluntarily report EVN's taxonomy-eligible and – subsequently taxonomy-aligned – economic activities for these four objectives as well as the key performance indicators (KPIs) for turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) in order to provide our stakeholders – in particular investors, analysts and lenders – with comprehensive information.\n\nFor the first time, an initial assessment for the reporting period was also made on the basis of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 of the Commission as of 9 March 2022 amending the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139\n\non economic activities in certain energy sectors (nuclear energy and fossil gas) and amending the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.\n\n- See page 52ff for the templates on activities involving nuclear energy and fossil gas\nThe focal points of EVN's business activities are the generation of electricity and heat from renewable sources and the operation of distribution networks. Consequently, the economic activities in the EUTaxonomy related to these activities are of paramount importance for EVN with a view towards taxonomy reporting.\n\nThe table on page 42 lists all economic activities to which KPIs were allocated in the 2022/23 financial year. This table also shows the changes versus the previous financial year and the changes resulting from the scope of consolidation (see note **4. Scope of consolidation** in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for 2022/23) as well as the changes resulting from the initial application of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (nuclear energy and fossil gas) and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 on the additional four environmental objectives.\n\n### **Assignment of EVN's economic activities to the segments**\n\nThe following section describes the economic activities by segment which were identified for the 2022/23 financial year together with the material aspects of KPI data collection in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. To facilitate reading, references to the economic activities only include the number of the respective activity. The\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nfull designation of the economic activity can be found in the table on \"Taxonomy-eligible economic activities\".\n\nBased on our evaluation, the Energy Segment carries out taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the areas of heat generation and distribution which can be assigned to the economic activities 4.15., 4.16., 4.20., 4.24., 4.30. and 4.31. according to the different fuels and technologies. The since 2022/23 fully consolidated energy services have also been included here; they cover the taxonomy-eligible economic activities 6.15., 6.16., 7.3., 7.4.,7.5., 7.6., 9.1. and 9.3. The turnover from trading included in this segment – which covers, above all, the marketing of EVN's own electricity generation and natural gas trading – is not included in the economic activities defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The Generation Segment includes electricity production from the renewable energy sources water, wind and solar, which are assigned to the economic activities 4.1., 4.3. and 4.5. This segment also includes heat generation from natural gas at the energy hub in Dürnrohr, which represents economic activity 4.31. Other identified economic activities in connection with heat generation are included in the Energy Segment to prevent double counting.\n\nThe Networks Segment covers the network infrastructure for electricity and for renewable and low-carbon gases in Lower Austria, which represent the economic activities 4.9. and 4.14. Shared equipment that is necessary for the infrastructure operated by Netz Niederösterreich is allocated 75% to the electricity network and 25% to the\n\nnatural gas network. The EU Taxonomy Regulation currently provides no criteria for the economic activities carried out by the Group companies kabelplus (telecommunications) and EVN Geoinfo (geographic information systems).\n\nThe South East Europe Segment covers the network infrastructure for electricity in Bulgaria and North Macedonia and for renewable and low-carbon gases in Croatia. This represents the economic activities 4.9. and 4.14. In contrast to the electricity meters installed in Austria, the meters in Bulgaria and North Macedonia do not meet the technical criteria of the EU Taxonomy Regulation at the present time. This segment also includes electricity and heat generation from natural gas (economic activities 4.30. and 4.31.) as well as heat supplies (economic\n\n| Taxonomy-eligible economic activities |

4.15.) in Bulgaria. Electricity generation from renewable energy sources (solar power and hydropower) in North Macedonia represents economic activities 4.1. and 4.5. The energy trading which is also included in the South East Europe Segment does not represent an economic activity listed in the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe Environment Segment includes drinking water supplies and wastewater disposal in Lower Austria, which are allocated to the economic activities 5.1. and 5.3. The international project business, which is managed by WTE, is also part of this segment and includes the construction and operation of plants for drinking water supplies and wastewater disposal (economic activities 2.1. and 5.3.) as well as the – non-taxonomy-eligible – thermal sewage sludge utilisation. Apart from drinking water supplies in the international project business, which are allocated to the economic activity 2.1. and as such to the environmental objective \"sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\", all of EVN's economic activities fall under the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\".\n\n### **Mandatory reporting of taxonomy alignment**\n\nThe EVN Group was required to report for the first time in accordance with Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation for 2021/22. Since EVN elected to voluntarily report on taxonomy alignment for the 2021/22 financial year, the prior year data on taxonomy alignment for the first two environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaption\" are presented voluntarily as comparative values in the tables.\n\nA second step involved the technical screening of the identified taxonomyeligible economic activities – separated by environmental objectives – to determine whether taxonomy-aligned economic activities were involved. This applied to all economic activities that meet the requirements of Art. 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nWith the exception of the economic activity water supply (WTR 2.1), which is classified by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 under the environmental objective \"sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\" as one of the four other environmental objectives, the economic activities classified as taxonomy-aligned were all allocated to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\" based on the technical screening. This prevents double counting in the assignment of the key performance indicators.\n\nFor this purpose, technical and business experts in the respective Group companies reviewed the previously identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities based on the applicable technical screening criteria and documented the findings in a transparent and comprehensible manner.\n\n### **Minimum safeguards as defined by Art. 18 EU Taxonomy Regulation**\n\nCompliance with the minimum (social) safeguards required by Art.18 of the EUTaxonomy Regulation was classified according to the set of rules defined by Art.18 as well as the Final Report on Minimum Safeguards by the Platform on Sustainable Finance (October 2022) for the subject areas of human rights,\n\n|                                               | 2022/23 |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Turnover (= denominator of KPI)               | EURm    | 3,768.6 |\n| thereof taxonomy-aligned (= numerator of KPI) | EURm    | 1,403.8 |\n| Turnover KPI                                  | %       | 37.2    |\n\n| CapEx                                                                                 |      | 2022/23 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------|\n| Additions to intangible assets, fixed assets and rights of use (= denominator of KPI) | EURm | 722.6   |\n| thereof taxonomy-aligned (= numerator of KPI)                                         | EURm | 634.3   |\n| CapEx KPI                                                                             | %    | 87.8    |\n\n| OpEx                                          |      | 2022/23 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|---------|\n| OpEx (= denominator of KPI)                   | EURm | 70.5    |\n| thereof taxonomy-aligned (= numerator of KPI) | EURm | 53.1    |\n| OpEx KPI                                      | %    | 75.3    |\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nworkers' rights and occupational safety, the prevention of corruption and fair competition, and tax policy. Compliance is ensured by the application of Group-wide established and relevant management approaches as well as organisational rules (e. g. guidelines, instructions). Moreover, processes and measures have been implemented in procurement to ensure that the principles and rules which apply to these areas in the EVN Group also apply to business partners and suppliers.\n\nFor management approaches and rules for\n\n- human rights, see page 28f\n- employee rights, see page 93\n- occupational safety, see page 103ff\n- corruption prevention and fair competition, see page 29f\n- tax policy, see page 33\n- procurement, see page 34f\n\n### **Analysis of climate risks**\n\nAgainst the backdrop of progressive global warming, EVN is working intensively to analyse possible new climate risks and their effects on its business model. We use the findings to meet expanded reporting requirements, for example by the EU Taxonomy Regulation or, in the future, also the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. The results of these analyses also form the basis to prepare EVN's plants and infrastructure for future climatic developments and to protect performance capability.\n\nEVN carried out a standardised evaluation process on this subject for the first time in 2021/22. It was based on a methodology developed by a specially created EVN team and has since been successively refined. The process is based on the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and is embedded in EVN's risk management. Potential climate risks for the years up to 2100 were identified and assessed.\n\nA differentiation was made between chronic and acute risks: An example of a chronic climate risk is the expected long-term global warming. Higher temperatures can have a negative effect on EVN's plants and equipment – for example, when a wind turbine automatically shuts down at a specific operating temperature or the capacity of an electric power line declines under extreme heat. In contrast, acute risks include storms, heavy rains and flooding. All these factors must be considered in the design of plants and infrastructure.\n\nThe basis for the analysis of climate risks is formed by scenarios that were developed by Austrian and European authorities together with meteorological institutes. In interviews with technicians from the entire Group, the effects of these scenarios on EVN's plants were evaluated. New and adapted meteorological data are regularly included in the risk analyses. The data situation for the evaluation of chronic climate risks, in particular, is already very good, and increasingly better estimates for the development of extreme weather events are also possible.\n\nThe analyses to date showed that EVN's plants and infrastructure are well prepared for potential climate risks. The ongoing refinement of the analysis process based on an increasingly better data situation will also make it possible for EVN to securely fulfil its important supply mandate in the coming decades.\n\n### **Key performance indicators for taxonomy-aligned economic activities**\n\nEVN defines the reportable performance indicators listed in Annex I of Delegated Regulation(EU) 2021/2178 as of 6 July 2021 as follows:\n\n### **Key performance indicator related to turnover (turnover KPl)**\n\nThis indicator shows the share of turnover generated by taxonomy-eligible and – subsequently – taxonomyaligned economic activities.\n\nThe denominator represents the total net revenue generated by the EVN Group during the reporting period, which was calculated in accordance with the definition provided by IFRS 15 (see note **25. Revenue** in the consolidated financial statements for 2022/23).\n\nThe numerator represents the part of total net revenue generated by the EVN Group from taxonomy-eligible and – subsequently – from taxonomyaligned economic activities in the reporting year.\n\nAs in the previous year, a large part of non-taxonomy-eligible net revenue (EUR 1,828.0m; previous year: EUR 2,309.7m) as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation was attributable to electricity trading.\n\nThe share of taxonomy-aligned net revenue generated by EVN equalled 37.2% in 2022/23 (previous year: 27.2%).\n\nA major driver for the improvement of this indicator is the downward trend in electricity prices and the resulting decline in trading revenue, which is classified as non-taxonomy-eligible and is only included in the denominator. Another positive factor was the increase in network revenue and revenue from the marketing of electricity production based on electricity procurement rights from the Danube River power plants following first-time confirmation by Verbund AG that the Danube River power plants, which are owned by them, are taxonomy-aligned (economic activity 4.5.). The share of non-taxonomy-aligned revenue was also reduced by the decline in revenue from the international project business due to the largely completed wastewater treatment plant in Kuwait.\n\n### **Key performance indicator related to capital expenditure (CapEx KPI)**\n\nThis indicator shows the share of capital expenditure in taxonomyeligible and – subsequently – taxonomy-aligned economic activities. \n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe denominator represents the addi tions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment recorded by the EVN Group during the reporting period in accordance with IAS 38 (additions to intangible assets), IAS 16 (additions to property, plant and equipment) and IFRS 16 (additions to rights of use) (see the line item \"additions\" in the tables to notes **35. Intangible assets** and **36. Property, plant and equipment** in the notes to the consolidated finan cial statements for 202 2 /23). The EVN Group recorded no additions to investment property (IAS 40) during the reporting period.\n\nThe numerator equals the part of capital expenditure included in the denominator, which was spent by the EVN Group during the reporting period on taxonomy-eligible and – subsequently – taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\n\nThe share of EVN's taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (CapEx) equalled 87.8% in 202 2 /23 (previous year: 84.7%). The increase resulted from a higher volume of taxonomy-aligned investments in the network infra structure and the expansion of renew ables.\n\nA CapEx plan as defined in Annex I of Delegated Regulation(EU) 202 1 /2178 was not prepared during the reporting period.\n\n### **Key performance indicator related to operating expenditure (OpEx KPI)**\n\nThis indicator shows the share of oper ating expenditure for taxonomy-eligible and – subsequently – taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\n\nIn contrast to revenue and capital expenditure (CapEx), the denominator for operating expenditure cannot be allocated to specific positions in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. Annex I of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 202 1 /2178 as of 6 July 2021 only permits the inclusion of certain\n\nImage /page/44/Picture/8 description: Two men wearing hard hats and work clothes are standing in a field of solar panels.

The German text of the signed confirmation report, which refers to the German version of the non-financial reporting 2022/23, is the only legally binding version. This English translation has no legal effect. More specifically, it cannot be used for interpreting the German version of the independent assurance report.\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement of the consolidated non-financial report and sustainability performance disclosures and indicators in accordance with Section 267a UGB for the financial year 2022/23 of EVN AG (the \"Company\"). In the course of the spin-off of the auditing business of BDO Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, the audit engagement has been transferred to BDO Assurance GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft with all rights and obligations by way of universal succession with effect from 26 January 2023.\n\n### **Summary judgement**\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial report for the financial year 2022/23 of the Company has in any material respect not been established in compliance with the requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (Section 267a UGB), the standards on sustainability reporting of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereafter \"GRI Standards 2021\") and Article 8 and 9 lit. a and b of the EU Taxonomy Regulation ((EU) 2020/852) in conjunction with Article 10 (4) of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2021/2178) in conjunction with Article 1 of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2023/2486).\n\n### **Responsibility of the statutory representatives**\n\nThe proper preparation of the consolidated non-financial report in accordance with the requirements pursuant to Section 267a UGB, the GRI Standards 2021 as well as Article 8 and 9 lit. a and b of the EU Taxonomy Regulation ((EU) 2020/852) in conjunction with Article 10 (4) of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2021/2178) in conjunction with Article1 of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2023/2486) is the responsibility of the statutory representatives.\n\nThe responsibility of the statutory representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting methods (in particular the identification of material topics) and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures that are reasonable in the circumstances. It also includes designing, implementing, and maintaining systems, processes and internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated non-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The responsibility also includes the selection and application of appropriate methods in the context of the applications of Article 8 and 9 lit. a and b of the EU Taxonomy Regulation ((EU) 2020/852) in conjunction with Article 10 (4) of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2021/2178) in conjunction with Article 1 of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2023/2486).\n\n### **Auditor's responsibility**\n\nWe have been engaged with providing a judgement, based on our audit procedures and on the evidence we have obtained, as to whether anything has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial report of the Company as of 30. September 2023 does not conform in any material respect to the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (Section 267a UGB), the GRI Standards 2021 as well as Article 8 and 9 lit. a and b of the EU Taxonomy Regulation ((EU) 2020/852) in conjunction with Article 10 (4) of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2021/2178) in conjunction with Article 1 of the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2023/2486).\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nClarification on the scope of the audit due to the integrated non-financial reporting in the full report. Our audit covers the following area of the full report:\n\n- Non-financial report in the full report 2022/23\nWe have performed our audit in accordance with the professional principles in force in Austria relating to general assurance engagements (KFS/PG 13) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000 (Revised)). In this respect, we have to comply with our professional obligations, including the provisions on independence, and are bound to plan and carry out our assignment with regard to the principle of materiality in such a manner that allows us to deliver our judgement with limited assurance.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the audit procedures undertaken are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore a lesser degree of assurance is obtained.\n\nThe choice of audit procedures is at the due discretion of the auditor and included in particular the following activities:\n\n- Interviewing employees responsible for the materiality analysis at group level in order to gain an understanding of the procedure for identifying material sustainability issues and the corresponding reporting boundaries of the Company;\n- Risk assessment, including a media analysis, of relevant information about the Company's sustainability performance during the reporting period;\n- Assessment of the design and implementation of systems and processes for the identification, processing and monitoring of environmental, social and labour data, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and bribery, including the consolidation of data;\n- Interviews with personnel at group level responsible for identifying, consolidating and performing internal control activities related to disclosures of concepts, risks, due diligence processes, results and performance indicators;\n- Assessment of the design and implementation of systems and processes for determining, processing and monitoring the sustainability performance data and indicators included in the scope of the audit, including the consolidation of the data;\n- Review of selected internal and external documents to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented accurately and fairly;\n- Assessment of local data collection, validation and reporting processes and the reliability of reported data through a process and sample survey of the sites in North Macedonia and Bulgaria. The interviews with personnel in North Macedonia was conducted virtually and the interviews of personnel in Bulgaria was carried out through an on-site visit at the headquarter in Plovdiv;\n- Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the quantitative disclosures for the GRI Standards 2021 listed in the GRI index, which were reported by all sites for consolidation at group level;\n\n",

Against this backdrop, the EU is continuing the implementation of various legal regulations to create a binding framework for the attainment of these ambitious goals.\n\nIn March 2023, the member states agreed on the basics of a package for the hydrogen market and the decarbonisation of the gas market. It is designed to establish the framework conditions for the gradual transition from fossil natural gas to renewable gases by creating a competitive market together with the necessary infrastructure. Other key content covers the regulation of the future hydrogen networks and the improvement of planning and investment security for networks and storage.\n\nThe new EU directive to reform emission trading took effect in May 2023 and was expanded to also cover the transport and building sector beginning in 2027. The income from these new emission trading areas is designated to flow into a climate and social fund.\n\nThe EU Parliament and the Council agreed in autumn 2023 on an amendment to the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) which sets significantly more ambitious goals for the share of renewable energies in heating and cooling supplies as well as the building, industry and transport sectors. For the industry sector, the new goals mean a more rapid conversion to renewable hydrogen. The directive also requires shorter planning and approval periods for projects involving the expansion of plants that generate renewable energies, networks and energy storage.\n\nThe energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war led to efforts by the EU Commission in 2023 to prepare and issue a draft for a new electricity market design. A key objective of these reform efforts is to contain the negative effects of extreme price fluctuations on the EU market and, in the end, reduce the impact on consumers. One of the most important measures gives governments an option to assume the market price risks associated with investments in plants that generate electricity from renewable and non-fossil sources. This will provide power plant operators with greater investment security and customers with relief in the event of rising market prices. The basis will be formed by the conclusion of so-called energy sector contracts for difference between electricity producers and the EU member states. The EU\n\naims to approve this legislative package on the electricity market design before the upcoming EU elections in 2024.\n\n#### **Austria**\n\nThe Renewable Energy Expansion Act, which was enacted in Austria during July 2021, includes concrete expansion targets. It requires an increase of 27 TWh per year in renewable electricity generation by 2030, with 11 TWh coming from photovoltaics, 10 TWh from wind power, 5 TWh from hydropower and 1 TWh from biomass.\n\nThe most relevant points of the Renewable Energy Expansion Act for EVN's business activities include the subsidy mechanisms for the construction of new renewable plants as well as investment subsidies for electrolysis equipment to convert electricity into hydrogen or synthetic gas. Investment security will also be created for existing and future renewable gas generating plants, and an increase of 5 TWh per year in nationally produced renewable gas as a share of Austria's total natural gas volumes is planned by 2030. Other relevant content includes the framework conditions for citizens' and renewable energy communities.\n\nAn amendment to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act was passed in March 2023. It facilitates proceedings and introduces measures to accelerate the approval of projects that contribute to the energy transformation.\n\nAn amendment to the Federal Energy Efficiency Act in June 2023 finalised the overdue enactment of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive in Austria.\n\nIn October 2023, the federal government agreed on the contents of a new Renewable Heat Act which, in particular, prohibits the installation of fossil fuel-based heating equipment in new household buildings. The Austrian Parliament also approved higher standards for gas storage as part of a legal amendment during that same month. It requires gas suppliers to guarantee supply security at a level of 45 days in the future (instead of the previous 30 days). A storage standard was also introduced for gas-fired power plants (including combined heat and power plants), and the strategic gas reserve was extended to 2026.\n\nThe Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology is currently working on the Electricity Industry Act to replace the current Electricity Industry and Organisation Act and to implement the EU's Directive on common rules for the internal market for electricity and the Renewable Energy Directive. The Electricity Industry Act is expected to provide, among others, clear rules for energy communities (e.g. concerning\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe operation of storage) as well as new rules for network operators (e. g. concerning the simplified use of smart meter data for planning network flexibilities). The new law is also expected to include additional consumer protection rules.\n\n#### **Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity**\n\nTo implement an EU regulation on emergency intervention measures that was issued in autumn 2022, Austria passed the Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity for the period from 1 December 2022 to 31 December 2023. The primary goal of the EU regulation and the related national laws was to present a temporary answer to the massive distortions on the international energy markets and the resulting effect on the European society and economy. Specifically, the member states were permitted to collect a solidarity levy based on the increased market revenue from electricity generation and from the crude oil, coal and refinery sectors. The income was to be used to provide financial relief from the high energy prices for end customers like households and smaller and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe Austrian Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity calls for a levy equal to 90% of the surplus revenue from electricity generation. The threshold for the calculation of surplus proceeds equalled EUR 140 per MWh from 1 December 2022 to 31 May 2023 but increased up to EUR 176 per MWh based on the inclusion of allowable investments in renewable energies and energy efficiency measures. The threshold was reduced to EUR 120 per MWh, respectively to EUR 156 per MWh as of 1 June 2023 based on the decline in the wholesale prices for electricity.\n\n#### **Regulatory environment Austria**\n\nThe operation of the distribution networks and network infrastructure for electricity and natural gas in Lower Austria is the responsibility of EVN's group company Netz Niederösterreich. All investments and expenditures by this company to ensure the continuous operations of the network infrastructure are remunerated through network tariffs which are set by the E-Control Commission each year in accordance with the Austrian regulatory method.\n\nKey parameters for the determination of the network tariffs include the interest-bearing capital base (regulatory asset base) of the network operator and the weighted average cost of capital. Also included is an incentive in the form of productivity factors, which serve as cost reduction targets for the respective company and also include inflationary adjustments. E-Control\n\nsets the weighted average cost of capital and cost reduction targets for an entire regulatory period, which equals five years in Austria.\n\nThe regulatory authority reduced the weighted average cost of capital with the start of the new regulatory periods for the electricity distribution network on 1 January 2019 and for the natural gas distribution network on 1 January 2023, respectively, to reflect the generally lower interest rate levels. However, a differentiation was made for the first time between the efficiency of the various network operators and between existing and new equipment in order to create incentives for further investments and efficiency improvements. This benefits network operators with higher productivity in industry comparison as well as with the slightly higher interest rates on the capital required for new investments. EVN's network company has received a very positive evaluation from the regulatory authority for its productivity in peer-group benchmarking. A new regulatory period for the electricity distribution network will start on 1 January 2024.\n\n#### **Bulgaria**\n\nThe delivery of electricity to industrial and commercial customers in Bulgaria has been liberalised. EVN Trading SEE serves as a supplier in this market segment. Household customers remain in the regulated market and are supplied by EVN Bulgaria EC, which also acts as a \"supplier of last resort\" for customers who do not select another supplier or cannot receive electricity from their chosen supplier through no fault of their own. In view of the current energy policy debate in Bulgaria, it can be assumed that the transfer of household customers to the liberalised market will be postponed at least to the end of 2026. Energy sales to customers in the regulated market segments and the procurement of the corresponding volumes are based on regulated prices.\n\nThe Bulgarian regulatory authority set new energy tariffs for the regulated market segments as of 1 July 2023. The electricity prices for household customers in EVN's supply area were increased by 3.8% on average (previous year: average increase of 3.6% as of 1 July 2022).\n\nThe new three-year regulation period for the electricity network in Bulgaria began on 1 July 2021. The regulatory method defines a revenue cap which covers recognised operating expenses, amortisation and depreciation as well as an adequate return on the regulatory asset base. The applied method also includes the projected network distribution volumes as well as an annually defined investment factor for planned future investments. EP Yug is responsible for the operation of the electricity distribution networks in EVN's Bulgarian supply area. Due to the decline in electricity prices dur\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\ning the 2022/23 financial year, this company did not receive any further government compensation payments to cover network losses (in the previous year, expenses were reduced by these compensation payments).\n\n#### **North Macedonia**\n\nIn order to achieve the legally required unbundling of the individual fields in the energy business and meet the related requirements, EVN operates through various companies in North Macedonia. Network operations in the regulated market segment are the responsibility of Elektrodistribucija DOOEL, while customers in the liberalised market segment receive deliveries from the supply company EVN Macedonia Elektrosnabduvanje DOOEL. EVN Macedonia Elektrani DOOEL serves as a production company. Since 1 July 2019, EVN Home DOO has supplied electricity to all households and small businesses in the regulated market segments based on a license as the \"supplier of universal service\". This license has an initial term of five years and will be reallocated in the first half of 2024. EVN Home DOO also serves as a \"supplier of last resort\" for customers who do not select another supplier or cannot receive electricity from their chosen supplier through no fault of their own.\n\nThe regulated electricity prices for the household customers supplied by EVN Home DOO are currently classified in four consumption-based categories. As of 1 January 2023, the prices for all four categories were raised by 8.7% to 14.4% (1 July 2022: increase of roughly 21.8%) and the regulated electricity procurement price for EVN Home DOO was set at EUR 56.0 per MWh (previous year: EUR 48.0 per MWh). The VAT on energy – which was temporarily reduced to 5% as of 1 July 2021 as relief for household customers – was increased to 10% in a first step. These tarif increases were, however, mitigated for household customers by a reduction of 19.8% in the network tariffs.\n\nThe VAT on energy was raised to the pre-crisis level of 18% as of 1 July 2023. In return, the regulator reduced the electricity prices for household customers of EVN Home DOO slightly and the regulated electricity procurement price for EVN Home DOO was cut to EUR 53.0 per MWh.\n\nA new three-year regulation period for the North Macedonian electricity network began on 1 July 2021 and brought an improvement in the recognition of operating expenses. Similar to the framework in Bulgaria, the regulatory method for the electricity network in North Macedonia defines a revenue cap which covers recognised operating expenses, amortisation and depreciation as well as an adequate return on the regulatory asset base.\n\n#### **Croatia**\n\nThe liberalisation of the Croatian natural gas market for household customers was nearly complete in 2022. The market for commercial and industrial customers has been liberalised since 2012 and is characterised by increasing competition among the natural gas suppliers active in the country. The new LNG terminal near the island of Krk was commissioned on 1 January 2021 and has further diversified natural gas supplies in Croatia. The substantial fluctuation in natural gas prices during the reporting period and the resulting changes in the suppliers' offering structure have led to expectations of continued consolidation on the Croatian natural gas market.\n\n## General business environment\n\nThe global economy lost substantial momentum in 2022, and this trend has continued into 2023. The energy crisis and the related, in part dramatic increase in the market prices for electricity and natural gas in the previous year have had a stronger impact on Europe than on the USA, where the economy remains robust despite monetary policy tightening. Growth in the eurozone equalled a moderate 3.3% in 2022. Economists currently expect a short timespan for the recession that has taken hold of several countries as well as a general improvement in the economy during the coming year. These assumptions are based on a substantial reduction in energy prices below the previous highs as well as weakening inflation and the related increase in real income, and an improvement in the global economic environment. GDP growth in the eurozone is projected to range from 0.4% to 0.7% in 2023 and from 1.2% to 1.3% in 2024.\n\nThe Austrian economy is currently unable to disengage from the international economic downturn and has fallen into a recession. Forecasts now point to a decline of 0.8% in 2023 after the 4.8% increase in 2022. The underlying factors include the negative effects of above-average inflation, restrictive monetary policies and the weak global economy. Added factors are the generally lower demand following the corona-related catch-up effects and weaker economic growth, especially in the neighbouring countries. The industrial sector is confronted with a decline in orders and high cost pressure. The coming year is, however, expected to see a recovery in the global economy and an increase in private consumption as the result of rising real incomes. The GDP in Austria is expected to increase by 0.8% to 1.2%.\n\nThe economic slowdown in Bulgaria became increasingly clear during the course of the year, and the industrial sector is now in a \n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecession. Exports declined, above all, due to weakening demand from Western Europe. A new government was formed in May and is supported by both major political parties. Bulgaria's accession to the eurozone has been delayed and will not take place as originally scheduled on 1 January 2024. Economic recovery is not expected before 2024. After a plus of 3.4% in 2022, GDP growth is forecasted to range from 1.5% to 2.0% in 2023 and from 1.8% to 3.2% in 2024.\n\nCroatia's accession to the eurozone and border-free Schengen area served as a significant source of momentum for tourism in 2023. The full integration of the country in the EU will help to improve trade and investments over the long term, as was demonstrated in 2022: EU subsidies supported investment activity in the country at that time, and this trend has continued in 2023. Economic growth is currently driven by private household consumption, the largest component of GDP. However, high inflation is pressuring real incomes, export activity and the willingness to invest. The GDP increase of 6.2% in 2022 is expected to be followed by a plus of 1.9% to 2.7% in 2023 and 2.5% to 3.1% in 2024.\n\nEconomic growth in North Macedonia slowed as expected during the second quarter of 2023, chiefly due to high inflation, the restrictive monetary policy of the North Macedonian central bank and limited foreign direct investment. Inflation has remained very high as a result of corporate profits, and the government recently even introduced price controls for food. Economic growth was moderate at 2.1% in 2022, and forecasts show an increase of 2.0% to 2.5% in 2023 and 2.7% to 3.2% in 2024.\n\n## Energy sector environment\n\nEVN's energy business is significantly influenced by external factors. The weather has a strong influence on the demand for electricity, natural gas and heat by household customers, while the general business environment is an important driver for industrial customers' energy requirements. Since the start of the Ukraine war and the related energy crisis, the energy saving steps taken by many customers in reaction to the rising energy prices have played an important role. Market prices and, as a result, EVN's procurement costs are also a function of the geopolitical climate. The relevant factors for energy generation include wind and water flows as well as solar radiation.\n\nThe weather in EVN's three core markets during the 2022/23 financial year was characterised by milder temperatures. The heating degree total – which defines the temperature-related demand for energy – in Austria was slightly lower and in Bulgaria and North Macedonia substantially lower than the long-term average. In Bulgaria, it reached only 77.7% of the median value. In contrast, the heating degree totals in the previous year were substantially above the long-term average in all three countries. The cooling degree total, which measures the temperature-related demand for cooling energy, rose substantially year-on-year in all three core markets during 2022/23. In Austria it was slightly above, and in Bulgaria and North Macedonia clearly above the long-term average.\n\nThe massive fluctuations and distortions in the previous financial year were followed by a decline in primary energy and energy\n\n| GDP growth           | % | 2024f      | 2023e       | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------|---|------------|-------------|------|------|------|\n| EU-281) 2)5)         |   | 1.2 to 1.3 | 0.4 to 0.7  | 3.3  | 5.6  | -6.1 |\n| Austria1) 2) 3) 5)   |   | 0.8 to 1.2 | -0.8 to 0.1 | 4.8  | 4.6  | -6.6 |\n| Bulgaria1)2)4)       |   | 1.8 to 3.2 | 1.5 to 2.0  | 3.4  | 7.6  | -4.0 |\n| Croatia1)2)5)        |   | 2.5 to 3.1 | 1.9 to 2.7  | 6.2  | 13.1 | -8.5 |\n| North Macedonia4) 5) |   | 2.7 to 3.2 | 2.0 to 2.5  | 2.1  | 3.9  | -4.7 |\n\n1) Source: \"European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2023\", EU-Commission, November 2023\n\n2) Source: \"Herbst-Prognose der österreichischen Wirtschaft 2023–2024\", IHS, October 2023\n\n3) Source: \"Prognose für 2023 und 2024: Kaufkraft steigt nach milder Rezession\", WIFO, October 2023\n\n4) Source: \"Global Economic Prospects\", World Bank, June 2023\n\n5) Source: \"World Economic Outlook\", International Monetary Fund, October 2023\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nprices during 2022/23, especially during the summer months. The average EEX price for natural gas dropped by half from EUR 123.1 per MWh to approximately EUR 56.4 per MWh. However, a contrasting trend appeared towards the end of the reporting year – with the exception of CO₂ emission certificate prices. Their price was subject to less fluctuation, but rose by 8% on average over the prior year value of EUR 78.0 per tonne to EUR 84.2 per tonne in 2022/23.\n\nThis development also had an impact on the market prices for electricity, which declined significantly during the reporting year but remained high. The spot market prices for base load and peak load electricity averaged EUR 134.4 per MWh and EUR 154.8 per MWh, respectively (previous year: EUR 258.7 per MWh and EUR 296.3 per MWh).\n\n## Business development\n\nThe scope of consolidation and changes in comparison with the previous year are explained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

EUR 46.1m)\n\n#### **Results of operations**\n\nRevenue recorded by the EVN Group declined by 7.2% year-onyear to EUR 3,768.7m in 2022/23. This development resulted primarily from a decline in revenue in South East Europe which, in turn, was caused by lower network and energy sales volumes and by the downward trend in wholesale prices. In the international project business, the largely completed wastewater treatment plant in Kuwait led to lower revenue. This decline was moderated by price and volume effects from renewable electricity generation, positive valuation effects from hedges, higher revenue from natural gas trading, increased selling prices at EVN Wärme and higher network tariffs.\n\nThe revenue generated by EVN outside Austria amounted to EUR 1,991.2m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 2,578.6m). This represents a decrease in the share of Group revenue from 63.5% in the previous year to 52.8% in 2022/23.\n\nOther operating income rose by 16.4% to EUR 127.5m.\n\nDeclining wholesale prices in South East Europe led to a reduction of 26.5% in the cost of electricity purchases from third parties and primary energy expenses to EUR 1,675.5m in 2022/23. These costs include positive upfront effects from the procurement of energy to cover network losses, which will be offset in the following year in accordance with the regulation methodology. Contrasting factors included, in particular, higher costs for network losses and upstream network costs at Netz Niederösterreich as well as increased energy procurement costs of EVN Wärme. Higher electricity production volumes in the Verbund Innkraftwerke also increased the cost of electricity purchases from third parties.\n\nThe cost of materials and services declined by 6.3% to EUR 662.7m in line with the development of revenue in the international project business and offset inflation-based increases in the other Group companies.\n\nPersonnel expenses were 12.6% higher year-on-year at EUR 419.2m due to adjustments required by collective bargaining agreements. The EVN Group had an average workforce of 7,255 in 2022/23 (previous year: 7,135 employees).\n\nOther operating expenses rose by 27.7% to EUR 202.2m. This amount includes a levy of EUR 25.1m on the surplus revenue from electricity production which is based on the Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity which was implemented in Austria during December 2022 (details on the underlying legal regulation are provided on page 3f in the section \"Energy policy environment\").\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees amounted to EUR –67.6m (previous year: EUR 98.9m). This decline – which was already reported in the first quarter of the financial year and forecasted for the entire year – is attributable to the energy supply company EVN KG, where the development of earnings was significantly impaired by several factors. They included higher procurement costs for energy that can only be passed on to customers with a delay, the lower valuation of hedges as of 30 September 2023 and additions to provisions for impending losses from contractual supply obligations. EVN KG reported a loss of EUR 240.3m for the reporting year. In contrast, higher earnings contributions were received from RAG (EUR +27.4m), the Verbund Innkraftwerke (EUR +20.7m) and Burgenland Energie (EUR +16.6m). A further positive effect was a revaluation to the Ashta hydropower plant (EUR 11.1m).\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on these developments, EBITDA recorded by the EVN Group rose by 15.1% year-on-year to EUR 869.0m in 2022/23.\n\nScheduled depreciation and amortisation rose by 5.8% to EUR 336.5m based on investments. A year-on-year comparison of the effects of impairment testing is influenced, above all, by the absence of impairment losses totalling EUR 114.8m from 2021/22 (which involved the international project business, Netz Niederösterreich's natural gas network, district heating equipment in Lower Austria and the Bulgarian district heating company TEZ Plovidv). Impairment losses in 2022/23 amounted to EUR 7.1m and were related chiefly to district heating equipment in Lower Austria (EUR 5.7m). Revaluations of EUR 3.2m were recorded to plants operated by EVN Wärme and EVN Wasser (previous year: revaluations of EUR 9.6m to the Kavarna wind park).\n\nThese developments led to an increase in EBIT to EUR 528.5m (previous year: EUR 331.6m).\n\nFinancial results improved to EUR 127.6m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR –30.5m) and were influenced, above all, by an increase in the dividend from Verbund AG to EUR 3.60 per share for the 2022 financial year (previous year: EUR 1.05 per share). In total, the earnings contribution from the Verbund investment equalled EUR 158.0m in 2022/23. Financial results were also supported by the better performance of the R138 fund and EVN's cash fund despite the increase in interest expense. In the previous year, financial results were negatively influenced by foreign exchange effects and the value adjustment to a loan extended to an equity accounted company in the international project business.\n\nThe result before income tax totalled EUR 656.2m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 301.2m). After the deduction of income tax expense – which increased to EUR 74.0m (previous year: EUR 64.0m) – and the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, Group net result for the 2022/23 financial year equalled EUR 529.7m (previous year: EUR 209.6m).\n\nImage /page/8/Figure/6 description: This image is a bar chart titled \"Revenue by region\" in EURm.

For EBIT, the values for 2021/22 and 2022/23 are as follows: Energy: -54.7 and -90.1; Environment: -34.9.\n\n#### **Statement of financial position**\n\n#### **Asset and financial position**\n\nEVN's balance sheet total declined by 11.5% year-on-year to EUR 10,996.0m as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted investees fell sharply due to the valuation of hedges held by EVN KG and EnergieAllianz as well as the loss recorded by EVN KG for the reporting period. In addition, the market price of the Verbund share (EUR 77.05 as of 30 September 2023 versus EUR 87.45 as of 30 September 2022) was responsible for a decline in other investments. A contrasting factor was the increase in property, plant and equipment which resulted from the high level of investments. Non-current assets declined by 12.4% to EUR 9,380.9m.\n\nCurrent assets were 6.0% lower at EUR 1,615.1m in 2022/23, whereby the high level of investments and capital commitment in working capital led to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents. Inventories fell below the level of the previous year which resulted from the rapid rise in wholesale prices for natural gas and the build-up of additional strategic natural gas reserves to protect supply security. In contrast, an increase was recorded in the receivables due from EVN KG from loans granted by the EVN Group, in tax receivables and in the receivables from hedging transactions.\n\n159.5\n\n255.0 260.3\n\n96.0 54.0\n\n48.0\n\n29.5\n\n78.6 58.8\n\nSouth East Europe\n\nNetworks\n\nGeneration\n\n–90.1 –54.7\n\nEnergy\n\nEnvironment\n\n–34.9\n\nAll Other Segments\n\nEquity totalled EUR 6,464.3m as of 30 September 2023 and was 11.7% lower than on 30 September 2022, even though the result after tax for the reporting period exceeded the dividend payment in February 2023 of EUR 0.52 per share for the 2021/22 financial year. This decline was based, above all, on valuation effects recorded directly in equity without recognition to profit or loss, in particular to equity accounted investees and to Verbund AG. These valuation effects are also reflected in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, which reduced equity by a\n\n**EVN Annual Financial Report 2022/23 10**\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Condensed consolidated statement of operations                              | 2022/23<br>EURm | 2021/22<br>EURm | +/–    |       | 2020/21<br>EURm |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|-------|-----------------|\n| Revenue                                                                     | 3,768.7         | 4,062.2         | -293.5 | -7.2  | 2,394.9         |\n| Other operating income                                                      | 127.5           | 109.5           | 18.0   | 16.4  | 250.1           |\n| Electricity purchases and primary energy expenses                           | -1,675.5        | -2,278.2        | 602.7  | 26.5  | -1,064.7        |\n| Cost of materials and services                                              | -662.7          | -707.1          | 44.3   | 6.3   | -509.2          |\n| Personnel expenses                                                          | -419.2          | -372.2          | -47.0  | -12.6 | -361.3          |\n| Other operating expenses                                                    | -202.2          | -158.4          | -43.9  | -27.7 | -113.0          |\n| Share of results from equity accounted<br>investees with operational nature | -67.6           | 98.9            | -166.5 | –     | 239.6           |\n| EBITDA                                                                      | 869.0           | 754.8           | 114.2  | 15.1  | 836.5           |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                               | -336.5          | -318.0          | -18.5  | -5.8  | -337.7          |\n| Effects from impairment tests                                               | -3.9            | -105.2          | 101.3  | 96.3  | -112.4          |\n| Results from operating activities (EBIT)                                    | 528.5           | 331.6           | 196.9  | 59.4  | 386.4           |\n| Financial results                                                           | 127.6           | -30.5           | 158.1  | –     | -20.0           |\n| Result before income tax                                                    | 656.2           | 301.2           | 355.0  | –     | 366.4           |\n| Income tax                                                                  | -74.0           | -64.0           | -10.0  | -15.6 | -14.7           |\n| Result for the period                                                       | 582.1           | 237.1           | 345.0  | –     | 351.7           |\n| thereof result attributable to EVN AG shareholders (Group net result)       | 529.7           | 209.6           | 320.1  | –     | 325.3           |\n| thereof result attributable to non-controlling interests                    | 52.4            | 27.5            | -24.9  | 90.5  | 26.4            |\n| Earnings per share in EUR1)                                                 | 2.97            | 1.18            | 1.8    | –     | 1.83            |\n\n1) There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\ntotal of EUR –737.1m in the reporting period (previous year: increased by EUR 895.4m). The equity ratio equalled 58.8% as of 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: 58.9%).\n\nNon-current liabilities declined by 10.4% to EUR 3,029.4m, chiefly due to the reduction in long-term tax liabilities which followed the lower valuation of equity accounted investees and the investment in Verbund AG. The development of non-current financial liabilities reflected the arrangement of four long-term bank loans at a total of EUR 255m, which was contrasted by the reclassification of bank loans (in total, EUR 200m) and the JPY bond (EUR 77.8m) to current financial liabilities. The new loans include a \"green loan\"with the European Investment Bank (EUR 110m), which has already been drawn down by an initial tranche of EUR 105m.\n\nCurrent liabilities fell by 13.0% to EUR 1,502.2m. The main factors for this development included a lower balance of liabilities from derivative transactions and from the procurement of strategic gas reserves, both of which are recorded under other current liabilities. A decline was also recorded in investments by EVN KG in the EVN Group, which are recorded under other current liabilities.\n\n#### **Value analysis**\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after tax – including EVN's specific company and country risks – was set at 5.0% for the purpose of corporate management. The operating return on capital employed (OpROCE) equalled 7.7% for the reporting year (previous year: 5.5%). The economic value added (EVA®) generated in 2022/23 totalled EUR 159.4m (previous year: EUR 29.3m).\n\n#### **Liquidity position**\n\nEVN's net debt including non-current employee-related provisions as of 30 September 2023 amounted to EUR 1,364.3m (previous year: EUR 1,245.1m). The gearing ratio increased from 17.0% to 21.1%.\n\nIn order to safeguard its financial flexibility, the EVN Group holds a syndicated credit line of EUR 400.0m as well as contractually agreed bilateral credit commitments of EUR 286.0m. These bilateral commitments were not drawn as of 30 September 2023 and were therefore available in full. The term of the syndicated credit line which serves as a strategic liquidity reserve will end in May 2025. The remaining terms of the bilateral credit lines concluded with 13 banks range up to two years.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Statement of cash flows**\n\nGross cash flow rose by 49.9% year-on-year to EUR 1,100.7m in 2022/23, chiefly due to the increase in EVN's result before tax. The development of the non-cash earnings components was characterised by the correction of the negative result from the equity accounted EVN KG. The increase was reduced by a reduction in the dividend payments from equity accounted investees and a year-on-year decline in impairment losses and the noncash earnings components in financial results.\n\nCash flow from operating activities totalled EUR 942.4m and was negatively affected by working capital developments and by an increase in income tax payments over 2021/22 but still exceeded the prior year value of EUR 151.0m. Working capital was reduced, in part by the liquidity settlement with EVN KG which followed the capital increases. Other positive effects resulted from the lower capital commitment in the international project\n\n## **Balance sheet structure** % Equity Non-current liabilities Current liabilities Current assets

However, working capital was increased by higher receivables from taxes and from hedges.\n\nCash flow from investing activities totalled EUR –929.0m (previous year: EUR –336.7m) and was influenced mainly by the significant increase in investments and by capital contributions to EVN KG. Investments were again made in the cash funds included under current financial investments during the fourth quarter of 2022/23, following the gradual reduction of these holdings in the previous quarters and prior year. A contrasting factor was the increase in network subsidies that accompanied the higher volume of network investments.\n\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR 1.6m (previous year: EUR 115.8m).

EVN AG also had contractually agreed, undrawn credit lines of EUR 686m at its disposal at the end of the reporting year to service potential short-term financing requirements.\n\n|  | Capital structure indicators                             | 30.09.2023<br>EURm | 30.09.2022<br>EURm | +/–<br>Nominal | +/–<br>% | 30.09.2021<br>EURm |\n|--|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------|--------------------|\n|  | Non-current loans and borrowings and leasing liabilities | 1,174.8            | 1,206.1            | -31.4          | -2.6     | 773.9              |\n|  | Current loans and borrowings1)                           | 302.0              | 128.8              | 173.2          | –        | 323.4              |\n|  | Cash and cash equivalents                                | -20.2              | -36.9              | 16.7           | 45.3     | -122.3             |\n|  | Non-current and current securities                       | -337.5             | -285.6             | -51.9          | -18.2    | -473.5             |\n|  | Non-current and current loans receivable                 | -29.5              | -29.4              | -0.1           | -0.3     | -39.6              |\n|  | Financial net debt                                       | 1,089.7            | 983.1              | 106.6          | 10.8     | 461.9              |\n|  | Net debt                                                 | 1,364.3            | 1,245.1            | 119.3          | 9.6      | 813.8              |\n|  | Equity                                                   | 6,464.3            | 7,321.1            | -856.8         | -11.7    | 6,544.3            |\n|  | Gearing (%)2)                                            | 21.1               | 17.0               | 4.1            | 4.1      | 12.4               |\n\n1) Excluding bank overdrafts contained in cash and cash equivalents\n\n2) Changes reported in percentage points\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nCapital expenditure was substantially higher than the previous year at EUR 694.1m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 564.0m). This increase was based on the Strategy 2030 which sets the focal points for EVN's investments in network infrastructure, renewable generation, natural heat and drinking water.\n\nInvestments in the Energy Segment included the completion of the new biomass combined heat and power plant in Krems and, above all, equipment and network expansion measures in the heating business. In the energy services business, investments in e-charging stations also increased.\n\nIn the Generation Segment, investments focused on the expansion of renewable generation and included wind power projects as well as large-scale photovoltaic equipment in Lower Austria.\n\nInvestments in the Lower Austrian network infrastructure continue to increase.

The focus here is on the expansion of cross-regional supply pipelines.\n\n#### **Structure of investments**\n\n%, total in EURm\n\nImage /page/14/Figure/8 description: This image shows a bar graph comparing data from 2020/21, 2021/22, and 2022/23. In 2020/21, the total is 415.0, with segments of 0.0, 4.9, 24.2, 4.9, 60.0, and 6.0. In 2021/22, the total is 564.0, with segments of 0.4, 3.5, 19.5, 7.4, 59.3, and 9.9.

Projects are directed primarily to safeguarding supply security, protecting the environment and resources, and strengthening the company's competitive position. The overriding criterion for all projects is to provide a concrete benefit for customers.\n\nIn 2022/23 EVN spent approximately EUR 4.0m (previous year: approximately EUR 2.6m) on innovation, research and development projects. Public subsidies were received for these projects and represent a subsidy quota of 2.8%.\n\nAn important focal point for EVN's innovation activities during the reporting year was formed by storage solutions that will allow surplus renewable production to be used in periods with lower energy generation from renewable sources. This challenge must be solved, particularly from a seasonal viewpoint, to design a CO₂-free energy system. Electricity generation from wind power and photovoltaics now frequently exceeds demand during the summer half-year due to the expansion of capacity, but low water, wind and sun periods in Central Europe – above all during the\n\nwinter half-year – can create challenging situations for supply security. In light of these developments, EVN is working, for example as a project partner with RAG, on a pilot plant that will use solar energy to operate electrolysis equipment. The resulting green hydrogen will be stored in an idle RAG natural gas storage facility and can be used during the winter to generate emission-free electricity and heat. In other projects, EVN is testing the possibility to use surplus production from renewable sources for sector integration purposes or for the substitution of thermal generation. One example is the pilot hybrid storage facility in Theiss, which combines heat storage equipment with a 5 MW storage battery and photovoltaics.\n\nOther EVN research projects involve innovative approaches to increasingly utilise flexibilities from various customers and smaller electricity producers to adjust the demand for energy over time in a manner that prevents demand peaks and makes it possible to cover requirements with the available renewable energy. Contributions in this area are made by CyberGrid, a subsidiary acquired by EVN in 2022, which offers special IT solutions for the flexibility management of electricity networks as well as individual projects (e.g. for the bi-directional charging of e-vehicles) within the framework of the Green Energy Lab, an interdisciplinary innovation laboratory.\n\nImage /page/15/Figure/6 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Expenditures for innovation, research and development projects and share of subsidies.\" The chart shows the expenditures in EURm and the share of subsidies in %.

As part of this process, a centrally organised corporate risk management department provides the decentralised risk managers with effective methods and tools for identifying and assessing risks. The responsible business units communicate their risk exposures to corporate risk management, which defines suitable actions to minimise these risks. The necessary actions are then implemented by the individual business units. The corporate risk management department is also responsible for analysing EVN's risk exposure. The risks related to sustainability, climate and compliance issues are identified annually and managed by specialised organisational units and/or processes in agreement with central risk management. EVN's risk management process includes the following steps:\n\n- **• Identification:** The survey and/or revision of risks based on the latest risk inventory (review of risk inventory) and the identification of new risk positions and appropriate risk management countermeasures\n- **• Assessment and analysis:** The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the identified risks; the aggregation of risks from different points of view; and the modelling of earnings and cash flow distributions\n- **• Reporting:** Discussion and evaluation of the risk profile by the Risk Working Committee and the Group Risk Committee; the implementation of further risk management measures where necessary; reporting on risk issues to the Audit Committee\n- **• Process review:** Definition of the organisational units that must submit to an explicit risk assessment; regular reviews to determine whether the methods used to identify and assess risks should be modified to reflect changed conditions; routine reviews by the internal audit department\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Risk Working Committee**\n\nThe Risk Working Committee supports the corporate risk management department in the correct implementation of the risk management process. It evaluates and approves changes in risk (assessment) methods and defines the type and scope of risk reporting. The voting members of the committee at the corporate level include the heads of the following corporate functions: controlling, legal and public affairs, finance, accounting, internal audit and the chief compliance officer (CCO) as well as an (internal) energy industry expert.\n\n#### **Group Risk Committee and control**\n\nThe results of the risk inventory and the related reports are presented to and discussed by the Group Risk Committee, which consists of the Executive Board of EVN AG, the heads of the organisational units and the members of the Risk Working Committee. The Group Risk Committee decides on any need for action, can establish working groups and assign specified tasks, and is authorised to approve the results of the risk inventory (risk reports).\n\nGRI indicator: GRI 2-12\n\n#### **Risk profile**\n\nIn addition to the normal industry risks and uncertainties, EVN's risk profile is influenced primarily by political, legal and regulatory challenges and changes in the competitive environment. EVN carries out an annual risk inventory that is updated as needed through ad-hoc risk reports. This inventory includes the following categorisation of risks: market and competition risks, financial risks, operating risks, external risks, strategic and planning risks and other risks. These are largely assessed in terms of their financial impact on the EVN Group. The following table shows the risks classified under the above categories and the measures designated for their minimisation.\n\nIn line with the Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act, the risk inventory aims to systematically identify potential risks and effects of EVN's business activities and business relations on areas of environmental, social and employee-related issues, the observance of human rights and the fight against corruption. The identified risks and their impact were dealt with in accordance with the steps defined by the risk management process.\n\nFor the material impacts, see page 21ff in the EVN Annual Report 2022/23\n\n#### **Potential climate risks**\n\nEVN also places high priority on climate protection, and potential climate risks are therefore identified as part of the risk inventory. Climate risk is consciously not defined as a separate risk category but – wherever applicable – represents interdisciplinary material in the individual risk categories.

stricter requirements could possibly lead to additional costs\n\n• Additional stress for the electricity network due to the ongoing expansion of substantially more volatile renewable generation: transition risk that is assigned to the category \"operating risks\" (\"service disruptions/network breakdowns\")\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity analysis for 2022/23**\n\nIn view of the geopolitical crises during the past two years and the resulting distortions on energy markets, EVN also monitored risk developments in the Group throughout the reporting period. Ad-hoc analyses were not required in 2022/23 but the assessment of the major risks with a potentially high impact was updated at the end of the first half-year. A report on these risks and their effects was also presented to the Audit Committee of EVN's Supervisory Board.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following issues were identified as the major uncertainties with the potentially highest effects and analysed in particular detail in connection with the risk inventory carried out as of 30 September 2023 (excerpt):\n\n- Margin risk and competitive situation\n- Inflation-related increase in procurement costs for investments and maintenance\n- Completion risk for major international projects in the environmental business\n- Cybersecurity\n\nEVN's risk profile is influenced primarily by common industry risks and uncertainties and, in particular, by political, legal and regulatory challenges and changes. All these aspects are categorised as part of EVN's risk management process.\n\n#### **Overall risk profile**\n\nIn addition to the uncertainties connected with the areas of business and operations outside Austria, EVN continues to be confronted with a challenging environment in its home market of Lower Austria. In the 2022/23 financial year, however, the uncertainties decreased. The overall risk profile of EVN is trending downwards, but not yet to pre-crisis levels. To conclude, no future risks can be identified at the present time that could endanger the continued existence of the EVN Group.\n\nThe table on the pages 18 to 20 provides a summary of the material risks and uncertainties to which the EVN Group is exposed. For the first time, this table also includes opportunities for certain categories, if applicable.\n\n#### **Key features of the internal control and risk management system related to accounting processes**\n\nIn accordance with § 267 (3b) and in connection with § 243a (2) of the Austrian Commercial Code, those companies whose shares are admitted for trading on a regulated market are required to disclose the key features of their internal control and risk management system for corporate accounting processes in the management report. The Executive Board is responsible for establishing a suitable internal control and risk management system (ICS) for accounting processes as defined in § 82 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The effectiveness of the ICS must be monitored by the Audit Committee in accordance with § 92 (4a) no. 4b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act.\n\nEVN's ICS for accounting processes is monitored at regular intervals by auditing the processes that are considered to be exposed to risk. The results of these monitoring activities are reported to\n\nthe Executive Board and the Audit Committee. The ICS ensures clear lines of responsibility and eliminates unnecessary process steps, and thereby further improves the security of processes for the preparation of financial statements. The description of the major features of the ICS covers five interrelated components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.\n\n#### **Control environment**\n\nThe Code of Conduct issued by EVN and the underlying values apply to all Group employees.\n\nEVN's Code of Conduct is available under www.evn.at/code-of-conduct\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by Group accounting. The related processes are based on a uniform accounting guideline that defines the accounting policies to be applied as well as key processes and schedules for the entire Group. Binding instructions apply to the reconciliation of intragroup accounts and other work required for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. All employees involved in the accounting process have the necessary qualifications and undergo regular training. Complex actuarial opinions and valuations are prepared by external experts or specially qualified employees. The managers responsible for the specific processes – in general, the heads of the organisational units and corporate services – are responsible for compliance with these processes and the related control measures.\n\n#### **Risk assessment and control activities**\n\nMulti-stage control measures have been implemented to prevent material misstatements in the presentation of transactions in order to ensure that the individual financial statements of all subsidiaries are recorded correctly. These measures include automated controls that are executed by the consolidation software as well as manual controls by the involved corporate services. These corporate service departments carry out extensive plausibility checks of the individual subsidiaries' financial statements to ensure their correct transfer to the consolidated financial statements. The review of the financial statement data includes analyses at the position, segment and Group levels, both before and after consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are not released until these quality controls are complete at all levels.\n\nEVN AG and the major domestic and foreign subsidiaries use SAP software (FI module, finance and accounting) for their accounting. The IFRS consolidated financial statements are prepared with the Hyperion Financial Management software, whereby the data from \n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe individual financial statements of the consolidated companies are transferred by means of an interface. The accounting systems and all upstream systems are protected by restricted access as well as automated and mandatory manual control steps.\n\nThe ICS for financial reporting and all accounting-related processes are reviewed by the auditor at least once each year to verify compliance with the required controls, to evaluate any risk incidents that occurred during the financial year and to determine whether the controls are still suitable to deal with the existing risks. In the reporting period, a number of process adjustments and improvements were made as part of the continuous efforts to further develop the ICS for financial reporting.\n\n#### **Information, communication and monitoring**\n\nThe Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with quarterly reports on EVN's asset, financial and earnings position, together with a statement of financial position and a statement of operations. The Executive Board and the Audit Committee also receive a report on the ICS for financial accounting twice each year, which contains basic information to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ICS and is designed to support the management of the ICS by the responsible corporate bodies. The report is prepared by ICS management in cooperation with the ICS Committee based on information supplied by the managers responsible for ICS, the persons who carried out the controls and the auditors.\n\nThis information is also distributed to management and key personnel in the involved companies to facilitate monitoring and control activities and thereby ensure the accuracy of accounting and reporting procedures. EVN's internal audit department carries out regular reviews of the ICS for financial accounting, and their findings are also included in the continuous improvement of this system.\n\nGRI indicators: GRI 2-12, GRI 2-16\n\n## Consolidated non-financial report\n\nThe consolidated non-financial statement required by the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act was prepared in accordance with § 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code and is presented as an independent non-financial report.\n\nSee page 1ff in the EVN Annual Report 2022/23\n\n## Disclosures required by § 243a of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\n1. The share capital of EVN AG totalled EUR 330,000,000 as of 30 September 2023 and was divided into 179,878,402 zero par value bearer shares, each of which represents an equal stake in share capital. Shareholders are not entitled to the issue of individual share certificates. There is only one class of shares, and all shares carry the same rights and responsibilities. EVN AG shares are traded in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n2. There are no restrictions on voting rights or agreements limiting the transfer of shares which exceed the general requirements of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. However, it should be noted that the transferability of the investment owned by the province of Lower Austria, which holds its shares through NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten, is limited by Austrian federal and provincial constitutional law.\n\nNÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH (\"NLH\") and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH (\"WSTW\") established a tax participation association on 23 September 2021, for which they concluded an \"agreement over the creation of a tax participation association for their investments in EVN AG\". This contract basically calls for the syndicated exercise of voting rights by NLH and WSTW in the Annual General Meetings of EVN but reflects only the voting weight in the Annual General Meeting based on the respective investments held by NLH and WSTW and in accordance with legal regulations and/or the articles of association (NLH continues to hold a simple – but not qualified – majority and WSTW continues to hold a blocking minority).\n\n- 3. Based on the above-mentioned constitutional requirements, the province of Lower Austria is the major shareholder of EVN with a stake of 51.0%. The second largest shareholder is Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH, Vienna, with a stake of 28.4%; this company is wholly owned by the city of Vienna. As of 30 September 2023, EVN held treasury shares representing 0.9% of share capital and free float equalled 19.7%.\n- 4. EVN has not issued any shares with special control rights.\n- 5. Employees who own shares in EVN may exercise their voting rights personally at the Annual General Meeting. EVN does not have a stock option programme.\n- 6. The Executive Board consists of at least two members. The Supervisory Board has a minimum of eight and a maximum of 12 members. Unless another majority is required by law, the Annual General Meeting passes its resolutions with a simple majority of the votes cast or with a majority of the capital represented in cases requiring a majority of capital.\n- 7. There were no authorisations as defined by § 243a (1) no. 7 of the Austrian Commercial Code in effect during the 2022/23 financial year which entitled the Executive Board, in particular, to issue the company's shares. However, the possibility of issuing previously repurchased treasury shares to employees remains intact.\n- 8. A change of control in EVN in the sense of § 243a (1) no. 8 of the Austrian Commercial Code is currently not possible because of the legal regulations described above under points 2. and 3. Therefore, there are no possible consequences of a change of control.\n- 9. There are no agreements to provide compensation to the members of corporate bodies or employees in the event of a public takeover.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Outlook on the 2023/24 financial year\n\nFollowing the new historical level of investments reached during the past financial year, annual investments will range from EUR 700m to EUR 900m up to 2030, whereby three-fourths will focus on Lower Austria. That makes EVN one of the key players in the design of a CO₂-free energy future. The necessary foundation is formed by a high-performance electricity network infrastructure and, consequently, up to EUR 450m will be directed to this area each year. These investments will safeguard Lower Austria's leading position in renewable generation because an efficient and stable network is the basic condition for integrating the electricity generated by the wind, sun and water in the energy system. Marketable solutions must also be found to utilise the surplus production from renewable generation across multiple sectors or – even more decisive for the success of a year-round CO₂-free energy future – to be stored over several seasons. We will continue to address this essential future issue as part of our innovation activities and work to develop solutions, for example together with RAG, through promising projects.\n\nThe expansion of our own renewable generation capacity has also reached a historically high level. In addition to the construction of wind parks, the realisation of large-scale photovoltaic plants has increased rapidly. Our installed photovoltaic capacity will double to roughly 80 MWp in the first quarter of 2023/24 with the commissioning of plants in Dürnrohr and North Macedonia – an important step to reach the goal of 300 MWp for photovoltaics by 2030. In the wind power field, a pipeline of projects in different phases of completion in Lower Austria will help us meet our expansion goal of over 770 MW by 2030.\n\nThe crisis that has influenced the international energy markets for the past two years has, at times, triggered unexpected and erratic price fluctuations. This has led to an enormous burden not only for our customers, but also for the profitability of our energy supply business. We expect a return to positive earnings in 2023/24 after spot and futures prices gradually decline.\n\nIn South East Europe, the sharp rise in electricity prices also created significant challenges in the various market segments. Regulatory measures, for example as compensation for the additional costs for covering network losses, had positive anticipatory effects that will be offset in 2023/24 in accordance with the regulatory mechanism.\n\nWe initiated a structured bidder process for the international project business in September 2023. Its goal is to identify potential new investors for WTE who can support the realisation of the future international project and growth potential that is offered, above all by the successful project in Kuwait.\n\nFor the 2023/24 financial year, EVN expects Group net result within a range of roughly EUR 420m to EUR 460m – under the assumption of a stable regulatory and energy policy environment.\n\nEVN's future dividend policy has also been revised to reflect the investment and growth perspectives up to 2030 and beyond. The dividend will equal at least EUR 0.82 per share in the future, whereby EVN wants its shareholders to appropriately participate in any additional earnings growth. In the mid term, a payout ratio equalling 40% of Group net result, adjusted for extraordinary effects, is targeted.\n\nThese future perspectives underscore EVN's responsibility to remain a reliable operator of energy and drinking water infrastructure. At the same time, EVN also offers attractive opportunities for the capital market.\n\nMaria Enzersdorf, 21 November 2023\n\n**Stefan Szyszkowitz Franz Mittermayer** Spokesman of the Executive Board

General**\n\nEVN AG, as the parent company of the EVN Group (EVN), is a leading listed Austrian energy and environmental services provider. Its headquarters are located in A-2344 Maria Enzersdorf, Austria. In addition to serving its domestic market in the province of Lower Austria, EVN operates in the Bulgarian, North Macedonian, Croatian, German and Albanian energy industry. EVN is also active in the area of environmental services through subsidiaries that provide customers in twelve countries with water supply, wastewater treatment and thermal waste utilisation services.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared as of the balance sheet date of EVN AG. The financial year of EVN AG covers the period from 1 October to 30 September.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of uniform accounting policies. In cases where the balance sheet date of a consolidated company differs from the balance sheet date of EVN AG, interim financial statements are prepared as of 30 September.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical acquisition and production costs, unless indicated otherwise.\n\nCertain items on the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of operations are summarised to achieve a more understandable and clearly structured presentation. These positions are presented individually in the consolidated notes and explained according to the principle of materiality. In order to improve clarity and comparability, the amounts in the consolidated financial statements are generally shown in millions of euros (EURm), unless otherwise noted. Small amounts below TEUR 50 as well as zero values are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements with \"–\" to improve readability. The rounding of individual positions and percentage rates can lead to minimal rounding differences. As far as possible, the legislative basis is presented as is.\n\nThe consolidated statement of operations is prepared in accordance with the nature of expense method.\n\n#### **2. Reporting in accordance with IFRS**\n\nPursuant to § 245a of the Austrian Commercial Code, the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the current guidelines set forth in the IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) that were applicable as of the balance sheet date and had been adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\n#### **Standards and interpretations applied for the first time and changes in accounting policies**\n\nThe following standards and interpretations were applied for the first time in the 2022/23 financial year:\n\n| Standards and interpretations applied for the first time | Effective1)                           | Expected material effects<br>on EVN's consolidated<br>financial statements |      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Revised standards and interpretations                    |                                       |                                                                            |      |\n| IFRS 3                                                   | Reference to the Conceptual Framework | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n| IAS 16                                                   | Proceeds before Intended Use          | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n| IAS 37                                                   | Cost of Fulfilling a Contract         | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n| Several                                                  | Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018–2020 | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n\n1) In accordance with the official Journal of the EU, these standards are applicable to financial years beginning on or after the effective date.\n\nThe first-time mandatory application of the amended standards and interpretations has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Standards and interpretations already adopted by the EU, but not yet compulsory**\n\n|                                       |                                                                                         | Effective¹ | EVN's consolidated financial statements |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| New standards and interpretations     | IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts                                                             | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n| Revised standards and interpretations | IAS 1 Disclosure of Accounting Policies                                                 | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates                                                | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IAS 12 Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IFRS 17 Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information             | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IAS 12 Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - Pillar Two Model                             | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n\n1) In accordance with IASB, these standards are applicable to financial years beginning on or after the effective date.\n\nThe IASB announced changes to IAS 12 – International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules in May 2023. The changes include a temporary exemption from the required recording and disclosure of information on deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the implementation of the Pillar Two rules.\n\nThe effects of the global minimum tax are currently the subject of analyses, and detailed statements on the concrete effects are therefore not possible at the present time. However, we assume there will be no effect on the consolidated financial statements. EVN regularly monitors and evaluates developments in connection with the global minimum tax. The future application of not yet binding standards and interpretations is also not expected to have a material effect on EVN's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following standards and interpretations had been issued by the IASB as of 30 September 2023, but have not yet been adopted by the EU:\n\n|               | Standards and interpretations not yet applicable and not yet adopted by the EU                                  | Effective1) | Expected material effects<br>on EVN's consolidated<br>financial statements |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               | Revised standards and interpretations                                                                           |             |                                                                            |\n| IAS 1         | Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current                                                         | 01.01.2024  | None                                                                       |\n| IFRS 16       | Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback                                                                         | 01.01.2024  | None                                                                       |\n| IAS 7, IFRS 7 | Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial<br>Instruments (Supplier Finance Arrangements) | 01.01.2024  | None                                                                       |\n| IAS 21        | Accounting in case of Lack of Exchangeability of a Currency                                                     | 01.01.2025  | None                                                                       |\n\n1) In accordance with IASB, these standards are applicable to financial years beginning on or after the effective date.\n\nEVN regularly monitors and analyses the effects of the application of revised standards and interpretations on the future presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the future disclosures in the consolidated notes.\n\n**Expected material effects on**\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\n#### **3. Consolidation methods**\n\nConsolidation is carried out by offsetting the consideration transferred against the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities.\n\nAll significant companies whose financial and operating activities are directly or indirectly controlled by EVN AG (i. e. subsidiaries) are fully consolidated. EVN is considered to have a controlling interest over a company in which it holds an investment when it has a right to variable returns from the investee and can influence the amount of these returns through its control.\n\nThis is usually the case when EVN's voting rights exceed 50.0%, but may also apply if EVN has the power of disposition over and is the primary beneficiary of any economic benefits arising from the business operations of these companies or if EVN is required to carry most of the risks. Companies are initially consolidated on the acquisition date or at the time EVN gains control and are deconsolidated when control ends.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) obtained through business combinations are recognised at their full fair value, irrespective of any existing non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are carried at the proportional share of net assets (excluding the proportional share of goodwill). Intangible assets are recognised separately from goodwill if they can be separated from the acquired company or arise from statutory, contractual or other legal rights. Any remaining positive differences which represent compensation to the seller for market opportunities or developmental potential that cannot be individually identified are recognised in local currency as goodwill and allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) in the relevant segment (for information on the treatment and recoverability of goodwill, see notes **35. Intangible assets** and **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).** Negative differences are recognised in profit or loss after a repeated measurement of the acquired company's identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and measurement of the acquisition cost. The differences between fair value and the carrying amount are carried forward in accordance with the related assets and liabilities during the subsequent consolidation. A change in the investment in a fully consolidated company is accounted for directly in equity without recognition through profit or loss.\n\nJoint arrangements are included in the consolidated financial statements of EVN depending on the rights and obligations attributed to the controlling parties by the respective agreement. If only rights to the net assets are involved, the joint arrangement is classified as a joint venture according to IFRS 11 and included at equity. If rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities are involved, the joint arrangement is classified as a joint operation according to IFRS 11 and included in the consolidated financial statements through line-by-line consolidation.\n\nAssociates – i. e. companies in which EVN AG can directly or indirectly exercise significant influence – are included at equity.\n\nSubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are not consolidated if their influence on EVN's asset, financial and earnings position is considered to be immaterial, either individually or in total. These companies are reported at cost less any necessary impairment losses. The materiality of an investment is assessed on the basis of the balance sheet total, the proportional share of equity, external revenue and annual profit or loss as reported in the last available financial statements in relation to the respective Group totals.\n\nIntragroup receivables, liabilities, income and expenses as well as interim profits and losses are eliminated unless they are immaterial. The consolidation procedure for profit or loss includes the effects of income taxes as well as the recognition of deferred taxes if permissible.\n\n#### **4. Scope of consolidation**\n\nThe scope of consolidation is determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 10. Accordingly, 26 domestic and 28 foreign subsidiaries (including the parent company EVN AG) were fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statements as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: 25 domestic and 27 foreign subsidiaries). A total of ten subsidiaries (previous year: 16) were not consolidated due to their immaterial influence on EVN's asset, financial and earnings position, either individually or in total.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fully consolidated subsidiary EVN Energieservices GmbH (previous year: EVN AG), as the limited partner of EVN KG, participates to 100.0% in the profit or loss of EVN KG. The limited partner changed in connection with intragroup reorganisations during 2022/23 (also see the information on the initial consolidation of EVN Energieservices GmbH). EnergieAllianz serves as the general partner of EVN KG, but does not hold an investment in this company. Based on the agreement with EnergieAllianz regarding the management of EVN KG, there is joint control and EVN KG is therefore classified as a joint venture in the sense of IFRS 11 and consolidated at equity. Contractual agreements also lead to the classification of the EnergieAllianz Group (EnergieAllianz and its subsidiaries) as a joint venture in the sense of IFRS 11; the group is therefore included in the consolidated financial statements at equity.\n\nRBG, a fully consolidated company in which EVN AG has an unchanged interest of 50.03%, holds a 100.0% stake in RAG. RAG is consolidated at equity because contractual agreements prevent EVN from exercising control.\n\nBioenergie Steyr, in which EVN Wärme holds a stake of 51.0%, is included in EVN's consolidated financial statements at equity because contractual agreements exclude any possibility of control.\n\nVerbund Innkraftwerke, Germany, in which EVN AG has an unchanged interest of 13.0%, is included at equity due to special contractual arrangements that allow for the exercise of significant influence.\n\nThe criteria for control defined by IFRS 10 are not considered to be met in companies with an investment of 50.0%. These companies are classified as joint ventures in the sense of IFRS 11 based on the respective contractual agreements and are therefore included in the consolidated financial statements at equity.\n\nAn overview of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements is provided under **EVN's investments,** starting on page 115. Notes **49. Non-controlling interests** and **64. Disclosures of interests in other entities** provide detailed information on the subsidiaries with major non-controlling interests as well as joint ventures and associates that are included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe scope of consolidation (including EVN AG as the parent company) developed as follows during the reporting year:\n\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation | Full consolidation | Equity | Total |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|-------|\n| 30.09.2021                            | 55                 | 16     | 71    |\n| thereof foreign companies             | 29                 | 6      | 35    |\n| Initial consolidation                 | –                  | –      | –     |\n| Deconsolidation                       | -3                 | –      | -3    |\n| 30.09.2022                            | 52                 | 16     | 68    |\n| thereof foreign companies             | 27                 | 6      | 33    |\n| Company acquisition                   | 1                  | –      | 1     |\n| Initial consolidation                 | 2                  | 1      | 3     |\n| Deconsolidation                       | –                  | -2     | -2    |\n| Reorganisation1)                      | -1                 | –      | -1    |\n| 30.09.2023                            | 54                 | 15     | 69    |\n| thereof foreign companies             | 28                 | 5      | 33    |\n\n1) Internal reorganisation\n\nThe 100.0% share in WTE Projektentwicklung GmbH, Maria Enzersdorf, and the 50.0% share in EVN-ECOWIND Sonnenstromerzeugungs GmbH, Maria Enzersdorf, which were previously not consolidated due to immateriality, were included in the consolidated financial statements as of 1 January 2023. WTE Projektentwicklung GmbH has been fully consolidated and EVN-ECOWIND consolidated at equity since 1 January 2023. These two first-time consolidations had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN previously held 50% of the shares in sludge2energy GmbH (s2e), Berching, Germany and included this company in the consolidated financial statements at equity. As of 1 January 2023, EVN acquired the remaining 50% of the shares in s2e and now holds an investment of 100%. The company has therefore been included through full consolidation since 1 January 2023.\n\nThe focus point of business for s2e is the planning, construction and operation of plants for the treatment and utilisation of sludge and residual materials as well as the generation of thermal and electrical energy. The company currently has a newly built thermal sewage sludge utilisation plant in Halle-Lochau, Germany, and is constructing a thermal sewage sludge utilisation plant for a German customer. EVN's objective for the acquisition of s2e by the WTE Group is to expand its market position in the planning and turnkey construction of thermal sewage sludge utilisation plants and to improve and increase the attractiveness of the product portfolio for environmental infrastructure projects in the international project business.\n\nThe fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date on 1 January 2023 is as follows:\n\n| Acquired assets and liabilities                     | Fair value |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                | 01.01.2023 |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment | 12.4       |\n| Other non-current assets                            | 1.3        |\n| Current receivables and other assets1)              | 23.5       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                           | 1.5        |\n| Total fair value of assets                          | 38.7       |\n| Trade payables                                      | -4.4       |\n| Current provisions                                  | -9.3       |\n| Other current liabilities                           | -22.7      |\n| Total fair value of liabilities                     | -36.5      |\n| Net assets                                          | 2.2        |\n| Transferred consideration                           | 2.2        |\n| thereof previous at-equity share (50%)              | 1.1        |\n| thereof consideration acquired share (50%)          | 1.1        |\n| Difference                                          | 0.0        |\n\n1) The carrying amounts of current receivables and other assets represent gross receivables and the fair value as of 1 January 2023.\n\nThe purchase price reflected the fair value of the acquired net assets and was paid entirely in cash. s2e recorded revenue of EUR 27.9m and a result for the period of EUR –5.4m from the acquisition date to 30 September 2023. If the company had been fully consolidated from the beginning of the financial year, it would have increased revenue by EUR 33.0m. The company generated a result before tax of EUR 2.0m in the first quarter of 2022/23. Because s2e reported negative equity as of 30 September 2022, the excess losses could not be recognised to profit or loss.\n\nThis transaction represents a business combination through the successive purchase of shares to attain control. The at equity carrying amount before the business combination equalled EUR 0.0m. The next step involved a revaluation of EUR 1.1m to the existing at equity component at fair value. The gain from this revaluation was reported on the consolidated statement of operations under share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN Energieservices GmbH, Maria Enzersdorf, which was previously not consolidated by EVN due to immateriality, was initially consolidated as of 28 February 2023. EVN AG holds all shares in this company. In connection with internal restructuring following the reorientation of sales activities in the EVN Group, the business unit \"sales and energy-related services\" of the equity accounted EVN KG was subsequently transferred to EVN Energieservices GmbH as of 28 February 2023. In the future, EVN KG will concentrate solely on electricity and natural gas deliveries to end customers and EVN Energieservices GmbH on sales and energy-related services. The transfer of this business unit represents an acquisition of a business as defined in IFRS 3. The consideration for the transfer of the business unit equalled EUR 3.4m.\n\nThe for the first time fully consolidated EVN Energieservices GmbH and the acquired business unit \"sales and energy-related services\" were assigned to the Energy Segment. The identified assets and liabilities of the business unit measured at fair value as of the acquisition date on 28 February 2023 are as follows:\n\n| Acquired assets and liabilities                     | Fair value |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                | 28.02.2023 |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment | 9.7        |\n| Inventories                                         | 3.3        |\n| Current receivables and other assets1)              | 13.3       |\n| <b>Total fair value of assets</b>                   | 26.4       |\n| Non-current provisions                              | -1.7       |\n| Other non-current liabilities                       | -2.3       |\n| Current loans and borrowings                        | -0.4       |\n| Trade payables                                      | -3.2       |\n| Other current liabilities                           | -14.0      |\n| <b>Total fair value of liabilities</b>              | -21.6      |\n| Net assets                                          | 4.7        |\n| Transferred consideration                           | 3.4        |\n| Difference                                          | 1.3        |\n\n1) The fair value of receivables and other assets represents the carrying amounts. Gross receivables, however, totalled EUR 14.7m.\n\nThe component considered uncollectible according to best estimates on the acquisition date therefore equals EUR 1.4m.\n\nThe contribution generated a negative difference of EUR 1.3m for the EVN Group on the acquisition date, which was recorded to profit or loss and is reported under other operating income. The agreed consideration of EUR 3.4m was based on the valuation of the business unit as of 30 September 2022. The gain from the transaction resulted primarily from the actual development of the business unit during the first five months of the 2022/23 financial year.\n\nThis business unit contributed revenue of EUR 20.8m and profit before tax of EUR –9.5m from the acquisition date to 30 September 2023. If the business unit had been included in EVN's consolidated statements from the beginning of the financial year, it would have increased revenue by EUR 42.8m. As the results of EVN KG for the period are included in full under the share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature, there would have been no change in Group result for the period apart from the above-mentioned initial consolidation gain.\n\nThe fully consolidated EVN Kraftwerks- und Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, Maria Enzersdorf, was merged with EVN Wärmekraftwerke GmbH. The merger was recorded in the company register on 10 May 2023.\n\nBiowärme Amstetten-West GmbH, Amstetten, which was previously consolidated at equity, was deconsolidated as of 30 June 2023 due to immateriality. This deconsolidation had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN acquired a telecommunications network from Bauer GmbH & Co KG, Loosdorf, through an asset deal as of 30 September 2023. This network, which services the communities of Loosdorf and Pöchlarn, provides customers with cable television as well as coaxial and glass fibre internet services. The transaction covers the entire business operations together with all its constituent parts, in particular the cable network, including all related plant components, employment relationships, the existing customer base and the processes required for business operations. Consequently, the acquisition represents a business combination as defined in IFRS 3. A purchase price of EUR 2.9m was paid as return consideration.\n\nThe business operations were acquired by kabelplus and allocated to the Networks Segment. The transaction will expand kabelplus' supply area and support connections with new customers. The location of the cable network between Melk and St. Pölten is considered ideal and closes a gap for kabelplus, which already provides internet connectivity.\n\nThe fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the acquisition date on 30 September 2023 are as follows:\n\n| Acquired assets and liabilities      | Fair value |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| EURm                                 | 30.09.2023 |\n| Intangible assets                    | 1.2        |\n| Property, plant and equipment        | 1.9        |\n| Current receivables and other assets | 0.1        |\n| Total fair value of assets           | 3.1        |\n| Other liabilities                    | 0.1        |\n| Total fair value of liabilities      | 0.1        |\n| Net assets                           | 3.0        |\n| Transferred consideration            | 2.9        |\n| Difference                           | 0.1        |\n\nThe acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included by carrying forward the fair values determined as of the acquisition date. These determined values should be seen as preliminary in accordance with IFRS 3 due to uncertainty.\n\nIn connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation under IFRS 3, the existing customer base was identified as an intangible asset to be recognised separately. The value of the customer base was calculated by applying the residual value method based on future earnings and expenses that could be allocated to the customer base. The fair value of the customer base equalled EUR 1.2m as of 30 September 2023 and will be amortised over a useful life of eight years.\n\nThe acquired current receivables did not include any receivables that are likely to be uncollectible. Consequently, the carrying amount represents the fair value.\n\nIf the business operations had been acquired as of 1 October 2022, they would have increased revenue by EUR 1.1m and the result after tax by EUR 0.3m.\n\nThe transaction led to a minor negative difference of less than EUR 0.1m, which resulted primarily from the negotiating positions of the involved parties.\n\nThere were no other IFRS 3 business combinations in the reporting period.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **5. Foreign currency translation**\n\nAll Group companies record their foreign currency business transactions at the mid exchange rate in effect on the date of the relevant transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the mid exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting foreign currency gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss. The exchange rate applied to the initial recognition of an asset, expense or income is derived from the date on which a company initially recognises the related non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, the annual financial statements of Group companies that are prepared in a foreign currency are translated into euros for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. This translation is based on the functional currency method, under which the assets and liabilities of companies not reporting in euros are converted at the mid exchange rate on the balance sheet date and any income and expenses are converted at the average annual rate. Unrealised currency translation differences from long-term Group loans are recorded under the currency translation reserve in equity without recognition in profit or loss. Currency translation differences directly recognised in equity resulted in a change to equity of EUR –15.9m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 31.3m). Of this amount, EUR 0.0m (previous year: EUR –2.1m) is attributable to transfers to the consolidated statement of operations from partial disposals (redemptions) of net investments and is reported as exchange rate losses in the other financial result (see note **32. Financial results).**\n\nAdditions and disposals are reported at the applicable average exchange rates in all tables. Changes in the mid exchange rates between the balance sheet date for the reporting year and the previous year as well as differences arising from the use of mid exchange rates to translate changes during the financial year are reported separately under currency translation differences in all tables.\n\nGoodwill resulting from the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries is recorded at the exchange rate in effect on the acquisition date. This goodwill is subsequently allocated to the acquired company and translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. When a foreign company is deconsolidated, any related currency differences are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe following key exchange rates were used for foreign currency translation:\n\n| Foreign currency translation | 2022/23                                    |           | 2021/22                                    |           |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Currency                     | Exchange rate on the<br>balance sheet date | Average1) | Exchange rate on the<br>balance sheet date | Average1) |\n| Albanian lek                 | 106.68000                                  | 112.01423 | 116.59500                                  | 120.14423 |\n| Bulgarian lev2)              | 1.95583                                    | 1.95583   | 1.95583                                    | 1.95583   |\n| Bahrain dinar                | 0.39950                                    | 0.40042   | 0.36775                                    | 0.40878   |\n| Japanese yen                 | 158.11000                                  | 148.73692 | 140.99500                                  | 134.31769 |\n| Croatian kuna3)              | –                                          | 7.53476   | 7.52415                                    | 7.53292   |\n| Kuwaiti dinar                | 0.32740                                    | 0.32669   | 0.30215                                    | 0.33036   |\n| North Macedonian denar       | 61.50160                                   | 61.58384  | 61.49500                                   | 61.63175  |\n| Polish zloty                 | 4.62775                                    | 4.61934   | 4.84870                                    | 4.66853   |\n| Russian rouble               | 103.18475                                  | 83.21165  | 59.62660                                   | 78.11961  |\n\n1) Average of the exchange rates on the last day of each month\n\n2) The exchange rate was determined by Bulgarian law.\n\n3) Accession to the euro currency area on 1 January 2023\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n#### **6. Intangible assets**\n\nAcquired intangible assets are recognised at acquisition cost less straight-line amortisation and any impairment losses, unless their useful life is classified as indefinite. Assets with a determinable limited useful life are amortised on the basis of that expected useful life, which as in the previous year, equals three to eight years for software and three to 40 years for rights. Customer relationships capitalised in connection with a business acquisition, which have a determinable useful life because of potential market liberalisation, are amortised on a straight-line basis over five to 15 years. The expected useful lives and amortisation curves are determined by estimating the timing and distribution of cash inflows from the corresponding intangible assets over time. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are measured at cost and tested annually for impairment (see note **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).**\n\nInternally generated intangible assets must meet the requirements of IAS 38 in order to be capitalised. This standard distinguishes between research and development expenses.\n\nService concessions that meet the requirements of IFRIC 12 are classified as intangible assets. Expenses and income are recognised according to the percentage of completion method at the fair value of the compensation received. The percentage of completion is assessed according to the cost-to-cost method. The requirements defined in IFRIC 12 are currently met by the Ashta hydropower plant as well as the sewage treatment plant project in Zagreb, both of which are included at equity.\n\n#### **7. Property, plant and equipment**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition or production cost less scheduled straight-line depreciation and any necessary impairment losses. The acquisition or production cost also includes the estimated expenses for demolition and disposal if there is an obligation to decommission or demolish the plant and equipment or to restore property at the end of the asset's useful life. The present value of the estimated demolition and/or disposal costs is capitalised along with the acquisition or production cost and also recognised as a liability (provision). Production costs for internally generated fixed assets include appropriate material and manufacturing overheads in addition to direct material and labour costs.\n\nOngoing maintenance and repairs to property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss, provided this work does not change the nature of the asset or lead to additional future benefits. If these measures enhance the value of the respective asset, the related expenses must be capitalised retroactively as part of the acquisition or production cost.\n\nIf the construction of property, plant and equipment continues over an extended period of time, these items are classified as \"qualifying assets\". The borrowing costs incurred during the construction period are then capitalised as a part of the production cost in accordance with IAS 23. In keeping with EVN's accounting policies, a project gives rise to a qualifying asset only if construction takes at least twelve months. Interest on borrowed capital is not capitalised if the amounts are insignificant over the entire construction phase.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are depreciated from the time they are available for use. Depreciation for property, plant and equipment subject to wear and tear is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the relevant asset or its components. The expected economic and technical life is evaluated at each balance sheet date and adjusted if necessary.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs in the previous year, straight-line depreciation is based on the following useful lives, which are uniform throughout the Group:\n\n| Expected useful life of property, plant and equipment | Years |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Buildings                                             | 10–50 |\n| Transmission lines and pipelines                      | 15–50 |\n| Machinery                                             | 10–50 |\n| Meters                                                | 5–40  |\n| Tools and equipment                                   | 3–25  |\n\nWhen property, plant and equipment are sold, the acquisition or production cost and accumulated depreciation are reported as a disposal. The difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the carrying amount are recognised in other operating income or expenses.\n\nSome leases include extension and cancellation options which are used by EVN to achieve maximum operating flexibility in the assets used by the Group. The determination of the contract term includes all facts and circumstances which could represent an economic incentive for the exercise of an extension option or the non-exercise of a cancellation option.\n\nEVN evaluates at the beginning of the contract term whether a contract establishes a lease. If a lease is involved, a right of use and corresponding lease liability are recognised. The amount of the right of use represents the amount of the lease liability on the contract's initial recognition date, with an adjustment for any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, payments at or before the beginning of the lease relationship, lease incentives and/or dismantling obligations. The carrying amount of the lease liability is determined by discounting the payments expected during the lease, the expected payments from issued residual value guarantees, the exercise prices for purchase options (if their exercise is sufficiently probable) and any payments for premature cancellation of the contract (if probable).\n\n#### **8. Investments in equity accounted investees**\n\nInvestments in equity accounted investees are initially recognised at cost. In subsequent periods, the carrying amounts of these investments are adjusted by the share of profit or loss attributable to EVN, less any dividends received, and by EVN's share of other comprehensive income and any other changes in equity. Investments accounted for according to the equity method are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 if there are any indications of a loss in value (see note **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).**\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature is reported as part of results from operating activities (EBIT). The share of results from equity accounted investees with financial nature is reported as part of financial results (see notes **30. Share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature, 32. Financial results** and **64. Disclosures of interests in other entities).**\n\n#### **9. Financial instruments**\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one company and a financial liability or an equity instrument in another company.\n\n#### **Primary financial instruments**\n\nPrimary financial instruments are measured in accordance with the rules defined by IFRS 9. Initial recognition is based on fair value as of the settlement date, including transaction costs, unless the financial instruments are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Primary financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when EVN is contractually entitled to receive payment or other financial assets from another party.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing the initial application of IFRS 9, EVN has classified its financial assets under the following measurement categories since 1 October 2018:\n\n- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\n- Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n- At amortised cost (AC)\n\nThe classification of financial assets on initial recognition is based on the business model and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.\n\nA financial asset is classified at amortised cost (AC) when it is held to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist entirely of interest and principal payments on the outstanding amount. EVN holds loans receivable, trade receivables, remaining other noncurrent assets, cash on hand and cash at banks within the framework of a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows. Consequently, the cash flow criterion is also met and the financial assets are classified at amortised cost (AC).\n\nThe non-current and current securities held by EVN are held within a business model whose objective is neither to collect contractual cash flows nor to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. These securities are classified at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Derivative financial assets (outside hedge accounting) must be classified at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) (see Derivative financial instruments).\n\nInvestments in equity instruments are generally measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). However, EVN decided, at the time IFRS 9 was initially applied, to exercise the \"FVOCI option\" provided by IFRS 9.5.7.5 and classify all its equity instruments irrevocably at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nFinancial liabilities are still classified under the following measurement categories:\n\n- Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n- At amortised cost (AC)\n\nSubsequent measurement is based on the classification to the measurement categories listed above and the rules applicable to the individual categories. These rules are described in the notes to the individual items on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe introduction of IFRS 9 led to the application at the time of initial recognition of the expected credit loss model (ECL) to debt instruments carried at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, lease receivables and contractual assets as defined in IFRS 15. Under the ECL model, impairment losses are not only recognised for losses which have already occurred but also for expected future credit losses. The related classification is based on a three-stage impairment model. When a financial asset is initially recognised, a loss allowance must be determined for the credit losses expected to occur within one year (risk category 1). Any significant deterioration in the debtor's credit standing leads to the extension of this timeframe to the full term of the financial asset (risk category 2). An impaired credit standing or actual default by the debtor results in reclassification to risk category 3. The criteria for the transfer between risk categories are based on EVN's internal rating system.\n\nEVN determines the expected future credit loss by multiplying the \"probability of default (PoD)\" with the carrying amount of the financial asset \"exposure at default (EAD)\" and the actual loss resulting from customer default \"loss given default (LGD)\".\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn contrast to the above-mentioned ECL model, the simplified approach does not include the measurement of the twelve-month expected credit loss but only the lifetime expected credit loss. A simplified approach must be applied to trade receivables and IFRS 15 contractual assets without a significant financing component. An option is also available to apply the simplified approach to trade receivables and IFRS 15 contractual assets with a significant financing component. EVN uses this option. The option to apply the simplified approach in accordance with IFRS 16 to lease receivables is not applied.\n\nEVN uses the practical expedient defined by IFRS 9.B5.5.35 for trade receivables and measures the expected credit loss with a provision matrix (also see note **13. Trade and other receivables).**\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments**\n\nThe main instruments used by EVN to manage and limit existing exchange rate and interest rate risks in the financial sector are foreign currency and interest rate swaps. EVN uses swaps, futures and forwards to limit energy sector risks arising from changes in commodity and product prices.\n\nThe forward and futures contracts concluded by EVN for the purchase or sale of electricity, natural gas, coal and CO2 emission certificates serve to hedge the purchase prices for expected electricity and natural gas deliveries or CO2 emission certificates as well as the selling prices for planned electricity production. If physical delivery is based on the expected procurement, sale or usage requirements, the criteria for the so-called \"own use exemption\" are met. The contracts are then not considered derivative financial instruments in terms of IFRS 9, but represent pending purchase and sale transactions, which must be assessed for possible impending losses from pending transactions in accordance with IAS 37. If the requirements for the own use exemption are not met – for example, by transactions for short-term optimisation – the contracts are recorded as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9. Corresponding expenses and income from such derivative financial instruments are reported under results from operating activities.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value, which generally reflects the acquisition cost, when the respective contract is concluded and measured at fair value in subsequent periods. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined on the basis of quoted market prices, information provided by banks or discounting-based valuation methods whereby the counterparty risk is also included. Positive fair values are recorded as receivables from derivative transactions (under other non-current assets or under current receivables and other assets, depending on the term). In contrast, negative fair values are recorded as liabilities from derivative transactions (under other non-current liabilities or under other current liabilities, depending on the term). For counterparties with a master agreement that includes a so-called netting clause, the positive and negative fair values are presented as net amounts for the respective time periods when net settlement is planned (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\nEVN has designated significant parts of the listed derivatives as hedges within the framework of hedge accounting. The requirements defined by IFRS 9 for this designation include an approved underlying transaction or hedging instrument, the formal designation and documentation of the hedge relationship, an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedge as well as an appropriately documented hedging strategy.\n\nCash flow hedges are used to hedge the interest rate risks arising from financial liabilities and foreign exchange risks and to hedge the price risk from planned future electricity sales. At the beginning of the designated hedge relationship, the Group documents the risk management goals and strategies to be followed with regard to the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument as well as expectations as to whether the changes in the cash flows from the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recognised under other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of the changes in fair value, which is recorded under other comprehensive income, is limited to the cumulative change in the fair value of the underlying transaction (based on present value) since the beginning of the hedge. Any ineffective parts of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately to profit or loss.\n\nIf an expected hedged transaction subsequently leads to the recognition of a non-financial item, e. g. inventories, the accumulated amount from the hedging reserve and the reserve for hedging costs is included in the acquisition cost of the non-financial item, if it is recognised.\n\nFor all other expected hedged transactions, the accumulated amount in the hedging reserve and the reserve for hedging costs is reclassified to profit or loss of the period or periods in which the expected future hedged cash flows influence profit or loss. If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or if the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is terminated prospectively. A so-called \"rebalancing\" is generally carried out when the framework conditions change, and the hedge is only terminated when this is not possible. When cash flow hedge accounting is terminated, the amount in the hedging reserve remains in equity until it is included in the acquisition cost of a non-financial item on initial recognition (for hedging transactions that lead to the recognition of a non-financial item) or until it is reclassified to profit or loss of the period or periods in which the expected hedged future cash flows influence profit or loss (for other cash flow hedges).\n\nIf the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, the amounts in the hedging reserve and the reserve for hedging costs are reclassified immediately to profit or loss.\n\nThe accounting treatment of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used for hedging purposes depends on the type of the hedging transaction.\n\nFair value hedges are used to hedge currency risks (also see notes **61. Risk managment** and **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\nDerivative financial instruments classified as fair value hedges under IFRS 9 serve to hedge recognised assets or liabilities against the risk of a change in fair value. For fair value hedges, the recognition in profit or loss includes the change in the fair value of the derivative as well as the contrasting change in the fair value of the underlying transaction, as far as it reflects the hedged risk. The related earnings are generally reported under the same position in the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying transaction. Changes in the value of the hedges are essentially offset by the changes in the value of the hedged transactions.\n\nThe derivatives used by EVN for hedging purposes constitute effective protection. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by compensating changes in the underlying transactions.\n\n#### **10. Other investments**\n\nOther investments include, in addition to other investments, shares in associated companies which are not included in the consolidated financial statements due to immateriality. These shares are recorded at cost less any necessary impairment losses. The other investments were classified irrevocably at fair value through other comprehensive income (\"FVOCI option\") in accordance with IFRS 9.5.7.5 following the introduction of IFRS 9. The fair value of these investments is based on available information and derived from market quotations, discounted cash flow calculations or the multiplier method. The measurement and deconsolidation results from these equity instruments are recorded under other comprehensive income. Dividends received are still reported on the consolidated statement of operations under income from investments, despite the use of this option (also see note **32. Financial results).** \n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **11. Other non-current assets**\n\nSecurities recorded under other non-current assets are initially recognised as FVTPL. These assets are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and subsequently measured at fair value as of the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nLoans receivable are classified as AC, whereby the carrying amount on the acquisition date corresponds to the fair value. These loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost in keeping with the effective interest rate method and also reflect any necessary impairment losses.\n\nLease receivables arise from the international project business in the Environment Segment. They are classified as finance leases according to IFRS 16.\n\nReceivables arising from derivative transactions are recognised as FVTPL. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of operations or in other comprehensive income (see note **9. Financial instruments).**\n\nThe measurement of the remaining non-current assets is based on acquisition or production cost or the lower net realisable value on the balance sheet date.\n\nCosts incurred for obtaining a contract are capitalised as an asset when EVN assumes these costs can be recovered. The capitalised costs are amortised on a systematic basis depending on how the goods or services are transferred to the customer.\n\n#### **12. Inventories**\n\nThe measurement of inventories is based on acquisition or production cost or the lower net realisable value as of the balance sheet date. For marketable inventories, these values are derived from the current market price. For other inventories, these figures are based on the expected proceeds less future production costs. Risks arising from the length of storage or reduced marketability are reflected in experience-based reductions. The moving average price method is used to determine the consumption of primary energy inventories as well as raw materials, auxiliary materials and fuels.\n\nThe inventories of natural gas held by EVN for trading purposes are measured through profit or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. In accordance with the dealer-broker exception for raw material and commodities traders, measurement is based on fair value less costs to sell. This represents the market price for day-ahead deliveries on the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH).\n\n#### **13. Trade and other receivables**\n\nCurrent receivables are generally recorded at amortised cost, which equals the acquisition cost less impairment losses for the components of the receivables that are expected to be uncollectible. EVN applies the practical expedient provided by IFRS 9.B5.5.35 to trade receivables and determines the expected credit loss with a provision matrix. The input factors for the matrix include analyses of default incidents in previous financial years based on different regional characteristics for the core markets. The expected credit losses determined by the matrix are ranked by the time (over)due based on historical default rates and subsequently written off through profit or loss. The compiled information is reviewed annually, and the default rates are adjusted if necessary. All other receivables are accounted for in accordance with the ECL model (also see note **9. Financial instruments).**\n\nAmortised costs, less any applicable impairment losses, can be considered appropriate estimates of the current value because the remaining term to maturity is generally less than one year.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nExceptions to the above procedure are receivables arising from derivative transactions which are recognised at fair value, and foreign currency items, which are measured at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date.\n\nContract assets consist primarily of the Group's claims to consideration for performance on contract orders from the project business, in cases where the performance was completed but not yet invoiced as of the balance sheet date. Contract assets are reclassified to receivables when the rights become unconditional. This generally occurs when the Group issues an invoice to the customer.\n\n#### **14. Securities**\n\nCurrent securities, which consist mainly of investment certificates, are classified as FVTPL and measured at their fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n#### **15. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash balances in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date.\n\nIn accordance with internal Group guidelines, EVN invests cash and cash equivalents only with reputable financial institutions with good ratings. In this respect, it is assumed that cash and cash equivalents based on the external rating of banks and financial institutions have a low risk of default.\n\n#### **16. Assets and liabilities held for sale**\n\nNon-current assets as well as disposal groups that contain assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale when their sale is highly likely.\n\nThese assets and disposal groups are generally carried at the lower of their respective carrying amount and fair value less disposal costs. Any necessary recognition of an impairment loss to a disposal group is initially allocated to goodwill and, thereafter, to the remaining assets and liabilities on a proportional basis. Impairment losses resulting from the initial classification as held for sale as well as later gains and losses on revaluation are recognised to profit or loss.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised, respectively depreciated once they have been classified as held for sale.\n\n#### **17. Equity**\n\nIn contrast to borrowings, equity is defined by the IFRS framework as the \"residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities\". Equity is thus the residual value of a company's assets and liabilities.\n\nTreasury shares held by EVN are not recognised as securities pursuant to IAS 32, but are instead reported at their (repurchase) acquisition cost and offset against equity. Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of treasury shares relative to the acquisition cost increases or decreases capital reserves.\n\nThe items recorded under other comprehensive income include certain changes in equity that are not recognised through profit or loss as well as the related deferred taxes. For example, this position contains the currency translation reserve, valuation results from equity instruments (FVOCI), the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges as well as all remeasurements according to IAS 19. This item also includes the proportional share of gains and losses recognised directly in equity accounted investees.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **18. Provisions**\n\n#### **Personnel provisions**\n\nThe projected unit credit method is used to determine the provisions for pensions and similar obligations as well as severance payments. The expected pension payments are distributed according to the number of years of service by employees until retirement, taking expected future increases in salaries and pensions into account.\n\nThe amounts of the provisions are determined by an actuary as of each balance sheet date based on an expert opinion. The measurement principles are described in note **52. Non-current provisions.** All remeasurements – at EVN, only gains and losses from changes in actuarial assumptions – are recognised under other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe applied interest rate is based on the market yields for first-class, fixed-interest industrial bonds as of the balance sheet date, whereby the maturities of the benefits were taken into account.\n\nThe service cost added to the provision is reported under personnel expenses, while the interest component of the addition is included under financial results.\n\n#### **Provisions for pensions and pension-related obligations**\n\nThe calculation of the provisions for pensions, as in the previous year, was based on the Austrian mortality tables \"AVÖ 2018-P – Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung\", which were issued by the Actuarial Association Austria (AVÖ) on 15 August 2018.\n\nUnder the terms of a company agreement, EVN AG is required to pay a supplementary pension on retirement to employees who joined the company prior to 31 December 1989. This commitment also applies to employees who, within the context of the legal unbundling agreement for the spin-off of the electricity and natural gas networks, are now employed by Netz Niederösterreich. The amount of this supplementary pension is based on performance as well as on the length of service and the amount of remuneration at retirement. EVN, in any case, and the employees, as a rule, also make contributions to the umbrella pension fund VBV Pensionskasse AG (VBV) and the resulting claims are fully credited toward pension payments. Therefore, EVN's obligations toward both retired employees and prospective beneficiaries are covered in part by provisions for pensions as well as by defined contribution payments on the part of VBV.\n\nFor employees who joined the company after 1 January 1990, the supplementary company pension was replaced by a defined contribution plan that is financed through VBV. VBV is responsible for the investment of the pension plan assets. Pension commitments were also made to certain employees, which require EVN to pay retirement benefits under certain conditions.\n\nProvisions for pension-related obligations were recognised for liabilities arising from the vested claims of current employees and the current claims of retired personnel and their dependents to receive benefits in kind in the form of electricity and natural gas.\n\n#### **Provision for severance payments**\n\nAustrian corporations are required by law to make one-off severance payments to employees whose employment began before 1 January 2003 if they are dismissed, in case of dissolution of the employment relationship by mutual consent or when they reach the legal retirement age. The amount of such payments is based on the number of years of service and the amount of the respective employee's remuneration at the time the severance payment is made.\n\nEmployees in Bulgaria and North Macedonia are entitled to severance payments on retirement, which are based on the number of years of service. With regard to severance compensation entitlements, the other EVN employees are covered by similar social protection measures contingent on the legal, economic and tax framework of the country in which they work.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe obligation to make one-off severance payments to employees of Austrian companies whose employment commenced after 31 December 2002 has been transferred to a defined contribution plan. The payments to this external employee fund are reported under personnel expenses.\n\n#### **Other provisions**\n\nThe other provisions reflect all recognisable legal or factual commitments to third parties based on past events, where the amount of the commitments and/or the precise starting point was still uncertain. In these cases, a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation is required. If a reliable estimate is not possible, a provision is not recognised. These provisions are recognised at the discounted settlement amount. They are measured based on the expected value or the amount most likely to be incurred.\n\nRisk-free interest rates are used for the discount rates. If the risks and uncertainties in cash flows cannot be taken into consideration adequately, an adapted discount rate is used.\n\nThe provisions for service anniversary bonuses required by collective wage and company agreements are measured using the same parameters as the provisions for pensions and similar obligations. A new regulation in the collective agreement for salaried employees of Austrian utility companies entitles salaried employees whose employment relationship began after 31 December 2009 to a service anniversary bonus equalling one month's salary after 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 years and to one-half month's salary after 40 years. This was taken into account accordingly. All remeasurements – at EVN, only gains and losses from changes in actuarial assumptions – involving service anniversary bonuses are recognised through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 19. The service cost added to the provision is reported under personnel expenses, while the interest component of the addition is included under financial results.\n\nWaste disposal and land restoration requirements resulting from legal and perceived commitments are recorded at the present value of the expected future costs. Changes in the estimated costs or the interest rate are offset against the carrying amount of the underlying asset. If the decrease in a provision exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the difference is recognised through profit or loss. The related depreciation is corrected in accordance with the residual carrying amount and depreciated over the remaining useful life. If the asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes to the provisions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised at the amount of the unavoidable outflow of resources. This represents the lower of the amount that would result from performance of the contract and any compensatory payments to be made in the event of non-performance.\n\n#### **19. Liabilities**\n\nLiabilities are reported at amortised cost, with the exception of liabilities arising from derivative financial instruments or liabilities arising from hedge accounting (see note **9. Financial instruments).** Costs for the procurement of funds are considered part of amortised cost. Non-current liabilities are discounted by applying the effective interest method.\n\nWith respect to financial liabilities, bullet loans and borrowings with a remaining term to maturity of over one year are classified as noncurrent and items with a remaining term to maturity of less than one year are reported under current loans and borrowings (for information on maturities see note **50. Non-current loans and borrowings).**\n\nIf the fulfilment of a liability is expected within twelve months after the balance sheet date, the liability is classified as current. Network subsidies – which constitute payments made by customers to cover previous investments by EVN in the upstream network – represent an offset to the acquisition cost of these assets. In the electricity and natural gas network business, they are related to supply obligations by EVN. The granting of investment subsidies generally requires an operational management structure that complies with legal requirements and has been approved by the authorities.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nNetwork and investment subsidies represent an offset to the acquisition or production cost of the related asset and, in accordance with the application of IAS 20 and IFRS 15, are recognised as liabilities. Network and investment subsidies are released on a straight-line basis over the average useful life of the respective assets. The release of network subsidies from the regulated business is reported under other operating income, while comparable items from the non-regulated business are reported under revenue (also see notes **2. Reporting in accordance with IFRS** and **20. Revenue recognition).**\n\nA contract liability must be reported when consideration (e. g. a prepayment) has been transferred by the customer and the company has not yet provided goods or services. In the EVN Group, this generally takes place in connection with prepayments from the international project business.\n\n#### **20. Revenue recognition**\n\nIFRS 15 provides a five-step model for the recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. Under this model, revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control over a good or service is transferred to the customer. A determination must therefore be made when a contract is concluded as to whether the resulting revenue should be recognised at a specific point in time or over time.\n\nRevenue in the EVN Group results primarily from the sale (energy deliveries) and distribution (network utilisation/network services) of electricity, natural gas, heat and water to industrial, household and commercial customers. The EVN Group also generates revenue from waste utilisation, telecommunications and the international project business. The provision of goods and services by the EVN Group generally takes place over a specific time period, and revenue is therefore recognised over time.\n\nThe major services are described below:\n\n#### **Energy deliveries**\n\nRevenue results primarily from the transfer of electricity, natural gas, heat and water. Since the customer uses these services as they are provided, revenue is recognised over time. Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the services provided and entitled to be invoiced by EVN. In particular for household customers who only receive one invoice per year, the variable consideration is determined by extrapolating the energy consumption based on usage profiles and current temperature trends. The payment terms for energy deliveries generally represent 14 days. There is no significant financing component.\n\n#### **Network utilisation and services**\n\nEVN supplies electricity, natural gas, heat and water to its customers within the framework of network usage. The related performance obligation lies, above all, in the continuous provision and availability of energy through the network infrastructure. Revenue from these services is also recognised over time and when the services are provided, as described above. The payment terms for network usage generally represent 14 days. There is no significant financing component.\n\nNetwork subsidies constitute payments made by customers to cover previous investments by EVN in the upstream network, to the extent they represent compensation for granting usage or purchase rights. Network subsidies in the regulated electricity and natural gas business, where the regulator determines the amount and underlying reason, are recognised as liabilities in accordance with IAS 20 and reported, as in the past, under other operating income as income from the reversal of deferred income from network subsidies. The network subsidies for all other areas are recorded as non-refundable advance payments (liabilities) in accordance with IFRS 15 and have been released to profit or loss under other revenue since 2018/19 (also see note **2. Reporting in accordance with IFRS).**\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **International project business**\n\nRevenue from the international project business is also recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method as defined by IFRS 15. Projects are characterised by individual contract conditions with fixed prices and payments which follow a fixed schedule. If the construction services provided exceed the amount of the payment, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments are higher than the construction services provided, a contract liability is recorded. The percentage of completion is determined by the cost-to-cost method, which calls for the recognition of revenue and contract results in relation to actually incurred production costs as a per cent of the expected total costs. Reliable estimates of the total costs for the contracts, selling prices and incurred costs are available. Any changes in the estimated total contract costs and possible resulting losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period incurred. The technological and financial risks which could occur during the remaining term of a project are included through individual estimates and an appropriate amount is added to the expected total costs. Impending losses from the valuation of projects not yet invoiced are expensed immediately. These losses are realised when it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed the contract revenue. In the case that customers terminate the contract for reasons other than the non-fulfilment of the service promised by the company, EVN has a legal claim that at least the expenses incurred plus the lost profit margin will be reimbursed.\n\n#### **Other**\n\nEVN also generates revenue from telecommunications, waste utilisation and energy services. Most of the related contracts include services which are consumed by the customer as they are provided, and this revenue is also recognised over time. Revenue from waste utilisation is recognised at a point in time.\n\nInterest income is recorded pro rata temporis using the effective interest rate applicable to the particular asset. Dividends are recognised when a legal entitlement to payment arises.\n\nThe costs for obtaining contracts are expensed as incurred if the amortisation period for the related asset equals one year or less. Significant financing components are not included when the period between the transfer to the customer of the promised good or service and payment by the customer is less than one year.\n\n#### **Significant judgments related to revenue recognition**\n\nConsumption-based fees for energy deliveries and network utilisation represent variable consideration, which is determined according to the expected value method defined by IFRS 15.53a. Meter-reading dates are spread over the entire year, especially for household customers with rolling invoices. The volumes of energy consumed during the period between the last meter-reading and the balance sheet date must be extrapolated with statistical methods and therefore estimated. The procedure used by EVN assigns each customer to a standard consumption profile in the form of an annual consumption curve for electricity and/or natural gas and extrapolates each customer individually.\n\nIn the international project business, the percentage of completion is decisive for the recognition of revenue. Progress on the respective projects is determined by an input-based method (cost-to-cost method). This method requires numerous estimates and judgmental decisions, above all for the identification of incurred costs, total contract costs and realisable contract revenue as well as the related contract risks (technical, political and financial risks). These estimates are reviewed regularly and adjusted if necessary.\n\n#### **21. Income taxes and deferred taxes**\n\nThe income tax expense reported in the consolidated statement of operations comprises the current income tax expense for fully consolidated companies, which is based on their taxable income and the applicable income tax rate, as well as the change in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following income tax rates were applied in calculating current income taxes:\n\n| Corporate income tax rates |           |           |\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| %                          | 2022/23   | 2021/22   |\n| Country of residence       |           |           |\n| Austria                    | 24.0      | 25.0      |\n| Albania                    | 15.0      | 15.0      |\n| Bulgaria                   | 10.0      | 10.0      |\n| Germany1)                  | 31.2–32.6 | 31.2–32.6 |\n| Croatia                    | 18.0      | 18.0      |\n| Kuwait                     | 15.0      | 15.0      |\n| Lithuania                  | 15.0      | 15.0      |\n| North Macedonia            | 10.0      | 10.0      |\n| Montenegro                 | 9.0       | 9.0       |\n| Poland                     | 19.0      | 19.0      |\n| Romania                    | 16.0      | 16.0      |\n| Russia                     | 20.0      | 20.0      |\n| Slovenia                   | 19.0      | 19.0      |\n| Czech Republic             | 19.0      | 19.0      |\n| Cyprus                     | 12.5      | 12.5      |\n\n1) The tax rate varies slightly depending on the applicable assessment rate for trade tax.\n\nEVN utilised the corporate tax group option as of 30 September 2023. EVN AG is a member of a participation entity with NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH as the majority participating company and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH as the minority participating company. A group and tax settlement contract was concluded for this purpose. EVN also has the right to designate other corporate entities as members of this tax group.\n\nThe taxable profit of the companies belonging to this group is attributable to EVN AG, which calculates combined results based on the attributed taxable profit. The contract calls for the payment of a positive tax charge, when the aggregated results are positive. As in the previous year, the positive aggregated tax result is based on the allocation method. If the aggregated results are negative, the tax losses are kept on record and offset against future positive results. The related disclosures are reported under income taxes. The transfer of losses from foreign subsidiaries within group taxation leads to the recognition of a liability equal to the nominal amount of the future corporate income tax obligation.\n\nAs an offset for the transferred taxable results, the tax group contracts include a tax charge that is based on the stand-alone method. Transferred tax losses are kept on record as internal loss carryforwards for the respective tax group members and offset against future positive earnings. An exception to this procedure is the contract concluded with Burgenland Holding, which calls for a negative tax charge for this company if its taxable results are negative and the group's total results are positive. In other cases, the loss is recorded as an internal loss carryforward and refunded in later years in the form of a negative tax charge as soon as it is covered by positive earnings.\n\nFuture changes in the tax rate are taken into account if the relevant law has been enacted by the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. The eco-social tax reform adopted in the 2021/22 financial year, which will reduce the corporate income tax rate by one percentage point to 23% from 2024, is therefore taken into account in the measurement of deferred taxes. These changes were reflected in the valuation of deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are calculated according to the liability method at the tax rate expected when short-term differences are reversed. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are calculated and recognised for all temporary differences (i. e. the difference between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements prepared for tax purposes that will balance out in the future).\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable income or taxable temporary differences to utilise these items. Tax loss carryforwards are recognised as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented as a net amount in the consolidated financial statements if there is a legal right and intention to offset these items.\n\n#### **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests**\n\nEVN carries out its impairment tests in accordance with the rules defined by IAS 36. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment when there are internal or external indications of a loss in value. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are tested at least once each year for signs of impairment.\n\nThe impairment testing of goodwill and assets for which no expected future cash flows can be identified is based on an assessment of the respective cash-generating unit (CGU). The decisive criterion used by EVN to classify a generation unit as a CGU is the technical and commercial ability to generate independent revenue. In the EVN Group, this definition applies to the electricity and heat generation plants, electricity, natural gas and water distribution systems, electricity procurement rights, telecommunications networks and facilities in the environmental services business.\n\nThe value in use is calculated in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. Due to the long-term nature of investments in infrastructure assets, EVN uses cash flow projections that correspond to the economic useful life of the respective assets. Impairment tests for hydropower plants are generally based on the assumption that the concession will be reissued and therefore that the respective sites will exist indefinitely. After a detailed planning period of seven years (previous year: four years), a rough planning period follows for infrastructure facilities/long-term projects until the end of the economic useful life, albeit limited to the period in which external electricity price forecasts are available (currently 2050). As the period of the medium-term planning calculations approved by management was aligned with the Strategy 2030 in the 2022/23 financial year, the detailed planning period was also adjusted to seven years.\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal is basically calculated in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy defined in IFRS 13. Since it is generally not possible to derive market values for the CGUs and assets of EVN under evaluation, the fair value is estimated in accordance with Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value less costs of disposal for a CGU is calculated with a WACC-based discounted cash flow method, which is conceptually similar to the value in use procedure, but includes adjustments to the parameters in the DCF model to reflect a market participant's viewpoint.\n\nThe calculation of the fair value less disposal costs and the value in use is based on the future cash inflows and outflows which are basically derived from internal medium-term forecasts. The cash flow forecasts are based on the latest financial plans approved by management. The underlying assumptions also take climate-related effects into consideration. The assumptions for the future development of electricity prices are derived from the quotations on the futures market of the European Energy Exchange AG, Leipzig, Germany. For the period extending beyond this time, an average is developed from the forecasts issued by two well-known information service providers in the energy sector. Several scenarios are used for averaging. In this way, the risks that may influence electricity prices in the future are taken into account comprehensively.\n\nA weighted average cost of capital which includes the deduction of income tax (WACC) is used as the discount rate. The equity component of the WACC reflects the risk-free interest rate, a country-specific premium plus a risk premium that incorporates the market risk premium and an appropriate beta coefficient based on peer group capital market indicators. The debt component of the WACC equals the basis interest rate plus a country-specific premium and a rating dependent risk premium. The equity and debt components are weighted according to a capital structure that is appropriate for the CGU based on peer group data at market values. The resulting WACC is used to discount the cash flows in the respective CGU.\n\nFor the purpose of estimating the recoverable amount, EVN initially assesses the value in use. In cases where this amount is lower than the carrying amount of the asset, or the CGU, the fair value less costs of disposal is calculated if necessary.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **23. Accounting estimates and forward-looking statements**\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted IFRS accounting methods requires estimates and assumptions that have an effect on the assets, liabilities, income and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements and on the amounts shown in the notes. The actual values may differ from these estimates. The assumptions and estimates are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nIn particular, the following assumptions and estimates can lead to significant adjustments in the carrying amounts of individual assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\nIn the international project business, changes in estimates for the progress on major projects can have a material effect. These estimates are particularly relevant for the large-scale project in Kuwait (construction of a wastewater treatment plant and corresponding sewage network) and the large-scale project in Bahrain (expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant and contruction of a sewage sludge utilisation plant). Revenue is recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method (see notes **20. Revenue recognition** and **25. Revenue).**\n\nImpairment tests require estimates, especially for future cash surpluses. A change in the general economic, industry or company environment may reduce cash surpluses and therefore lead to signs of impairment. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used to determine the recoverable amounts based on capital market methods. The WACC represents the weighted average interest paid by a company for equity and debt. The weighting applied to the interest on the equity and debt components – which reflects a capital structure at market values – was derived from an appropriate peer group. Given the current volatility on the financial markets, the development of the cost of capital (and above all the country risk premiums) is monitored on a regular basis (see note **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).**\n\nFor the valuation of the generation portfolio, the price structure beginning with the fifth year (when predictable market prices are no longer available on the electricity exchanges) was based on average forecasts from two well-known market research institutes and information service providers in the energy sector. The most recent studies, which are updated annually due to the current volatility on the electricity markets, were used in each case. The following notes show the sensitivity of these assumptions for the largest CGUs, based on the carrying amount, where a triggering event was identified and for which an impairment loss or reversal was recognised in the financial statements: **35. Intangible assets, 36. Property, plant and equipment** and **37. Investments in equity accounted investees.**\n\nThe most important premises and judgmental decisions used to determine the scope of consolidation are described under notes **4. Scope of consolidation** and **38. Other investments.**\n\nWTE constructed a wastewater treatment plant in Budva, Republic of Montenegro, with a contract value of EUR 58.5m. The customer, the municipality of Budva, subsequently failed to meet its payment obligations to WTE. Following the issue of reminders and an extension period, WTE cancelled the investment contract in May 2018 but operations were temporarily continued as a goodwill gesture by WTE. All efforts by WTE to reach an agreement on the outstanding payments failed due to a lack of cooperation by the municipality of Budva; in particular, the joint commission installed for this purpose was unable to deliver any results due to a lack of cooperation by the municipality of Budva. In December 2019, WTE therefore called the guarantee issued by the Republic of Montenegro (EUR 29.3m) and the municipality of Budva (EUR 64.6m). The Republic of Montenegro met its payment obligation, but the municipality of Budva refused to make payment. WTE terminated its operation of the plant at the end of January 2020 after multiple notifications and transferred these operations to the municipality of Budva. WTE filed an arbitration action in Frankfurt against the municipality of Budva for failure to honour the guarantee; the value in dispute equalled EUR 37.9m, including interest. The court of arbitration issued a decision in favour of WTE at the beginning of October 2023. The municipality of Budva must therefore honour the guarantee provided to WTE. Moreover, WTE filed an arbitration action in Geneva in spring 2021 against the municipality of Budva for non-fulfilment of the investment contract. The outcome of these proceedings can lead to valuation adjustments in future periods (also see note **61. Risk management).**\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe valuation of the provisions for pensions, pension-related obligations and severance payments are based on assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age and life expectancy as well as pension and salary increases. The adjustment of these parameters in future periods can lead to valuation adjustments. Moreover, future changes in electricity and natural gas tariffs can lead to valuation adjustments in the pension-related obligations (see note **52. Non-current provisions).**\n\nAssumptions and estimates are also required to determine the useful life of non-current assets (see notes **6. Intangible assets** and **7. Property, plant and equipment),** and the provisions for legal proceedings and environmental protection (see note **18. Provisions)** as well as estimates for other obligations and risks (see note **65. Other obligations and risks).** In addition, it is necessary to make assumptions and estimates for the valuation of receivables and inventories (see notes **12. Inventories** and **13. Trade and other receivables)** and for the recognition of revenue (see note **20. Revenue recognition),** as well for the usability of tax carry forwards (see note **51. Deferred taxes).** These estimates are based on historical data and other assumptions considered appropriate under the given circumstances.\n\n#### **Information on climate change**\n\nAs an energy and environmental services provider, EVN is committed to making a concrete contribution to climate protection. The company's strategic considerations include the special requirements created by the energy transformation and the far-reaching changes required by this transformation towards climate neutrality as well as the related effects on all sectors of the economy and on private households. Analyses in this context place a special focus on the requirements for climate protection, possible implementation tracks and the implications for the company's business model. These elements create an important basis for evaluating the opportunities and risks for our business resulting, from climate change and the related, rapidly changing regulations.\n\nEVN terminated electricity generation from hard coal in 2020/21. In summer 2021, the company joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and, in this connection, set five reduction goals for its activities. The EVN Climate Initiative \"EVN for the climate\" was launched in 2020/21 to realise these goals. It includes three focal points: the concrete reduction of CO₂ emissions, climate neutrality in selected group companies, and a contribution by EVN's research and development to climate protection. Success in this area will make an important contribution to realising the climate goal agreed in Paris to limit global warming to clearly below 2°C.\n\nThe majority of EVN's assets are subject to unpredictable weather conditions due to the generation and transmission or distribution technologies in use. This applies, in particular, to the in part exposed generation infrastructure (hydropower and wind power plants, photovoltaic equipment) and also to the transmission and distribution infrastructure. Climate changes can have a lasting influence on the hydropower, wind power and photovoltaic offering over the long term, which could lead to more extreme seasonal and annual deviations in generation. Changing climatic conditions can also lead to different demand-related behaviour. The declining demand for heating products will be accompanied by a greater demand for drinking water. In view of the high priority given to climate protection at EVN, potential climate risks are identified and assessed as part of the central risk management process. The active handling of risks can limit the effects on the company or support the conscious perception of opportunities for additional growth.\n\nThe impact of climate change on the recognition and valuation of assets and liabilities is evaluated at regular intervals. Climate-related earnings fluctuations – whether they result from production differences or changes in demand – are analysed with sensitivity and scenario calculations as part of the planning process and, after approval by management, transferred to the forecast calculations. The measures derived from the EVN Climate Initiative also flow into these calculations which, in total, form the basis for the impairment tests required by IAS 36 (see notes **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests** and **36. Property, plant and equipment).** The risks arising from climate change are also included in the determination of the useful life of depreciable assets (see note **7. Property, plant and equipment),** the measurement of inventories (see note **12. Inventories)** and the recognition and measurement of provisions (see note **18. Provisions).** \n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CO₂ emissions from twelve of our electricity generation and heating supply plants are covered by the EU's emission rights trading scheme (EU-ETS). In accordance with the ETS, we needed 318,582 CO₂ emission certificates in the 2022/23 financial year. The emission certificates required for heat production in Austria were granted free of charge, and the remainder were purchased over the wholesale market (see notes **40. Inventories** and **57. Current provisions).** \n\n#### **Impact of the war in Ukraine**\n\nThe possible effects of the war in Ukraine were evaluated, in particular, with regard to the recoverability of assets as defined by IAS 36 and IFRS 9 and to further uncertainties connected with discretionary assessments.\n\nRussia's assault on Ukraine which began on 24 February 2022 has strained relations between the majority of the international community and the Russian Federation and led to a series of reciprocal sanctions by the EU as well as the Russian Federation. The result was a massive increase in the wholesale prices for electricity and primary energy, which have since stabilised at a level two- to three-times higher than before the crisis. Further developments are uncertain due to the tense situation and can bring an increase in energy prices at any time. Added reciprocal sanctions and/or a possible halt to gas deliveries by Russia could have a significant influence on the energy market and a negative effect on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe possible termination of gas deliveries by Russia could, depending on the timing and duration, have an impact on natural gas supplies for EVN's customers. The volume of non-Russian gas and strategic gas inventories were expanded in view of this possibility. Measures to support supply security are connected with higher costs and can have a negative influence on earnings in individual periods.\n\nThe volatile development of energy prices had a negative effect on earnings in the energy supply business. To protect energy supplies, EVN successively purchased natural gas supplies and concluded futures contracts for electricity. The decline in the market prices for electricity and natural gas subsequently led to negative valuation effects for the recorded natural gas inventories and derivative futures in 2022/23. Provisions were also required for contingent losses from onerous customer contracts (see note **30. Share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature).**\n\nAs a consequence of the political developments in Russia, EVN decided in the previous year to withdraw from this market and to sell the two combined heat and power plants in Moscow. The sale negotiations are currently in the approval process by the Russian government commission (see note **43. Assets and liabilities held for sale).**\n\n#### **Effects of the macroeconomic environment**\n\nEVN evaluated the recoverability of assets as defined by IAS 36 and IFRS 9 and further uncertainties connected with discretionary assessments against the backdrop of the current macroeconomic environment.\n\nEconomic developments have led to a higher number of insolvencies across Europe, especially after the expiration of government subsidy measures. These insolvencies are expected to have a negative effect on the macroeconomic environment and cause an increase in receivables defaults. The EVN Group has included the projected increase in potential default incidents through a forward-looking component, similar to the procedure followed in previous years.\n\nEVN determines the impairment losses for trade receivables in accordance with IFRS 9.B5.5.35 based on regionally differentiated analyses of historical default incidents. The inclusion of the forward-looking component led to an increase of EUR 5.0m in the impairment loss allowance for trade receivables (previous year: EUR 6.1m) (see the section on Credit and default risk under note **61. Risk management).**\n\nApart from price increases on the energy markets and the differing effects on EVN's activities and business fields, investments and operating expenses are also affected by the sharp rise in inflation. These cost increases can possibly only be passed on to customers with a delay. The current macroeconomic developments can also have a – direct and indirect – negative influence on the demand for energy and, together with rising costs, have a negative influence on earnings.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nLow net debt and a comfortable base of contractually committed, undrawn credit lines give EVN a constant, high degree of financial flexibility and solid liquidity reserves. The high energy prices in recent months had a substantial negative impact on earnings from energy supply, while renewable energy generation made a positive contribution to earnings. Stabilising effects were provided, above all, by EVN's integrated business model and widely diversified customer portfolio. The EVN Group can therefore be considered a going concern.\n\n#### **24. Principles of segment reporting**\n\nThe identification of operating segments is based on the internal organisational and reporting structure and information prepared for internal management decisions (the \"management approach\"). The Executive Board of the EVN Group (the chief operating decisionmaker as defined in IFRS 8) reviews internal management reports on each operating segment at least once each quarter. EVN has defined the following operating segments: Generation, Energy, Networks, South East Europe, Environment and All Other Segments. This conforms in full to the internal reporting structure. The assessment of all segment information is consistent with the IFRS. EBITDA is used as an indicator to measure the earning power of the individual segments. For each segment, EBITDA represents the total net operating profit or loss before interest, taxes, amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment for the companies included in the segment, taking intragroup income and expenses into account (see note **59. Notes to segment reporting).**\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Notes to the consolidated statement of operations\n\n#### **25. Revenue**\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. The consideration is recognised in the amount that the company expects to receive in exchange for these goods or services.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, EVN generates other revenue from its ordinary business activities. This revenue is presented separately in the following table:\n\n| Revenue                               |         |         |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                  | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Revenue from contracts with customers | 3,662.9 | 3,995.3 |\n| Other revenue                         | 105.7   | 66.9    |\n| Total                                 | 3,768.7 | 4,062.2 |\n\nOther revenue includes valuation effects of EUR 73.7m (previous year: EUR 44.9m) related to energy derivatives which are attributable to the Energy Segment. Positive and negative results from the valuation of these derivatives are offset for reporting. In addition, EVN recognised operating lease revenue of EUR 32.2m in the 2022/23 financial year (previous year: EUR 22.1m).\n\nThe following table shows the revenue from contracts with customers classified by segment and product:\n\n| Revenue from contracts by segment and product |         |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                          | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Electricity                                   | 437.1   | 405.4   |\n| Natural gas                                   | 191.0   | 57.7    |\n| Heat                                          | 239.6   | 186.3   |\n| Other                                         | 42.4    | 34.3    |\n| Energy                                        | 910.1   | 683.7   |\n| Electricity                                   | 75.7    | 95.3    |\n| Other                                         | 57.0    | 64.2    |\n| Generation                                    | 132.8   | 159.5   |\n| Electricity                                   | 374.6   | 331.3   |\n| Natural gas                                   | 103.0   | 103.7   |\n| Other                                         | 86.8    | 82.2    |\n| Networks                                      | 564.5   | 517.3   |\n| Electricity                                   | 1,464.4 | 1,973.4 |\n| Natural gas                                   | 9.9     | 9.4     |\n| Heat                                          | 11.9    | 11.2    |\n| Other                                         | 13.4    | 8.4     |\n| South East Europe                             | 1,499.7 | 2,002.4 |\n| Environmental services                        | 525.3   | 604.3   |\n| Electricity                                   | 4.9     | 6.1     |\n| Heat                                          | 1.3     | 1.5     |\n| Environment                                   | 531.4   | 611.8   |\n| Other                                         | 24.5    | 20.6    |\n| All Other Segments                            | 24.5    | 20.6    |\n| Total                                         | 3,662.9 | 3,995.3 |\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN generally recognises revenue over time in its core business of energy supplies and deliveries as well as in the international project business. An exception to this practice is the recognition of revenue by EVN Wärmekraftwerke in connection with the thermal waste utilisation plant in Dürnrohr, where revenue is recognised at a specific point in time. The related revenue amounted to EUR 51.9m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 53.1m).\n\nSales revenues which are expected to be realised in future in connection with performance obligations and which have not yet been met or have only been partially met as of 30 September 2023, mainly relate to network subsidies and the international project business.\n\nIn total, the remaining performance obligations amount to EUR 942.5m (previous year: EUR 875.2m) at the balance sheet date. Of this amount, EUR 873.5m (previous year: EUR 812.4m) relates to performance obligations from the international project business. Revenue is recognised on the basis of the percentage of completion and will be recognised within the next five years, depending on the project. The performance obligations from network subsidies are shown in the following table:\n\n| Transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations |         |           |          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|----------|\n| 2022/23 financial year                                            |         |           |          |\n| EURm                                                              |         |           |          |\n|                                                                   | <1 year | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Network subsidies                                                 | 7.0     | 28.1      | 34.0     |\n| Total                                                             | 7.0     | 28.1      | 34.0     |\n|                                                                   |         |           |          |\n| 2021/22 financial year                                            |         |           |          |\n| EURm                                                              |         |           |          |\n|                                                                   | <1 year | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Network subsidies                                                 | 6.3     | 25.4      | 30.7     |\n| Total                                                             | 6.3     | 25.4      | 30.7     |\n\nEVN applies the practical expedient provided by IFRS 15.B16 when the respective requirements are met and recognises revenue at the amount it is entitled to invoice. Moreover, contracts for electricity and natural gas deliveries as well as contracts for network utilisation in the household customer business are concluded for an indefinite period. The customer has a unilateral right to terminate the contracts at any time. As a result, EVN does not have a contractual right to transfer the related performance obligations or to receive consideration.

The threshold for the calculation of surplus proceeds was set at EUR 140 per MWh up to 31 May 2023 but reduced to EUR 120 per MWh from 1 June 2023 up to the expiration date on 31 December 2023. The threshold can be increased up to EUR 176 per MWh, respectively EUR 156 per MWh based on the inclusion of allowable investments in renewable energies and energy efficiency measures. A levy to moderate the energy and price crisis was also introduced in North Macedonia during 2022/23, whereby this solidarity tax for companies in North Macedonia was only collected once.\n\nThis levy on surplus proceeds from electricity generation in Austria and the solidarity tax in North Macedonia were reflected in the recognition of expenses totalling EUR 31.2m.\n\nThe increase in business operation taxes and duties resulted primarily from the levy on surplus proceeds from electricity generation in Austria and the solidarity tax in North Macedonia. In addition, provisions were recognised for tax audits in South East Europe.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe position legal and consulting fees, expenses related to process risks also contains the change in the provision for process costs and risks. The item rents includes non-capitalised rental expenses (see note **36. Property, plant and equipment)** as well as changes in provisions for rents for network access in Bulgaria. In addition, expenses which are not under the scope of IFRS 16 are also included.\n\nThe decline in receivables write-offs resulted mainly from a reduction in the balance of receivables in North Macedonia. As in previous years, a forward-looking component was included in 2022/23 to reflect expected future receivables defaults (see note **61. Risk management).**\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses include environmental protection expenses, fees for monetary transactions, licenses, membership fees and administrative and office expenses.\n\n#### **30.

The consolidated financial statements do not include any equity-accounted companies of a financial nature.\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature consists primarily of earnings contributions, impairment losses recognised to assets capitalised in connection with acquisitions and other necessary impairment losses and write-ups (see note **37. Investments in equity accounted investees).**\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature decreased to EUR –67.6m in financial year 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 98.9m).

The interest expense on liabilities not designated at fair value through profit or loss totalled EUR 46.9m (previous year: EUR 33.8m).\n\nThe increase in the financial result was mainly due to the dividend payment by Verbund AG in the amount of EUR 158.0m.\n\n#### **33.

The effective tax rate is a weighted average of the effective local income tax rates of all consolidated subsidiaries (see note **51. Deferred taxes).**\n\n#### **34. Earnings per share**\n\nEarnings per share were calculated by dividing Group net result (= proportional share of net result attributable to EVN AG shareholders) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding in 2022/23, i. e. 178,225,093 (previous year: 178,187,472) (see note **48. Treasury shares).** This amount may be diluted by so-called potential shares arising from stock options or convertible bonds. Since EVN does not have any such shares, there is no difference between basic and diluted earnings per share. Based on the Group net result of EUR 529.7m for the 2022/23 financial year (previous year: EUR 209.6m), earnings per share equalled EUR 2.97 (previous year: EUR 1.18).\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position\n\n## Assets\n\n#### **35.

There was no maximum amount mortgage as of 30 September 2023.\n\nAs in the previous year, no property, plant and equipment or intangible assets were pledged as collateral as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe impairment testing of assets in accordance with IAS 36 led to the recognition of the following impairment losses and write-ups in 2022/23:\n\nVarious heating plants attributable to EVN Wärme in the Energy Segment were tested for impairment due to a deterioration in the economic environment during 2022/23. The related calculations led to the recognition of impairment losses totalling EUR 5.7m to three plants and to revaluations of EUR 1.6m to six plants. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of the value in use and amounted to EUR 23.9m. A WACC after tax ranging from 5.51% to 5.66% was used as the discount rate, which corresponds to an iteratively derived pre-tax WACC of 6.50% to 9.05%.\n\nA building used for operations by EVN Wasser was tested for impairment in 2013/14 following the unscheduled shutdown of a wellfield. The construction and commissioning of a natural filter plant in this operating building led to a revaluation with recognition to profit or loss of EUR 1.6m to the depreciated cost in 2022/23.\n\n#### **EVN as the lessee**\n\nThe most important application area for the EVN Group is formed by lease and easement agreements, as well as leased commercial and warehouse space which are assumed to be based on long-term leases. Rights of use totalling EUR 95.6m (previous year: EUR 74.0m) were contrasted by lease liabilities with a present value of EUR 80.2m (previous year: EUR 61.8m) as of 30 September 2023. The short-term portion of the lease liabilities equalled EUR 8.8m (previous year: EUR 6.4m).\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with subsequent measurement, the rights of use are amortised on a systematic basis over the shorter of the useful life and the remaining term of the lease. The conclusion of new agreements and the recognition of changes in estimates and modifications in 2022/23 led to an addition of EUR 28.6m (previous year: EUR 12.0m). Rights of use from lease agreements are reported as part of property, plant and equipment in accordance with IFRS 16; the development and amortisation of these rights of use are allocated to the following asset classes:\n\n| 2022/23 financial year<br>EURm       | Land and<br>buildings | Lines | Technical<br>equipment | Other plants,<br>tools and<br>equipment | Total |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|\n| Rights of use 30.09.2022             | 58.4                  | 14.8  | 0.3                    | 0.5                                     | 74.0  |\n| Additions                            | 24.2                  | 3.5   | –                      | 1.1                                     | 28.7  |\n| Scheduled depreciation               | –6.5                  | –0.6  | –0.3                   | –0.4                                    | –7.7  |\n| Disposals                            | –0.7                  | –     | –                      | –                                       | –0.7  |\n| Transfers                            | –0.1                  | –     | 0.2                    | –0.1                                    | –     |\n| Change in the scope of consolidation | 1.2                   | –     | –                      | –                                       | 1.3   |\n| Rights of use 30.09.2023             | 76.5                  | 17.7  | 0.1                    | 1.3                                     | 95.6  |\n\n| 2021/22 financial year<br>EURm | Land and<br>buildings | Lines | Technical<br>equipment | Other plants,<br>tools and<br>equipment | Total |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|\n| Rights of use 30.09.2021       | 55.8                  | 11.4  | 1.0                    | 0.4                                     | 68.6  |\n| Additions                      | 7.4                   | 3.9   | 0.4                    | 0.4                                     | 12.0  |\n| Scheduled depreciation         | -4.9                  | -0.5  | -1.0                   | -0.2                                    | -6.6  |\n| Rights of use 30.09.2022       | 58.4                  | 14.8  | 0.3                    | 0.5                                     | 74.0  |\n\nThe determination of the rights of use and corresponding lease liabilities includes all sufficiently probable cash outflows. The cash outflows from leases totalled EUR 19.9m (previous year: EUR 14.0m) in 2022/23. The consolidated statement of operations contains EUR 3.4m (previous year: EUR 2.5m) of expenses from unrecognised leases, which include expenses from low-value leases, expenses from short-term leases (less than twelve months) and expenses from variable lease payments that were not included in the lease liability. The interest expense for lease liabilities totalled EUR 1.3m (previous year: EUR 0.6m) in 2022/23. The difference between the cash outflows presented here and the payments for lease liabilities resulted primarily from advance rental payments made in 2022/23. These advance payments are not reported under cash flow from financing activities because they are not related to lease liabilities; they are instead included under cash flow from investing activities.\n\n#### **37. Investments in equity accounted investees**\n\nThe companies included in the consolidated financial statements at equity are listed in the notes under **EVN's investments** starting on page 115. Note **64. Disclosures of interests in other entities** contains financial information on joint ventures and associates that are included at equity in EVN's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll investments in equity accounted investees were recognised at their proportional share of IFRS income or loss based on an interim or annual report with a balance sheet date that does not precede the balance sheet date of EVN by more than three months. There were no listed market prices for the investments in equity accounted investees included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Reconciliation of investments in equity accounted investees |          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 2022/23 financial year<br>EURm                              |          |\n| Gross value 30.09.2022                                      | 968.3    |\n| Additions                                                   | 329.6    |\n| Disposals                                                   | -5.8     |\n| Gross value 30.09.2023                                      | 1,292.2  |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2022                         | 1,419.7  |\n| Currency translation differences                            | -2.5     |\n| Change in the scope of consolidation                        | 0.9      |\n| Revaluation                                                 | 11.1     |\n| Proportional share of results                               | -78.7    |\n| Dividends                                                   | -105.3   |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income            | -1,434.0 |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2023                         | -188.9   |\n| Net value 30.09.2022                                        | 2,388.0  |\n| Net value 30.09.2023                                        | 1,103.4  |\n\n| 2021/22 financial year                           |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| EURm                                             |         |\n| Gross value 30.09.2021                           | 918.3   |\n| Additions                                        | 50.0    |\n| Gross value 30.09.2022                           | 968.3   |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2021              | 659.2   |\n| Currency translation differences                 | 3.8     |\n| Proportional share of results                    | 98.9    |\n| Dividends                                        | -152.6  |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income | 810.3   |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2022              | 1,419.7 |\n| Net value 30.09.2021                             | 1,577.5 |\n| Net value 30.09.2022                             | 2,388.0 |\n\nTo protect energy supplies, EVN KG continuously purchased natural gas supplies and concluded futures contracts for electricity. The decline in the market prices for electricity and natural gas subsequently led to negative valuation effects for the recognised natural gas inventories and derivative futures. Provisions were also required for contingent losses from onerous customer contracts. EVN injected new capital to cover the company's losses and ensure its operational capability. The subsidies to EVN KG totalled EUR 318.4m in 2022/23. The at equity carrying amount of EVN KG equalled EUR 0.0m as of 30 September 2023. Value adjustments of EUR 16.9m could not be recorded directly in equity because the at equity carrying amount would then have been negative.\n\nA capital contribution of EUR 8.6m was provided to EnergieAllianz in 2022/23. The at equity carrying amount of EnergieAllianz equalled EUR 0.0m as of 30 September 2023. Value adjustments of EUR 34.1m were not recognised because the carrying amount would then have been negative.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN-ECOWIND Sonnenstromerzeugungs GmbH was included in the consolidated financial statements of EVN AG for the first time in 2022/23. This resulted in the recognition of a EUR 0.5m addition (also see **4. Scope of consolidation).** A shareholder contribution of EUR 2.2m was also made to EVN-ECOWIND.\n\nThe disposals resulted from the transferral of the \"sales and energy-related services\" business unit from EVN KG and to changes in the scope of consolidation in connection with s2e and Biowärme Amstetten-West GmbH (also see note **4. Scope of consolidation).** \n\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted investees, excluding additions and disposals, declined by EUR 1,620.1m in 2022/23. These changes resulted chiefly from adjustments of EUR –1,445.2m to the fair value of derivative financial instruments in the energy business which are designated as cash flow hedges and related to the investments in EVN KG and EnergieAllianz and also included an earnings contribution of EUR –240.3m from EVN KG.\n\n#### **38. Other investments**\n\nThe item other investments includes holdings in affiliates and associates, which are not consolidated due to immateriality, as well as miscellaneous stakes of less than 20.0% that were not included at equity.\n\nThe shares in affiliates and associates which are not consolidated due to immateriality are measured at cost less any necessary impairment losses and totalled EUR 7.0m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 6.2m). The other investments classified as FVOCI consist primarily of shares in Verbund AG with a value of EUR 3,381.1m (previous year: EUR 3,837.5m) and miscellaneous other investments of EUR 167.4m (previous year: EUR 190.9m). The valuation adjustments were recorded under other comprehensive income, the dividends were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations (also see note **32. Financial results).** \n\nEVN AG and Wiener Stadtwerke Holding AG entered into an agreement on 22 September 2010 for the syndication of their directly and indirectly held shareholdings in Verbund AG. This agreement gives the two companies joint control over approximately 26% of the voting shares in Verbund AG. In spite of the syndicate agreement, the scope of possible influence over the financial and business policies of Verbund AG is very limited. The requirements for classification as a controlling influence (IAS 28) are therefore not met and the shares in Verbund AG are therefore accounted by applying IFRS 9.\n\nThe valuation of the investment in Verbund Hydro Power AG in 2022/23 based on the discounted cash flow method resulted in an impairment loss of EUR 26.2m in the Generation Segment. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (Level 3 according to IFRS 13) and amounted to EUR 132.8m. A WACC after tax of 5.54% was used as the discount rate. The present value model underlying the valuation is based on publicly available information from the annual financial statements and, according to available data for electricity prices, forecasts the development of the years up to 2050 and a perpetual yield without a growth rate.\n\nIn the Networks Segment, the valuation of the investment in AGGM Austrian Gas Grid Management AG based on the discounted cash flow method resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss of EUR 1.3m. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (Level 3 according to IFRS 13) and amounted to EUR 3.0m. A WACC after tax of 4.90% was used as the discount rate. The present value model underlying the valuation is based on a perpetual yield without a growth rate which, in turn, was developed from the average trend of data from the publicly available annual financial statements for 2019–2022 and a forecast for the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn the All Other Segments, the valuation of the investment in Wiener Börse AG based on the discounted cash flow method resulted in an impairment loss of EUR 0.2m in 2022/23. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (Level 3 according to IFRS 13) and amounted to EUR 30.5m. A WACC after tax of 6.47% was used as the discount rate. The present value model underlying the valuation includes forecasted distributions for the coming year as well as a perpetual yield without a growth rate.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **39.

The carrying amounts correspond to the fair value as of the balance sheet date.\n\nLease receivables relate to project business in connection with PPP-projects. The decline in the fiscal year is mainly due to the contractually agreed redemption payments.\n\nThe reconciliation of the future minimum lease payments to their present value is as follows:\n\n#### **Terms to maturity of non-current lease receivables** EURm\n\n|          | Remaining term to maturity as of 30.09.2023 |                        |       |  | Remaining term to maturity as of 30.09.2022 |                        |       |  |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------|--|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------|--|\n|          | Principal<br>components                     | Interest<br>components | Total |  | Principal<br>components                     | Interest<br>components | Total |  |\n| <5 years | 8.9                                         | 0.7                    | 9.6   |  | 7.6                                         | 0.5                    | 8.2   |  |\n| >5 years | 1.2                                         | 0.1                    | 1.3   |  | 5.0                                         | 0.1                    | 5.1   |  |\n| Total    | 10.1                                        | 0.8                    | 10.9  |  | 12.7                                        | 0.6                    | 13.3  |  |\n\nThe total of the principal components corresponds to the capitalised value of the lease receivables. The interest components correspond to the proportionate share of the interest component of the total lease payment and do not represent discounted amounts. The interest components of the lease payments in 2022/23 were reported as interest income on non-current assets.\n\nReceivables and other assets include claims from trade receivables in North Macedonia that are reported under non-current assets as a result of instalment plan agreements. In addition, non-current receivables from the Bulgarian Post in the amount of EUR 16.4m are included for the first time in the 2022/23 financial year.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nContract costs represent the costs for obtaining contracts, as defined in IFRS 15.91, and are related to the international project business. Contract costs totalling EUR 86.7m were capitalised in financial year 2019/20 and will be amortised on a systematic basis in line with the expected timing of the contract on which the costs are based and depending on how the goods or services are transferred to the customer. Therefore, the original depreciation period is between 2.5 years and 4 years. As a result of the current depreciation of EUR 20.6m (previous year: EUR 20.6m) in the financial year 2022/23, the book value decreased to EUR 15.5m (see note **31. Depreciation and amortisation and effects from impairment tests).**\n\n#### **Current assets**\n\n#### **40. Inventories**\n\n| Inventories<br>EURm                                        | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Primary energy inventories                                 | 67.6       | 120.0      |\n| CO2 emission certificates                                  | 13.6       | 16.9       |\n| Raw materials, supplies, consumables and other inventories | 47.8       | 62.3       |\n| Customer orders not yet invoiced                           | 8.8        | 7.6        |\n| Total                                                      | 137.7      | 206.8      |\n\nPrimary energy inventories consist primarily of natural gas. Gas inventories totalled EUR 61.0m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 117.2m).\n\nPart of the natural gas inventories are measured according to the broker-trader exception because they are held exclusively for trading. Consequently, these natural gas inventories are measured at fair value (Level 1) less costs to sell. The fair value of the inventories held for trading totalled EUR 48.1m (previous year: EUR 0.1m) as of 30 September 2023. Negative changes in the market value resulted in a revaluation through profit or loss of EUR –10.5m (previous year: EUR 0.1m) as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe CO2 emission certificates relate exclusively to certificates purchased to fulfil the requirements of the Austrian Emission Certificate Act and which have not yet been used. The corresponding obligation for any shortfall in the certificates is reported under current provisions (see note **57. Current provisions).** \n\nValuation allowances of EUR 0.9m were recognised to inventories in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 0.7m) and were contrasted by revaluations of EUR 0.2m (previous year: EUR 0.1m). The inventories are not subject to any restrictions on disposal or other encumbrances.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **41.

Notes to impairment losses and default risks for trade receivables can be found in note **61. Risk management.** \n\nReceivables from investments in equity accounted investees and receivables from non-consolidated subsidiaries arise primarily from intragroup transactions related to energy supplies as well as Group financing and services provided to those companies.\n\nThe receivables arising from derivative transactions consist of the positive market values of derivatives in the energy business. Other receivables and assets include, among others, receivables from insurance and short-term loans receivable, as well as security retained in the international project business. The developement in contract assets resulted primarily from contract orders in the international project business. In 2022/23, as in the previous year, no impairments were recognised in connection with contract assets.\n\nAs of 30 September 2023, as in the previous year, no receivables were pledged as collateral for EVN's own liabilities.\n\n#### **42.

The time deposits reported under this item have a maturity of more than three months.\n\nThe item restricted cash includes bank balances that have been pledged and are therefore not available for general use by the Group.\n\n#### **43. Assets and liabilities held for sale**\n\nEVN, together with its two fully consolidated subsidiaries OOO EVN Umwelt Service and OOO EVN Umwelt, operates two sludge-fired combined heat and power plants in Moscow. These plants are allocated to the Environment Segment. The war in Ukraine has had a negative influence on relations between the majority of the international community of states and the Russian Federation, and the risk of the orderly continuation of business operations in Russia is more difficult to calculate. In view of these developments, EVN evaluated possible exit scenarios and decided to sell the companies. EVN generally assumed that the sale would take place in the 2022/23 financial year, but there were unexpected delays due to additional requirements and bureaucratic hurdles. The agreement with the buyer was already reached in the first quarter of the 2022/23 financial year, but the mandatory approval of the Russian government commission has not yet been granted. EVN fulfills all of the prescribed requirements for the sale of the companies and expects the formal approval of the Russian government commission to be granted within the next twelve months. The assets and liabilities connected with this disposal group are therefore classified as current as of 30 September 2023 in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\nAs of 30 September 2022, other operating expenses included impairment losses of EUR 1.8m. In addition, impairment losses to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were combined into a minor sum of less than EUR 0.1m. A comparison of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell for the disposal group led to a revaluation of EUR 0.4m as of 30 September 2023.\n\nOther comprehensive income includes cumulative expenses connected with the disposal group. The difference from currency translation equalled EUR –5.4m (previous year: EUR –1.5m) as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe disposal group was measured at fair value less costs to sell as of 30 September 2023 and contains the following assets and liabilities:\n\n| Assets and liabilities held for sale<br>EURm | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current assets                               | 5.8        | 9.3        |\n| Assets held for sale                         | 5.8        | 9.3        |\n| Non-current liabilities                      | -          | 0.5        |\n| Current liabilities                          | 0.4        | 0.8        |\n| Liabilities held for sale                    | 0.4        | 1.3        |\n\nCurrent assets include EUR 4.9m (previous year: EUR 7.5m) of bank deposits which are subject to disposal restrictions due to the sanctions imposed by the Russian Federation.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Liabilities\n\n#### **Equity**\n\nThe development of equity in 2022/23 and 2021/22 is shown on page 29.\n\n#### **44. Share capital**\n\nThe share capital of EVN AG totals EUR 330.0m (previous year: EUR 330.0m) and is divided into 179,878,402 (previous year: 179,878,402) zero par value bearer shares.\n\n#### **45. Share premium and capital reserves**\n\nThe share premium and capital reserves comprise appropriated capital reserves of EUR 205.2m (previous year: EUR 205.2m) from capital increases and unappropriated capital reserves of EUR 58.3m (previous year: EUR 58.3m), both in accordance with Austrian stock corporation law.\n\n#### **46. Retained earnings**\n\nRetained earnings of EUR 3,417.0m (previous year: EUR 2,979.9m) comprise the proportional share of retained earnings attributable to EVN AG and all other consolidated companies from the date of initial consolidation as well as the proportional share of retained earnings from business combinations achieved in stages.\n\nDividends are based on the result of EVN AG as reported in the annual financial statements and developed as follows:\n\n| Reconciliation of EVN AG's result for the period       |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| EURm                                                   | 2022/23 |\n| Reported result for the period 2022/23                 | 416.3   |\n| Plus retained earnings from the 2021/22 financial year | 0.4     |\n| Less additions to voluntary reserves                   | -213.0  |\n| Distributable result for the period                    | 203.7   |\n| Proposed dividend                                      | -203.2  |\n| Retained earnings for the 2023/24 financial year       | 0.5     |\n\nLiabilities do not include the dividend of EUR 1.14 per share for the 2022/23 financial year which will be proposed to the Annual General.\n\nThe 94th Annual General Meeting on 2 February 2023 approved a proposal by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board to distribute a dividend of EUR 0.52 per share for the 2021/22 financial year. This resulted in a total dividend payment of EUR 92.7m. Ex-dividend day was 8 February 2023, dividend payment day was 10 February 2023.\n\n#### **47. Valuation reserves**\n\nThe valuation reserve contains changes in the market value of cash flow hedges and financial assets classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), the IAS 19 remeasurements and the proportional share of changes in the equity of investments in equity accounted investees.\n\nIn addition, the statement of comprehensive income includes EUR –0.9m (previous year: EUR 9.4m) for the share of changes in the valuation reserves that are attributable to non-controlling interests (see **Consolidated statement of comprehensive income,** page 27).\n\nThe part of the valuation reserve attributable to equity accounted investees consists primarily of components from cash flow hedges that were recorded under equity as well as remeasurements in accordance with IAS 19 and the valuation of FVOCI instruments.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                 | 30.09.2023 |        |           | 30.09.2022 |          |           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|\n| Valuation reserves<br>EURm                                                      | Before tax | Tax    | After tax | Before tax | Tax      | After tax |\n| Items recognised under other comprehensive<br>income from                       |            |        |           |            |          |           |\n| Financial assets classified at fair value through<br>other comprehensive income | 3,087.0    | -709.9 | 2,377.1   | 3,566.3    | -820.2   | 2,746.1   |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                                | 28.9       | -3.3   | 25.6      | -206.5     | 55.1     | -151.4    |\n| Remeasurements IAS 19                                                           | -99.6      | 22.3   | -77.3     | -73.0      | 16.3     | -56.7     |\n| Investments in equity accounted investees                                       | -204.9     | 53.5   | -151.3    | 1,229.9    | -289.7   | 940.2     |\n| Total                                                                           | 2,811.4    | -637.4 | 2,174.0   | 4,516.7    | -1,038.4 | 3,478.3   |\n\nIn 2022/23, cash flow hedges totalling EUR –15.4m (previous year: EUR –43.0m) were transferred from other comprehensive income to the consolidated statement of operations. The year-on-year change resulted, above all, from the portfolio hedge as well as from the hedging of net cash flows from the international project business (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).** Due to the ineffectiveness of the hedges an amount of EUR 0.0m (previous year: EUR 0.0m) was recognised in profit or loss.\n\n#### **48. Treasury shares**\n\nA total of 36,287 treasury shares were sold during the reporting year to permit their issue as a special payment in accordance with a company agreement (previous year: 37,888 shares). EVN AG is not entitled to any rights arising from treasury shares. In particular, these shares are not entitled to dividends.\n\nThe number of shares outstanding developed as follows:\n\n| Reconciliation of the number of |                       |                 |                    |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| outstanding shares              | Zero par value shares | Treasury shares | Outstanding shares |\n| 30.09.2021                      | 179,878,402           | -1,697,245      | 178,181,157        |\n| Purchase of treasury shares     | -                     | -               | -                  |\n| Disposal of treasury shares     | -                     | 37,888          | 37,888             |\n| 30.09.2022                      | 179,878,402           | -1,659,357      | 178,219,045        |\n| Purchase of treasury shares     | -                     | -               | -                  |\n| Disposal of treasury shares     | -                     | 36,287          | 36,287             |\n| 30.09.2023                      | 179,878,402           | -1,623,070      | 178,255,332        |\n\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding, which is used as the basis for calculating earnings per share, equals 178,225,093 shares (previous year: 178,187,472 shares).\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **49.

The foreign currency bond is hedged against interest and foreign exchange risk by means of cross-currency swaps.\n\nThe change in the carrying amount of the bonds resulted primarily from the reclassification of one bond to current financial liabilities because of the scheduled maturity within the next 12 months.\n\nThe bonds are carried at amortised cost. Foreign currency liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. In accordance with IFRS 9, hedged liabilities are adjusted to reflect the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged risk in cases where hedge accounting is applied (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\n#### **Bank loans**\n\nThe loans consist of immaterial general borrowings from banks and loans which are subsidised in part by interest and redemption grants from the Austrian Environment and Water Industry Fund. This position also includes EUR 247.0m (previous year: EUR 247.0m) of promissory note loans that were issued in October 2012, April 2020 and in July 2022.\n\nAccrued interest is reported under other current liabilities.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **51.

Deferred tax assets of EUR 75.1m (previous year: EUR 73.9m) related to loss carryforwards were not recognised because they are not expected to be used within the foreseeable future. Of this total, EUR 8.6m will expire during the next five years (previous year: EUR 8.6m). The remaining loss carryforwards that were not capitalised can be carried forward for an indefinite period of time.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities of EUR 110.1m (previous year: EUR 85.7m) on temporary differences of EUR 407.2m (previous year: EUR 325.5m) were not recognised because these differences will remain tax-free in the foreseeable future. These temporary differences arise from differences between the tax base of the participation interest and the proportional share of equity owned less retained earnings, respectively between the tax base of the participation interest and the carrying amount of the equity accounted investees (outside basis differences).\n\nThe changes recorded under other comprehensive income are primarily attributable to financial instruments (EUR –51.8m; previous year: EUR –119.6m), associates (EUR –343.2m; previous year: EUR 178.6m) and employee-related provisions (EUR –6.0m; previous year: EUR 20.9m).\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **52.

Only one parameter was changed at a time during the examination, while the other variables remained constant (ceteris paribus). The method used to calculate the changed obligation reflected the calculation of the actual obligation. The analytical capacity of this method is limited because the interdependencies between the individual actuarial parameters are not taken into account. With respect to the severance compensation obligations, a sensitivity analysis was not carried out for the remaining life expectancy because this parameter has only an immaterial effect on the liability.\n\n#### **Reconciliation of other non-current provisions**\n\nEURm\n\n|                                  | Service<br>anniversary<br>bonuses | Rents<br>for network<br>access | Process costs<br>and risks | Environmental<br>and disposal<br>risks | Other<br>non-current<br>provisions | Total |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|\n| Carrying amount 01.10.2022       | 20.5                              | 6.5                            | 3.1                        | 42.3                                   | 1.9                                | 74.3  |\n| Interest expense                 | 0.8                               | -                              | 0.2                        | 0.4                                    | -                                  | 1.4   |\n| Use                              | -1.6                              | -                              | -0.2                       | -                                      | -                                  | -1.9  |\n| Release                          | -                                 | -0.1                           | -2.0                       | -0.2                                   | -0.2                               | -2.4  |\n| Additions                        | 1.3                               | 0.5                            | 0.8                        | 8.6                                    | 0.5                                | 11.8  |\n| Reclassification                 | -                                 | -0.1                           | 0.4                        | 5.8                                    | 2.2                                | 8.2   |\n| Change in scope of consolidation | 0.1                               | -                              | -                          | -                                      | 1.7                                | 1.7   |\n| Carrying amount 30.09.2023       | 21.0                              | 6.8                            | 2.3                        | 57.0                                   | 6.0                                | 93.1  |\n\nRents for network access involve provisions for rents to gain access to third-party facilities in Bulgaria. Various legal proceedings and lawsuits, which for the most part arise from operating activities and are currently pending, are reported under process costs and risks. Environmental and disposal risks primarily encompass the estimated costs for demolition or disposal as well as provisions for environmental risks and risks related to contaminated sites. At the present time, the use of the provisions for environmental and disposal risks is expected within a timeframe of one to 19 years. Reclassifications consist chiefly of a transfer from the current to the non-current section due to the adjustment of estimates for the time required to meet renaturation obligations.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **53.

EVN AG is allocated to the segments on the basis of data from the cost accounting system.\n\nThe transfer prices for energy between the individual segments are based on comparable prices for special contract customers, and thus represent applicable market prices. For the remaining items, pricing is based on cost plus an appropriate mark-up.\n\n#### **Reconciliation of segment results at the Group level**\n\nServices performed between segments are eliminated in the consolidation column. The results in the total column reflect the amounts shown in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n#### **Group disclosures**\n\nIFRS 8 requires additional segment information classified by products (external revenues broken down by products and services) and countries (external revenues and non-current assets broken down by countries) if this information is not already provided as part of the segment reporting.\n\nInformation on transactions with major external customers is required only if these transactions amount to 10.0% or more of a company's external revenues. EVN has no transactions with customers that meet this criterion because of its large number of customers and diverse business activities.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Other information\n\n#### **60.

Risk management**\n\nMarket risk represents the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as the result of market risk factors. Market risk is classified in the following three components: interest rate, foreign exchange and other market risks. The goal of risk management in the EVN Group is to reduce the market-based volatility of earnings on the consolidated statement of operations. To manage market risks, the Group acquires and sells derivatives and also enters into financial liabilities. Wherever possible, hedging transactions should be recognised in order to manage earnings volatility. Other relevant risks include credit or default risk and liquidity risk.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nEVN defines interest rate risk as the risk that fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in the market interest rate could adversely affect interest income and expense as well as equity. This risk is minimised through the regular monitoring of interest rate risk and compliance with limits as well as hedging strategies that include the use of derivative financial instruments (also see notes **9. Financial instruments** and **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\nEVN monitors interest rate risk through sensitivity analyses and, among others, with a daily value-at-risk (VaR) calculation. This procedure calculates the VaR with a confidence level of 99.0% for one day according to the variance-covariance method (delta-gamma approach). The interest VaR, including the hedging instruments used by EVN, equalled EUR 6.5m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 10.7m). The decrease noted here is essentially due to slightly lower loans and bonds outstanding and the decreased volatility on the interest markets.\n\n#### **Foreign exchange risk**\n\nFor EVN, the risk to profit or loss arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arises from transactions carried out in currencies other than the euro. EVN is exposed to foreign exchange risk on receivables, liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents that are not held in the Group's functional currency (i. e. BGN, BHD, CZK, JPY, KWD, MKD, PLN, RUB). The major driver of foreign exchange risk for EVN is a bond issued in Japanese yen (JPY). Foreign exchange risk is managed by way of the central compilation, analysis and management of risk positions, and by hedging the bonds denominated in foreign currency (JPY 12bn) through cross-currency swaps (for a nominal value of JPY 10bn). Cross-currency swaps for a nominal value of JPY 2bn were terminated on 15 January 2019 based on the related settlement agreement concluded with a bank. This agreement gave both parties the right to early termination of the cross-currency swap in January 2019. Deposits totalling JPY 2bn were held with financial institutions as at the balance sheet date to hedge foreign exchange risk (see notes **9. Financial instruments** and **50. Non-current loans and borrowings).**\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother material driver for foreign exchange risk is the Umm Al Hayman wastewater treatment project in Kuwait. The EVN Group serves as the general contractor and, as such, is responsible for the planning and construction, above all, of a wastewater treatment plant (contract value: approximately EUR 600m, converted) and – together with partners – of a sewage network with pumping stations (contract value: approximately EUR 950m, converted). The Group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange risks to the extent that the currencies for settlement of the project transactions differ from the Group's functional currency. These transactions are carried out chiefly in euro (EUR), US dollar (USD) and Kuwaiti dinar (KWD). In accordance with the relevant Group guideline, foreign exchange risks from expected project transactions are hedged over the next twelve months. This practice can vary for large-scale projects, where hedging can also extend beyond the twelve-month period. Forward exchange transactions are used to hedge currency risk and formally designated in macro-cash flow accounting. These contracts are principally designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nThe EVN Group is expanding an existing sewage treatment plant in Bahrain and building a sewage sludge incineration plant. As with the project in Kuwait, the company is also exposed to currency risks in Bahrain. Forward exchange transactions were concluded to hedge the highly probable expected net cash flows. The transactions are carried out on the basis of euros (EUR) and Bahraini dinars (BHD).\n\nIn previous years, EVN used forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate for the project, but measured these at fair value. In the 2022/23 financial year, EVN decided to implement a cash flow hedge as for the project in Kuwait. In this respect, newly concluded forward exchange contracts, which were concluded to hedge the highly probable net payments in BHD, were designated as hedging instruments.\n\nThe foreign exchange VaR, based on the major foreign currency risk drivers in the financial area amounted to EUR 0.2m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 1.6m) after the inclusion of hedging instruments. The decrease is mainly due to the abovementioned use of forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges in the Bahrain project.\n\n#### **Other market risks**\n\nEVN defines other market risks as the risk of price changes resulting from market fluctuations in primary energy, CO2 emission certificates, electricity and securities.\n\nIn EVN's energy trading activities, energy trading contracts are entered into for the purpose of managing price risk. Price risks result from the procurement and sale of electricity, natural gas and CO2 emission certificates.\n\nEVN uses futures, forwards and swaps to hedge the prices of the primary energy carriers electricity, natural gas and CO2 emission certificates in the energy business. These swaps are generally fulfilled. The contracts which cover expected procurement, sale or usage requirements are evaluated as own-use transactions (also see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).** An increase or decrease of 5% in the price would have resulted in an aggregated commodity price risk of EUR 2.7m for EVN as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 3.0m).\n\nThe price risk for securities results from fluctuations on the capital markets. The most significant securities position held by EVN is its investment in Verbund AG. The price risk VaR for the Verbund AG shares held by EVN as of the balance sheet date was EUR 145.7m (previous year: EUR 272.0m), whereby the price would be influenced by the sale of a large block of Verbund shares by EVN. The decrease in VaR compared to the last balance sheet date is essentially due to the stable development of the stock market price of the shares of Verbund AG in the past financial year.\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk represents the risk of not being able to raise the required financial resources to settle liabilities on their due date as well as the inability to raise the necessary liquidity at the expected terms and conditions. EVN minimises this risk by means of short-term and medium-term financial and liquidity planning. In concluding financing agreements, special attention is paid to managing the terms to maturity in order to achieve a balanced maturity profile and thus avoid the bundling of repayment dates. The EVN Group uses cash pooling to equalise liquidity balances.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe liquidity reserve as of 30 September 2023 comprised cash and cash equivalents of EUR 70.2m (previous year: EUR 292.0m), short-term time deposits of EUR 12.6m (previous year: EUR 14.4m) and current securities of EUR 216.8m (previous year: EUR 193.3m) which can be sold at any time. Moreover, EVN had EUR 400.0m in a contractually agreed and unused syndicated line of credit (previous year: EUR 400.0m) and EUR 286.0m (previous year: EUR 227.0m) of contractually agreed and unused bilateral lines of credit as of the balance sheet date. The liquidity risk was therefore extremely low. The gearing ratio equalled 21.1% as of the balance sheet date (previous year: 17.0%) and underscores EVN's sound capital structure.\n\n#### **Expected occurrence of cash flows of loans and borrowings and other liabilities**\n\n| 30.09.2023                                         |                 |                     | Contractually stipulated payment flows |           |          |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| EURm                                               | Carrying amount | Total payment flows | <1 year                                | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Bonds                                              | 547.3           | 719.0               | 93.7                                   | 58.6      | 566.7    |\n| Bank loans                                         | 927.1           | 980.2               | 234.7                                  | 259.1     | 486.4    |\n| Lease liabilities                                  | 80.2            | 96.6                | 9.4                                    | 27.8      | 59.4     |\n| Liabilities arising from derivative transactions1) | 39.1            | 42.3                | 33.2                                   | 9.1       | –        |\n| Liabilities from contract costs                    | 15.5            | 15.5                | 15.5                                   | –         | –        |\n| Total                                              | 1,531.4         | 1,853.6             | 386.5                                  | 354.6     | 1,112.5  |\n| 30.09.2022                                         |                 |                     | Contractually stipulated payment flows |           |          |\n| EURm                                               | Carrying amount | Total payment flows | <1 year                                | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Bonds                                              | 556.7           | 736.6               | 15.9                                   | 141.9     | 578.7    |\n| Bank loans                                         | 716.4           | 812.0               | 136.0                                  | 279.3     | 396.8    |\n| Lease liabilities                                  | 61.8            | 69.7                | 7.0                                    | 20.8      | 41.9     |\n| Liabilities arising from derivative transactions1) | 294.4           | 326.6               | 268.9                                  | 57.7      | –        |\n| Liabilities from contract costs                    | 20.6            | 20.6                | 14.1                                   | 6.5       | –        |\n| Total                                              | 1,650.0         | 1,965.4             | 441.8                                  | 506.2     | 1,017.4  |\n\n1) Forward exchange transactions (USD/KWD) are included in the carrying amount. Cash flows from forward exchange transactions, however, are shown in the tables on page 105 in the respective foreign currency.\n\nAll financial liabilities not shown in the table are current and the associated cash flows are therefore due within one year.\n\n#### **Credit and default risk**\n\nCredit and default risk represents the risk of a loss when business partners fail to meet their contractual obligations. This risk is inherent to all agreements with delayed payment terms or fulfilment at a later date. Default risk generally arises in connection with trade receivables and the debt instruments held as financial assets by the Group. The carrying amount of the financial assets and contractual assets represents the maximum default risk.\n\nTo limit default risk, the company evaluates the credit standing of its business partners. Internal and external ratings (including Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch and KSV 1870) are used for this purpose, and the business volume is limited in accordance with the rating and the probability of default. Sufficient collateral is required before a transaction is entered into if the partner's credit rating is inadequate.\n\nEVN monitors credit risk and limits default risk for financial receivables and for derivatives and forward transactions which are concluded to hedge the risks connected with EVN's energy business or are related to end customers and other debtors.\n\nIn order to reduce credit risk, hedging transactions are entered into only with well-known banks that have good credit ratings. EVN also ensures that funds are deposited at banks with the best possible credit standing based on international ratings.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default risk for customers is monitored separately at EVN and supported primarily by ratings and experience-based values. Default risk is also minimised with efficient receivables management and the continuous monitoring of customer payment behaviour.\n\nThe recognition of impairment losses to financial assets carried at amortised cost and to contractual assets in accordance with IFRS 15 has been based on the ECL model for expected credit losses since 1 October 2018. EVN measures the impairment losses for trade receivables without a significant financing component and for contractual assets at an amount equal to the expected lifetime credit losses. In contrast, the impairment losses\n\n- for financial assets with a low default risk as of the balance sheet date and\n- for bank deposits without a significant increase in the default risk since initial recognition are based on the expected twelve-month credit loss.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the EVN Group, a financial asset has a low default risk when its credit rating meets the \"investment grade\" definition. The Group sees this condition as met with an internal rating of 5a or higher or with an equivalent rating of BB– or higher from Standard and Poor's (S&P).\n\nEVN uses appropriate and reliable information which is relevant and available without undue expenditure of time and expense to determine whether the default risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and to estimate the expected credit losses. The default risk of a financial asset is assumed to have increased significantly when the related credit rating has declined to 5b on EVN's internal rating scale, which represents the S&P equivalent of B+.\n\nThe EVN Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\n- the debtor is unlikely to meet his/her credit obligations in full without measures by the Group to realise collateral (if available), or\n- the financial asset declines to 5c on EVN's internal rating scale, which represents the S&P equivalent of CCC+, or\n- payment on trade receivables has not been received after a second reminder or insolvency proceedings are opened over a company or private person.\n\nDefault probabilities and collection rates based on the applicable rating category are used to calculate the required impairment loss. The amount of the impairment loss equals the present value of the expected credit loss.\n\nThe following table includes information on the default risk and expected credit losses for financial instruments carried at amortised cost. It does not cover trade receivables, receivables from equity accounted investees, receivables from unconsolidated investments or amounts due from employees. The risk allowance for all financial instruments represents the expected twelve-month credit loss because the default risk is low. The amounts shown in the table include both current and non-current components.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Major financial instruments covered by the ECL model**\n\n| 2022/23 financial year |                | Default           | Loans      | Lease       |                    | Calculated   |\n|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| EURm                   | Equivalent S&P | probability (%)1) | receivable | receivables | Bank deposits2) 3) | impairment4) |\n| EVN rating class 1     | AAA            | –                 | –          | 7.4         | 93.1               | –            |\n| EVN rating class 2     | Up to AA–      | 0.03              | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 3     | Up to A–       | 0.05              | 19.4       | 4.9         | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 4     | Up to BBB–     | 0.22              | 9.2        | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 5a    | Up to BB–      | 0.91              | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 5b    | Up to B–       | 5.53              | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 5c    | Up to D        | 24.70             | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| No rating              | –              | –                 | 0.9        | –           | –                  | –            |\n| Total                  |                |                   | 29.5       | 12.3        | 93.1               | –            |\n\n1) Assumed loss ratio (60% for banks, 80% for corporates)\n\n2) Due to the daily maturity, a one-day probability of default is applied to account balances;\n\nfor money market deposits, the PoD of the average volume-weighted residual term is taken into account.\n\n3) Bank balances also include restricted cash in the amount of EUR 22.9m.\n\n4) The calculated impairments are not recognised in the balance sheet due to their minor magnitude.\n\n#### **Major financial instruments covered by the ECL model**\n\n| 2021/22 financial year<br>EURm | Equivalent S&P | Default<br>probability (%)1) | Loans<br>receivable | Lease<br>receivables | Bank deposits2) 3) | Calculated<br>impairment4) |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| EVN rating class 1             | AAA            | –                            | –                   | 3.3                  | 301.3              | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 2             | Up to AA–      | 0.03                         | –                   | 10.8                 | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 3             | Up to A–       | 0.06                         | 17.2                | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 4             | Up to BBB–     | 0.30                         | 11.0                | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 5a            | Up to BB–      | 1.45                         | –                   | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 5b            | Up to B–       | 7.47                         | –                   | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 5c            | Up to D        | 9.87                         | –                   | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| No rating                      | –              | –                            | 1.2                 | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| Total                          |                |                              | 29.4                | 14.1                 | 301.3              | –                          |\n\n1) Assumed loss ratio (60% for banks, 80% for corporates)\n\n2) Due to the daily maturity, a one-day probability of default is applied to account balances;\n\nfor money market deposits, the PoD of the average volume-weighted residual term is taken into account.\n\n3) Bank balances also include restricted cash in the amount of EUR 9.3m.\n\n4) The calculated impairments are not recognized in the balance sheet due to their minor magnitude.\n\nEVN uses the practical expedient provided by IFRS 9.B5.5.35 for trade receivables and calculates the expected credit losses with a provision matrix. The input factors include analyses of default incidents in previous financial years based on different regional characteristics for the core markets. These factors form the basis for the development of a provision matrix with different time ranges.\n\nIn the current situation, it is particularly important to evaluate how the macroeconomic environment will influence the expected credit losses on trade receivables. The economic developments in recent years did not lead to a sharp rise in receivables defaults by customers, in particular because of numerous government support measures. However, this has currently been reflected in an increasing number of insolvencies in Europe, and we expect higher receivables defaults in the future. For this reason, the EVN Group recognised a EUR 5.0m (previous year: EUR 6.1m) higher impairment loss to trade receivables for the 2022/23 financial year via a forward-looking component.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following tables include information on the default risk and expected credit losses for trade receivables, which were determined on the basis of a provision matrix for EVN's core markets:\n\n#### **Expected credit losses in Austria 2022/23** EURm\n\n|                        | Default probability<br>range (%) | Default probability<br>average (%) | Gross amount | Net amount | Cumulative<br>impairment loss |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| Not overdue            | 0.0-0.1                          | –                                  | 98.6         | 98.6       | –                             |\n| Up to 89 days overdue  | 0.1-0.6                          | 1.1                                | 7.9          | 7.8        | 0.1                           |\n| Up to 179 days overdue | 4.6-19.7                         | 13.6                               | 1.9          | 1.6        | 0.3                           |\n| Up to 359 days overdue | 7.9-55.2                         | 18.9                               | 2.7          | 2.2        | 0.5                           |\n| >360 days overdue      | 15.5-100.0                       | 38.6                               | 11.0         | 6.8        | 4.3                           |\n| Total                  |                                  |                                    | 122.2        | 117.0      | 5.2                           |\n\n#### **Expected credit losses in Austria 2021/22**\n\nEURm\n\n|                        | Default probability<br>range (%) | Default probability<br>average (%) | Gross amount | Net amount | Cumulative<br>impairment loss |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| Not overdue            | 0.0-1.2                          | -

Following the conclusion of instalment agreements with customers in North Macedonia, existing trade receivables were reclassified as non-current. These receivables are not considered part of overdue receivables and, consequently, this category carries a higher average probability of default than the category \"up to 89 days overdue\".\n\nThe remaining gross trade receivables of EUR 102.8m (previous year: EUR 84.4m) are related primarily to the international project business. Since the customers are mainly government-related entities, the probability of default was calculated on the basis of external ratings. Impairments totalling EUR 23.7m (previous year: EUR 18.1m) were recognised for receivables with a gross carrying amount of EUR 70.7m (previous year: EUR 59.6m) that fall into Level 3.\n\nIn financial year 2022/23, impairments of EUR 20.7m (previous year: EUR 38.0m) were recognised for trade receivables. The impairments mainly resulted from expected credit losses under consideration of a provision matrix. As in the previous year, no impairment of contract assets was necessary.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the development of impairment losses to trade receivables in 2022/23:\n\n| Impairment losses – trade receivables |         |         |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                  | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Balance on 01.10.                     | 287.1   | 255.0   |\n| Additions                             | 20.7    | 38.0    |\n| Disposal                              | -21.1   | -6.0    |\n| Balance on 30.09.                     | 286.7   | 287.1   |\n\nThe Group's maximum default risk for the items reported on the consolidated statement of financial position as of 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022 reflect the carrying amounts shown in notes **39. Other non-current assets, 41. Trade and other receivables** and **42. Securities and other financial investments,** excluding financial guarantees.\n\nThe maximum default risk for derivative financial instruments equals the positive fair value (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).** \n\nThe maximum risk from financial guarantees is described in note **65. Other obligations and risks.**\n\n#### **62. Capital management**\n\nEVN's goal in the area of capital management is to maintain a solid capital structure in order to use the resulting financial strength for value-creating investments and an attractive dividend policy. EVN has defined an equity ratio of more than 40% and net debt coverage of more than 50% as its targets. As of 30 September 2023, the equity ratio equalled 58.8% (previous year: 58.9%). Net debt coverage, which represents the ratio of funds from operations to net debt, equalled 79.4% (previous year: 55.8%). Net debt is calculated as the total of current and non-current financial liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current securities and loans receivable, plus non-current personnel provisions.\n\n| Capital management                                       |            |            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                     | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n| Non-current loans and borrowings and leasing liabilities | 1,174.8    | 1,206.1    |\n| Current loans and borrowings1)                           | 302.0      | 128.8      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                | -20.2      | -36.9      |\n| Non-current and current securities                       | -337.5     | -285.6     |\n| Non-current and current loans receivable                 | -29.5      | -29.4      |\n| <b>Net financial debt</b>                                | 1,089.7    | 983.1      |\n| Non-current personnel provisions2)                       | 274.6      | 262.0      |\n| <b>Net debt</b>                                          | 1,364.3    | 1,245.1    |\n| <b>Funds from operations</b>                             | 1,082.9    | 694.1      |\n| <b>Equity</b>                                            | 6,464.3    | 7,321.1    |\n| <b>Gearing (%)</b>                                       | 21.1       | 17.0       |\n| <b>Net debt coverage (%)</b>                             | 79.4       | 55.8       |\n\n1) Excluding bank overdrafts contained in cash and cash equivalents\n\n2) Excluding provisions for service anniversary bonuses\n\nThe EVN Group uses cash pooling to manage liquidity and optimise interest rates.

Reporting on financial instruments**\n\nFair value generally reflects the listed price on the balance sheet date. If this price is not available, fair value is calculated in accordance with financial methods, e. g. by discounting the expected cash flows at the prevailing market interest rate. The input factors required for the calculations are explained below.\n\nThe fair value of shares in unlisted subsidiaries and other investments is based on discounted expected cash flows or comparable transactions. For financial instruments listed on an active market, the trading price as of the balance sheet date represents fair value. Most of the receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current financial liabilities have short terms to maturity. Therefore, the carrying value of these instruments as of the balance sheet date approximately corresponds to fair value. The fair value of bonds is calculated as the present value of the discounted future cash flows based on prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe following table shows the financial instruments carried at fair value and their classification in the fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13.\n\nLevel 1 input factors are observable parameters such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities. These prices are used for valuation purposes without modification. Level 2 input factors represent other observable parameters which must be adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics of the valuation object. Examples of the parameters used to measure the financial instruments classified under Level 2 are forward price curves derived from market prices, exchange rates, interest structure curves and the counterparty credit risk. Level 3 input factors are non-observable factors which reflect the assumptions that would be used by a market participant to determine an appropriate price. There were no reclassifications between the various levels during the reporting period.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Information on classes and categories of

The operative goal is to ensure the long-term continuity of the Group's earnings. All derivative financial instruments are integrated in a risk management system as soon as the respective contracts are concluded. This allows for the preparation of a daily overview of all main risk indicators.\n\nThe nominal values represent the separate totals of the items classified as financial derivatives on the balance sheet date. These are reference values which do not provide a measure of the risk incurred by the company through the use of these financial instruments. In particular, potential risk factors include fluctuations in the underlying market parameters and the credit risk of the contracting parties. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at their fair value.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nDerivative financial instruments comprise the following:\n\n| Derivative<br>financial instruments  | 30.09.2023 |           |          |          |       | 30.09.2022 |           |          |          |        |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|\n|                                      | Purchases  | Disposals | Positive | Negative | Net   | Purchases  | Disposals | Positive | Negative | Net    |\n| Forward exchange<br>transactions     |            |           |          |          |       |            |           |          |          |        |\n| KWD3)                                | –          | 80.1      | 1.4      | –12.3    | –10.9 | –          | 81.2      | –        | –25.6    | –25.6  |\n| USD3)                                | –          | 111.4     | 2.3      | –3.4     | –1.0  | –          | 174.7     | –        | –19.5    | –19.5  |\n| BHD3)                                | –          | 8.4       | –        | –0.6     | –0.6  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –      |\n| USD                                  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –     | –          | 40.0      | –        | –0.1     | –0.1   |\n| BHD                                  | –          | 4.7       | 0.1      | –        | 0.1   | –          | 33.4      | –        | –1.5     | –1.5   |\n| KWD                                  | –          | 1.8       | –        | –        | –     | –          | 3.5       | –        | –0.2     | –0.2   |\n| PLN                                  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –     | –          | 4.9       | –        | –        | –      |\n| RON                                  | –          | 2.0       | –        | –        | –     | –          | –         | –        | –        | –      |\n| Currency swaps                       |            |           |          |          |       |            |           |          |          |        |\n| JPYm (>5 years)3)                    | 10,000.0   | –         | –        | –19.4    | –19.4 | 10,000.0   | –         | –        | –11.1    | –11.1  |\n| Derivatives energy                   |            |           |          |          |       |            |           |          |          |        |\n| Swaps                                | –          | –         | –        | –        | –     | 36.0       | –36.0     | 10.0     | –8.4     | 1.6    |\n| Futures                              | 1,257.6    | 2,347.7   | 12.7     | –5.6     | 7.1   | 22.0       | –         | –        | –0.4     | –0.4   |\n| Forwards                             | 436.9      | 411.2     | 16.4     | –10.9    | 5.5   | 668.4      | 843.2     | 40.7     | –92.6    | –51.9  |\n| Futures3)                            | –          | 556.0     | 13.7     | –        | 13.7  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –      |\n| Forwards3)                           | 19.9       | 365.4     | 57.8     | –10.6    | 47.2  | 204.1      | 849.3     | 24.3     | –183.0   | –158.7 |\n| Recognition of offsetting<br>clauses | –          | –         | –23.6    | 23.6     | –     | –          | –         | –48.1    | 48.1     | –      |\n| Total after netting out              | –          | –         | 80.9     | –39.1    | 41.2  | –          | –         | 27.0     | –294.4   | –267.4 |\n\n1) In m nominal currency; energy related in GWh\n\n2) In EURm\n\n3) Designated as a hedge in accordance with IFRS 9\n\nPositive fair values are recognised as receivables from derivative transactions under other non-current assets or receivables and other current assets, depending on their remaining term to maturity. Negative fair values are recognised as liabilities from derivative transactions under other non-current liabilities or other current liabilities, depending on their remaining term to maturity. For counterparties with a master agreement that includes an offsetting clause, the positive and negative fair values are presented as a net amount for specific periods because of the applicable net settlement procedure. A maturity analysis of the derivative financial liabilities is provided in the table on liquidity risk (see note **61. Risk management).**\n\nEVN uses hedges to manage earnings volatility. The underlying transaction and the hedge are designed to ensure a match between the parameters relevant for measurement (critical terms match). In order to gauge the effectiveness, the underlying transactions are recorded in the treasury management system as hypothetical derivates and evaluated to determine whether the relationship with the respective hedges was or will be effective. Possible sources of ineffectiveness are, for example, timing shifts or a change in the volume of an existing underlying transaction as well as adjustments for the credit risk of hedges and underlying transactions. All measures are based on internal guidelines.\n\nThe EVN Group applied the hedge accounting rules under IFRS 9 to hedge a bond issued in JPY (see note **50. Non-current loans and borrowings)** as well as for the hedging of the currency risk from the Umm Al Hayman wastewater treatment project. In addition, derivative financial instruments were used as part of cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the price risk from the planned future income from electricity sales at variable prices.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **JPY bond**\n\nThe hedge of the JPY bond primarily involves EUR/JPY cross-currency swaps. These cross-currency swaps (for a nominal value of JPY 12bn up to 15 January 2019 and for a nominal value of JPY 10bn since that date) represent a fair value hedge and are recorded and measured in the treasury management system, designated as a hedge and documented. The corresponding change in the bond liability from the hedge represents a contrary movement to the market value of the swaps. The results from the hedge of the JPY bond with cross-currency swaps totalled EUR 1.2m in 2022/23 (measurement of the bond EUR 9.5m and measurement of the swaps EUR –8.3m; previous year: earnings effect EUR 1.0m, including measurement of the bond EUR 7.8m and measurement of the swaps EUR –6.8m) and were recorded under other financial results. The market value was derived from the information available on the balance sheet date and based on the applicable bond price and exchange rate. A cross-currency swap for a nominal value of JPY 2bn was concluded to hedge the JPY bond through a settlement agreement with a bank. The related agreement entitled both parties to early termination in January 2019, and the cross-currency swap was terminated by the bank as of 15 January 2019. In connection with this termination, EVN dissolved the fair value hedge relationship and collected a settlement payment of EUR 0.6m. The interest rate-based fair value adjustment of the JPY bond related to the terminated EUR –1.2m swap will be released to profit or loss until the bond matures on 9 January 2024 (as of 30 September 2023: EUR –0.1m and as of 30 September 2022: EUR –0.3m).\n\n#### **Umm Al Hayman/Bahrain**\n\nEVN concluded forward exchange contracts to hedge the planned net foreign currency cash flows from the Umm Al Hayman project and, as of the 2022/23 financial year, also from the project in Bahrain. The expected payments are therefore fully hedged. A Group guideline requires the critical terms of these forward exchange contracts to reflect the hedged transaction as best as possible. The hedging does not result in any ineffectiveness if the expectations for the timing and amount remain unchanged.\n\nEVN establishes the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction based on the currency, amount and timing of the respective cash flows. The dollar-offset derivative method is used to evaluate whether the derivative designated in each hedge will presumably be, and was, effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows from the hedged transaction.\n\n#### **Portfolio hedge**\n\nEVN implements a portfolio hedge electricity to hedge the risk from the marketing of the Group's own electricity production. Under cash flow hedge accounting as defined by IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments (electricity forwards and electricity future contracts) used to hedge the price risk from planned future income from electricity sales are carried at variable prices. The underlying transaction represents the portfolio of future highly probable sales of electricity produced by the EVN Group in Austria.\n\nEvaluating the effectiveness of the hedge involves demonstrating an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument. In addition, the default risk may not have a dominant influence on the changes in value. The prospective effectiveness assessment principally takes place on a qualitative basis in accordance with the critical terms match method, which compares the key conditions of the hedging instrument with the underlying transaction. In order to minimise the risk of ineffectiveness from over-hedging, the hedges are not concluded for the total planned sales volumes. The major conditions between the hedging instruments and planned cash flows agree, and it is therefore assumed that the changes in the value of the hedging instruments will be offset in full by the changes in future cash flows. The hedged risks to which both the underlying transaction and hedging instrument are exposed therefore have an opposite influence on the value of the underlying transaction and hedging instrument.\n\nFor hedges of electricity deliveries to foreign markets, the change in the value of the hedging instruments may not always fully offset the change in the value of future cash flows. The higher liquidity on the German market has created a situation where increasingly futures are seeing concluded in this market. The electricity price in Austria consists of a German electricity price plus a DE/AT spread. The futures products concluded in Germany therefore represent a hedge for the price component included in the Austrian electricity prices.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the hedge and the underlying transaction take place on the same market, complete coverage is principally ensured between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument. If hedges are concluded on the German market due to a lack of sufficient liquidity, the risk component of the German price alone represents the underlying transaction for the hedging relationship – and in that way, achieves full coverage between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of hedges can lead to changes in the credit risk of the counterparty or to a reduction in the expected electricity delivery volume.\n\n|                                                                                            | Carrying<br>amount | Balance sheet position

Other obligations and risks**\n\nThe commitments entered into by EVN and the related risks are as follows:\n\n| Other obligations and risks                                                              |            |            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                                                     | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n| Guarantees in connection with energy transactions                                        | 208.6      | 82.5       |\n| Guarantees in connection with projects in the Environment Segment                        | 710.7      | 684.1      |\n| Guarantees related to the construction and operation of                                  |            |            |\n| Energy networks                                                                          | 4.0        | 2.0        |\n| Power plants                                                                             | 84.2       | 87.6       |\n| Order obligations for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment | 266.3      | 218.5      |\n| Further obligations arising from guarantees or other contractual contingent liabilities  | 0.1        | 0.1        |\n| Total                                                                                    | 1,273.9    | 1,074.8    |\n| thereof in connection with equity accounted investees                                    | 195.9      | 82.0       |\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nNeither provisions nor liabilities were recognised for the above-mentioned items because claims to the fulfilment of obligations or the actual occurrence of specific risks were not expected at the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared. The abovementioned obligations were contrasted by corresponding recourse claims of EUR 72.1m (previous year: EUR 21.2m).\n\nOther obligations and risks increased by EUR 199.1m to EUR 1,273.9m compared to 30 September 2022. This change mainly resulted from an increase in guarantees in connection with energy transactions, in guarantees for environmental projects as well as from an increase in scheduled orders for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. This was offset by a reduction in guarantees in connection with the construction and operation of power plants.\n\nContingent liabilities relating to guarantees in connection with energy transactions are recognised in the amount of the actual risk for EVN for those guarantees issued for the procurement or marketing of energy. This risk is measured by the changes between the stipulated price and the actual market price, whereby EVN is only exposed to procurement risks when market prices decline and to selling risks when market prices increase.\n\nAccordingly, fluctuations in market prices may lead to a change in the risk exposure after the balance sheet date. The risk assessment resulted in a contingent liability of EUR 208.6m as of 30 September 2023. The nominal volume of the guarantees underlying this assessment was EUR 538.5m. As of 31 October 2023, the market price risk was EUR 164.1m based on an underlying nominal volume of EUR 544.9m.\n\nVarious legal proceedings and lawsuits related to operating activities are pending or claims may be filed against EVN in the future. The attendant risks were analysed in relation to their probability of occurrence. The evaluation of possible claims showed that the legal proceedings and lawsuits, individually and as a whole, would not have a material negative effect on EVN's business, liquidity, profit or loss or financial position.\n\nAdditional obligations arising from guarantees and other contractual contingent liabilities consisted chiefly of outstanding capital contributions to affiliates as well as liabilities for affiliates' loans.\n\n#### **66. Information on transactions with related parties**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, transactions with related parties arise through direct or indirect control, significant influence or joint management. Related parties further include close family members of the respective natural persons. Key management personnel and their close family members are also considered to be related parties.\n\nEVN's related parties include all companies in the scope of consolidation, other subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that are not included in the consolidated financial statements, as well as people who are responsible for the planning, management and supervision of the Group's activities. In particular, related parties also include the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as their family members. A list of the Group companies can be found starting on page 115 under **EVN's investments.** \n\nThe province of Lower Austria holds 51.0% of the shares of EVN AG through NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten. Therefore, the province of Lower Austria and companies under its control or significant influence are classified as related parties of the EVN Group. Since the province of Lower Austria is a government-related entity which has control over EVN AG due to its majority shareholding, EVN has elected to apply the exemption provided by IAS 24.25. This exemption releases EVN from the requirement to disclose business transactions and outstanding balances with related parties when the related party is a government-related entity. The business transactions with companies under the control or significant influence of NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH are related mainly to the provision of electricity, natural gas, network and telecommunications services.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nNÖ Holding GmbH holds 100% of the shares in NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, which prepares and publishes consolidated financial statements.\n\nWiener Stadtwerke GmbH acquired 51,000,000 EVN shares on 5 August 2020. The closing of this transaction made the company, which is wholly owned by the city of Vienna, the second largest shareholder of EVN AG with an investment of 28.4%. Since the city of Vienna is a government-related entity which, based on the majority shareholding, can exercise significant influence over EVN AG, the exemption provided by IAS 24.25 was applied. This exemption permits the non-disclosure of business transactions and outstanding balances with related parties when the related pary is a government-related entity.\n\n#### **Transactions with related parties**\n\n#### **Main shareholder**\n\nEVN is part of a joint venture with NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH as the main shareholder and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH as the minority shareholder. A group and tax equalisation agreement was concluded to regulate the modalities. On the basis of this agreement, EVN has included further subsidiaries in this group of companies. This resulted in a current receivable of EUR 5.4m from NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: current liability of EUR 28.9m). All business relationships with the main shareholder or companies attributable to the main shareholder are carried out at arm's length.\n\n#### **Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH**\n\nBased on a syndicate agreement, EVN and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH together hold roughly 26% of the voting shares in Verbund AG through their direct and indirect investments (also see note **38. Other investments).**\n\nBased on the group and tax equalisation agreement, there is a current liability to Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH of EUR 3.1m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 8.8m).\n\nEnergieAllianz is a joint energy distribution company comprising Burgenland Energie, EVN and Wien Energie GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH. EVN holds 45% of the shares in EnergieAllianz, which is responsible for the trading and sale of electricity, natural gas and energy-related services for industrial, large-scale and business customers.\n\nEVN and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH jointly operate the project company EVN-Wien Energie Windparkentwicklungs- und Betriebs GmbH & Co KG through their respective subsidiaries, EVN Naturkraft and Wien Energie GmbH, each of which holds an investment of 50% as a limited partner. This company is responsible for the development, construction and operation of wind parks.\n\nFurther joint investments, which are immaterial in scope, exist between the EVN Group and/or subsidiaries controlled by Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH.\n\n#### **Investments in equity accounted investees**\n\nWithin the context of its ordinary business operations, EVN has concluded supply and service contracts with numerous companies included at equity in its consolidated financial statements. Long-term agreements were concluded with EnergieAllianz for the sale and procurement of electricity and natural gas, and long-term procurement contracts were concluded with Verbund Innkraftwerke for electricity.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe value of services provided to the investments in equity accounted investees listed above is as follows:\n\n| Transactions with joint ventures included at equity |         |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                                | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Revenue                                             | 527.2   | 449.1   |\n| Cost of services received                           | -153.5  | -144.5  |\n| Trade accounts receivable                           | 61.2    | 50.6    |\n| Receivables from cash pooling                       | 86.5    | –       |\n| Trade accounts payable                              | 28.8    | 120.1   |\n| Loans                                               | 7.4     | 11.5    |\n| Liabilities from cash pooling                       | –       | 8.2     |\n| Interest income from loans                          | 0.4     | 0.4     |\n\n| Transactions with associates included at equity |         |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                            | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Cost of services received                       | -48.1   | -16.2   |\n| Trade accounts payable                          | -       | 1.4     |\n\n#### **Transactions with related individuals**\n\n**Executive Board and Supervisory Board**\n\nThe payments to members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consist primarily of salaries, severance payments, pensions and Supervisory Board remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration paid to the active members of the Executive Board in 2022/23 totalled TEUR 1,360.2 (including compensation in kind and contributions to pension funds; previous year: TEUR 1,253.5).\n\n| Remuneration of the active Executive Board<br>TEUR<br>2022/23 |                       |                            | 2021/22                 |                       |                          |                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                               | Fixed<br>remuneration | Variable<br>remuneration1) | Compensation<br>in kind | Fixed<br>remuneration | Variable<br>remuneration | Compensation<br>in kind |\n| Stefan Szyszkowitz                                            | 477.4                 | 146.0                      | 3.5                     | 446.9                 | 127.4                    | 3.4                     |\n| Franz Mittermayer                                             | 445.5                 | 133.9                      | 14.2                    | 417.1                 | 114.4                    | 14.1                    |\n\n1) Corresponds to the amounts paid in the 2022/23 financial year; the variable remuneration depends on the achievement of targets. Details can be found in the remuneration report.\n\nIn addition, pension fund contributions made in 2022/23 equalled TEUR 72.6 for Stefan Szyszkowitz (previous year: TEUR 67.6) and TEUR 67.1 for Franz Mittermayer (previous year: TEUR 62.5).\n\nIn the 2022/23 financial year, the provision for pension obligations for Stefan Szyszkowitz resulted in an addition of TEUR 856.1 (of which TEUR 151.4 was interest expense and TEUR 568.3 was actuarial gains/losses). In the previous year, the change amounted to TEUR –2,313.9 (thereof TEUR 71.4 interest expense and TEUR –2,609.3 actuarial gains/losses). For Franz Mittermayer, there was an addition to the provision for pension obligations of TEUR 337.7 (of which TEUR 230.4 interest expense and TEUR 107.3 actuarial gains/losses). In the previous year, the change amounted to TEUR –1,707.4 (thereof TEUR 90.3 interest expense and TEUR –2,071.3 actuarial gains/losses).\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe addition to the provision for severance compensation on behalf of Stefan Szyszkowitz equalled TEUR 57.2 (thereof TEUR 10.3 interest expense and TEUR 38.7 of actuarial gains/losses). The change in the previous year equalled TEUR – 20.9 (thereof TEUR 2.8 interest expense and TEUR –32.7 of actuarial gains/losses). The addition to the provision for severance compensation on behalf of Franz Mittermayer equalled TEUR 44.8 (thereof TEUR 11.8 interest expense and TEUR 33.0 of actuarial gains/losses). The addition in the previous year equalled TEUR 23.0 (thereof TEUR 2.8 interest expense and TEUR 9.7 actuarial gains/losses).\n\nIn 2022/23 contributions of TEUR 9.6 (previous year: TEUR 8.8) were made to an external employee fund on behalf of Stefan Szyszkowitz and TEUR 9.1 (previous year: TEUR 8.3) on behalf of Franz Mittermayer.\n\nThe year-on-year change in the remuneration of the active members of the Executive Board is attributable primarily to the change in performance-based components and the annual wage and salary increases mandated by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are also entitled to a contractually agreed pension at retirement, whereby pension payments under the Austrian social security scheme and any payments from the VBV-Pensionskasse are credited against this amount.\n\nThe payments to former members of the Executive Board or their surviving dependents amounted to TEUR 1,034.4 in 2022/23 (previous year: TEUR 1,008.4).\n\nThe additions to the provisions for severance payments and pensions for active members of senior management totalled TEUR 545.5 (thereof TEUR 95.4 interest expense and TEUR 353.4 of actuarial gains/losses). The comparative amounts for the previous year included income of TEUR –1,006.6 (thereof TEUR 35.0 interest expense and TEUR –1,155.4 of actuarial gains/losses).\n\nContributions to the employee fund on behalf of active members of senior management totalled TEUR 19.9 in 2022/23 (previous year: TEUR 18.7) and pension fund contributions amounted to TEUR 337.8 (previous year: TEUR 412.8).\n\nThe above amounts include expenses recognised in accordance with national law, as required by the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. In accordance with IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recorded under other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration totalled TEUR 172.7 in 2022/23 (previous year: TEUR 156.7). The members of the Advisory Committee for Environmental and Social Responsibility received remuneration of TEUR 99.1 during the reporting year (previous year: TEUR 98.4).\n\nThe basic principles underlying the remuneration system are presented in the remuneration report, which is part of the corporate governance report.\n\n#### **Transactions with other related companies**\n\nThe disclosure requirements for the notes do not cover information on intragroup transactions. Therefore, business transactions between EVN and its subsidiaries are not reported. Business transactions with non-consolidated subsidiaries and companies not included at equity are generally not reported because they are immaterial.\n\nRelated parties can also be direct customers of a company within the EVN Group, whereby these business relationships reflect prevailing market rates and conditions and are immaterial in relation to the total income recorded by the EVN Group in 2022/23. The resulting items outstanding as of 30 September 2023 are reported under trade accounts receivable.\n\n#### **67.

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### **Key Audit Matters**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow are the key audit matters, from our viewpoint\n\n- Accounting of the large-scale project Umm Al Hayman in the international project business\n- Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in equity accounted investees\n\n#### **Accounting of the large-scale project Umm Al Hayman in the international project business**\n\n#### **Facts and references to further information**\n\nWith a contract volume of more than EUR 1.2 bn attributable to the Group, the Umm Al Hayman project is currently the largest construction project in EVN's international project division. The subject of this project is the design and construction of a sewage treatment plant or respectively a sewer network with pumping stations in Kuwait. Contract costs have been capitalised and will be amortised based on the project progress.\n\nRevenue is recognised over the period in which the term of the service was rendered, with the stage of completion being measured based on the cost incurred in relation to the expected total cost. As payments are denominated mainly in Kuwaiti dinar and US dollar, derivative financial instruments are used to hedge against exchange rate risks. IFRS 9 hedge accounting is applied, therefore, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Covid 19 pandemic, delays in supply chains as well as project modifications made at the customer`s request resulted in moderate delays, which need to be assessed and accounted for. Overall, the project is classified as significant in terms of value for the consolidated financial statements and requires the application of complex accounting methods.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe risk for the consolidated financial statements lies in the uncertainty of the assumptions and estimates needed to account for this large-scale project. These may result in misstatements in the consolidated statement of financial position or the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n#### **Auditing procedure**\n\nDuring our audit, we have obtained an understanding of the relevant processes and have tested the effectiveness of selected internal controls. Additionally, we have analysed the accounting instructions and files (accounting template) and have assessed them based on the underlying contracts. We have examined the application of the relevant accounting standards (in particular IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers and IFRS 9 – Financial instruments regarding hedge accounting). The recorded costs (third party and own work) have been critically reviewed and a detailed document examination on a sample basis was performed. We have inspected the cost and project reports and questioned the commercial and technical project managers on the current construction process. Finally, we also reconciled the cost element reports with the general ledger and the bookings were matched to the accounting templates.\n\n#### **Reference to further information**\n\nThe principles of revenue recognition for construction projects are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in section 20 (Revenue recognition) of the Accounting and valuation policies. Further information to this project can be found in section 23 Accounting estimates and forward-looking statements, in section 39 Other non-current assets regarding costs for obtaining contracts and in section 61 Risk management regarding foreign exchange risk.\n\n#### **Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in equity accounted investees Facts and reference to further information**\n\nIntangible assets, property, plant and equipment (PPE) and investments in equity accounted investees with a total carrying amount of EUR 5,600.3 mn account for 51% of total assets of the group as of 30 September, 2023.\n\nAccounting standards require an assessment to be made at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that the recoverable amount has decreased significantly. For those items of intangible assets, PPE and equity accounted investees, for which impairment losses were recognised in prior periods, the Group assesses whether the impairment loss no longer exists and therefore needs to be reversed.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment for which no separate future cash flows can be identified are tested for impairment at the level of the cash-generating units. By determining the value in use or, if necessary, the value less costs to sell, estimates must be made regarding the development of revenues and expenses and the resulting cash surpluses, as well as assumptions for determining the discount rate used.\n\nThe result of the valuation is therefore subject to estimation uncertainties. A change in the macroe-conomic, industry or corporate situation in the future may lead to a reduction in cashflows and thus to impairment losses. For the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk of incorrect valuation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investments in equity accounted investees.\n\n#### **Auditing procedure**\n\nDuring our audit, we have obtained an understanding of how the Group monitors impairment triggers. In doing so, we critically assessed the processes implemented to determine whether they are suitable for the valuation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investments in equity accounted investees. We also assessed the related key internal controls and evaluated their form and implementation. We critically assessed the triggers for impairments and reversals and have compared them with our own estimates.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have critically discussed and evaluated the underlying forecasts and assumptions for the valuation and assessed their appropriateness based on current and expected developments and other evidence. In consultation with our valuation specialists, we assessed the measurement technique model, planning assumptions and measurement parameter for selected issues, on which the discount rate is based. We assessed the appropriateness of planning estimates by comparing actual cash flows with prior period estimated cash flows on a sample basis and discussing deviations with staff responsible for planning. We agreed that the respective results of the valuations were properly accounted for.\n\n#### **Reference to further information**\n\nThe procedures and effects of impairment tests are described in section 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Further information can be found in section 23 Accounting estimates and forward-looking statements. The effects of impairment tests are presented in section 31 (Depreciation and amortisation and effects from impairment tests) and in sections 35 (Intangible assets), 36 (Property, plant and equipment) and 37 (Investments in equity accounted investees) of the notes to the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### **Other information**\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the Group's management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nWe received the consolidated non-financial report and the consolidated corporate governance report before the date of the auditor's report, and we expect to receive the remaining parts of the annual report after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and of the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU and with requirements stated in § 245a UGB, for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consoli-dated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n#### **Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n#### **Comments on the Group Management Report**\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Group management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether it was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the Group's management report in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing for the audit of the Group's management report.\n\n#### **Opinion**\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the valid legal requirements, comprising the details in accordance with § 243a UGB (Austrian Company Code) and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Statement**\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the thus obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the Group's management report came to our attention.\n\n#### **Additional information in accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation**\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the ordinary General Meeting on 2 February, 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on 3 February, 2023. We have been appointed to audit the consolidated financial statements without interruption since the 2020/21 financial year.\n\nWe confirm that the audit opinion in the section \"Report on the consolidated financial statements\" is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee referred to in article 11 of the EU regulation.\n\nWe declare that no prohibited non-audit services (article 5 par. 1 of the EU regulation) were provided by us and that we remained independent of the audited company in conducting the audit.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsible austrian certified public accountant**\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Mr. Gerhard Posautz, Certified Public Accountant.\n\nVienna, 21 November 2023\n\nBDO Assurance GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\n**Gerhard Posautz**\n\n**Gerhard Posautz Johannes Waltersam** Certified Auditor Certified Auditor\n\nThis report is a translation of the original report in German, which is solely valid.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **EVN AG Jahresabschluss 2022/23**\n\nnach UGB\n\n**EVN AG**\n\nEVN Platz 2344 Maria Enzersdorf Österreich\n\nSitz der Gesellschaft: 2344 Maria Enzersdorf Registriert Landesgericht Wr.

Vor diesem Hintergrund arbeitet die EU laufend an weiteren Gesetzesvorhaben, um einen verbindlichen Rechtsrahmen zur Erreichung dieser ambitionierten Ziele zu schaffen.\n\nIm März 2023 einigten sich die Mitgliedsstaaten auf die Grundlagen des Pakets für den Wasserstoffmarkt und den dekarbonisierten Gasmarkt. Es soll die wesentlichen Rahmenbedingungen für den sukzessiven Übergang von fossilem Erdgas hin zu erneuerbaren Gasen durch die Schaffung eines wettbewerbsfähigen Markts samt der dafür erforderlichen Infrastruktur regeln. Weitere wesentliche Inhalte sind die Regulierung der künftigen Wasserstoffnetze sowie die Verbesserung der Planungs- und Investitionssicherheit für Netze und Speicher.\n\nIm Mai 2023 trat eine neue EU-Richtlinie über die Reform des Emissionshandels in Kraft, die diesen ab 2027 auch auf den Verkehrs- und Gebäudesektor ausweitet. Die Einnahmen aus den neuen Bereichen des Emissionshandels sollen in einen Klima- und Sozialfonds fließen.\n\nIm Herbst 2023 einigten sich EU-Parlament und Rat auf eine Novelle der Erneuerbaren-Energien-Richtlinie (RED III), die deutlich ambitioniertere Ziele für den Anteil erneuerbarer Energien in der Wärme- und Kälteversorgung sowie in den Sektoren Gebäude, Industrie und Verkehr vorsieht. Für die Industrie bedeuten die neuen Ziele auch einen rascheren Umstieg auf erneuerbaren Wasserstoff. Zudem enthält die Richtlinie die Vorgabe, die Dauer der Planungs- und Genehmigungsverfahren für den Ausbau von Anlagen zur Erzeugung von erneuerbaren Energien, Netzen und Energiespeichern zu verkürzen.\n\nVor dem Hintergrund der durch den Ukrainekrieg ausgelösten Energiekrise legte die EU-Kommission 2023 einen Entwurf für ein neues Strommarktdesign vor. Ein wesentliches Ziel der Reformbestrebungen ist es, die negativen Auswirkungen von extremen Preisschwankungen auf den EU-Markt und letztlich auf die Verbraucher einzudämmen. Als eine wesentliche Maßnahme soll künftig für Investitionen in Anlagen zur Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren bzw. nichtfossilen Quellen die Übernahme von Marktpreisrisiken durch den Staat ermöglicht werden. Dies soll einerseits den Kraftwerksbetreibern Investitionssicherheit bieten, andererseits sollen Verbraucher bei steigenden Marktpreisen entlastet werden können. Ermöglicht werden soll das durch den Abschluss sogenannter energiewirtschaftlicher Differenzverträge (Contracts for Difference) zwischen Stromproduzenten und den EU-Mitgliedsstaaten. Die EU ist bestrebt, dass das Gesetzespaket zum Strommarktdesign noch vor den EU-Wahlen im Jahr 2024 beschlossen wird.\n\n## **Österreich**\n\nIn Österreich enthält das im Juli 2021 beschlossene Erneuerbaren-Ausbau-Gesetz (EAG) konkrete Ausbauziele. Bis 2030 soll die erneuerbare Stromerzeugung um insgesamt 27 TWh pro Jahr gesteigert werden, davon sollen 11 TWh auf Photovoltaik, 10 TWh auf Windkraft, 5 TWh auf Wasserkraft und 1 TWh auf Biomasse entfallen.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nZu den für die Aktivitäten der EVN besonders relevanten Inhalten des EAG zählen die Fördermechanismen für die Errichtung neuer erneuerbarer Erzeugungsanlagen sowie Investitionszuschüsse für Elektrolyseanlagen zur Umwandlung von Strom in Wasserstoff oder synthetisches Gas. Darüber hinaus sollen die Investitionssicherheit für bestehende und zukünftige Anlagen zur Erzeugung von erneuerbarem Gas gewährleistet und der Anteil von national produziertem erneuerbarem Gas am österreichischen Gasabsatz bis 2030 auf 5 TWh p. a. erhöht werden. Weitere relevante Inhalte sind die Rahmenbedingungen für Bürgerenergiegemeinschaften und Erneuerbare-Energie-Gemeinschaften.\n\nIm März 2023 wurden durch eine Novelle des Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfungsgesetzes Verfahrenserleichterungen sowie Maßnahmen zur Beschleunigung der Genehmigung für Vorhaben der Energiewende beschlossen.\n\nIm Juni 2023 erfolgte mit der Novelle des Bundes-Energieeffizienzgesetzes die Umsetzung der Energieeffizienz-Richtlinie der EU in Österreich.\n\nIm Oktober 2023 einigte sich die Bundesregierung auf die Inhalte für ein neues Erneuerbare-Wärme-Gesetz, das insbesondere ein Verbot der Errichtung neuer Heizungsanlagen auf Basis fossiler Brennstoffe in Neubauten für Haushalte vorsieht. Ebenfalls im Oktober 2023 beschloss der österreichische Nationalrat im Rahmen einer Gesetzesnovelle einen höheren Standard für die Gasbevorratung. Demnach müssen Gaslieferanten zur Gewährleistung der Versorgungssicherheit künftig einen Versorgungsstandard von 45 Tagen (statt bisher 30 Tagen) gewährleisten. Neu eingeführt wurde auch ein Bevorratungsstandard für Gaskraftwerke (inkl. Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungsanlagen). Zudem wurde die Verlängerung des Vorhaltens der strategischen Gasreserve bis 2026 beschlossen.\n\nDas Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie arbeitet zur Umsetzung der Strombinnenmarktrichtlinie sowie der Erneuerbaren-Richtlinie der EU aktuell am Elektrizitätswirtschaftsgesetz (ElWG), das auch das bestehende Elektrizitätswirtschafts- und -organisationsgesetz (ElWOG) ersetzen soll. Vom ElWG werden somit u. a. klare Regelungen zu Energiegemeinschaften (z. B. in Bezug auf den Betrieb von Speichern) ebenso erwartet wie neue Regelungen für Netzbetreiber (z. B. in Bezug auf die vereinfachte Nutzung von Smart-Meter-Daten für die Planung von Netzflexibilitäten). Auch zusätzliche Konsumentenschutzbestimmungen sollen Eingang in das ElWG finden.\n\n## Bundesgesetz über den Energiekrisenbeitrag-Strom\n\nIn Österreich trat – in Umsetzung einer im Herbst 2022 beschlossenen EU-Verordnung über zeitlich befristete Notfallmaßnahmen – für den Zeitraum 1. Dezember 2022 bis 31. Dezember 2023 das Bundesgesetz über den Energiekrisenbeitrag-Strom in Kraft. Primäres Ziel der EU-Verordnung und der darauf beruhenden nationalstaatlichen Gesetze war es, temporär auf die massiven Verwerfungen auf den internationalen Energiemärkten und die daraus resultierenden Auswirkungen auf die europäische Gesellschaft und Volkswirtschaft zu reagieren. Konkret sollten die Mitgliedsstaaten zur Einhebung einer Solidaritätsabgabe auf Grundlage gestiegener Markterlöse in der Stromerzeugung sowie aus dem Erdöl-, Kohleund Raffineriebereich ermächtigt werden. Die Einnahmen sollten verwendet werden, um Endkunden wie Haushalte sowie kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen angesichts der hohen Energiepreise finanziell zu entlasten.\n\nDas österreichische Bundesgesetz über den Energiekrisenbeitrag-Strom sieht die Abschöpfung von 90 % der Überschusserlöse aus der Stromerzeugung vor. Der Schwellenwert zur Ermittlung der Überschusserlöse lag im Zeitraum 1. Dezember 2022 bis 31. Mai 2023 bei 140 Euro pro MWh bzw. bis zu 176 Euro pro MWh unter Berücksichtigung der anrechenbaren Investitionen in erneuerbare Energien und Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen. Ab 1. Juni 2023 wurde der Schwellenwert aufgrund der mittlerweile gesunkenen Großhandelspreise für Strom auf 120 Euro pro MWh bzw. bis zu 156 Euro pro MWh reduziert.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **WIRTSCHAFTLICHES UMFELD**\n\nNachdem die Weltwirtschaft im Lauf des Jahres 2022 bereits deutlich an Schwung verloren hatte, setzte sich dieser Trend 2023 fort. Im Vorjahr hatte die Energiekrise und der damit verbundene, teilweise drastische Anstieg der Marktpreise für Strom und Erdgas Europa stärker getroffen als die USA, wo die Konjunktur trotz der ausgeprägten Straffung der Geldpolitik robust blieb. Mit einem Plus von 3,3 % fiel das Wachstum in der Eurozone damit 2022 nur moderat aus. Aktuell gehen die Ökonomen mehrheitlich davon aus, dass die in einigen wenigen Ländern einsetzende Rezession von kurzer Dauer sein wird und die Konjunktur sich im nächsten Jahr allgemein wieder verbessern wird. Diese Annahme beruht auf dem im Vergleich zu den Höchstständen deutlichen Rückgang der Energiepreise, den durch die nachlassende Inflation steigenden Realeinkommen sowie auf dem verbesserten weltwirtschaftlichen Umfeld. Für die Eurozone werden für 2023 BIP-Wachstumsraten zwischen 0,4 und 1,1 % bzw. zwischen 1,2 und 1,6 % für 2024 erwartet.\n\nDie österreichische Volkswirtschaft befindet sich gegenwärtig im Sog des internationalen Konjunkturabschwungs in einer Rezession. Nach einem Anstieg um 4,8 % im Jahr 2022 dürfte die Wirtschaftsleistung 2023 um bis zu 0,8 % schrumpfen. Hauptfaktoren dafür sind die Belastungen durch die überdurchschnittlich hohe Inflation, die restriktive Geldpolitik sowie die schwache internationale Wirtschaftsentwicklung. Hinzu kommen eine geringere gesamtwirtschaftliche Nachfrage nach den coronabedingten Aufholeffekten sowie die schwächere wirtschaftliche Entwicklung gerade in den Nachbarländern. Die Industrie leidet unter einem Rückgang bei den Aufträgen und hohem Kostendruck. Für das nächste Jahr wird jedoch eine Belebung der Weltwirtschaft und ein von steigenden Realeinkommen getragenes Wachstum des privaten Konsums erwartet. Damit dürfte das BIP 2024 auch in Österreich etwa um 0,8 bis 1,6 % steigen.\n\n## **ENERGIEWIRTSCHAFTLICHES UMFELD**\n\n|                                                                           |           | 2021/22<br>IST | 2022/23<br>IST |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| Primärenergie und CO2-Zertifikate                                         |           |                |                |\n| Rohölpreis - Brent                                                        | EUR/bbl   | 89,5           | 78,8           |\n| Gaspreis - NCG                                                            | EUR/MWh   | 123,1          | 56,4           |\n| Kohle - API#2                                                             | EUR/Tonne | 258,8          | 150,4          |\n| CO2 - Zertifikate EUA                                                     | EUR/Tonne | 78,0           | 84,2           |\n| Strom - Spot/Forwardmarkt (AT) - \"IST = Spotpreise; Plan = Forwardpreise\" |           |                |                |\n| EEX Grundlaststrom                                                        | EUR/MWh   | 258,7          | 134,4          |\n| EEX Spitzenlaststrom                                                      | EUR/MWh   | 296,3          | 154,8          |\n\nDas Energiegeschäft der EVN ist wesentlich durch externe Einflussfaktoren geprägt. Bei den Haushaltskunden geht vor allem von der Witterung ein starker Einfluss auf die Nachfrage nach Strom, Erdgas und Wärme aus. Die Nachfrage der Industriekunden wiederum ist primär durch die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung bestimmt. Seit Beginn des Ukrainekriegs und der dadurch ausgelösten Energiekrise spielen zudem die Energiesparmaßnahmen, mit denen viele Kunden auf die gestiegenen Energiepreise reagieren, eine wesentliche Rolle. Auch die Marktpreise und damit die Beschaffungspreise der EVN hängen vom geopolitischen Umfeld ab. Für die Energieerzeugung sind das Wind- und Wasserdargebot sowie die Sonneneinstrahlung relevant.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 war der Witterungsverlauf in allen drei Kernmärkten der EVN von milden Temperaturen geprägt. Die Heizgradsumme – sie definiert den temperaturbedingten Energiebedarf – lag in Österreich leicht, in Bulgarien und Nordmazedonien deutlich unter\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\ndem langjährigen Durchschnitt. In Bulgarien erreichte sie sogar nur 77,7 % des üblichen Mittelwerts. Zum Unterschied davon waren die Heizgradsummen im Vorjahr in allen drei Ländern deutlich über dem langjährigen Durchschnitt gelegen.\n\nDie Kühlgradsumme, die den Energiebedarf für Kühlung bemisst, stieg im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 in allen drei Kernmärkten im Vergleich zum Vorjahr deutlich an. In Österreich kam sie leicht, in Bulgarien und Nordmazedonien deutlich über dem langjährigen Durchschnitt zu liegen.\n\nNach den massiven Schwankungen und Verwerfungen im vorangegangenen Geschäftsjahr waren die Primärenergie- und Energiepreise in der Berichtsperiode vor allem während der Sommermonate wieder rückläufig. So halbierte sich der durchschnittliche EEX-Börsepreis für Erdgas von zuvor 123,1 Euro pro MWh auf rund 56,4 Euro pro MWh. Gegen Ende des Berichtsjahres zeichnete sich hier allerdings wieder ein gegenläufiger Trend ab. Eine Ausnahme bildeten die Preise für CO2-Emissionszertifikate: Ihr Preis unterlag zwar geringeren Schwankungen, lag im Schnitt aber mit 84,2 Euro pro Tonne im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 um rund 8 % über dem Vorjahreswert von 78,0 Euro pro Tonne.\n\nDies wirkte sich auch auf die Marktpreise für Strom entsprechend aus: Sie verzeichneten im Berichtsjahr zwar einen deutlichen Rückgang, blieben aber dennoch auf hohem Niveau: Die Spotmarktpreise für Grund- und Spitzenlaststrom lagen bei durchschnittlich 134,4 Euro pro MWh bzw. 154,8 Euro pro MWH (Vorjahr: 258,7 Euro pro MWh bzw. 296,3 Euro pro MWh).\n\n## **WIRTSCHAFTLICHE ENTWICKLUNG**\n\n## **Kennzahlen zur Ertragslage**\n\n|              | 2022/23  | 2021/22  | Veränderung |       |\n|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|-------|\n|              | Mio.

EUR und setzen sich aus Stromerlösen in Höhe von 485,4 Mio. EUR (VJ: 550,3 Mio. EUR), Gaserlösen in Höhe von 242,0 Mio. EUR (VJ: 55,9 Mio. EUR) und sonstigen Umsatzerlösen in Höhe von 209,0 Mio. EUR (VJ: 184,0 Mio. EUR) zusammen.\n\nDie Stromerlöse sanken gegenüber dem Vorjahr um 64,9 Mio. EUR, während die Gaserlöse um 186,0 Mio. EUR und die sonstigen Umsatzerlöse um 25,0 Mio. EUR stiegen. Die Stromerlöse sanken trotz höherer Energieabsatzpreise, was in erster Linie auf positive Effekte aus Absicherungsgeschäften im Vorjahr und gesunkene Erlöse aus dem CO2- Zertifikatehandel zurückzuführen ist. Der Anstieg der Gaserlöse resultiert hauptsächlich aus gestiegenen Absatzpreisen und Arbitragegeschäften zur Optimierung der Nutzung der zur Verfügung stehenden Gasspeicherkapazitäten. Die Preiseffekte gegenüber dem Vorjahr sind also sowohl im Strom- als auch im Gasbereich der Marktpreisentwicklung entgegengesetzt.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nDas begründet sich daraus, dass die EVN AG den Großteil ihrer absatz- und beschaffungsseitigen Geschäfte mehrere Monate im Voraus kontrahiert.\n\n|                                       | Berechnung                                                                                | 2022/23  | 2021/22  | Veränderung |       |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-------------|-------|\n|                                       |                                                                                           | Mio.

EUR (Vorjahr: 48,4 Mio. EUR). Der Rückgang ist auf den Wegfall von Einmaleffekten aus der Auflösung von Rückstellungen im Vorjahr und auf positive Effekte aus Absicherungsgeschäften im Vorjahr zurückzuführen.\n\nDie Aufwendungen für Primärenergie, CO2-Kosten und Strombezug betrugen im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr 682,5 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 564,7 Mio. EUR). Der Anstieg ist in erster Linie auf einen preisbedingten Anstieg der Aufwendungen für Strom- und Gasbezug zurückzuführen. Dieser Effekt wird abgeschwächt durch gesunkene Aufwendungen für CO2 Zertifikate und positive Effekte aus beschaffungsseitigen Derivaten.\n\nAn Materialaufwand und sonstigen bezogenen Leistungen fielen 105,5 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 91,9 Mio. EUR) an. Dies bedeutet gegenüber dem Vorjahr einen Anstieg von 13,6 Mio. EUR.\n\nDer Personalaufwand betrug im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 96,6 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 73,5 Mio. EUR) und ist insbesondere aufgrund von kollektivvertraglichen Anpassungen und Rückstellungsbildungen gegenüber dem Vorjahr gestiegen. Bei der EVN AG waren durchschnittlich 561 Angestellte auf Vollzeitbasis (Vorjahr: 546 Angestellte) beschäftigt. Daraus resultierte ein Personalaufwand pro Mitarbeiter von 0,2 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 0,1 Mio. EUR). Der Umsatz pro Mitarbeiter betrug 1,7 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 1,4 Mio. EUR).\n\nDie Abschreibungen betrugen im Berichtszeitraum 6,5 Mio. EUR und sind damit um 0,1 Mio. EUR höher als im Vorjahr.\n\nDie sonstigen betrieblichen Aufwendungen beliefen sich auf 31,4 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr 27,6 Mio. EUR).\n\nAufgrund der oben angeführten Rahmenbedingungen verzeichnete die EVN AG ein positives Betriebsergebnis in Höhe von 15,1 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr 74,0 Mio. EUR).\n\nDas Finanzergebnis ist vor allem durch Beteiligungserträge, Zinsaufwendungen und -erträge, Wertpapiererträgen und Aufwendungen aus Finanzanlagen geprägt. Das Beteiligungsergebnis stieg gegenüber dem Vorjahr von 300,5 Mio. EUR auf 431,1 Mio. EUR, getrieben durch die höhere Verbund-Dividende. Die sonstigen Zinsen und ähnlichen Erträgen beliefen sich auf 29,6 Mio. EUR (VJ: 8,7 Mio. EUR). Die Erträge aus dem Abgang von und der Zuschreibung zu Finanzanlagen sanken auf 1,9 Mio. EUR (VJ: 8,7 Mio. EUR). Die Aufwendungen aus Finanzanlagen und aus Wertpapieren des Umlaufvermögens stiegen vor allem wegen höherer Abschreibungen auf Anteile an verbundenen Unternehmen auf 33,8 Mio. EUR (VJ: 24,5 Mio. EUR). Die Zinsen und ähnlichen Aufwendungen betrugen im Geschäftsjahr 69,0 Mio. EUR (VJ: 34,6 Mio. EUR).\n\nInsgesamt konnte ein Finanzergebnis in Höhe von 389,6 Mio. EUR erzielt werden, welches um 112,9 Mio. EUR oder 40,8 % über dem Vorjahr liegt.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie beschriebenen Entwicklungen führten zu einem Ergebnis vor Steuern von 404,7 Mio. EUR. Dies bedeutet einen Anstieg von 54,0 Mio. EUR. Das Ergebnis vor Zinsen und Steuern erhöhte sich um 88,4 Mio. EUR auf 473,8 Mio. EUR.\n\n|                          | Berechnung                                              | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                          |                                                         | %       | %       |\n| Eigenkapitalrentabilität | Ergebnis vor Steuern<br>durchschnittliches Eigenkapital | 14,6%   | 14,2%   |\n\nDie Eigenkapitalrentabilität belief sich im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 auf 14,6%.

EUR belief sich der Cashflow aus dem Ergebnis im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr auf 541,5 Mio. EUR und der Cashflow aus der laufenden Geschäftstätigkeit auf 402,5 Mio. EUR.\n\nDer Cashflow aus der Investitionstätigkeit betrug -536,4 Mio. EUR, wobei die Veränderung zum Vorjahr vor allem auf höhere Investitionen in Finanzanlagen bei geringeren Einzahlungen aus Anlagenabgängen zurückzuführen ist.\n\nAusgehend von der im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 durchgeführten Ausschüttung aus dem Bilanzgewinn 2021/22 in Höhe von 92,7 Mio. EUR und einem Anstieg der Finanzverbindlichkeiten weist die EVN AG einen Cashflow aus der Finanzierungstätigkeit in Höhe von 10,6 Mio. EUR aus.\n\nInsgesamt resultierte aus dieser Entwicklung eine Reduktion des Finanzmittelbestandes (bestehend aus Forderungen aus Cash Pooling, Taggeldguthaben bei Kreditinstituten und Wertpapieren des Umlaufvermögens) von -123,8 Mio. EUR. Die Veränderung der Verbindlichkeiten aus Cash Pooling werden im Cashflow aus der Finanzierungstätigkeit ausgewiesen.\n\n## **Zweigniederlassungen**\n\nEVN verfügt über keine Zweigniederlassungen im Sinne des § 243 Abs 3 Z 4 UGB.\n\n## **Innovation, Forschung und Entwicklung**\n\nDie Handlungsfelder der Wesentlichkeitsmatrix der EVN geben auch den Themenrahmen für die Innovations-, Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivitäten der Gruppe vor. In diesem Sinn verfolgt die EVN primär Projekte zur Gewährleistung der Versorgungssicherheit, zur Schonung von Klima und Umwelt sowie zur Stärkung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit des Unternehmens. Übergeordnetes Kriterium ist bei allen Projekten die Anforderung, einen konkreten Kundennutzen zu erbringen.\n\nIn der Berichtsperiode hat die EVN insgesamt 1,0 Mio. Euro (Vorjahr: 1,8 Mio. Euro) für Innovations-, Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekte aufgewendet. Für diese Projekte wurden Förderungen in Anspruch genommen, die einer Förderquote von 11,0 % entsprechen.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nEin wesentlicher Schwerpunkt in den Innovationsaktivitäten der EVN gilt Lösungen zur Speicherung erneuerbarer Überschussproduktion für Perioden mit geringer Energieerzeugung aus erneuerbaren Quellen. Besonders in saisonaler Hinsicht ist dies die zu lösende Herausforderung für ein CO2-freies Energiesystem. Denn während die Stromerzeugung aus Windkraft und Photovoltaik im Sommerhalbjahr dank des forcierten Ausbaus mittlerweile häufig die Nachfrage deutlich übersteigt, können Perioden mit geringem Wasser-, Wind- und Sonnenaufkommen in Zentraleuropa – vor allem im Winterhalbjahr – zu herausfordernden Situationen für die Versorgungssicherheit führen. Vor diesem Hintergrund engagiert sich die EVN z. B. als Projektpartner der RAG bei einer Pilotanlage, die Sonnenenergie zum Betrieb einer Elektrolyseanlage nutzt. Der dadurch produzierte grüne Wasserstoff wird in eine natürliche Erdgasspeicherspeicherstätte der RAG eingespeichert und kann im Winter zur emissionsfreien Energie- bzw. Wärmeerzeugung genutzt werden. In anderen Projekten forscht die EVN an Möglichkeiten, Überschussproduktion aus erneuerbaren Quellen für sektorenübergreifende Zwecke oder zur Substitution thermischer Erzeugung zu nutzen. Ein Beispiel ist der Pilot-Hybridspeicher Theiß, eine Kombination eines Wärmespeichers mit einem 5-MW-Batteriespeicher und einer Photovoltaikanlage.\n\nWeitere Forschungsschwerpunkte der EVN betreffen innovative Ansätze zur vermehrten Nutzung von Flexibilitäten verschiedener Abnehmer und kleinerer Stromproduzenten, um die Energienachfrage zeitlich so zu verändern, dass Nachfragespitzen vermieden und der Bedarf mit den gerade verfügbaren Energiemengen aus erneuerbarer Produktion gedeckt werden kann. Beiträge leisten in diesem Bereich etwa die 2022 von der EVN erworbene Tochtergesellschaft CyberGrid mit speziellen IT-Lösungen zum Flexibilitätsmanagement von Stromnetzen sowie Einzelprojekte (z. B. solche zum bidirektionalen Laden von E-Fahrzeugen) im Rahmen des Green Energy Lab, eines branchenübergreifenden Innovationslabors.\n\n## **Risikomanagement**\n\n## **Risikodefinition**\n\nIm EVN Konzern ist Risiko als die potenzielle Abweichung von geplanten Unternehmenszielen definiert.\n\n## **Risikomanagementprozess**\n\nPrimäres Ziel des Risikomanagements ist die gezielte Sicherung bestehender und zukünftiger Ertrags- und Cash-Flow-Potenziale durch aktive Risikosteuerung. Dazu stellt ein zentral organisiertes Risikomanagement den dezentralen Risikoverantwortlichen im Rahmen des Risikomanagementprozesses geeignete Methoden und Werkzeuge zur Identifikation und Bewertung von Risiken zur Verfügung. Die risikoverantwortlichen Geschäftseinheiten kommunizieren ihre Risikopositionen an das zentrale Risikomanagement. Hier werden geeignete Maßnahmen zur Risikominimierung definiert, für deren Umsetzung wiederum die dezentralen Geschäftseinheiten verantwortlich sind. Ebenso erfolgt hier die Analyse des Risikoprofils der EVN. Die jährliche Erfassung und das Management von Risiken mit Bezug auf Nachhaltigkeit, Klima und Compliance erfolgen im Einklang mit dem zentralen Risikomanagementprozess durch darauf spezialisierte Organisationseinheiten bzw. Prozesse. Insgesamt umfasst der Risikomanagementprozess der EVN die folgenden Schritte:\n\n• **Identifikation:** Erhebung bzw. Überarbeitung der Risiken auf Basis der letzten Risikoinventur (Review des Risikoinventars) und Identifikation von neuen Risiken und entsprechenden Risikosteuerungsmaßnahmen\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **Bewertung und Analyse:** Qualitative und quantitative Bewertung der identifizierten Risiken, Aggregation der Risiken nach unterschiedlichen Betrachtungsperspektiven und Modellierung der Ergebnis- und Cash-Flow-Verteilungen\n- **Berichterstattung:** Diskussion und Beurteilung des Risikoprofils im Risikoarbeitsausschuss und im Konzernrisikoausschuss sowie gegebenenfalls Einleitung von weiteren Risikosteuerungsmaßnahmen; Risikoberichterstattung an den Prüfungsausschuss\n- **Prozess-Review:** Definition jener organisatorischen Einheiten, die einer expliziten Risikobetrachtung zu unterziehen sind; regelmäßige Überprüfung, ob die festgelegten Methoden bei geänderten Verhältnissen modifiziert werden müssen; regelmäßige Prüfung durch die Interne Revision\n\n## **Aufgaben des Risikoarbeitsausschusses**\n\nDer Risikoarbeitsausschuss unterstützt das zentrale Risikomanagement bei der ordnungsgemäßen Umsetzung des Risikomanagementprozesses. Er beurteilt und genehmigt Änderungen in Bezug auf die (Bewertungs-)Methodik und definiert Art und Umfang der Risikoberichterstattung. Mitglieder des Risikoarbeitsausschusses auf Konzernebene sind die Leiter der Konzernfunktionen Controlling, Recht und Public Affairs, Finanzwesen, Rechnungswesen, Interne Revision, der Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) sowie ein (unternehmensinterner) energiewirtschaftlicher Experte.\n\n## **Konzernrisikoausschuss und Kontrolle**\n\nIm Konzernrisikoausschuss, der aus dem Vorstand der EVN AG, den Leitern der Organisationseinheiten und den Mitgliedern des Risikoarbeitsausschusses besteht, werden die Ergebnisse der Risikoinventur sowie die Berichte präsentiert und diskutiert. Er entscheidet über den weiteren Handlungsbedarf, kann Arbeitsgruppen einberufen sowie Arbeitsaufträge erteilen und verabschiedet die Ergebnisse der Risikoinventur (Risikoberichte).\n\n## **Risikoprofil**\n\nNeben den branchenüblichen Risiken und Ungewissheiten ist das Risikoprofil der EVN vor allem durch politische, rechtliche und regulatorische Herausforderungen und Veränderungen im Wettbewerbsumfeld geprägt. Im Rahmen der jährlich durchgeführten Risikoinventur, deren Ergebnisse im Bedarfsfall um Ad-hoc-Risikomeldungen aktualisiert werden, erfolgt eine Kategorisierung in Markt- und Wettbewerbs-, Finanz-, Betriebs-, Umfeld-, Strategie- und Planungsrisiken sowie sonstige Risiken. Diese werden großteils bezüglich ihrer finanziellen Auswirkungen auf den EVN Konzern bewertet. In der nachfolgenden Tabelle werden die entsprechend diesen Kategorien ermittelten wesentlichen Risiken sowie Maßnahmen zu deren Minimierung beschrieben.\n\nIn der Risikoinventur werden in der EVN im Sinn des NaDiVeG sowohl potenzielle Risiken als auch Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN und ihrer Geschäftsbeziehungen auf Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelange, die Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Bekämpfung von Korruption systematisch erhoben. Die identifizierten Risiken bzw. Auswirkungen wurden entsprechend den im Risikomanagementprozess vorgesehenen Schritten weiter behandelt.\n\n## **Potenzielle Klimarisiken**\n\nAngesichts des hohen Stellenwerts des Themas Klimaschutz bei der EVN werden im Zuge der Risikoinventur gezielt auch potenzielle Klimarisiken erhoben. Klimarisiko ist jedoch bewusst nicht als eigene Risikokategorie definiert, sondern wird – sofern zutreffend – als Querschnittsmaterie den einzelnen Risikokategorien der EVN zugeordnet. Dabei wird zwischen Transitionsrisiken und physischen Risiken unterschieden.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nZu den Transitionsrisiken zählen Unsicherheiten, die aus dem Übergang in Richtung eines erneuerbaren Energiesystems resultieren. Physische Risiken betreffen hingegen Ereignisse und Veränderungen, die unmittelbare klimatische Ursachen haben.\n\nIm Folgenden einige Beispiele, die die Zuordnung potenzieller Klimarisiken zu den Risikokategorien der EVN illustrieren:\n\n- Nachfragerückgang aufgrund eines milderen Winters: physisches Risiko, das der Kategorie Deckungsbeitragsrisiko zugeordnet wird\n- Rückgang der Stromproduktion durch ein klimabedingt geringes Wasserdargebot: physisches Risiko, das der Kategorie Deckungsbeitragsrisiko zugeordnet wird\n- Schaden durch ein Extremwetterereignis: physisches Risiko, das der Kategorie Störungen/Netzausfall zugeordnet wird\n- Änderung von Umweltauflagen: Transitionsrisiko, das der Kategorie Umfeldrisiko zugeordnet wird; strengere Auflagen könnten potenziell Mehrkosten verursachen\n- Zunehmende Belastung für das Stromnetz durch den laufenden Ausbau der deutlich volatileren, erneuerbaren Erzeugung: Transitionsrisiko, das der Kategorie Betriebsrisiko (Störungen/Netzausfall) zugeordnet wird\n\n## **Risiko- und Chancenanalysen im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23**\n\nVor dem Hintergrund der geopolitischen Krisen während der vergangenen beiden Jahre und der daraus resultierenden Verwerfungen auf den Energiemärkten führt EVN auch unterjährig ein engmaschiges Monitoring der Risikoentwicklung für die Gruppe durch. Adhoc-Analysen waren im Berichtszeitraum nicht erforderlich, es erfolgte jedoch zum Ende des ersten Halbjahres 2022/23 eine Aktualisierung der Bewertung der wesentlichen Risiken mit potenziell hohen Auswirkungen. Das Risikomanagement berichtete über diese Risiken sowie deren Auswirkungen auch dem Prüfungsausschuss des Aufsichtsrats der EVN.\n\nIn der zum Bilanzstichtag durchgeführten Risikoinventur wurden u. a. folgende wesentliche Unsicherheiten mit potenziell hohen Auswirkungen identifiziert und folglich mit besonderem Augenmerk analysiert (Auswahl):\n\n- Margenrisiko und Wettbewerbssituation; Weitergabemöglichkeit der Energiebeschaffungskosten an Endkunden\n- Inflationsbedingt steigende Beschaffungskosten für Investitionen und Instandhaltungsmaßnahmen\n- Fertigstellungsrisiko bei internationalen Großprojekten im Umweltbereich\n- Cybersecurity\n\nDas Risikoprofil des EVN Konzerns ist vor allem durch die branchenüblichen Risiken und Ungewissheiten und insbesondere durch politische, rechtliche und regulatorische Herausforderungen geprägt. Die Kategorisierung all dieser Aspekte folgt dem Risikomanagementprozess der EVN.\n\n## **Wesentliche Merkmale des internen Kontroll- und -Risikomanagementsystems im Hinblick auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess**\n\nDie Einrichtung eines angemessenen internen Kontroll- und Risikomanagementsystems (IKS) im Hinblick auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess liegt gemäß § 82 AktG in der Verantwortung des Vorstands und ist gemäß § 92 Abs. 4a Z. 4b AktG vom Prüfungsausschuss auf seine Wirksamkeit hin zu überwachen.\n\nDas IKS für den Rechnungslegungsprozess der EVN wird durch Kontrollen der identifizierten risikobehafteten Prozesse in regelmäßigen Abständen überwacht, und die Ergebnisse daraus werden dem Management und dem Prüfungsausschuss berichtet. Das IKS gewährleistet klare Zuständigkeiten und eliminiert überflüssige Prozessschritte, wodurch die Sicherheit in den Abläufen für die Erstellung der Finanzberichterstattung weiter erhöht wird.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie Beschreibung der wesentlichen Merkmale besteht aus den fünf zusammenhängenden Komponenten Kontrollumfeld, Risikobeurteilung, Kontrollmaßnahmen, Information und Kommunikation sowie Überwachung.\n\n## **Kontrollumfeld**\n\nDer von der EVN festgelegte Verhaltenskodex und die darin zugrunde gelegten Wertvorstellungen gelten für alle Mitarbeiter des gesamten Konzerns. Zum EVN Verhaltenskodex siehe www.evn.at/verhaltenskodex.\n\nDie Erstellung des Jahresabschlusses erfolgt durch die kaufmännischen Konzernfunktionen der EVN. Der Abschlussprozess der EVN basiert auf einer einheitlichen Bilanzierungsrichtlinie, die neben den Bilanzierungsvorschriften auch die wesentlichen Prozesse und Termine konzernweit festlegt. Für die konzerninternen Abstimmungen und die sonstigen Abschlussarbeiten bestehen verbindliche Anweisungen. Die am Rechnungslegungsprozess beteiligten Mitarbeiter erfüllen die qualitativen Anforderungen und werden regelmäßig geschult. Komplexe versicherungsmathematische Gutachten und Bewertungen werden durch darauf spezialisierte Dienstleister oder qualifizierte Mitarbeiter erstellt. Für die Einhaltung der Prozesse sowie der korrespondierenden Kontrollmaßnahmen sind die jeweiligen Prozessverantwortlichen – das sind im Wesentlichen die Leiter der Organisationseinheiten sowie der Konzernfunktionen – verantwortlich.\n\n## **Risikobeurteilung und Kontrollmaßnahmen**\n\nZur Vermeidung von wesentlichen Fehldarstellungen bei der Abbildung von Transaktionen wurden mehrstufig aufgebaute Sicherungsmaßnahmen mit dem Ziel implementiert, dass die Einzelabschlüsse sämtlicher Tochtergesellschaften richtig erfasst werden. Diese Maßnahmen umfassen sowohl automatisierte Kontrollen in der Konsolidierungssoftware als auch manuelle Kontrollen in den kaufmännischen Konzernfunktionen. Auf Basis der Abschlüsse der Tochterunternehmen führen diese Fachabteilungen umfangreiche Plausibilitätsüberprüfungen durch, damit die Daten der Einzelabschlüsse ordnungsgemäß in den Konzernabschluss übernommen werden. Die Überprüfung der Abschlussdaten sieht vor, dass die Daten vor und nach der Konsolidierung zentral auf Positions-, Segment- und Konzernebene analysiert werden. Erst nach Durchführung dieser Qualitätskontrollen auf allen Stufen erfolgt die Freigabe des Konzernabschlusses.\n\nDas Rechnungswesen der EVN AG und der wichtigsten in- und ausländischen Tochtergesellschaften wird mit dem ERP-Softwaresystem SAP, Modul FI (Finanz- /Rechnungswesen) geführt. Die Erstellung des Konzernabschlusses nach IFRS erfolgt mit der Software Hyperion Financial Management, in die die Werte der Einzelabschlüsse der konsolidierten Gesellschaften mittels Schnittstelle übernommen werden. Die Rechnungswesensysteme sowie alle vorgelagerten Systeme sind durch Zugriffsberechtigungen und automatische sowie zwingend im Prozess vorgesehene manuelle Kontrollschritte geschützt.\n\nDas IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung und die für das Rechnungswesen relevanten Prozesse werden mindestens einmal jährlich vom zuständigen Assessor dahingehend überprüft, ob die Kontrollen durchgeführt worden sind, ob es im Geschäftsjahr Risikovorfälle gegeben hat und ob die Kontrollen weiterhin geeignet sind, die vorhandenen Risiken abzudecken. Im Berichtszeitraum wurden im Sinn der kontinuierlichen Weiterentwicklung des IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung Prozessanpassungen und verbesserungen durchgeführt.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Information, Kommunikation und Überwachung**\n\nDer Aufsichtsrat wird vom Vorstand vierteljährlich mit einem umfassenden Bericht über die Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage, der sowohl eine Bilanz als auch eine Gewinn-und-Verlust-Rechnung enthält, informiert. Darüber hinaus ergeht zweimal jährlich ein Bericht über das IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung an den Vorstand und den Prüfungsausschuss, der als Informationsgrundlage zur Beurteilung der Effizienz und Effektivität des IKS dient und die Steuerbarkeit des IKS durch die dafür vorgesehenen Gremien gewährleisten soll. Dieser Bericht erfolgt durch das IKS-Management in Zusammenarbeit mit dem IKS-Komitee auf Basis der Informationen der IKS-Bereichsverantwortlichen, der Kontrolldurchführenden und der Assessoren.\n\nZur Wahrnehmung der Überwachungs- und Kontrollfunktion im Hinblick auf eine ordnungsgemäße Rechnungslegung und Berichterstattung werden die relevanten Informationen zudem auch den Leitungsorganen und wesentlichen Mitarbeitern der jeweiligen Gesellschaft zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Interne Revision der EVN führt regelmäßig Prüfungen des IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung durch, deren Ergebnisse ebenfalls bei den laufenden Verbesserungen des IKS Berücksichtigung finden.\n\n## **Einsatz von Finanzinstrumenten**\n\nDie EVN setzt derivative Finanzinstrumente zur Absicherung des Unternehmens gegen Marktpreisänderungs-, Liquiditäts-, Wechselkurs- und Zinsänderungsrisiken ein. Zu diesem Zweck hat das Unternehmen ein Kontrollumfeld geschaffen, welches im Rahmen des Risikomanagements Richtlinien und Abläufe für die Beurteilung der Anwendung von Derivaten umfasst. Weitere Informationen finden sich im Anhang der EVN AG im Kapitel 3.2.7.\n\n## **Gesamtrisikoprofil**\n\nNeben den Ungewissheiten im Zusammenhang mit Geschäftsfeldern und -betrieben außerhalb Österreichs ist die EVN auch im Heimmarkt Niederösterreich mit einem weiterhin herausfordernden Umfeld konfrontiert. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 haben die Unsicherheiten allerdings abgenommen. Damit hat sich das Gesamtrisikoprofil der EVN tendenziell reduziert, jedoch noch nicht bis auf das Vorkrisenniveau. Gegenwärtig sind keine Risiken für die Zukunft erkennbar, die den Fortbestand des EVN Konzerns gefährden könnten.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn der folgenden Tabelle werden die wesentlichen Risiken und Ungewissheiten zusammenfassend erläutert. Erstmals werden in dieser Tabelle, sofern zutreffend, auch die Chancen für die einzelnen Kategorien erwähnt.\n\n| Risiko-/Chancenkategorie                                                                 | Beschreibung                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Maßnahme zur<br>Risikominimierung                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Markt- und Wettbewerbsrisiken/-chancen                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Deckungsbeitragsrisiko/-<br>chance<br>(Preis- und<br>Mengeneffekte)                      | Energievertrieb und -produktion:<br>Nichterreichen der geplanten<br>Deckungsbeiträge<br>• Volatile bzw. vom Plan<br>abweichende Bezugs-<br>und Absatzpreise (insb. für<br>Energieträger)<br>• Nachfragerückgänge (insb.<br>beeinflusst durch Witterung<br>bzw.

Per 30. September 2023 betrug das Grundkapital der EVN AG 330.000.000 Euro und war unterteilt in 179.878.402 Stück auf Inhaber lautende nennwertlose Stückaktien, die jeweils im gleichen Umfang am Grundkapital beteiligt sind. Der Anspruch auf Einzelverbriefung der Aktien ist ausgeschlossen. Es existiert nur diese eine Aktiengattung. Alle Aktien verkörpern die gleichen Rechte und Pflichten und werden auf dem Prime Market der Wiener Börse gehandelt.\n- 2. Es gibt keine über die Bestimmungen des Aktiengesetzes hinausgehenden Beschränkungen der Stimmrechte bzw. Vereinbarungen über die Beschränkung der Übertragbarkeit von Aktien. Hinzuweisen ist jedoch darauf, dass die Übertragbarkeit der Beteiligung des Landes Niederösterreich, das seine Anteile über die NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten, hält, durch bundes- und landesverfassungsgesetzliche Bestimmungen eingeschränkt ist.\n\nDie NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH (\"NLH\") und die Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH (\"WSTW\") haben am 23. September 2021 eine steuerliche Beteiligungsgemeinschaft gegründet, wofür sie einen \"Vertrag über die Bildung einer steuerlichen Beteiligungsgemeinschaft betreffend Anteile der Parteien an der EVN AG\" abgeschlossen haben. Dieser Vertrag sieht grundsätzlich eine syndizierte Ausübung der Stimmrechte von NLH und WSTW in der Hauptversammlung der EVN AG vor, bildet aber nur das sich ohnehin nach Gesetz und/oder Satzung auf Grund des jeweiligen Aktienbesitzes von NLH und WSTW ergebende Stimmgewicht in der Hauptversammlung ab (im Ergebnis verfügt NLH weiterhin über die einfache (nicht aber eine qualifizierte) Mehrheit und WSTW weiterhin über eine Sperrminorität).\n\n- 3. Auf Basis dieser verfassungsrechtlichen Vorschriften ist das Land Niederösterreich mit 51,0 % Mehrheitsaktionär der EVN AG. Zweitgrößter Aktionär der EVN AG ist mit 28,4 % die Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH, Wien, die zu 100 % im Eigentum der Stadt Wien steht. Der Anteil der von der EVN AG gehaltenen eigenen Aktien betrug zum Stichtag 0,9 %; der Streubesitz belief sich somit auf 19,7 %.\n- 4. Es wurden keine Aktien mit besonderen Kontrollrechten ausgegeben.\n- 5. Mitarbeiter, die im Besitz von Aktien sind, üben ihr Stimmrecht unmittelbar selbst bei der Hauptversammlung aus. Es besteht in der EVN AG kein Aktienoptionsprogramm.\n- 6. Der Vorstand besteht aus mindestens zwei Mitgliedern. Der Aufsichtsrat besteht aus mindestens acht und höchstens zwölf Mitgliedern. Sofern das Gesetz nicht zwingend eine andere Mehrheit vorschreibt, beschließt die Hauptversammlung mit einfacher Mehrheit der abgegebenen Stimmen und in Fällen, in denen eine Kapitalmehrheit erforderlich ist, mit einfacher Mehrheit des bei der Beschlussfassung vertretenen Grundkapitals.\n- 7. Befugnisse des Vorstands im Sinn des § 243a Abs. 1 Z. 7 UGB, insbesondere hinsichtlich der Möglichkeit, Aktien auszugeben, bestanden im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 nicht. Davon unberührt blieb jedoch die Möglichkeit, bereits zurückgekaufte eigene Aktien an Mitarbeiter auszugeben.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n- 8. Aufgrund der oben, insbesondere in Punkt 2. und 3., erwähnten Rechtslage kann in der EVN AG derzeit ein Kontrollwechsel im Sinn des § 243a Abs. 1 Z. 8 UGB nicht eintreten. Dasselbe gilt für allfällige Folgewirkungen eines Kontrollwechsels.\n- 9.

Oktober 2022 bis 30. September 2023.\n\n## **Analyse wesentlicher Themen und Stakeholder-Einbeziehung**\n\nDie EVN bekennt sich zum Konzept der nachhaltigen Unternehmensführung und strebt in diesem Sinn eine ausgewogene Berücksichtigung ökonomischer, ökologischer und sozialer Gesichtspunkte an. Damit sind alle ethischen, sozialen und umweltbezogenen Aspekte – sprich die Themenfelder Environment, Social und Governance (ESG) – umfasst, für die die EVN auch den Überbegriff \"Nachhaltigkeit\" verwendet. Ein angemessener Ausgleich der Anliegen aller am Unternehmen Interessierten – der Stakeholder – ist dabei das Leitmotiv. Grundlegende Aussagen zu Vision, Mission und Unternehmenswerten sowie verbindliche Dokumente zu konzernweiten Verhaltens- und Handlungsregeln bilden gemeinsam das Wertegerüst der EVN. Als Mitglied des UN Global Compact bekennt sie sich zudem explizit zur Einhaltung globaler Prinzipien ethischen wirtschaftlichen Handelns.\n\nDen Kern des Stakeholder-Managements bildet ein institutionalisierter Dialog mit den diversen Stakeholder-Gruppen, die aus nachstehender Darstellung ersichtlich sind. Ihre Identifikation und Priorisierung erfolgen regelmäßig im Rahmen der Aktualisierung der Wesentlichkeitsmatrix. Dabei überprüft die EVN auch stets die Relevanz der einzelnen Stakeholder-Gruppen für das Unternehmen.\n\nDie EVN Wesentlichkeitsmatrix wird im Dreijahresrhythmus aktualisiert. Die letzte Stakeholder-Befragung fand im Frühjahr 2021 statt. Dazu wurde eine repräsentative Auswahl interner und externer Stakeholder ersucht, mittels Online-Fragebogen die Relevanz der Handlungsfelder sowie deren Auswirkungen auf die Unternehmenstätigkeit zu beurteilen. Ziel dieses strukturierten Erhebungsprozesses war es, auf jene Themen zu fokussieren, die den höchsten Stellenwert für die Stakeholder der EVN aufweisen und gleichzeitig die größten ökonomischen, ökologischen oder sozialen Auswirkungen auf die Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN haben. Die wesentlichsten Themen und Handlungsfelder, auf die sich die Berichterstattung konzentriert, sind jene, die in der Wesentlichkeitsmatrix eine mittlere bis sehr hohe Relevanz für die EVN aufweisen. Im Rahmen eines Lenkungsausschusses Nachhaltigkeit hat die EVN für den Berichtszeitraum validiert und bestätigt, dass die wesentlichsten Themen und Handlungsfelder für die EVN weiterhin gültig sind.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Wichtigste Stakeholder-Gruppen der EVN**\n\nImage /page/149/Figure/2 description: The image contains a diagram and a matrix. The diagram is made up of puzzle pieces arranged in a circular fashion. Each puzzle piece contains a label, such as \"Medien Bürgerbeteiligungen NGOs\", \"Projekt-anrainer\\*innen\", \"Zivilgesellschaft\", \"Wissenschaft Forschung\", \"Politik\", \"Behörden\", \"Kund\\*innen\", \"Kapitalmarkt\", \"Investor\\*innen (institutionelle, private)\", \"Kreditgeber\\*innen Analyst\\*innen\", \"Mitarbeiter\\*innen\", \"Vorstand Führungskräfte Geschäfts-führer\\*innen\", \"Aufsichtsrat\", \"Mitbewerber\\*innen\", \"Interessen-vertretungen\", \"Geschäfts-partner\\*innen\", and \"Verbände Branchenverbände Betriebsrät\\*innen\".

The x-axis is labeled \"Durchschnittliche Auswirkung der Unternehmenstätigkeit\" and ranges from \"Mittel\" to \"Sehr hoch\" with values 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0. The y-axis is labeled \"Durchschnittliche Relevanz für Stakeholder\" and ranges from \"Mittel\" to \"Sehr hoch\" with values 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0. Several data points are plotted on the matrix, including \"Klimaschutz\", \"Versorgungssicherheit\", \"Kund\\*innenorientierung\", \"Innovation und Digitalisierung\", \"Attraktive Arbeitgeberin\", \"Umweltschutz\", \"Stakeholder-Dialog\", and \"Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung\".\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Handlungsfelder**\n\nAls Grundlage für den Abgleich zwischen der Strategie und den Stakeholder-Interessen dient die EVN Wesentlichkeitsmatrix mit ihren acht Handlungsfeldern:\n\n- Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung\n- Versorgungssicherheit\n- Kundenorientierung\n- Attraktive Arbeitgeberin\n- Klimaschutz\n- Umweltschutz\n- Innovation und Digitalisierung\n- Stakeholder-Dialog\n\nDie nachstehende Tabelle liefert einen Überblick hinsichtlich der Zuordnung der einzelnen Handlungsfelder zu den gemäß NaDiVeG geforderten Angaben und Leistungsindikatoren zu den im Fokus stehenden Belangen in Bezug auf Umwelt, Soziales, Arbeitnehmer, Achtung der Menschenrechte und Bekämpfung von Korruption.\n\n| EVN Handlungsfeld                      | Nichtfinanzielle Informationen gem.<br>NaDiVeG                      |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung | Strategie, Achtung der Menschenrechte,<br>Bekämpfung von Korruption |\n| Versorgungssicherheit                  | Strategie                                                           |\n| Kundenorientierung                     | Einbindung Stakeholder                                              |\n| Attraktiver Arbeitgeber                | Arbeitnehmerbelange, Achtung der<br>Menschenrechte, Sozialbelange   |\n| Klimaschutz                            | Umweltbelange                                                       |\n| Umweltschutz                           | Umweltbelange                                                       |\n| Innovation und Digitalisierung         | Strategie, Arbeitnehmerbelange                                      |\n| Stakeholder-Dialog                     | Einbindung der Stakeholder, Sozialbelange                           |\n\n## **Nachhaltigkeitsorganisation**\n\nDie folgende Darstellung illustriert die Nachhaltigkeitsorganisation der EVN, die – im Einklang mit der europäischen Best Practice – insbesondere den folgenden Grundsätzen folgt:\n\n- In der EVN ist die Verantwortung für das Themenfeld Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) – also sämtliche Aspekte und Agenden in Sachen Umweltschutz, Soziales und nachhaltige Unternehmensführung – und deren Weiterentwicklung beim Gesamtvorstand und damit auf der höchsten Unternehmensebene angesiedelt. Alle diese Themen fließen in die EVN Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie ein, die ihrerseits von der (ebenfalls vom Vorstand verantworteten) Konzernstrategie abgeleitet wird. Zudem tauscht sich der Vorstand regelmäßig mit dem Aufsichtsrat zur Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie aus und berichtet diesem quartalsweise über wesentliche Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen im ESG-Bereich. Angesichts der hohen Relevanz von ESG-Themen und um die Nachhaltigkeitsexpertise im Prüfungsausschuss noch stärker zu verankern, wurde im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 zusätzlich eine Nachhaltigkeitsexpertin in den Prüfungsausschuss des Aufsichtsrats bestellt.\n- Vierteljährlich tagt zudem der Lenkungsausschuss Nachhaltigkeit, der sich aus dem Gesamtvorstand, aus Führungskräften, aus Geschäftsführern der wesentlichen österreichischen und internationalen Konzerngesellschaften sowie aus Mitgliedern eines abteilungsübergreifenden Nachhaltigkeitsteams zusammensetzt. Das Gremium behandelt aktuelle ESG-Themen, beschließt wesentliche ESG-Aktivitäten und stellt dank seiner breiten Zusammensetzung sicher, dass die behandelten Strategien, Maßnahmen und Ziele operativ auf den Gesamtkonzern ausgerollt und flächendeckend umgesetzt werden.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **EVN Nachhaltigkeitsorganisation**\n\nImage /page/151/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram outlining the structure of sustainability management within an organization.

Oberstes Prinzip ist dabei die angemessene und gut ausbalancierte Berücksichtigung jener Anliegen, die von verschiedenen Stakeholder-Gruppen an die EVN herangetragen werden. Ein regelmäßiger, proaktiver und offener Dialog mit diesen Stakeholdern ist daher auch im EVN Verhaltenskodex als wichtiger Managementgrundsatz verankert.\n\n27\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Projektkommunikation**\n\nDie EVN hält engen und offenen Kontakt zu relevanten NGOs und Interessenvertretungen, um vertrauensvolle und langfristige Beziehungen zu entwickeln. Dieser offene Austausch fördert gegenseitiges Verständnis und ist die entscheidende Voraussetzung dafür, dass im Fall divergierender Interessen gemeinsam Lösungen gefunden werden können. Neben einer höherer Planungsqualität und -sicherheit hat dies auch den positiven Effekt, dass die Kommunikation mit Anrainern und lokalen Initiativen intensiver und professioneller wird. Dabei fließt die Erfahrung aus bereits realisierten Projekten ebenfalls positiv mit ein.\n\nVon Beginn der Planung an werden sowohl ökologische als auch soziale Aspekte in die Projektentwicklung und auch in die Due-Diligence-Prüfungen einbezogen. Diese Prüfungen, die vor jedem Projektstart durchgeführt werden, bilden die Grundlage für interne Entscheidungsprozesse des Vorstands und bei größeren Projekten auch des Aufsichtsrats. Der intensive Dialog verfolgt dabei insbesondere die folgenden Ziele:\n\n- Hohe Akzeptanz bei allen Stakeholdern\n- Unterstützung der Realisierbarkeit von Projekten\n- Positive Wahrnehmung des Unternehmens und seiner Aktivitäten\n- Reduktion von Risiken und Vermeidung von Imageschäden\n\n## **Verantwortungsvoller Umgang mit den Anliegen lokaler Stakeholder**\n\nDen Dialog mit den unmittelbar von einem geplanten Projekt der EVN betroffenen Menschen führen wir stets nach folgenden Grundsätzen:\n\n- Frühzeitiges Identifizieren der unterschiedlichen Erwartungen und Ansprüchen\n- Transparente und umfassende Projektinformation\n- Professionelle, strukturierte und proaktive Kommunikation mit allen lokalen Stakeholdern (inklusive politischer Entscheidungsträger)\n- Unterstützung der Kommunen bei der Kommunikation und gegebenenfalls Vermittlung bei Konflikten\n\nDie Informationsaktivitäten zu den verschiedenen Projekten der EVN erfolgen in enger Abstimmung und Zusammenarbeit mit den Projektleitern und -verantwortlichen. Selbstverständlich bietet die EVN die Möglichkeit, dass sich lokale Stakeholder mit ihren Anliegen jederzeit von sich aus an die EVN wenden können. Neben einer direkten Kontaktaufnahme mit den Projektleitern unter der E-Mail-Adresse dialog@evn.at stehen dafür auch das EVN Servicetelefon bzw. die E-Mail-Adresse info@evn.at zur Verfügung.\n\n## **Krisenmanagement**\n\nFür weite Teile der Geschäftstätigkeit – insbesondere für Gefährdungsbereiche, die auch die Bevölkerung sowie die Umwelt betreffen – verfügt die EVN über umfassende Krisen-, Katastrophen- und Notfallpläne sowie über dazugehörige Schulungsprogramme. An allen Standorten werden Maßnahmen für Krisensituationen regelmäßig trainiert. In Niederösterreich veranstaltet die EVN darüber hinaus regelmäßig interne und externe Übungen und Schulungen zum Thema Krisenmanagement abgehalten. Mitarbeiter im Störungsdienst werden laufend geschult, ebenso erfolgen jährlich Trainings für Diensthabenden sowie Sicherheitsunterweisungen für alle Mitarbeiter.\n\n## **Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung der Projektkommunikation**\n\nBei Projekten in den Bereichen erneuerbare Energieerzeugung, Netze und Trinkwasserversorgung sind zwei Trends zu beobachten: Zum einen wird die Öffentlichkeit immer kritischer gegenüber solchen Projekten, und zum anderen steigen die Anforderungen an eine erfolgreiche Projektkommunikation aus Sicht aller Interessengruppen. Als Reaktion darauf hat die EVN das Team \"Projektkommunikation und Klimadialog\" geschaffen und ein spezielles Aus- und Weiterbildungsprogramm entwickelt, das die kommunikativen und strategischen Fähigkeiten der Projektleiter stärken soll.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nExterne Experten begleiteten die Schulung, die insgesamt 40 Stunden umfasste, und vermittelten den Teilnehmern wertvolles Wissen und bewährte Strategien, mit denen eine erfolgreiche Kommunikation mit wichtigen Interessengruppen gewährleistet werden kann. Die Schulungsinhalte umfassten auch den Umgang mit schwierigen Situationen und Konflikten, wie sie bei Infrastrukturprojekten auftreten können. Dank der Schulung können die Teilnehmer nun die Kommunikation mit relevanten Stakeholdern wie NGOs und Bürgerinitiativen optimieren und Konflikte frühzeitig lösen, um Vertrauen und Akzeptanz zu stärken und die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Projekten zu unterstützen.\n\n## **Unterstützung von Interessenvertretungen und Initiativen**\n\nDa die vielfältigen Geschäftsaktivitäten einen wesentlichen Beitrag zum öffentlichen Leben und zur Wirtschaft insgesamt leisten, ist die EVN Mitglied in diversen gesetzlichen und freiwilligen nationalen und internationalen Organisationen und Interessenvertretungen, nicht zuletzt um durch diese Vernetzung die Aufgaben der EVN noch besser und im Sinn der Stakeholder erfüllen zu können. Beispiele für Branchenverbände sind Oesterreichs Energie oder Eurelectric, zu den Initiativen im Kontext sozialer und ökologischer Themen zählen u.a. UN Global Compact oder respACT. Alle Aktivitäten im Zusammenhang mit diesen Mitgliedschaften erfolgen im Einklang mit dem Verhaltensrahmen des Compliance-Management-Systems. Gemäß den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen ist die EVN auch in das österreichische Lobbying- und Interessenvertretungsregister sowie in das Transparenzregister der EU eingetragen.\n\n## **Unternehmensstrategie**\n\nEin klares Wertegerüst und die Fokussierung auf Handlungsfelder, die regelmäßig gemeinsam mit allen Stakeholdern reflektiert und entsprechend priorisiert werden, bilden die Grundlage für das unternehmerische Handeln der EVN. Auf diesem Fundament ruhen nicht nur alle Grundsätze und Regeln in Bezug auf das Verhalten der Mitarbeiter, Lieferanten und Geschäftspartner, sondern die gesamte Konzernstrategie der EVN. In der jährlichen Risikoinventur werden im Sinn des NaDiVeG und der EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung sowohl potenzielle Risiken als auch Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN und ihrer Geschäftsbeziehungen auf Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelange, die Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Bekämpfung von Korruption systematisch erhoben und hinsichtlich ihrer finanziellen Auswirkungen auf den EVN Konzern bewertet. Als wichtigste Verpflichtung gegenüber ihren Kunden betrachtet die EVN die Sicherstellung einer flächendeckenden und stets verlässlichen Versorgung mit ihren Produkten und Dienstleistungen.\n\nAls Energie- und Umweltdienstleisterin sieht sich die EVN in der Verantwortung, einen wesentlichen Beitrag im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel zu leisten. Dies betrifft insbesondere die Minimierung der von der EVN Tätigkeit verursachten Emissionen. Den Fokus legt die EVN hier auch auf den Umbau des Energiesystems in Richtung einer klimaneutralen Erzeugung – und hier vor allem auf den Ausbau der Windkraft- und Photovoltaikkapazitäten. Bereits im Geschäftsjahr 2020/21 hat die EVN die Stromerzeugung aus Kohle endgültig beendet. Im Sommer 2021 trat die EVN der Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) bei und setzte sich insgesamt fünf Reduktionsziele. Damit leistet sie einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Verwirklichung des in Paris vereinbarten Klimaziels, den Anstieg der Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter 2°C zu beschränken. Für das Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 ist die Ausarbeitung eines Transitionsplans auf das 1,5°C-Ziel geplant.\n\nEine wesentliche Rolle spielten im Strategieprozess die für den Energiesektor relevanten internationalen Rahmenwerke wie die Sustainable Development Goals der Vereinten Nationen und die Zielsetzungen der Energie- und Klimapolitik, z. B. das Pariser Klimaabkommen oder der European Green Deal. Denn sie verändern das Umfeld und die für eine Energieversorgerin maßgeblichen rechtlichen und regulatorischen Vorgaben teils massiv.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie bestimmende Veränderung für die Energiebranche – und damit auch ein zentraler Faktor für die EVN Strategie – ergibt sich aus dem gesellschaftlichen und politischen Bestreben, das auf eine möglichst rasche Transformation in ein funktionierendes CO2-freies Energiesystem abzielt, um die branchenspezifischen Klimaeinflüsse noch deutlicher und schneller zu minimieren. Um diesen Entwicklungen in angemessener Weise gerecht zu werden, hat die EVN auf Basis der Strategie 2030 die EVN Klimainitiative entwickelt. Dadurch wurden maßgebliche Zielsetzungen wie die mit der Science Based Targets Initiative akkordierten Dekarbonisierungsziele oder die Klimaneutralität ausgewählter Konzerngesellschaften eng mit der Gesamtstrategie der EVN verknüpft.\n\n## **EVN Klimainitiative**\n\nBasierend auf der Strategie 2030 hat die EVN bereits im Geschäftsjahr 2020/21 die EVN Klimainitiative entwickelt. Sie besteht aus den folgenden drei Säulen und untermauert das Engagement der EVN für den Klimaschutz durch konkrete Maßnahmen, Ziele und Projekte.\n\n- Science Based Targets Initiative\n- Klimaneutralität in ausgewählten Tochtergesellschaften\n- Beitrag von Forschung und Entwicklung zum Klimaschutz\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Unsere Kernstrategien 2030**\n\nImage /page/155/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram outlining strategies and trends.

The diagram is divided into three main sections, each with a title in a red circle. The first section, titled \"Wachstum und Effizienzsteigerung in Südosteuropa\" (Growth and Efficiency Increase in Southeastern Europe), lists key points such as high growth potential in renewable energy, the need for efficiency improvements in the grid, and the challenge of progressive liberalization for energy sales. The second section, titled \"Verstärkter Fokus auf Trinkwasserversorgung in Niederösterreich\" (Increased Focus on Drinking Water Supply in Lower Austria), highlights increasing water consumption due to demographic changes and rising quality requirements in water supply. The third section, titled \"Fokussierung auf Konzepte im Bereich Kreislaufwirtschaft\" (Focus on Concepts in the Field of Circular Economy), mentions bans on sewage sludge and stricter EU regulations regarding the separation and recycling of household waste. Below each section, there are further details. For the first section, it includes growth through new wind and photovoltaic projects, commitment to security and quality of supply, reduction of network losses, and efficiency improvements in operations. For the second section, it mentions capacity increases in pumping stations, construction of natural filter systems, and development of new drinking water sources. For the third section, it includes the operation of own plants for thermal waste and sewage sludge treatment in Lower Austria. The bottom of the diagram includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 in red circles, and the phrases \"Branchenumfeld und Trends\" (Industry Environment and Trends) and \"Unsere Strategie\" (Our Strategy) are also present.\n\n#### **Handlungsfelder**\n\n- **1** Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung **2** Versorgungssicherheit\n- **3** Kund\\*innenorientierung\n\n**4** Innovation und Digitalisierung **5** Klimaschutz **6** Umweltschutz\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit auf Gesellschaft, Umwelt und Wirtschaft**\n\nIm Rahmen der jährlichen Risikoinventur werden im Sinn des NaDiVeG und der EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung sowohl potenzielle Risiken als auch Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN und ihrer Geschäftsbeziehungen auf Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelange, die Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Bekämpfung von Korruption systematisch erhoben und hinsichtlich ihrer finanziellen Auswirkungen auf die EVN bewertet.\n\nDamit steht ein klar strukturierter und definierter Prozess zur Verfügung, um potenzielle Risiken bzw. Auswirkungen auf unterschiedlichen organisatorischen und hierarchischen Ebenen zu identifizieren und zu analysieren sowie geeignete Gegenmaßnahmen zu entwickeln. Die Einbindung der Führungs- und der Vorstandsebene wird dabei insbesondere dadurch gewährleistet, dass die Erkenntnisse und Analysen der Risikoinventur im Risikoarbeits- und im Konzernrisikoausschuss präsentiert und diskutiert werden.\n\nDie nachfolgende Tabelle fasst die wesentlichen potenziellen Auswirkungen zusammen. Sie enthält zudem beispielhaft Instrumente und Maßnahmen, die – im Einklang mit dem EVN Verhaltenskodex und den übergeordneten Verhaltensnormen zum Thema Compliance – zur Minimierung allfälliger negativer Auswirkungen genutzt bzw. gesetzt werden.\n\n## **Nachhaltigkeits- und insbesondere Klimarisiken im Fokus**\n\nGemäß EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung werden Klimarisiken anhand von Klimaszenarien analysiert. Auch im Rahmen der Risikoinventur werden potenzielle Klimarisiken sowie Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit im Zusammenhang mit dem Thema Klimawandel erhoben. Im Risikomanagementprozess ist Klimarisiko jedoch bewusst nicht als eigene Risikokategorie definiert, sondern wird als Querschnittsmaterie den einzelnen Risikokategorien der EVN zugeordnet. Dabei wird unterschieden zwischen Transitionsrisiken und physischen Risiken. Zu den Transitionsrisiken zählen Unsicherheiten, die aus dem Übergang in Richtung eines erneuerbaren Energiesystems resultieren. Physische Risiken betreffen hingegen Ereignisse und Veränderungen, die unmittelbare klimatische Ursachen haben.\n\nKlimatisch verursachte Ergebnisschwankungen werden aber nicht nur durch das Risikomanagement erfasst, sondern mögliche quantitative Auswirkungen auch im Planungsprozess in Form entsprechender Sensitivitäts- und Szenarioanalysen analysiert. Vergleichbare Fragestellungen prägen auch die Auswahl der Szenarien für die Betrachtung der künftigen Preisentwicklung von Energie und Primärenergieträgern. Auf dieser Basis werden der Klimawandel und seine Auswirkungen auf die EVN Geschäftstätigkeit auch auf Ebene der Führungskräfte, des Vorstands und des Aufsichtsrats erläutert.\n\nSchäden durch Extremwetterereignisse stellen wiederum eine Bedrohung für die Versorgungssicherheit dar. In einem weiter gefassten Nachhaltigkeitskontext umfassen Risiken in diesem Bereich auch Versorgungsunterbrechungen oder die Gefährdung von Leib und Leben sowie der Infrastruktur durch Explosionen oder Unfälle. Um einen störungsfreien Betrieb und die technische Sicherheit der Kraftwerke – beides maßgebliche Voraussetzungen für eine verlässliche Versorgung – zu gewährleisten, werden regelmäßig Revisionen und Wartungsarbeiten durchgeführt, die geplante Stillstandszeiten mit sich bringen. Tatsächliche Unterbrechungen der Stromversorgung werden im Netzbereich anhand der Kennzahlen System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) – der mittleren Unterbrechungshäufigkeit – und System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) – der durchschnittlichen jährlichen Dauer der ungeplanten Stromunterbrechungen gemessen und überwacht.\n\nArbeitssicherheit und Unfallvermeidung nehmen in allen Einheiten des Unternehmens ebenfalls einen zentralen Stellenwert ein. Das geforderte hohe Sicherheitsniveau wird dabei vor allem durch Schulungen und Bewusstseinsbildung gewährleistet.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nIn Ergänzung der geltenden gesetzlichen Vorschriften wurde dafür ein umfangreiches internes Regelwerk aus Geschäftsanweisungen und Richtlinien entwickelt. Im EVN Konzern werden sämtliche Arbeitsunfälle zentral über den sicherheitstechnischen Dienst erfasst und ausgewertet. Wie in nebenstehender Tabelle beim Handlungsfeld \"Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung\" beschrieben, beziehen sich die Mitarbeiterrisiken aber auch auf den Abgang von hochqualifizierten Mitarbeitern. Diesem Risiko wird vor allem mit der Schaffung eines attraktiven Arbeitsumfelds und mit flexiblen Arbeitszeitmodellen begegnet. In der Risikobetrachtung umfasst sind auch bewusste bzw. unbewusste Fehldarstellungen von Transaktionen bzw. Jahresabschlussposten, die durch das interne Kontrollsystem (IKS) vermieden werden sollen.\n\nDie Erfassung und Analyse der ökologischen Auswirkungen der Unternehmenstätigkeit in Bereichen wie Ressourceneinsatz, Energie- und Wasserverbrauch, Emissionen, Biodiversität, Transport sowie Abwasser und Abfall (Umweltrisiken) obliegen der Stabsstelle Innovation, Nachhaltigkeit und Umweltschutz. Diese unterstützt die operativen Einheiten auf Basis ihrer Analysen auch darin, Umweltauswirkungen zu verhindern bzw. zu minimieren.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Überblick über die wesentlichen potenziellen Auswirkungen unserer Unternehmenstätigkeit (Auswahl)**\n\n#### **EVN Handlungsfeld und Definition**\n\n#### **Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung**\n\n… steht für eine unternehmerische Haltung, die bei strategischen Entscheidungen stets auf ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen wertorientierten Investitionen und einer attraktiven Vergütung für die Aktionär\\*innen achtet.

Auch im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 stand das EVN Kundenservice deshalb vor enormen Herausforderungen. Um die Servicequalität kontinuierlich zu steigern, hat die EVN im Berichtszeitraum zudem ein Projekt zur Verbesserung der Resilienz und Stabilität und zur Schaffung einer schlagkräftigen, effizienten Organisationsstruktur im Bereich Customer Relations gestartet. Dieser Prozess wurde von externen Beratern begleitet. Maßnahmen zur Entlastung des Customer-Relations-Teams umfassten u. a. Kapazitätserhöhungen sowohl intern als auch durch die Unterstützung externer Call-Center-Partner. Zudem fanden unter externer Begleitung Teamcoachings zur Steigerung der mentalen Stärke und somit zur besseren Bewältigung des hohen Arbeitspensums statt. 37 Herausforderungen.

Zudem fanden unter externer Begleitung Teamcoachings zur Steigerung der mentalen Stärke und somit zur besseren Bewältigung des hohen Arbeitspensums statt.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nUm möglichst viele der EVN Kunden persönlich über die Ablöse des bisherigen Klassik-Tarifs und die Optionen für einen Wechsel zu einem neuen Tarif zu informieren, startete die EVN im Frühjahr 2023 wieder eine Informationskampagne mit dem EVN Info-Bus. Im Rahmen dieser Kampagne besuchten EVN Mitarbeiter insgesamt 469 Gemeinden Niederösterreichs, um die Kunden vor Ort umfassend über den Tarifwechsel aufzuklären und zu informieren. Der EVN Info-Bus hatte sich bereits im Herbst 2022 im Rahmen der Informationskampagne über Entlastungsmaßnahmen und Einsparungspotenziale sehr bewährt und wurde auch diesmal äußerst positiv aufgenommen.\n\nHohen Stellenwert misst die EVN auch einem aktiven Beschwerdemanagement bei, in dessen Rahmen alle Rückmeldungen unzufriedener Kunden dokumentiert, ausgewertet und regelmäßig eingehend analysiert werden, um daraus spezifische Verbesserungsmaßnahmen abzuleiten. Zudem setzt die EVN intensiv auf Schulungen und Trainings für das Customer-Relations-Team – zunehmend auch mittels digitaler E-Learning-Formate.\n\nDie EVN legt großen Wert auf Diversität, sowohl in Bezug auf ihre eigenen Mitarbeiter als auch im Umgang mit ihren Kunden. Für Kunden, deren Muttersprache nicht Deutsch ist, werden Beratungsdienste in ihrer jeweiligen Muttersprache angeboten. Möglich wird dies durch die große Vielfalt im Team, dem viele Kollegen mit unterschiedlichen Muttersprachen angehören.\n\nNach umfassenden Vorbereitungen wurde der frühere Kundenbeirat der EVN im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 in einem neuen, digitalen Format aufgesetzt. Das bestehende Beratungsgremium, in dem seit dem Jahr 2011 gewählte Kundenvertreter ihre Anliegen und Bedürfnisse mit dem Management und Experten erörtert hatten, wurde dadurch auf eine zeitgemäße und wesentlich breitere Basis gestellt. Feedbackwillige Kunden können sich nun auf freiwilliger Basis online unter https://mein-feedback.at/ anmelden. Dadurch soll eine große Gruppe an Testkunden entstehen, die online sowie vor Ort – und damit rasch, flexibel und niederschwellig – um ihre Meinung zu bestehenden sowie geplanten Produkt- und Serviceangeboten gebeten werden kann. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 will die EVN darüber hinaus Real-Time-Feedback in einem digitalen Format auf Echtzeitbasis einführen. Dies soll eine rasche Erhebung und Auswertung der Qualität von Kundenkontakten ermöglichen.\n\nDie EVN setzt darüber hinaus auf den für die spezifischen Anforderungen des Unternehmens definierten Customer Loyalty Index, um die Zufriedenheit der Kunden mit unterschiedlichen Aspekten ihrer Geschäftsbeziehung zur EVN zu evaluieren. Dabei wird anhand verschiedener Indikatoren die Loyalität der Kunden auf monatlicher Basis beobachtet und gemessen. Der Index ermöglicht es, Veränderungen des Kundenverhaltens und deren Ursachen frühzeitig zu erkennen und rasch darauf zu reagieren.\n\nIm Frühjahr 2023 absolvierte das EVN Kundenservice erfolgreich die Re-Zertifizierung nach ISO 18295-1. Die Schwerpunkte der dafür erforderlichen Überprüfung lagen auf den Abläufen im Kundenservice sowie auf dem Schulungskonzept für das Customer-Relations-Team. In allen Bereichen wurden die umfassenden Anforderungen der ISO-Norm erfüllt. Das neue Zertifikat ist bis Dezember 2028 gültig.\n\nDas Wertegerüst der EVN schließt auch das klare Bekenntnis zu sozialer Verantwortung mit ein, das im aktuellen Umfeld nochmals stark an Bedeutung gewinnt. Über unterschiedliche Kanäle (persönlich, telefonisch oder online) bieten geschulte Mitarbeiter in Customer Relations und in den Service Centern individuelle Beratung von Energiespartipps bis hin zum Umgang mit Zahlungsschwierigkeiten und halten aktiv den Kontakt mit den Kunden. Seit vielen Jahren bewähren sich Maßnahmen wie Kooperationen mit der Caritas, der Schuldnerberatung Niederösterreich, der Diakonie sowie dem Niederösterreichischen Armutsnetzwerk. Diese Zusammenarbeit hat die EVN zuletzt weiter intensiviert. Einen Fokus bilden hier Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen sowie die Ausschöpfung von Einsparpotenzialen, durch die sich oft erhebliche Kostenreduktionen erzielen lassen.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nDer regelmäßige Austausch mit den genannten Organisationen erleichtert es zudem, im Einzelfall gezielte Maßnahmen für sozial benachteiligte Kunden abzustimmen. Dazu zählen individuelle Vereinbarungen über Stundungen oder Ratenzahlungen ebenso wie Lösungen, die in Kooperation mit Hilfsorganisationen und Anbietern sozialer Hilfsleistungen erarbeitet werden. Für den Zeitraum von 1. Dezember 2022 bis 30. April 2023 hat die EVN auf Abschaltungen bei Haushaltskunden für Strom überhaupt ganz verzichtet, und auch im laufenden Geschäftsjahr werden im Zeitraum von 1. Dezember 2023 bis 31. März 2024 bei Haushaltskunden keine Abschaltungen bei Strom, Erdgas oder Wärme vorgenommen. Zur Unterstützung besonderer sozialer Härtefälle wurde im Herbst 2022 ein mit 3 Mio. Euro dotierter Energiehilfe-Fonds eingerichtet, der betroffene Haushalte mit professioneller Energieberatung, Gerätetausch oder einer Überbrückungsfinanzierung für Energierechnungen unterstützen soll. Die Abwicklung der von diesem Fonds gewährten Unterstützungen erfolgt über soziale Institutionen.\n\n## **Umweltbelange**\n\nDie grundlegenden Ziele und Werte der EVN in Sachen Klima- und Umweltschutz sind einerseits im Umweltleitbild der EVN und andererseits in der EVN Klimainitiative verankert. Im Bereich Umweltschutz umfasst das Leitbild Vorgaben zur Minimierung von Umweltbeeinträchtigungen, zur verantwortungsvollen Nutzung von Ressourcen, zum Erhalt der natürlichen Lebensräume von Tieren und Pflanzen im Umfeld der Anlagen und Projekte sowie zu einem umweltgerechten Abfallmanagement. Die lückenlose Erfüllung vom Umweltgesetzen und -auflagen in allen Aktivitäten der EVN ist dabei selbstverständlich. Im Bereich Klimaschutz wiederum legt die Klimainitiative den Fokus auf einen schrittweisen Systemumbau in Richtung einer klimaneutralen Energieerzeugung mit den Schwerpunkten Windkraft und Photovoltaik bei gleichzeitiger Gewährleistung der Versorgungssicherheit.\n\nDie Tätigkeitsbereiche der EVN AG umfassten im Geschäftsjahr im Wesentlichen Handelsund Verwaltungstätigkeit. Energieverbrauch und Emissionen sind deshalb für den Einzelabschluss nicht wesentlich, weswegen auf eine diesbezügliche Angabe verzichtet wird.\n\n## **Umweltmanagement in der EVN**\n\nBereits seit 1995 betreibt die EVN auf freiwilliger Basis Umweltmanagementsysteme gemäß dem Eco Management und Audit Scheme (EMAS) sowie nach ISO 14001. Die EMAS-Verordnung schreibt unter anderem die Festlegung von messbaren Umweltzielen vor, deren Zielsetzung einen kontinuierlichen Verbesserungsprozess vorsieht. Für die Zertifizierung nach EMAS sind die lückenlose Einhaltung von umweltrelevanten Gesetzen und deren engmaschige Überprüfung zwingende Grundvoraussetzungen. Alle thermischen Anlagen in Niederösterreich sowie 74 Wärmeerzeugungs- und Kälteanlagen der EVN entsprechen diesen Standards.\n\nDas Engagement der EVN zum Klimaschutz orientiert sich an einem ausgewogenen Mix aus optimaler Versorgungssicherheit und minimalen Umweltauswirkungen. Mit den folgenden Initiativen und strategischen Ansätzen erbringt die EVN einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Erreichung der österreichischen und europäischen Klimaziele:\n\n- Forcierte Nutzung der erneuerbaren Energiequellen Wasser, Wind, Sonne, Biomasse und erneuerbares Gas\n- Steigerung der Energieeffizienz eigener Produktionsanlagen und Netze\n- Aktive Teilnahme an Innovations-, Entwicklungs- und Forschungsprojekten\n- Information und Beratung der Kunden im Hinblick auf die Reduktion ihres Energiebedarfs\n- Regionale Wertschöpfung durch die Nutzung heimischer Energieträger wie Biomasse und erneuerbares Gas\n- Nutzung von Fahrzeugen mit alternativen Antrieben wie z.B. E-Autos\n- Steigerung des Anteils erneuerbarer Energien am Produktmix der EVN\n- Zunehmender Einsatz erneuerbarer Energien zur Deckung des Eigenbedarfs\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n• Unterstützung der Transformation der Gasnetze hin zu erneuerbarem Gas und Wasserstoff\n\n## **Nachhaltigkeitsbeirat**\n\nDer Nachhaltigkeitsbeirat der EVN berät den Vorstand der Gesellschaft in wichtigen Fragen der nachhaltigen Unternehmensführung in den Bereichen Umwelt- und Klimaschutz, Anpassung an den Klimawandel, Kreislaufwirtschaft, Biodiversität, nachhaltige Wasserwirtschaft, Digitalisierung, Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit, Arbeitssicherheit und Arbeitsschutz sowie Soziales und Menschenrechte. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 trat das aus 28 Mitgliedern bestehende Gremium zu zwei Sitzungen zusammen. Ein besonderer Fokus wurde dabei neben den Themen Versorgungssicherheit und Energietransformation, energiewirtschaftliche Situation in Niederösterreich und aktuelle Marktsituation und Aktivitäten des EVN Vertriebsgeschäfts auch auf die Herausforderungen des Arbeitsmarkts sowie von der Ausbildung über das Finden und Halten von Arbeitskräften als auch auf die Skills der Zukunft gelegt.\n\n## **Abfall**\n\nDie EVN achtet darauf, dass Wertstoffe – soweit möglich – intern wiederverwendet werden, bevor sie als Abfall deklariert werden. Eine innerbetriebliche Behandlung oder Recycling von Abfällen wird aufgrund der rechtlich dafür notwendigen Behandlungserlaubnis nicht durchgeführt. Gemäß der EU-Gesetzgebung geschieht dies über die direkte Beauftragung von geeigneten Entsorgern oder Verwertern, die eine fachgerechte Verwertung und Entsorgung der Abfälle nach der europäischen Abfallhierarchie gewährleisten und so sicherstellen, dass Wertstoffe nicht verloren gehen.\n\nAlle regelmäßig anfallenden gefährlichen und nicht gefährlichen Abfälle gibt die EVN auf Basis von Rahmenverträgen an berechtigte Entsorgungsunternehmen ab, die diese Abfälle entsprechend den gesetzlichen Vorschriften des jeweiligen Landes umweltgerecht entsorgen. In der Berichtsperiode entsorgte die EVN keine gefährlichen oder nicht gefährlichen Abfälle grenzüberschreitend.\n\n| Abfallmengen gesamt¹⁾                                    |   | 2022/23 | 2021/22 | 2020/21 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---|---------|---------|---------|\n| Nicht gefährliche Abfälle                                | t | 203     | 267     | 339     |\n| davon zur Rückgewinnung umgeleitete Abfälle              | t | 180     | -       | -       |\n| davon dem Recycling zugeführt                            | t | 176     | -       | -       |\n| davon sonstigen Verfahren zur Rückgewinnung zugeführt    | t | 4       | -       | -       |\n| davon zur Entsorgung weitergeleitete Abfälle             | t | 23      | -       | -       |\n| davon in die Verbrennung mit Energierückgewinnung        | t | 21      | -       | -       |\n| davon zur Deponierung                                    | t | 1       | -       | -       |\n| davon zu sonstigen Entsorgungsverfahren                  | t | 1       | -       | -       |\n|                                                          |   |         |         |         |\n| Gefährliche Abfälle                                      | t | 33      | 35      | 31      |\n| davon der Verwertung zugeführte gefährliche Abfälle      | t | 8       | -       | -       |\n| davon zur Entsorgung weitergeleitete gefährliche Abfälle | t | 25      | -       | -       |\n\n1) Ohne Baurestmassen\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Sozialbelange**\n\nIm Bewusstsein der Verantwortung gegenüber den unterschiedlichen Interessengruppen setzt die EVN in ihrem Verantwortungsbereich auch außerhalb des operativen Kerngeschäfts Initiativen zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität der Menschen. Nachfolgend einige Beispiele für diese Aktivitäten im gesellschaftlichen Kontext:\n\n- **EVN Junior-Ranger-Programm:** An zwei Samstagen vermittelten externe Experten insgesamt 17 Jugendlichen Theorie- und Praxiswissen zu Themen wie Hydrobiologie, Flora und Fauna in Flussauen, Gewässerökologie, Fischerei sowie Natur- und Gewässerschutz. Die Wissensvermittlung fand am und um den Stausee Erlaufklause, ein Wasserkraftwerksstandort der EVN, statt.\n- **EVN Sozialfonds:** Der EVN Sozialfonds ist mit jährlich rund 120.000 Euro dotiert und unterstützt Kinder- und Jugendprojekte niederösterreichischer Institutionen. Über die Auswahl der Förderprojekte entscheidet ein Expertengremium, das zweimal pro Jahr zusammentritt. Seine Empfehlungen zur Mittelverwendung an den Vorstand der EVN erfolgen einstimmig auf Basis eines vordefinierten Kriterienkatalogs. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 unterstützte der Fonds 18 Projekte mit einem Gesamtbeitrag von rund 122.000 Euro.\n- **Bonuspunkte spenden:** In der EVN Bonuswelt bietet die EVN ihren Kunden vielfältige Möglichkeiten zur Verwendung jener Bonuspunkte, die sie im Rahmen ihres Energiebezugs oder der Nutzung anderer EVN Services laufend sammeln. Die Bonuspunkte können wahlweise als finanzielle Vergütung für die Kunden selbst oder aber zur Unterstützung verschiedener wohltätiger Projekte eingelöst werden. Spendenaktionen gab es zuletzt u.a. für Menschen mit psychischen Erkrankungen, für Tierheime oder für Sozialmärkte.\n- **evn sammlung:** Seit 1995 besteht die evn sammlung, eine Kollektion zeitgenössischer Kunst aus aller Welt, die von dem mit renommierten Experten besetzten EVN Kunstrat kuratiert wird. Die Firmensammlung versteht sich als Plattform zur Auseinandersetzung mit bildender Kunst und richtet sich gleichermaßen an Mitarbeiter und ihre Familien wie an Kunstinteressierte von außerhalb des Unternehmens.\n\n## **Arbeitnehmerbelange**\n\nDie EVN sieht es als ihre Verantwortung, zeitgerecht auf die aktuellen Herausforderungen zu reagieren und ein optimales Arbeitsumfeld für ihre Mitarbeiter zu schaffen, in dem sie sich weiterentwickeln und zielorientiert am gemeinsamen Erfolg arbeiten können. Mit dem Projekt \"EVN Arbeitswelt\" versucht die EVN, diesen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden und ein möglichst flexibles Arbeitsumfeld für ihre Mitarbeiter zu schaffen. Länderspezifische gesetzliche Bestimmungen und internationale Regelwerke, etwa die Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte, sowie die grundlegenden Formulierungen in unserem Verhaltenskodex bilden die grundsätzlichen Leitgedanken der EVN Unternehmenskultur, wenn es um den Umgang mit Mitarbeitern geht. Eine Reihe weiterer verbindlicher Dokumente zur Unternehmens- und Führungskultur, so etwa das Führungsleitbild und die Menschenrechts-Policy, definiert und konkretisiert die Prinzipien und Richtlinien der EVN für den alltäglichen Umgang miteinander.\n\nIm Umgang mit den Mitarbeitern kommt die EVN aber nicht nur den gesetzlich definierten Pflichten nach, sondern erbringt darüber hinaus viele zusätzliche freiwillige Leistungen, um dem Anspruchsbild einer fairen Arbeitgeberin zu entsprechen.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\nFundamentale Prinzipien wie z.B. Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit, Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf, Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit, betriebliche Gesundheitsvorsorge, betriebliche Sozialpartnerschaft und interne Kommunikation sowie betriebliche Zusatzleistungen prägen hierbei die Unternehmenskultur.\n\nZum Bilanzstichtag am 30. September 2023 beschäftigte die EVN 626 Mitarbeiter (Kopfzahl). Die Belegschaft setzt sich aus Menschen unterschiedlicher Nationalitäten, Kulturen und Generationen zusammen. Sie spielen durch ihre hohe Qualifikation in allen Geschäftsaktivitäten der EVN eine zentrale Rolle.\n\n## **Diversität**\n\nZum Bilanzstichtag 30. September 2023 gehörten der EVN AG 182 Frauen (29,1 %) und 444 Männer (70,9 %) an. Zur Erhöhung des Frauenanteils in der EVN sowie zur Unterstützung der Karriereplanung insbesondere hoch qualifizierter bietet das Programm \"Frauen@ EVN\" u. a. die Möglichkeit, bedarfsorientiert Seminare zu besuchen und interne Netzwerkmöglichkeiten wahrzunehmen. Auch ein Mentoring-Programm wurde vor einigen Jahren ins Leben gerufen. Damit will die EVN die Mitarbeiterinnen in ihren Führungspositionen stärken und gleichzeitig die Voraussetzungen für eine Steigerung der Anzahl weiblicher Führungskräfte schaffen. Auch die Möglichkeit, als Teilzeitbeschäftigter Führungsverantwortung zu übernehmen, wird von der EVN bewusst unterstützt und gelebt.\n\n10 Frauen und 9 Männer sind in der Berichtsperiode neu in das Unternehmen eingetreten, während 5 Frauen und 8 Männer das Unternehmen verlassen haben. Zum Stichtag 30. September 2023 gab es in der EVN AG in Summe 76 Teilzeitbeschäftigte, davon 59 Frauen und 17 Männer. Der Anteil an teilzeitbeschäftigten Mitarbeitern an der Gesamtbelegschaft der EVN AG zum Bilanzstichtag entspricht somit 12,1 %.\n\n## **Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit**\n\nIm Einklang mit der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte, den Prinzipien des UN Global Compact sowie den Grundsätzen der International Labour Organization werden alle Mitarbeiter der EVN ungeachtet von Geschlecht, Alter, ethnischer Herkunft, Hautfarbe, sexueller Orientierung, Religion, Weltanschauung oder allfälligen Beeinträchtigungen gleichwertig behandelt. Außerdem lehnt die EVN jede Diskriminierung von Mitarbeitern in Bezug auf Einstellung, Fortbildung, Personalentwicklung, Beschäftigungsbedingungen und Entlohnung bei gleicher fachlicher und persönlicher Qualifikation ausdrücklich ab.\n\nDie Vergütung aller Mitarbeiter richtet sich nach dem jeweils gültigen Kollektivvertrag bzw. nach ihrer jeweiligen Tätigkeit und Qualifikation. Damit bestehen in der EVN bei gleichwertiger Ausbildung und Tätigkeit keine Unterschiede in der Vergütung zwischen Frauen und Männern. Zu unserem grundsätzlichen Bekenntnis zu Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit zählt auch die Förderung der Integration von Menschen mit besonderen Bedürfnissen. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 beschäftigte die EVN AG 15 Menschen aus dieser Personengruppe. Dies entspricht einem Anteil von 2,4 % der Gesamtbelegschaft.\n\n## **Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf**\n\nEin weiteres zentrales Anliegen der EVN ist eine ausgewogene Balance zwischen dem Berufs- und Familienleben ihrer Mitarbeiter. Als eines der ersten Unternehmen hat die EVN bereits im Mai 2011 die \"Charta zur neuen Vereinbarkeit Eltern – Wirtschaft\" – eine Initiative des Landes und der Wirtschaftskammer Niederösterreich – unterzeichnet und damit ein Zeichen für eine elternorientierte Personalpolitik gesetzt. In vielen Bereichen können Mitarbeiter ihre Arbeitszeit frei gestalten, sofern nicht betriebliche Erfordernisse wie etwa Schichtdienste dem entgegenstehen. Die Grundlage dafür bildet ein Gleitzeitmodell ohne Kernzeit, das sehr hohe Flexibilität ermöglicht, Verschiedene Teilzeitmodelle sowie fixe Modelle für mobiles Arbeiten, die z.B. auch eine Kombination von Arbeitseinsatz im Außendienst und mobilem Arbeiten innerhalb eines Arbeitstags ermöglichen, erleichtern den Mitarbeitern die Vereinbarkeit von beruflichen und familiären Verpflichtungen.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie Modelle für mobiles Arbeiten sehen einen Rahmen von bis zu 1.280 Stunden pro Jahr vor, in denen die Mitarbeiter ortsungebunden arbeiten können. Mitarbeiter mit Familienverantwortung werden außerdem mit Einrichtungen wie einem Eltern-Kind-Büro oder mit dem betreuten Kinderferienprogramm der EVN unterstützt.\n\nAlle Mitarbeiter der EVN haben nach der Geburt eines Kindes gesetzlichen Anspruch auf Karenzzeit sowie dem sogenannten Papamonat. Die EVN gewährt die Karenzzeit mit einer möglichen Arbeitsfreistellung bis zum 36. Lebensmonat des Kindes sogar über die bestehende gesetzliche Verpflichtung hinaus. Während der Karenzzeit hält die EVN den Kontakt zu ihren Mitarbeitern gezielt aufrecht und erleichtert damit ihren beruflichen Wiedereinstieg. Darüber hinaus stehen den Mitarbeitern in Karenz weiterhin spezifische Informationsveranstaltungen und ein umfassendes Aus- und Weiterbildungsprogramm offen. Auch immer mehr männliche Mitarbeiter der EVN nutzen dieses Angebot, und beinahe alle Mütter und Väter kehren nach ihrer Karenz wieder zur EVN zurück.\n\n## **Gesundheitsvorsorge, Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit**\n\nDie Gewährleistung der Sicherheit und Gesundheit der Mitarbeiter sowie die Bestrebungen im Interesse von Arbeitssicherheit und Unfallvermeidung bilden ein zentrales Element der EVN Unternehmenskultur. In Ergänzung zu europäischen und länderspezifischen gesetzlichen Vorschriften, die durchwegs zur Gänze eingehalten werden, sind sie für sämtliche Unternehmenseinheiten im EVN Verhaltenskodex, Menschenrechts-Policy, Sicherheitsleitbild und -strategie sowie in internen Geschäftsanweisungen und Richtlinien fest verankert, die Sicherheitsrisiken definieren und entsprechende Gegenmaßnahmen vorgeben.\n\nSämtliche Arbeitsunfälle nahezu aller Mitarbeiter und Leiharbeiter der EVN werden über einen zentralen sicherheitstechnischen Dienst erfasst und analysiert, und es werden gegebenenfalls entsprechende Maßnahmen eingeleitet. Zur Erfassung erkannter Risiken und Vorfälle sowie zum Monitoring getroffener Maßnahmen orientiert sich die EVN an den Anforderungen der Norm ISO 45001. Durch den engen Kontakt zwischen den Sicherheitsvertrauenspersonen in den einzelnen Unternehmensbereichen und den zentralen Sicherheitsfachkräften wird außerdem sichergestellt, dass erkannte Risiken und Maßnahmen zur Gefahrenvermeidung in alle Sicherheits- und Gesundheitsschutzdokumente einfließen. Bei sicherheitstechnischen Fragen ist die jeweils zuständige Sicherheitsvertrauensperson mit ihrer fachlichen Kompetenz hinsichtlich des konkreten Arbeitsprozesses und ihrer Kenntnisse im Arbeitsschutz die erste Anlaufstelle für Betroffene. Darüber hinaus werden alle Mitarbeiter und Leasingmitarbeiter von Sicherheitsvertrauenspersonen in Arbeitsausschüssen vertreten, die Arbeitsschutzprogramme überwachen und über solche beraten. Dieser Austausch erfolgt gemäß den gesetzlichen Vorgaben einmal jährlich.\n\nAls Basis der regelmäßigen Unterweisungen dient das eigens auf die Arbeitsbedingungen in der Energiewirtschaft ausgerichtete \"Handbuch Sicherheit\" der Branchenvereinigung Oesterreichs Energie. Das für den Konzern zentral organisierte Team der EVN Arbeitssicherheit setzt auch eine Vielfalt an konkreten Maßnahmen um, wie z.B. Sicherheitsgespräche mit dem Vorgesetzten, E-Learning-Module und Videoclips zu Arbeitsweisen und zur Handhabung von Arbeitsmitteln, Fachseminare, Artikel in der Mitarbeiterzeitung sowie im Intranet zu unterschiedlichen Aspekten der Arbeitssicherheit sowie die Verleihung des jährlichen \"Oskar für Arbeitssicherheit\" an jene Abteilungen bzw. Organisationen, die ein unfallfreies Jahr hinter sicher gebracht haben.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 ereigneten sich bei der EVN AG zwei Arbeitsunfälle (Vorjahr: 5); der Lost Time Injury Frequency Index (LTIF) betrug 1,6 (Vorjahr: 1,7).\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nUm auch unserer Verantwortung für die Gesundheit der Mitarbeiter gerecht zu werden, bietet die EVN eine weit über das gesetzliche Maß hinausgehende arbeitsmedizinische Betreuung. Zwei Arbeitsmediziner stehen für alle Fragen rund um Gesundheitsvorsorge, Bewusstseinsbildung sowie Erhaltung und Förderung der Gesundheit am Arbeitsplatz zur Verfügung und betreuen die Mitarbeiter im Rahmen der Arbeitnehmerschutzbestimmungen und darüber hinaus. Zu den zahlreichen angebotenen Maßnahmen zählen u.a. Gesundenuntersuchungen, Impfungen, Seh- und Hörtests, Präventionsmedizin sowie Erste-Hilfe-Kurse, aber auch psychologische Beratung, Coaching, Tipps für gesunde Ernährung sowie spezifische Angebote für Mitarbeiter, die besonderen Belastungen ausgesetzt sind. Die EVN ist nicht in Ländern aktiv, in denen ein erhöhtes Risiko durch übertragbare Krankheiten besteht oder Arbeitsbedingungen vorherrschen, die die Gesundheit der Mitarbeiter dauerhaft gefährden könnten. Dennoch hat die EVN Konzernanweisungen für Ernstfälle in allen Konzerngesellschaften entwickelt – darunter z.B. die \"Pandemievorsorge EVN\", die nach dem Ausbruch von Covid-19 im März 2020 als wertvolle Grundlage für die gesetzten Maßnahmen diente.\n\nNeben den direkt vom Unternehmen getragenen Maßnahmen eröffnet die EVN Kultur- und Sportvereinigung allen Mitarbeitern ein vielfältiges Angebot an Aktivitäten von Laufsport über Tennis, Fußball und Flugsport bis hin zu Film und Fotografie. Bei vielen dieser Aktivitäten nimmt die Gesundheitsförderung ebenfalls einen wichtigen Stellenwert ein.\n\n## **Betriebliche Sozialpartnerschaft**\n\nBei wesentlichen unternehmerischen Entscheidungen achtet die EVN auf Transparenz und steht damit im Einklang mit ihrem Führungsleitbild, mit allen gesetzlichen Bestimmungen sowie mit der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte. In diesem Sinn werden auch die Arbeitnehmervertreter laufend und zeitgerecht über wesentliche unternehmerische Entscheidungen informiert bzw. in die Entscheidungsprozesse eingebunden. Dies gilt für strategische Entscheidungen ebenso wie für Änderungen oder Anpassungen im Personalbereich. 100 % der Mitarbeiter in der EVN AG werden durch Belegschaftsvertretungen wie Betriebsräte oder Gewerkschaften vertreten und sind hinsichtlich ihrer Bezahlung durch kollektivvertragliche, tarifliche oder gesetzliche Mindestlöhne geschützt. Regelmäßig werden die Belegschaftsvertretungen in die Kollektivvertragsverhandlungen eingebunden. Insgesamt orientiert sich das Gehaltsschema von allen Mitarbeitern der EVN AG an diesen Kollektivverträgen. Mitarbeiterthemen werden auch in Arbeits- und Sicherheitsausschüssen behandelt, die sich u.a. aus Betriebsräten oder Gewerkschaftsvertretern zusammensetzen. Außerdem können sich Vertreter des Betriebsrats im Aufsichtsrat sowie im Nachhaltigkeitsbeirat äußern.\n\n## **Personalentwicklung und -förderung**\n\nDie hohe Qualifikation der Mitarbeiter hat für die EVN große strategische Bedeutung und ist wesentlich für die Sicherung des nachhaltigen Unternehmenserfolgs. Daher bilden die Wahrung, aber auch die Verbesserung der hohen Kompetenz der Mitarbeiter zentrale Schwerpunkte des Personalmanagements bei EVN. Vor dem Hintergrund des aktuellen Arbeits- und Fachkräftemangels hat die zielgerichtete, individuelle und effiziente Personalentwicklung nochmals an Bedeutung gewonnen. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 absolvierte jeder Mitarbeiter der EVN AG im Schnitt 11,1 Stunden an Weiterbildungsveranstaltungen.\n\nEntscheidender Erfolgsfaktor im Wettbewerb um die klügsten Köpfe ist es, die Erwartungen und Bedürfnisse seiner potenziellen und auch bestehenden Mitarbeiter zu kennen und diesen so weit wie möglich entgegenzukommen. Die EVN betrachtet ihre Mitarbeiter sehr differenziert über den gesamten Employee Life Cycle hinweg, von der Phase der Orientierung und Jobsuche bis hin zum Pensionsantritt und auch noch danach. Ein umfassendes Onboarding stellt mit Infoveranstaltungen, Einschulungen, E-Learnings, Patensystem und regelmäßigen Feedbackschleifen sicher, dass die neuen Mitarbeiter auch tatsächlich im Unternehmen ankommen.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nDamit die Mitarbeiter in ihrer jeweiligen Situation wahrgenommen und gefördert werden und sich weiterentwickeln können, spielt auch regelmäßiges Feedback – z. B. im Rahmen der jährlichen Mitarbeitergespräche – und die laufende Erhebung der Mitarbeiterzufriedenheit durch den \"Stimmungsbarometer\" eine ganz wesentliche Rolle.\n\nZur Gewinnung von qualifizierten neuen Mitarbeitern nutzt die EVN seit vielen Jahren auch gezieltes Employer Branding. Dazu gibt sie u. a. auf digitalen Plattformen authentische Einblicke in das Unternehmen und die vielfältigen Aufgabenbereiche. Ebenso gibt es seit einigen Jahren ein erfolgreiches Empfehlungsprogramm \"Mitarbeiter werben Mitarbeiter\" sowie ein Jobbotschafter-Programm. Grundidee ist in beiden Fällen die stärkere und aktive Einbindung bestehender Kollegen ins Recruiting.\n\nDas umfangreiche Aus- und Weiterbildungsangebot der EVN wird durch die EVN Akademie umgesetzt, die jährlich rund 200 Veranstaltungen organisiert und mehr als 70 unterschiedliche Ausbildungspläne zu technischen Themenstellungen und Inhalten wie auch zur Persönlichkeitsentwicklung koordiniert. Für Führungskräfte und High Potentials gibt es darüber hinausgehende Ausbildungsprogramme und vielfältige Karrieremöglichkeiten.\n\nIm Bewusstsein um den hohen Stellenwert von Aus- und Weiterbildung bekennt sich die EVN auch zu Bildungskarenz und Bildungsteilzeit. Entsprechende Ansuchen werden nach Prüfung der betrieblichen Möglichkeiten und Interessen vonseiten der Arbeitgeberin unter Berücksichtigung definierter Rahmenbedingungen grundsätzlich genehmigt. Auch das Modell der befristeten Wiedereingliederungsteilzeit wird fallweise genutzt, um Mitarbeiter z.B. nach einer längeren Krankheit die schrittweise Rückkehr in den Arbeitsalltag zu erleichtern. Die Möglichkeit der Altersteilzeit wiederum nutzen Mitarbeiter, um ihre Arbeitszeit bis zum Pensionsantritt schrittweise zu reduzieren.\n\n## **Achtung der Menschenrechte und Bekämpfung von Korruption**\n\nNeben den grundlegenden Formulierungen zu Vision, Mission und Unternehmenswerten definiert eine Reihe weiterer verbindlicher Dokumente den Verhaltens- und Handlungsrahmen der EVN. Als Mitglied des UN Global Compact bekennt sich die EVN zudem explizit zur Einhaltung globaler Prinzipien ethischen wirtschaftlichen Handelns.\n\nDie EVN legt größten Wert auf ethisch und rechtlich einwandfreies Verhalten aller Mitarbeiter, Geschäftspartner und Lieferanten. Um die Einhaltung dieses Bekenntnisses zu lückenloser Regeltreue wirksam zu gewährleisten, hat die EVN konzernweit Compliance-Richtlinien und Maßnahmen implementiert. Zentrales Dokument ist dabei der in zehn Themenbereiche gegliederte EVN Verhaltenskodex, der auf Basis des EVN Unternehmensleitbilds u. a. jene Aspekte der Geschäftstätigkeit regelt, die Menschenrechte, Governance, Unternehmensethik, Korruptionsprävention, Datenschutz, Vertraulichkeit und Wettbewerbsverhalten, Arbeitsschutz und Unfallvermeidung sowie Klima- und Umweltschutz betreffen. Lückenlose Compliance sowie die strikte Einhaltung des EVN Verhaltenskodex bilden konzernweit die verbindliche Richtschnur für das Verhalten. Die Regelungen des Verhaltenskodex setzen auf verschiedenen Grundlagen auf, die jeweils auf die Gegebenheiten und Anforderungen des Unternehmens umgelegt werden. Ihr Bogen reicht von länderspezifischen gesetzlichen Bestimmungen und internationalen Regelwerken, etwa Leitsätzen und Übereinkommen der OECD sowie des UN Global Compact, über Grundsatzerklärungen und Prinzipien der International Labour Organisation (ILO) bis hin zu internen Organisationsvorschriften und Unternehmensgrundsätzen, die über geltendes Recht hinausgehen.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Menschenrechte**\n\nSeit jeher ist im EVN Verhaltenskodex das uneingeschränkte und unmissverständliche Bekenntnis zur Achtung, zur Einhaltung sowie zum Schutz der Menschenrechte sowie zur Berücksichtigung ethischer Grundsätze im Umgang mit allen Mitarbeitern an allen Standorten sowie in allen Geschäftsbeziehungen verankert. Die Ablehnung von Kinder- und Zwangsarbeit zählt ebenso dazu wie die Forderung, niemanden aufgrund von Gender, Alter, ethnischer Herkunft, Hautfarbe, sexueller Orientierung, Religion, Weltanschauung oder allfälligen Beeinträchtigungen zu diskriminieren. Weitere Elemente sind die Gewährung von Mitspracherechten, die Umsetzung von Maßnahmen für Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit sowie die Berücksichtigung von Menschenrechtsfragen in der Lieferkette (insbesondere bei internationalen Projekten).\n\nDen Handlungsrahmen für die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte und des sozialen Mindestschutzes bilden interne Regelungen, die ihrerseits auf relevanten Gesetzen und internationalen Regelwerken beruhen, insbesondere auf den zehn Prinzipien des UN Global Compact und auf den Leitsätzen der OECD, der Vereinten Nationen sowie der International Labour Organization. Als international tätiges Unternehmen ist die EVN in Ländern mit unterschiedlicher Geschichte und Entwicklung in Menschenrechtsfragen tätig. Auch wenn dies primär in der Verantwortung der jeweiligen Regierungen liegt, fühlt sich die EVN dazu verpflichtet, die Wahrung der Menschenrechte sicherzustellen und ihre Einhaltung im Rahmen der Möglichkeiten auch außerhalb des unmittelbaren Wirkungsbereichs zu fördern.\n\nDie Aspekte Menschenrechte und sozialer Mindestschutz werden im EVN Konzern als Querschnittsmaterien von unterschiedlichen Organisationseinheiten (insbesondere Personalwesen, Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit, Beschaffung und Einkauf sowie der Stabsstelle Corporate Compliance Management) verantwortet. Im Geschäftsjahr 2021/22 wurden – insbesondere mit Blick auf die erstmalige Berichterstattung gemäß der EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung – die internen Prozesse und Regelwerke zu den Themen Menschenrechte und sozialer Mindestschutz überprüft und diese im Berichtszeitraum weiterentwickelt. Damit sollte sichergestellt werden, dass die für diese Themenbereiche etablierten Managementansätze und organisatorischen Regelungen lückenlos eingehalten werden.\n\nBegleitend erfolgte im Lauf der letzten beiden Geschäftsjahre – vor allem für die besonders mit den Aspekten Menschenrechte befassten Organisationen – eine vertiefte Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema, die auch durch externe Experten begleitet wurde. Vorstand und Führungskräfte wurden regelmäßig über Fortschritte und neu implementierte Maßnahmen informiert. Darüber hinaus wurde im Jahr 2022 eine EVN Menschenrechts-Policy formuliert und vom Vorstand genehmigt sowie ein EVN Menschenrechtsbeauftragter ernannt und in der Stabsstelle Corporate Compliance Management etabliert. Ab dem Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 sind bereits konkrete Weiterentwicklungsmaßnahmen geplant: Zu Beginn stehen Sensibilisierungsmaßnahmen und verpflichtende Schulungen. Diese sollen konzernweit das Verständnis zur Achtung der diversen Aspekte zum Thema Menschenrechte verstärken. Zudem soll ein Impact Assessment zum Thema Menschenrechte durchgeführt werden, um mögliche Risiken und Auswirkungen strukturiert zu erheben, zu bewerten und gegebenenfalls weitere Maßnahmen zu entwickeln.\n\nRisiken in Bezug auf die Nichteinhaltung der Menschenrechte werden konzernweit im Rahmen der jährlichen Risikoinventur erhoben.\n\n## **Korruptionsprävention**\n\nDie EVN tritt entschieden gegen jede Art von Korruption auf und fasst den Begriff Korruption sehr weit. Er beinhaltet für die EVN neben gesetzwidrigen Zahlungen (z.B. Bestechung, Kick-back-Zahlungen, fingierten Leistungen, Falschklassifizierung/-kontierung) auch alle anderen Arten von Zuwendungen (z.B. Geschenke, Einladungen, nicht drittübliche Vergünstigungen, immaterielle Vorteile wie Auszeichnungen und Protektion).\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nSowohl die Annahme als auch die Gewährung solcher Vorteile sind für die Mitarbeiter der EVN und deren Angehörige konzernweit verboten. Ausgenommen davon sind bei pflichtgemäßer Abwicklung von Geschäften lediglich die Annahme bzw. Gewährung ortsund landesüblicher Aufmerksamkeiten geringen Werts.\n\nUmfassende präventive Maßnahmen – darunter eigene Verhaltensregeln sowie spezifische Aus- und Weiterbildungsveranstaltungen – sollen Mitarbeiter gerade zum Thema Korruptionsvermeidung sensibilisieren. Deshalb legt die EVN bei der regelmäßigen Erhebung von Compliance-Risiken auch besonders Augenmerk auf das Thema Korruption.\n\n## **Organisation des Compliance-Managements**\n\nBei der EVN besteht seit 2012 ein eigenes Compliance-Management-System (CMS). Es gibt einen konzernweit einheitlichen Rahmen vor, der die EVN Mitarbeiter im Arbeitsalltag dabei unterstützen soll, sich integer und gesetzestreu zu verhalten.\n\nEs baut auf drei Säulen auf:\n\n- Prävention durch Bewusstseinsbildung und Schulungen\n- Identifikation von Compliance-Risikofeldern und Verstößen gegen den Verhaltenskodex\n- Reaktion durch Aufklärung und Verbesserung sowie gegebenenfalls Setzen von Maßnahmen\n\nDie Führung und die laufende Weiterentwicklung des CMS werden von der direkt dem Gesamtvorstand unterstellten Stabsstelle Corporate Compliance Management (CCM) verantwortet. Neben dem Chief Compliance Officer und den Mitarbeitern von CCM wurden in den einzelnen operativen Bereichen der EVN dezentrale Compliance Officer eingesetzt.\n\n## **Erhebung von Compliance-Risiken**\n\nCompliance-Risiken, die bei der EVN auch die Themen Menschenrechte und Korruptionsprävention umfassen, werden bei der EVN jährlich systematisch und aus unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln für den Gesamtkonzern erhoben. Ein wichtiger Anlass dafür ist etwa die jährliche Risikoinventur, da Compliance-Verstöße aus Sicht des Risikomanagements der EVN einen Risikofaktor darstellen. Darüber hinaus achtet auch die Interne Revision im Rahmen aller Prüfungsprojekte auf die Einhaltung sämtlicher Vorgaben und Regelungen im Zusammenhang mit Compliance. Die Ergebnisse dieser Erhebungen werden den Führungskräften, dem Gesamtvorstand und dem Prüfungsausschuss des Aufsichtsrats vorgelegt.\n\n## **Hinweisgeberverfahren**\n\nFür den Fall eines (vermuteten) Compliance-Verstoßes steht internen und externen Personen ein vertrauliches und anonymes Hinweisgeberverfahren (\"Whistle Blowing\") zur Verfügung. Alle Bedenken in Bezug auf ethisch nicht vertretbares oder rechtswidriges Verhalten können dabei niederschwellig entweder persönlich, telefonisch, über spezifische Compliance E-Mail-Adressen oder über ein von einem externen Dienstleister gehostetes Hinweisgebersystem erfolgen. Diese Möglichkeiten bestehen konzernweit und in allen wesentlichen Landessprachen des EVN Konzerns. Das Hinweisgeberverfahren wurde dabei mit der Zielsetzung ausgestaltet, eine lückenlose, objektive und effiziente Aufklärung gemeldeter Verstöße gegen den EVN Verhaltenskodex zu gewährleisten. Anonym abgegebene Hinweise werden stets von der EVN behandelt. Eine eigene Konzernanweisung regelt insbesondere die Vorgehensweise bei der Behandlung der gemeldeten Bedenken sowie die Vorkehrungen zum Schutz der Hinweisgeber vor Repressalien.\n\nCompliance-Verstöße stellen eine Verletzung von Dienstpflichten dar, in manchen Fällen sind sie zudem strafrechtlich relevant. Dies ist von den dazu berufenen Einrichtungen zu beurteilen. Sollte sich ein Verdacht bestätigen, führt dies je nach Schwere und Schadensumfang zu arbeits- bzw. zivilrechtlichen Konsequenzen.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeshalb sind Mitarbeiter, die im Rahmen ihrer Arbeit in Interessen- oder Loyalitätskonflikte geraten, aufgerufen, sich direkt und rechtzeitig an den EVN Compliance Officer zu wenden.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 wurden der EVN AG keine Fälle von vermuteter Diskriminierung gemeldet. In der Berichtsperiode hat die EVN AG keine Meldungen über Vorwürfe vermuteter Korruption erreicht und kein – aus vor der Berichtszeit – gemeldeter Fall war Gegenstand von Klagen. Auch eine Vertragsaufkündigung mit Geschäftspartnern aus Gründen von Verstößen gegen den EVN Verhaltenskodex ist nicht erfolgt.\n\nDie Verpflichtung zur Einhaltung hoher ethischer Standards gilt explizit auch für Geschäftspartner der EVN. Besonderen Wert wird hier auf die Themen \"Menschenrechte\", \"Arbeitsbedingungen und -rechte\", \"Umwelt- und Klimaschutz\" sowie \"Geschäftsethik\" gelegt. Im gesamten Konzern verfolgt die EVN das Ziel, Geschäftsbeziehungen zu Unternehmen zu vermeiden, denen direkte oder indirekte Verstöße gegen die Menschenrechte bzw. das Korruptions-, Kartell- oder Wirtschaftsrecht zur Last gelegt werden oder gar nachgewiesen wurden. Bei der Überprüfung potenzieller Geschäftspartner, die auch das Screening von Sanktionslisten mit einschließt, folgt die EVN einem risikoorientierten Ansatz und berücksichtigt insbesondere Branchen- und Länderrisiken. Die EVN nutzt zudem die Compliance-Datenbank und -Software eines spezialisierten externen Dienstleisters. Sofern diese Screenings sensible Ergebnisse erbringen, werden entsprechende Maßnahmen zur Risikoreduktion gesetzt.\n\n## **Compliance-Schulungen**\n\nDas CMS der EVN stellt mit einem sorgsam entwickelten und kontinuierlich verbesserten Schulungs- und Kommunikationskonzept konzernweit sicher, dass sich alle Mitarbeiter regelmäßig mit Compliance-Themen befassen und die Themenbereiche des EVN Verhaltenskodex jährlich wiederholt werden. Schulungsschwerpunkte sind insbesondere Menschenrechte, Unternehmensethik, Korruptionsprävention und Wettbewerbsverhalten.\n\nDas im Geschäftsjahr 2021/22 in Abstimmung mit den Führungskräften neu konzipierte mehrstufige Compliance-Schulungsprogramm stellt nun mehr den konzernweit verpflichtenden Schulungsstandard zum EVN Verhaltenskodex dar, der von allen neu eingetretenen Mitarbeitern (inklusive externer Arbeitskräfte) absolviert werden muss. Sämtliche Module dieses umfassenden Lernpfads zeichnen sich durch einen hohen Grad an Interaktion und Praxisbezug aus. Die Präsenztrainings, Webinare und E-Learnings kombinieren zudem Einheiten zum Selbststudium samt Wissensüberprüfungen mit der Möglichkeit zur gemeinsamen Arbeit an Fallbeispielen.\n\nNeben diesem umfangreichen Schulungsprogramm setzt CCM regelmäßig auch auf alternative Kommunikationsmaßen (z.B. solche im Intranet oder in der Mitarbeiterzeitung der EVN) sowie auf die Wissensvermittlung durch Führungskräfte, die laufend in die Vertiefung und Weiterentwicklung der Compliance-Grundsätze und -Regeln sowie der ethischen Prinzipien eingebunden sind.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n**EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf** \n\n#### **Ausblick Ausblick**  Die EVN AG wird im Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 den mit der Strategie 2030 vorgegebenen Kurs konzentriert weiterverfolgen.

ALLGEMEINE ANGABEN**\n\nDer vorliegende Jahresabschluss zum 30.09.2023 der EVN AG wurde vom Vorstand der Gesellschaft nach den Vorschriften des Unternehmensgesetzbuches (UGB) aufgestellt.\n\nDie Gesellschaft ist eine große Kapitalgesellschaft gemäß § 221 UGB.\n\nDie bisherige Form der Darstellung des Jahresabschlusses wurde bei der Erstellung des vorliegenden Jahresabschlusses beibehalten.\n\nDas Unternehmen ist Mutterunternehmen und gehört dem Konsolidierungskreis des EVN-Konzerns an. Der Konzernabschluss ist beim Firmenbuchgericht Wiener Neustadt hinterlegt.\n\nBeginnend mit dem Geschäftsjahr 2020/21 sind die NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding (NLH) und die WIENER STADTWERKE GmbH (WSTW) übereingekommen, dass die EVN AG in eine steuerliche Beteiligungsgemeinschaft iSd § 9 KStG einbezogen wird. Die EVN AG kann ihrerseits nach freiem Ermessen einzelne oder mehrere ihrer qualifizierenden Tochter- und Beteiligungsgemeinschaften in die Gruppe der Beteiligungsgemeinschaft einbeziehen. Die NLH und die WSTW sind selbst jeweils Gruppenträger einer Unternehmensgruppe. NLH bleibt als hauptbeteiligte Gesellschaft der Beteiligungsgemeinschaft Gruppenträger der EVN, WSTW ist minderbeteiligte Gesellschaft.\n\nZum 30. September 2023 hat die EVN AG ihrerseits mit der EVN Wasser GmbH, Netz Niederösterreich GmbH, EVN Wärme GmbH, evn naturkraft Erzeugungsgesellschaft m.b.H, EVN Energieservices GmbH, EVN Kroatien Holding GmbH, EVN Croatia Plin d.o.o., kabelplus GmbH, Utilitas Dienstleistungs- und Beteiligungs-Gesellschaft m.b.H, EVN Wärmekraftwerke GmbH, Burgenland Holding AG, RAG-Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft, RAG Austria AG, RAG Energy Storage GmbH, RAG Exploration & Production GmbH, EVN Umweltholding und Betriebs-GmbH, EVN Business Service GmbH, EVN Geoinfo GmbH, Netz Niederösterreich Beteiligung 31 GmbH, Netz Niederösterreich Liegenschaftsbesitz 31 GmbH sowie der EVN Umwelt Beteiligungs und Service GmbH eine Gruppen- und Steuerumlagevereinbarung abgeschlossen und bildet mit diesen Gesellschaften die steuerliche EVN Gruppe.\n\nDie Steuerumlagen in der \"EVN Gruppe\" werden jeweils nach der Belastungsmethode (\"stand-alone\"-Methode) ermittelt. Dabei werden bei überrechneten steuerlichen Verlusten, diese auf Seite der Gruppenmitglieder als \"interne Verlustvorträge\" evident gehalten und mit künftigen positiven Ergebnissen verrechnet. Eine Ausnahme davon bildet der Vertrag mit der Burgenland Holding AG, der vorsieht, dass der Burgenland Holding AG im Falle der Zurechnung eines negativen steuerlichen Ergebnisses auch dann eine negative Steuerumlage gutgeschrieben wird, wenn das Gruppenergebnis insgesamt positiv ist. Die EVN AG entrichtet ihrerseits eine Steuerumlage an die NLH und WSTW die sich vom steuerlichen Ergebnis der \"EVN Gruppe\" bemisst.\n\nIm Zuge einer konzerninternen Umstrukturierung infolge einer Neuausrichtung der Vertriebsaktivitäten des EVN Konzerns wurde mit 28. Februar 2023 der Teilbetrieb \"vertriebs- und energienahe Dienstleistungen\" der EVN KG in die 100%ige Tochtergesellschaft EVN Energieservice GmbH eingebracht. Die EVN KG soll sich damit künftig ausschließlich auf Stromund Gaslieferungen an Endkund\\*innen konzentrieren, während die EVN Energieservices sich auf vertriebs- und energienahe Dienstleistungen fokussiert. Weiters erfolgte eine Einbringung der Anteile an der EnergieAllianz Austria GmbH (EAA) in die EVN Energieservice GmbH. Dementsprechend werden die Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten an die EVN KG und EAA nunmehr als Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber Dritten ausgewiesen. Nachdem im Vorjahr der Ausweis unter Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber beteiligten Unternehmen erfolgte, sind die Vorjahreszahlen nur bedingt vergleichbar.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie Gewinn-und-Verlust-Rechnung wurde gem. § 231 Abs 1 in Verbindung mit Abs. 2 UGB nach dem Gesamtkostenverfahren erstellt.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2. BILANZIERUNGS- UND BEWERTUNGSMETHODEN**\n\n## **2.1. Allgemeine Grundsätze**\n\nDer Jahresabschluss wurde unter Beachtung der Grundsätze ordnungsmäßiger Buchführung und Bilanzierung erstellt und entspricht der Generalnorm für den Jahresabschluss, ein möglichst getreues Bild der Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage des Unternehmens zu vermitteln.\n\nBei der Erstellung des Jahresabschlusses wurde der Grundsatz der Vollständigkeit eingehalten.\n\nBei den angewandten Bilanzierungs- und Bewertungsmethoden wird gemäß § 237 Abs 1 Z1 UGB von der Fortführung des Unternehmens ausgegangen.\n\nBei Umgründungen werden die Buchwerte aus dem letzten Jahresabschluss oder einer Zwischenbilanz, die nach dem auf den letzten Jahresabschluss angewandten Bilanzierungsund Bewertungsmethoden zu erstellen ist, fortgeführt.\n\nBei den Vermögensgegenständen und Schulden wurde der Grundsatz der Einzelbewertung angewandt.\n\nDem Vorsichtsgrundsatz wurde Rechnung getragen, indem nur die am Abschlussstichtag verwirklichten Gewinne zum Ausweis gelangten und alle erkennbaren Risiken und drohenden Verluste, die bis zum Bilanzstichtag entstanden sind, berücksichtigt wurden.\n\nDie bisherigen angewandten Bilanzierungs- und Bewertungsmethoden wurden beibehalten.\n\n## **2.2. Anlagevermögen**\n\n**Immaterielle Vermögensgegenstände** werden zu Anschaffungskosten, vermindert um lineare, planmäßige Abschreibungen bewertet. Gemäß den steuerrechtlichen Vorschriften nimmt die Gesellschaft für Zugänge im ersten Halbjahr eine volle Jahresabschreibung, für Zugänge im zweiten Halbjahr eine halbe Jahresabschreibung vor. Außerplanmäßige Abschreibungen auf einen zum Abschlussstichtag niedrigeren beizulegenden Wert werden vorgenommen, soweit die Wertminderung voraussichtlich von Dauer ist.\n\n**Gegenstände des Sachanlagevermögens** werden zu Anschaffungs- bzw. Herstellungskosten, vermindert um lineare, planmäßige Abschreibungen bewertet. Gemäß den steuerrechtlichen Vorschriften nimmt die Gesellschaft für Zugänge im ersten Halbjahr eine volle Jahresabschreibung, für Zugänge im zweiten Halbjahr eine halbe Jahresabschreibung vor.\n\nAußerplanmäßige Abschreibungen auf einen zum Abschlussstichtag niedrigeren beizulegenden Wert werden vorgenommen, soweit die Wertminderung voraussichtlich von Dauer ist.\n\nDie Herstellungskosten enthalten Material- und Fertigungseinzelkosten sowie angemessene Teile der Material- und Fertigungsgemeinkosten. Aufwendungen der allgemeinen Verwaltung sowie Fremdkapitalzinsen werden nicht aktiviert. Die der Aktivierung von Eigenleistungen zugrundeliegenden Personalstundensätze berücksichtigen auch Aufwendungen für freiwillige Sozialleistungen, Abfertigungen und überbetriebliche Altersversorgung. Ein Ausscheiden überhöhter Gemeinkosten infolge offenbarer Unterbeschäftigung war nicht erforderlich.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\nDer betriebsgewöhnlichen Nutzungsdauer werden branchenübliche Richtwerte zugrunde gelegt. Die Abschreibungssätze sind nachstehender Tabelle zu entnehmen.\n\n| Abschreibungen nach Anlagenkategorien                       | Nutzungsdauer in Jahren | Planm         äßige Abschreibung in % |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Rechte                                                      | 4-40                    | 2,5-25                                |\n| Geb         äude                                            | 10-50                   | 2-10                                  |\n| Kraftwerks- und Erzeugungsanlagen                           | 20                      | 5                                     |\n| andere Anlagen, Betriebs- und Gesch         äftsausstattung | 3-20                    | 5-33,3                                |\n\nGeringwertige Vermögensgegenstände werden im Zugangsjahr aktiviert und sofort abgeschrieben. Die Ausbuchung dieser Anlagen erfolgt nach Ablauf der Nutzungsdauern, die für die definierten Anlagengruppen grundsätzlich gelten.\n\nDie **Finanzanlagen** werden zu Anschaffungskosten oder, falls ihnen ein niedrigerer Wert (z.

Börsekurs) beizulegen ist, mit diesem angesetzt, wenn die Wertminderungen voraussichtlich von Dauer sind.\n\nBei der Bewertung von Anteilen an verbundenen Unternehmen müssen vor allem in Bezug auf künftige Zahlungsmittelüberschüsse Schätzungen unter Unsicherheit vorgenommen werden. Eine Änderung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen, der Branchen- oder der Unternehmenssituation in der Zukunft kann zu einer Reduktion bzw. Erhöhung der Zahlungsmittelüberschüsse und somit zu Wertminderungen bzw. Wertaufholungen führen.\n\nDen Bewertungen wird auf Basis der voraussichtlichen Entwicklung ein kapitalwertorientiertes Verfahren zugrunde gelegt, bei dem die gewichteten durchschnittlichen Kapitalkosten (Weighted Average Cost of Capital = WACC) verwendet werden. Diese entsprechen der durchschnittlichen gewichteten Verzinsung von Eigen- und Fremdkapital. Die Gewichtung von Eigen- und Fremdkapitalverzinsung – diese entspricht einer Kapitalstruktur zu Marktwerten – werden aus einer adäquaten Peer Group abgeleitet. Vor dem Hintergrund des derzeit volatilen Finanzmarktumfelds stellt die Entwicklung der Kapitalkosten (und insbesondere der Länderrisikoprämien) eine Unsicherheit dar und wird laufend beobachtet.\n\nAls Preisgerüst dienen ab dem fünften Jahr (keine aussagekräftigen Marktpreise an den Strombörsen mehr verfügbar) Prognosen zweier renommierter Marktforschungsinstitute und Informationsdienstleister in der Energiewirtschaft, welche aufgrund der derzeitigen Volatilität der Strommärkte jährlich aktualisiert werden.\n\n**Ausleihungen** werden zu Anschaffungskosten, unverzinsliche bzw. niedrig verzinsliche Ausleihungen zum Barwert bilanziert. Außerplanmäßige Abschreibungen werden nur im Fall einer voraussichtlich dauernden Wertminderung vorgenommen.\n\n**Zuschreibungen zu Vermögensgegenständen des Anlagevermögens** werden vorgenommen, wenn die Gründe für die außerplanmäßige Abschreibung weggefallen sind. Die Zuschreibung erfolgt auf maximal den Nettobuchwert, der sich unter Berücksichtigung der Normalabschreibungen, die inzwischen vorzunehmen gewesen wären, ergibt.\n\n## **2.3. Umlaufvermögen**\n\nDie Bewertung der Vorräte erfolgt zu Anschaffungs- bzw. Herstellungskosten oder dem niedrigeren Wert aus Anschaffungskosten oder beizulegendem Wert am Bilanzstichtag. Die Anschaffungskosten für den Gasvorrat werden nach dem gleitenden Durchschnittspreisverfahren ermittelt. Bestandsrisken, die sich aus der Lagerdauer sowie geminderter Verwendbarkeit ergeben, werden durch angemessene Wertabschläge berücksichtigt.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nFür notwendige Beschaffungen von CO2-Emissionszertifikaten erfolgt die Bilanzierung zu Anschaffungskosten, für Zuführungen zu Rückstellungen aufgrund allfälliger Unterdeckungen mit dem Zeitwert zum Bilanzstichtag. Als Verbrauchsfolgeverfahren von CO2 Zertifikaten wird das First-in-first-out Prinzip angewendet.\n\nForderungen und sonstige Vermögensgegenstände werden mit dem Nennbetrag angesetzt. Längerfristige unverzinsliche bzw. niedrig verzinsliche Forderungen werden entsprechend diskontiert. Für erkennbare Risiken werden Einzelwertberichtigungen gebildet. Für das allgemeine Kreditrisiko erfolgt eine pauschale Einzelwertberichtigung je nach Außenstandsdauer mit folgenden Wertberichtigungssätzen:\n\n| Außenstandsdauer: | Wertberichtigungsprozentsatz: |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| noch nicht fällig | 0,06%                         |\n| 1 - 89 Tage       | 0,13%                         |\n| 90 - 179 Tage     | 83,43%                        |\n| 180 - 359 Tage    | 79,30%                        |\n| 360 - 719 Tage    | 81,14%                        |\n| 720 - 1079 Tage   | 91,68%                        |\n| >1080 Tage        | 92,02%                        |\n\nDie Wertpapiere des Umlaufvermögens werden zu Anschaffungskosten oder dem niedrigeren beizulegendem Wert zum Bilanzstichtag bewertet.\n\nZuschreibungen zu Vermögensgegenständen des Umlaufvermögens werden vorgenommen, wenn die Gründe für die Abschreibung weggefallen sind.\n\n## **2.4. Latente Steuern**\n\nLatente Steuern werden gemäß § 198 Abs 9 und 10 UGB nach dem bilanzorientierten Konzept und ohne Abzinsung auf Basis des Steuersatzes der im Zeitpunkt der Umkehr der befristeten Unterschiede gelten wird gebildet. Die im Geschäftsjahr 2021/22 beschlossene ökosoziale Steuerreform, den Körperschaftsteuersatz ab dem Jahr 2023 etappenweise auf 24 % und ab dem Jahr 2024 auf 23 % zu senken, wird dementsprechend bei der Bewertung der latenten Steuern berücksichtigt.\n\n## **2.5. Rückstellungen**\n\nDie Ermittlung der Rückstellungen für Abfertigungen sowie für Pensionen und pensionsähnlichen Verpflichtungen erfolgt nach versicherungsmathematischen Grundsätzen unter der Anwendung der \"Projected-Unit-Credit\"-Methode gemäß IAS 19. Die Berechnung erfolgt mit einem Rechnungszinssatz von 4,30 % (Abfertigungen) (VJ: 3,60 %) bzw. 4,30 % (Pensionen) (VJ: 3,70 %) sowie unter Berücksichtigung von künftigen jährlichen Gehaltssteigerungen und Erhöhungen von Pensionen von 7,0 % (VJ: 3,50 %) im nächsten Jahr, einer jährlichen Steigerung von 3,5 % für 2025 (VJ: 2,25 %) und einer jährlichen Steigerung von 2,25 % für Folgejahre (VJ: 2,25 %).\n\nDas Pensionsantrittsalter wurde für Männer und Frauen nunmehr einheitlich mit 63 Jahren angesetzt. Für Frauen wurde zusätzlich die Übergangsregelung 60 - 63 Jahre berücksichtigt. (Vorjahr: Männer 65 Jahre, Frauen 60 - 65 Jahre). Hinsichtlich der Sterbewahrscheinlichkeit kommen die Berechnungstafeln (\"AVÖ 2018–P\") zur Anwendung.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nDer Rückstellung für Jubiläumsgeldverpflichtungen liegt eine versicherungsmathematische Berechnung nach IAS 19 zugrunde. Es werden dieselben Parameter wie bei den Berechnungen der Rückstellungen für Pensionsverpflichtungen angewandt.\n\nDer Rechnungszinssatz für alle Sozialkapitalrückstellungen ist ein Stichtagszinssatz basierend auf Renditen von hochwertigen, festverzinslichen Unternehmensanleihen, wobei die Fälligkeiten der zu zahlenden Leistungen entsprechend berücksichtigt werden. Die Zinsen auf die Rückstellungen für Sozialkapital sowie Auswirkungen aus einer Änderung des Zinssatzes werden im Finanzergebnis ausgewiesen.\n\nIn den sonstigen Rückstellungen werden unter Beachtung des Vorsichtsprinzips alle zum Zeitpunkt der Bilanzerstellung erkennbaren Risiken und der Höhe sowie dem Grunde nach ungewissen Verbindlichkeiten mit den Beträgen berücksichtigt, die nach vernünftiger kaufmännischer Beurteilung erforderlich sind.\n\nLangfristige Rückstellungen werden in Abhängigkeit von ihrer erwarteten Laufzeit mit einem Zinssatz von 0,91 % (VJ: 0,43 %) abgezinst.\n\n## **2.6. Verbindlichkeiten**\n\nDie Verbindlichkeiten sind mit dem Erfüllungsbetrag unter Bedachtnahme auf den Grundsatz der Vorsicht angesetzt.\n\n## **2.7. Währungsumrechnung**\n\nDie Währungsumrechnung erfolgt zum Zeitpunkt des Geschäftsvorfalles mit dem aktuellen Kurs. Zum Bilanzstichtag erfolgt bei den Forderungen eine Abwertung, sofern der Stichtagskurs niedriger als der Entstehungskurs ist, bei den Verbindlichkeiten eine Aufwertung sofern der Stichtagskurs höher als der Entstehungskurs ist. In Fremdwährung angeschaffte Gegenstände des Anlage- oder Umlaufvermögens werden mit dem Entstehungskurs erfasst, wobei keine weitere Umwertung erfolgt.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3.

Bei diesen Transaktionen hat sich die EVN AG verpflichtet, in bestimmten Verzugs- und Verlustfällen an die Österreichische Elektrizitätswirtschafts-Aktiengesellschaft (Verbund AG) Kostenersatz zu leisten.\n\nFür die im Auftrag der EVN AG getätigten Geschäfte der ENERGIEALLIANZ Austria GmbH für den Eigenhandel sowie die Beschaffung von Elektrizität und Gas wurden gegenüber den Handelspartnern Patronatserklärungen erteilt. Die Eventualverbindlichkeiten hierfür werden in Höhe des tatsächlichen Risikos für die EVN AG angesetzt. Dieses Risiko bemisst sich an Veränderungen zwischen vereinbartem Preis und aktuellem Marktpreis, wobei sich bei Beschaffungsgeschäften ein Risiko nur bei gesunkenen Marktpreisen und bei Absatzgeschäften ein Risiko nur bei gestiegenen Marktpreisen ergibt.\n\nDementsprechend kann sich das Risiko aufgrund von Marktpreisänderungen nach dem Stichtag entsprechend verändern. Aus dieser Risikobewertung resultierte per 30. September 2023 eine Eventualverbindlichkeit in Höhe von EUR 204.946.727,06 (VJ: TEUR 19.765). Das dieser Bewertung zugrundeliegende Nominalvolumen der Garantien betrug EUR 496.600.253,99. Zum 31. Oktober 2023 betrug das Risiko betreffend Marktpreisänderungen EUR 159.343.258,85 bei einem zugrundeliegenden Nominalvolumen von EUR 502.834.861,40.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3.2.6. Art, Zweck und finanzielle Auswirkungen sonstiger nicht in der Bilanz ausgewiesener oder angegebener Geschäfte**\n\nDie Gesellschaft hat im Geschäftsjahr folgende wesentliche Verträge mit Wirkung für die Folgeperioden abgeschlossen:\n\n- 1. Kontrahierung von Gasspeichernutzungsmöglichkeiten im Umfang von bis zu 643 MW Ausspeicherleistung für den Zeitraum 01.04.2023 bis 31.03.2027. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 3 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 2. Abschluss von Großhandelskontrakten Strom mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 mit einer Netto-Verkaufsmenge von 666.636 MWh. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 117 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 3. Abschluss von Großhandelskontrakten Erdgas mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 mit einer Netto-Verkaufsmenge von 1.071.648 MWh. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 293 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 4. Abschluss von Bezugsverträgen über den Bezug von Energie aus Erneuerbaren Energieträgern mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 im Umfang von 23.629 MWh. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 2 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 5. Abschluss von Bezugs- und Lieferverträgen über den Bezug von elektrischer Energie in Verbindung mit Herkunftsnachweisen mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 im Umfang 584.346 MWh.\n- 6. Abschluss eines Netzreservevertrages mit APG über die Vorhaltung von 470 MW Leistung für die Zwecke des Engpassmanagement für den Zeitraum 01.10.2023 bis 30.09.2024.\n\nHinsichtlich der wertmäßigen Auswirkung der derivativen Verträge wird auf den Abschnitt zu den derivativen Finanzinstrumenten verwiesen.\n\n## **3.2.7. Finanzinstrumente**\n\nDie Bilanzierungs- und Bewertungsgrundsätze sind beim jeweiligen Bilanzposten angeführt. Käufe und Verkäufe von Finanzinstrumenten werden zum Settlement-Stichtag gebucht.\n\nLangfristige Veranlagungen dienen dem Aufbau des für das Sozialkapital erforderlichen Deckungsstocks und erfolgen im Rahmen von extern verwalteten Investmentfonds.\n\nDas Kreditrisiko von Forderungen entspricht den in der Bilanz ausgewiesenen, um vorgenommene Wertberichtigungen reduzierten Wertansätzen.\n\nAlle Finanzinstrumente werden sofort nach Abschluss in einem Treasury- und Risikomanagementsystem erfasst. Dies ermöglicht einen tagesaktuellen Überblick über alle wesentlichen Risikokennzahlen. Für das Risiko-Controlling wurde zudem ein eigenes Team im Finanzwesen mit Stabstellecharakter eingerichtet, das laufend Risikoanalysen, u.a. basierend auf der Value-at-Risk-Methode erstellt.\n\nDerivative Finanzinstrumente dienen in erster Linie der Absicherung des Unternehmens gegen Marktpreisänderungsrisiken (insbesondere Wechselkurs- und Zinsänderungsrisiken) sowie zur Bereitstellung der benötigten liquiden Mittel in der erforderlichen Währung. Ziel des Marktrisikomanagements ist es, wirtschaftliche Effekte, die sich aus Marktpreisschwankungen ergeben, zu minimieren. Das aktive Marktrisikomanagement führt zu einer verbesserten Planbarkeit in Bezug auf Ergebnisgrößen, erwartete Zahlungsströme und Bilanzpositionen.\n\nDie Nominalwerte sind die saldierten Summen der zu den jeweiligen Finanzderivaten gehörenden Einzelpositionen zum Bilanzstichtag. Sie entsprechen zwar den zwischen den Vertragspartnern vereinbarten Beträgen, sind jedoch kein Maßstab für das Risiko des Unternehmens aus dem Einsatz dieser Finanzinstrumente. Das Risikopotenzial umfasst insbesondere Schwankungen der zugrunde liegenden Marktparameter. Die Bewertung der Finan-\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nzinstrumente erfolgt mittels marktgängiger, stichtagsbezogener Wechselkurse sowie Zinsstrukturkurven. Das Kreditrisiko der Vertragspartner findet dabei Berücksichtigung.\n\nFür derivative Finanzinstrumente werden die Nominalwerte sowie die aktuellen Marktwerte (Fair Values) angegeben.\n\nDie derivativen Finanzinstrumente setzen sich zum Bilanzstichtag wie folgt zusammen und sind in den folgenden Bilanzpositionen erfasst:\n\n| Derivative Finanzinstrumente mit Sicherungsbeziehung |                        |            |                      |            |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|----------------------|------------|\n|                                                      | Nominalwert in Mio JPY |            | Marktwert in Mio EUR |            |\n|                                                      | 30.09.2023             | 30.09.2022 | 30.09.2023           | 30.09.2022 |\n| Währungsswaps                                        |                        |            |                      |            |\n| JPY (unter 1 Jahr)                                   | 10.000,0               | 10.000,0   | -19,4                | -11,2      |\n\nDie in obiger Tabelle ausgewiesenen Währungsswaps sind Cross-Currency Swaps zur Absicherung der Zins- und Währungsrisiken der in fremder Währung begebenen Anleihe (JPY-Anleihe). Die Laufzeit der Währungsswaps ist ident mit der Laufzeit der Anleihe bis 2024.\n\nDie Effektivität der Sicherungsbeziehung der Cross-Currency Swaps wird zumindest quartalsweise geprüft. Prospektiv wird die Critical-Terms-Match-Methode angewandt. Retrospektiv erfolgt diese Prüfung mittels Dollar-Offset-Methode (ergänzt um eine Regressionsanalyse), wobei die verschiedenen gesicherten Risiken (Zins- und Währungsrisiken) mit Hilfe von hypothetischen Derivaten einzeln gemessen werden. Per 30.09.2023 beträgt die auf das Zinsrisiko bezogene Effektivität aufgrund der kurzen Restlaufzeit lediglich 52 %. Mittels Regressionsanalyse, die ein Bestimmtheitsmaß von 0,99992 ergibt, wird jedoch die Effektivität nachgewiesen. Die auf das Währungsrisiko bezogene Effektivität beläuft sich auf 97 %.\n\nEine dokumentierte Widmung der Verträge wurde vollzogen, indem das abzusichernde Risiko identifiziert, der Beginn der Sicherungsbeziehung festgelegt und das Vorliegen aller materiellen Voraussetzungen nachvollziehbar begründet wurde. In materieller Hinsicht gilt hier dazu, dass die Sicherungsgeschäfte die qualitative Eignung des abgesicherten Grundgeschäfts besitzen, ein Absicherungsbedarf auf Basis des Preisänderungsrisikos aus dem Grundgeschäft vorliegt, eine bestehende Absicherungsstrategie existiert und die Derivate qualitativ geeignet als Sicherungsinstrument sind.\n\nFür derivative Instrumente mit negativem Marktwert wird keine Drohverlustrückstellung gebildet, sofern eine Sicherungsbeziehung mit den jeweils zugrundeliegenden Geschäften besteht.\n\n## **Energiebereich:**\n\nDie nachfolgende Tabelle zeigt die saldierten Werte der derivativen Finanzinstrumente ausgenommen Geschäfte, die im Portfolioansatz (siehe unten) enthalten sind.

Against this backdrop, the EU is continuing the implementation of various legal regulations to create a binding framework for the attainment of these ambitious goals.\n\nIn March 2023, the member states agreed on the basics of a package for the hydrogen market and the decarbonisation of the gas market. It is designed to establish the framework conditions for the gradual transition from fossil natural gas to renewable gases by creating a competitive market together with the necessary infrastructure. Other key content covers the regulation of the future hydrogen networks and the improvement of planning and investment security for networks and storage.\n\nThe new EU directive to reform emission trading took effect in May 2023 and was expanded to also cover the transport and building sector beginning in 2027. The income from these new emission trading areas is designated to flow into a climate and social fund.\n\nThe EU Parliament and the Council agreed in autumn 2023 on an amendment to the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) which sets significantly more ambitious goals for the share of renewable energies in heating and cooling supplies as well as the building, industry and transport sectors. For the industry sector, the new goals mean a more rapid conversion to renewable hydrogen. The directive also requires shorter planning and approval periods for projects involving the expansion of plants that generate renewable energies, networks and energy storage.\n\nThe energy crisis triggered by the Ukraine war led to efforts by the EU Commission in 2023 to prepare and issue a draft for a new electricity market design. A key objective of these reform efforts is to contain the negative effects of extreme price fluctuations on the EU market and, in the end, reduce the impact on consumers. One of the most important measures gives governments an option to assume the market price risks associated with investments in plants that generate electricity from renewable and non-fossil sources. This will provide power plant operators with greater investment security and customers with relief in the event of rising market prices. The basis will be formed by the conclusion of so-called energy sector contracts for difference between electricity producers and the EU member states. The EU\n\naims to approve this legislative package on the electricity market design before the upcoming EU elections in 2024.\n\n#### **Austria**\n\nThe Renewable Energy Expansion Act, which was enacted in Austria during July 2021, includes concrete expansion targets. It requires an increase of 27 TWh per year in renewable electricity generation by 2030, with 11 TWh coming from photovoltaics, 10 TWh from wind power, 5 TWh from hydropower and 1 TWh from biomass.\n\nThe most relevant points of the Renewable Energy Expansion Act for EVN's business activities include the subsidy mechanisms for the construction of new renewable plants as well as investment subsidies for electrolysis equipment to convert electricity into hydrogen or synthetic gas. Investment security will also be created for existing and future renewable gas generating plants, and an increase of 5 TWh per year in nationally produced renewable gas as a share of Austria's total natural gas volumes is planned by 2030. Other relevant content includes the framework conditions for citizens' and renewable energy communities.\n\nAn amendment to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act was passed in March 2023. It facilitates proceedings and introduces measures to accelerate the approval of projects that contribute to the energy transformation.\n\nAn amendment to the Federal Energy Efficiency Act in June 2023 finalised the overdue enactment of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive in Austria.\n\nIn October 2023, the federal government agreed on the contents of a new Renewable Heat Act which, in particular, prohibits the installation of fossil fuel-based heating equipment in new household buildings. The Austrian Parliament also approved higher standards for gas storage as part of a legal amendment during that same month. It requires gas suppliers to guarantee supply security at a level of 45 days in the future (instead of the previous 30 days). A storage standard was also introduced for gas-fired power plants (including combined heat and power plants), and the strategic gas reserve was extended to 2026.\n\nThe Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology is currently working on the Electricity Industry Act to replace the current Electricity Industry and Organisation Act and to implement the EU's Directive on common rules for the internal market for electricity and the Renewable Energy Directive. The Electricity Industry Act is expected to provide, among others, clear rules for energy communities (e.g. concerning\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe operation of storage) as well as new rules for network operators (e. g. concerning the simplified use of smart meter data for planning network flexibilities). The new law is also expected to include additional consumer protection rules.\n\n#### **Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity**\n\nTo implement an EU regulation on emergency intervention measures that was issued in autumn 2022, Austria passed the Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity for the period from 1 December 2022 to 31 December 2023. The primary goal of the EU regulation and the related national laws was to present a temporary answer to the massive distortions on the international energy markets and the resulting effect on the European society and economy. Specifically, the member states were permitted to collect a solidarity levy based on the increased market revenue from electricity generation and from the crude oil, coal and refinery sectors. The income was to be used to provide financial relief from the high energy prices for end customers like households and smaller and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe Austrian Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity calls for a levy equal to 90% of the surplus revenue from electricity generation. The threshold for the calculation of surplus proceeds equalled EUR 140 per MWh from 1 December 2022 to 31 May 2023 but increased up to EUR 176 per MWh based on the inclusion of allowable investments in renewable energies and energy efficiency measures. The threshold was reduced to EUR 120 per MWh, respectively to EUR 156 per MWh as of 1 June 2023 based on the decline in the wholesale prices for electricity.\n\n#### **Regulatory environment Austria**\n\nThe operation of the distribution networks and network infrastructure for electricity and natural gas in Lower Austria is the responsibility of EVN's group company Netz Niederösterreich. All investments and expenditures by this company to ensure the continuous operations of the network infrastructure are remunerated through network tariffs which are set by the E-Control Commission each year in accordance with the Austrian regulatory method.\n\nKey parameters for the determination of the network tariffs include the interest-bearing capital base (regulatory asset base) of the network operator and the weighted average cost of capital. Also included is an incentive in the form of productivity factors, which serve as cost reduction targets for the respective company and also include inflationary adjustments. E-Control\n\nsets the weighted average cost of capital and cost reduction targets for an entire regulatory period, which equals five years in Austria.\n\nThe regulatory authority reduced the weighted average cost of capital with the start of the new regulatory periods for the electricity distribution network on 1 January 2019 and for the natural gas distribution network on 1 January 2023, respectively, to reflect the generally lower interest rate levels. However, a differentiation was made for the first time between the efficiency of the various network operators and between existing and new equipment in order to create incentives for further investments and efficiency improvements. This benefits network operators with higher productivity in industry comparison as well as with the slightly higher interest rates on the capital required for new investments. EVN's network company has received a very positive evaluation from the regulatory authority for its productivity in peer-group benchmarking. A new regulatory period for the electricity distribution network will start on 1 January 2024.\n\n#### **Bulgaria**\n\nThe delivery of electricity to industrial and commercial customers in Bulgaria has been liberalised. EVN Trading SEE serves as a supplier in this market segment. Household customers remain in the regulated market and are supplied by EVN Bulgaria EC, which also acts as a \"supplier of last resort\" for customers who do not select another supplier or cannot receive electricity from their chosen supplier through no fault of their own. In view of the current energy policy debate in Bulgaria, it can be assumed that the transfer of household customers to the liberalised market will be postponed at least to the end of 2026. Energy sales to customers in the regulated market segments and the procurement of the corresponding volumes are based on regulated prices.\n\nThe Bulgarian regulatory authority set new energy tariffs for the regulated market segments as of 1 July 2023. The electricity prices for household customers in EVN's supply area were increased by 3.8% on average (previous year: average increase of 3.6% as of 1 July 2022).\n\nThe new three-year regulation period for the electricity network in Bulgaria began on 1 July 2021. The regulatory method defines a revenue cap which covers recognised operating expenses, amortisation and depreciation as well as an adequate return on the regulatory asset base. The applied method also includes the projected network distribution volumes as well as an annually defined investment factor for planned future investments. EP Yug is responsible for the operation of the electricity distribution networks in EVN's Bulgarian supply area. Due to the decline in electricity prices dur\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\ning the 2022/23 financial year, this company did not receive any further government compensation payments to cover network losses (in the previous year, expenses were reduced by these compensation payments).\n\n#### **North Macedonia**\n\nIn order to achieve the legally required unbundling of the individual fields in the energy business and meet the related requirements, EVN operates through various companies in North Macedonia. Network operations in the regulated market segment are the responsibility of Elektrodistribucija DOOEL, while customers in the liberalised market segment receive deliveries from the supply company EVN Macedonia Elektrosnabduvanje DOOEL. EVN Macedonia Elektrani DOOEL serves as a production company. Since 1 July 2019, EVN Home DOO has supplied electricity to all households and small businesses in the regulated market segments based on a license as the \"supplier of universal service\". This license has an initial term of five years and will be reallocated in the first half of 2024. EVN Home DOO also serves as a \"supplier of last resort\" for customers who do not select another supplier or cannot receive electricity from their chosen supplier through no fault of their own.\n\nThe regulated electricity prices for the household customers supplied by EVN Home DOO are currently classified in four consumption-based categories. As of 1 January 2023, the prices for all four categories were raised by 8.7% to 14.4% (1 July 2022: increase of roughly 21.8%) and the regulated electricity procurement price for EVN Home DOO was set at EUR 56.0 per MWh (previous year: EUR 48.0 per MWh). The VAT on energy – which was temporarily reduced to 5% as of 1 July 2021 as relief for household customers – was increased to 10% in a first step. These tarif increases were, however, mitigated for household customers by a reduction of 19.8% in the network tariffs.\n\nThe VAT on energy was raised to the pre-crisis level of 18% as of 1 July 2023. In return, the regulator reduced the electricity prices for household customers of EVN Home DOO slightly and the regulated electricity procurement price for EVN Home DOO was cut to EUR 53.0 per MWh.\n\nA new three-year regulation period for the North Macedonian electricity network began on 1 July 2021 and brought an improvement in the recognition of operating expenses. Similar to the framework in Bulgaria, the regulatory method for the electricity network in North Macedonia defines a revenue cap which covers recognised operating expenses, amortisation and depreciation as well as an adequate return on the regulatory asset base.\n\n#### **Croatia**\n\nThe liberalisation of the Croatian natural gas market for household customers was nearly complete in 2022. The market for commercial and industrial customers has been liberalised since 2012 and is characterised by increasing competition among the natural gas suppliers active in the country. The new LNG terminal near the island of Krk was commissioned on 1 January 2021 and has further diversified natural gas supplies in Croatia. The substantial fluctuation in natural gas prices during the reporting period and the resulting changes in the suppliers' offering structure have led to expectations of continued consolidation on the Croatian natural gas market.\n\n## General business environment\n\nThe global economy lost substantial momentum in 2022, and this trend has continued into 2023. The energy crisis and the related, in part dramatic increase in the market prices for electricity and natural gas in the previous year have had a stronger impact on Europe than on the USA, where the economy remains robust despite monetary policy tightening. Growth in the eurozone equalled a moderate 3.3% in 2022. Economists currently expect a short timespan for the recession that has taken hold of several countries as well as a general improvement in the economy during the coming year. These assumptions are based on a substantial reduction in energy prices below the previous highs as well as weakening inflation and the related increase in real income, and an improvement in the global economic environment. GDP growth in the eurozone is projected to range from 0.4% to 0.7% in 2023 and from 1.2% to 1.3% in 2024.\n\nThe Austrian economy is currently unable to disengage from the international economic downturn and has fallen into a recession. Forecasts now point to a decline of 0.8% in 2023 after the 4.8% increase in 2022. The underlying factors include the negative effects of above-average inflation, restrictive monetary policies and the weak global economy. Added factors are the generally lower demand following the corona-related catch-up effects and weaker economic growth, especially in the neighbouring countries. The industrial sector is confronted with a decline in orders and high cost pressure. The coming year is, however, expected to see a recovery in the global economy and an increase in private consumption as the result of rising real incomes. The GDP in Austria is expected to increase by 0.8% to 1.2%.\n\nThe economic slowdown in Bulgaria became increasingly clear during the course of the year, and the industrial sector is now in a \n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecession. Exports declined, above all, due to weakening demand from Western Europe. A new government was formed in May and is supported by both major political parties. Bulgaria's accession to the eurozone has been delayed and will not take place as originally scheduled on 1 January 2024. Economic recovery is not expected before 2024. After a plus of 3.4% in 2022, GDP growth is forecasted to range from 1.5% to 2.0% in 2023 and from 1.8% to 3.2% in 2024.\n\nCroatia's accession to the eurozone and border-free Schengen area served as a significant source of momentum for tourism in 2023. The full integration of the country in the EU will help to improve trade and investments over the long term, as was demonstrated in 2022: EU subsidies supported investment activity in the country at that time, and this trend has continued in 2023. Economic growth is currently driven by private household consumption, the largest component of GDP. However, high inflation is pressuring real incomes, export activity and the willingness to invest. The GDP increase of 6.2% in 2022 is expected to be followed by a plus of 1.9% to 2.7% in 2023 and 2.5% to 3.1% in 2024.\n\nEconomic growth in North Macedonia slowed as expected during the second quarter of 2023, chiefly due to high inflation, the restrictive monetary policy of the North Macedonian central bank and limited foreign direct investment. Inflation has remained very high as a result of corporate profits, and the government recently even introduced price controls for food. Economic growth was moderate at 2.1% in 2022, and forecasts show an increase of 2.0% to 2.5% in 2023 and 2.7% to 3.2% in 2024.\n\n## Energy sector environment\n\nEVN's energy business is significantly influenced by external factors. The weather has a strong influence on the demand for electricity, natural gas and heat by household customers, while the general business environment is an important driver for industrial customers' energy requirements. Since the start of the Ukraine war and the related energy crisis, the energy saving steps taken by many customers in reaction to the rising energy prices have played an important role. Market prices and, as a result, EVN's procurement costs are also a function of the geopolitical climate. The relevant factors for energy generation include wind and water flows as well as solar radiation.\n\nThe weather in EVN's three core markets during the 2022/23 financial year was characterised by milder temperatures. The heating degree total – which defines the temperature-related demand for energy – in Austria was slightly lower and in Bulgaria and North Macedonia substantially lower than the long-term average. In Bulgaria, it reached only 77.7% of the median value. In contrast, the heating degree totals in the previous year were substantially above the long-term average in all three countries. The cooling degree total, which measures the temperature-related demand for cooling energy, rose substantially year-on-year in all three core markets during 2022/23. In Austria it was slightly above, and in Bulgaria and North Macedonia clearly above the long-term average.\n\nThe massive fluctuations and distortions in the previous financial year were followed by a decline in primary energy and energy\n\n| GDP growth           | % | 2024f      | 2023e       | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|----------------------|---|------------|-------------|------|------|------|\n| EU-281) 2)5)         |   | 1.2 to 1.3 | 0.4 to 0.7  | 3.3  | 5.6  | -6.1 |\n| Austria1) 2) 3) 5)   |   | 0.8 to 1.2 | -0.8 to 0.1 | 4.8  | 4.6  | -6.6 |\n| Bulgaria1)2)4)       |   | 1.8 to 3.2 | 1.5 to 2.0  | 3.4  | 7.6  | -4.0 |\n| Croatia1)2)5)        |   | 2.5 to 3.1 | 1.9 to 2.7  | 6.2  | 13.1 | -8.5 |\n| North Macedonia4) 5) |   | 2.7 to 3.2 | 2.0 to 2.5  | 2.1  | 3.9  | -4.7 |\n\n1) Source: \"European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2023\", EU-Commission, November 2023\n\n2) Source: \"Herbst-Prognose der österreichischen Wirtschaft 2023–2024\", IHS, October 2023\n\n3) Source: \"Prognose für 2023 und 2024: Kaufkraft steigt nach milder Rezession\", WIFO, October 2023\n\n4) Source: \"Global Economic Prospects\", World Bank, June 2023\n\n5) Source: \"World Economic Outlook\", International Monetary Fund, October 2023\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nprices during 2022/23, especially during the summer months. The average EEX price for natural gas dropped by half from EUR 123.1 per MWh to approximately EUR 56.4 per MWh. However, a contrasting trend appeared towards the end of the reporting year – with the exception of CO₂ emission certificate prices. Their price was subject to less fluctuation, but rose by 8% on average over the prior year value of EUR 78.0 per tonne to EUR 84.2 per tonne in 2022/23.\n\nThis development also had an impact on the market prices for electricity, which declined significantly during the reporting year but remained high. The spot market prices for base load and peak load electricity averaged EUR 134.4 per MWh and EUR 154.8 per MWh, respectively (previous year: EUR 258.7 per MWh and EUR 296.3 per MWh).\n\n## Business development\n\nThe scope of consolidation and changes in comparison with the previous year are explained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Effects from initial consolidations and deconsolidations are of minor significance for the development of the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nSee page 33ff\n\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements also include an analysis of the potential effects of climate change, the war in Ukraine and the macroeconomic environment on the recoverability of assets in accordance with IAS 36 and IFRS 9 and explain further uncertainty in discretionary assessments.\n\nSee page 33ff\n\n| Energy sector environment –<br>indicators    |         | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Heating-related energy demand1)              | %       |         |         |\n| Austria                                      |         | 98.7    | 105.8   |\n| Bulgaria                                     |         | 77.7    | 111.8   |\n| North Macedonia                              |         | 86.1    | 106.2   |\n| Cooling-related energy demand1)              | %       |         |         |\n| Austria                                      |         | 101.2   | 86.4    |\n| Bulgaria                                     |         | 120.2   | 86.5    |\n| North Macedonia                              |         | 131.0   | 123.0   |\n| Primary energy and CO2 emission certificates |         |         |         |\n| Crude oil – Brent                            | EUR/bbl | 78.8    | 89.5    |\n| Natural gas – NCG2)                          | EUR/MWh | 56.4    | 123.1   |\n| Hard coal – API#23)                          | EUR/t   | 150.4   | 258.8   |\n| CO2 emission certificates                    | EUR/t   | 84.2    | 78.0    |\n| Electricity – EPEX spot market4)             |         |         |         |\n| Base load                                    | EUR/MWh | 134.4   | 258.7   |\n| Peak load                                    | EUR/MWh | 154.8   | 296.3   |\n\n1) Calculated based on the heating degree total respectively cooling degree total; the basis (100%) corresponds to the adjusted long-term average for the respective countries.\n\n2) Net Connect Germany (NCG) – EEX (European Energy Exchange) stock exchange price for natural gas\n\n3) ARA notation (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp)\n\n4) EPEX spot – European Power Exchange\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Statement of operations**\n\n#### **Highlights 2022/23**\n\n- Earnings improvement in South East Europe; includes, in part, positive anticipatory and subsequently recognised effects\n- Previous year negatively influenced by impairment losses totalling EUR 114.8m\n- Equity accounted energy supply company EVN KG as forecasted – with substantial loss of EUR 240.3m (pre-tax) for the period\n- Group net result influenced by significantly higher dividend of EUR 158.0m from Verbund AG for the 2022 financial year (previous year. EUR 46.1m)\n\n#### **Results of operations**\n\nRevenue recorded by the EVN Group declined by 7.2% year-onyear to EUR 3,768.7m in 2022/23. This development resulted primarily from a decline in revenue in South East Europe which, in turn, was caused by lower network and energy sales volumes and by the downward trend in wholesale prices. In the international project business, the largely completed wastewater treatment plant in Kuwait led to lower revenue. This decline was moderated by price and volume effects from renewable electricity generation, positive valuation effects from hedges, higher revenue from natural gas trading, increased selling prices at EVN Wärme and higher network tariffs.\n\nThe revenue generated by EVN outside Austria amounted to EUR 1,991.2m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 2,578.6m). This represents a decrease in the share of Group revenue from 63.5% in the previous year to 52.8% in 2022/23.\n\nOther operating income rose by 16.4% to EUR 127.5m.\n\nDeclining wholesale prices in South East Europe led to a reduction of 26.5% in the cost of electricity purchases from third parties and primary energy expenses to EUR 1,675.5m in 2022/23. These costs include positive upfront effects from the procurement of energy to cover network losses, which will be offset in the following year in accordance with the regulation methodology. Contrasting factors included, in particular, higher costs for network losses and upstream network costs at Netz Niederösterreich as well as increased energy procurement costs of EVN Wärme. Higher electricity production volumes in the Verbund Innkraftwerke also increased the cost of electricity purchases from third parties.\n\nThe cost of materials and services declined by 6.3% to EUR 662.7m in line with the development of revenue in the international project business and offset inflation-based increases in the other Group companies.\n\nPersonnel expenses were 12.6% higher year-on-year at EUR 419.2m due to adjustments required by collective bargaining agreements. The EVN Group had an average workforce of 7,255 in 2022/23 (previous year: 7,135 employees).\n\nOther operating expenses rose by 27.7% to EUR 202.2m. This amount includes a levy of EUR 25.1m on the surplus revenue from electricity production which is based on the Federal Act on the Energy Crisis Contribution for Electricity which was implemented in Austria during December 2022 (details on the underlying legal regulation are provided on page 3f in the section \"Energy policy environment\").\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees amounted to EUR –67.6m (previous year: EUR 98.9m). This decline – which was already reported in the first quarter of the financial year and forecasted for the entire year – is attributable to the energy supply company EVN KG, where the development of earnings was significantly impaired by several factors. They included higher procurement costs for energy that can only be passed on to customers with a delay, the lower valuation of hedges as of 30 September 2023 and additions to provisions for impending losses from contractual supply obligations. EVN KG reported a loss of EUR 240.3m for the reporting year. In contrast, higher earnings contributions were received from RAG (EUR +27.4m), the Verbund Innkraftwerke (EUR +20.7m) and Burgenland Energie (EUR +16.6m). A further positive effect was a revaluation to the Ashta hydropower plant (EUR 11.1m).\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on these developments, EBITDA recorded by the EVN Group rose by 15.1% year-on-year to EUR 869.0m in 2022/23.\n\nScheduled depreciation and amortisation rose by 5.8% to EUR 336.5m based on investments. A year-on-year comparison of the effects of impairment testing is influenced, above all, by the absence of impairment losses totalling EUR 114.8m from 2021/22 (which involved the international project business, Netz Niederösterreich's natural gas network, district heating equipment in Lower Austria and the Bulgarian district heating company TEZ Plovidv). Impairment losses in 2022/23 amounted to EUR 7.1m and were related chiefly to district heating equipment in Lower Austria (EUR 5.7m). Revaluations of EUR 3.2m were recorded to plants operated by EVN Wärme and EVN Wasser (previous year: revaluations of EUR 9.6m to the Kavarna wind park).\n\nThese developments led to an increase in EBIT to EUR 528.5m (previous year: EUR 331.6m).\n\nFinancial results improved to EUR 127.6m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR –30.5m) and were influenced, above all, by an increase in the dividend from Verbund AG to EUR 3.60 per share for the 2022 financial year (previous year: EUR 1.05 per share). In total, the earnings contribution from the Verbund investment equalled EUR 158.0m in 2022/23. Financial results were also supported by the better performance of the R138 fund and EVN's cash fund despite the increase in interest expense. In the previous year, financial results were negatively influenced by foreign exchange effects and the value adjustment to a loan extended to an equity accounted company in the international project business.\n\nThe result before income tax totalled EUR 656.2m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 301.2m). After the deduction of income tax expense – which increased to EUR 74.0m (previous year: EUR 64.0m) – and the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, Group net result for the 2022/23 financial year equalled EUR 529.7m (previous year: EUR 209.6m).\n\nImage /page/8/Figure/6 description: This image is a bar chart titled \"Revenue by region\" in EURm.

For external revenue, the values for 2021/22 and 2022/23 are as follows: Energy: 750.6 and 1,015.9; Generation: 159.5 and 132.8; Networks: 517.3 and 564.5; South East Europe: 2,002.4 and 1,499.7; Environment: 611.8 and 531.4; All Other Segments: 20.6 and 24.5. For EBIT, the values for 2021/22 and 2022/23 are as follows: Energy: -54.7 and -90.1; Environment: -34.9.\n\n#### **Statement of financial position**\n\n#### **Asset and financial position**\n\nEVN's balance sheet total declined by 11.5% year-on-year to EUR 10,996.0m as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted investees fell sharply due to the valuation of hedges held by EVN KG and EnergieAllianz as well as the loss recorded by EVN KG for the reporting period. In addition, the market price of the Verbund share (EUR 77.05 as of 30 September 2023 versus EUR 87.45 as of 30 September 2022) was responsible for a decline in other investments. A contrasting factor was the increase in property, plant and equipment which resulted from the high level of investments. Non-current assets declined by 12.4% to EUR 9,380.9m.\n\nCurrent assets were 6.0% lower at EUR 1,615.1m in 2022/23, whereby the high level of investments and capital commitment in working capital led to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents. Inventories fell below the level of the previous year which resulted from the rapid rise in wholesale prices for natural gas and the build-up of additional strategic natural gas reserves to protect supply security. In contrast, an increase was recorded in the receivables due from EVN KG from loans granted by the EVN Group, in tax receivables and in the receivables from hedging transactions.\n\n159.5\n\n255.0 260.3\n\n96.0 54.0\n\n48.0\n\n29.5\n\n78.6 58.8\n\nSouth East Europe\n\nNetworks\n\nGeneration\n\n–90.1 –54.7\n\nEnergy\n\nEnvironment\n\n–34.9\n\nAll Other Segments\n\nEquity totalled EUR 6,464.3m as of 30 September 2023 and was 11.7% lower than on 30 September 2022, even though the result after tax for the reporting period exceeded the dividend payment in February 2023 of EUR 0.52 per share for the 2021/22 financial year. This decline was based, above all, on valuation effects recorded directly in equity without recognition to profit or loss, in particular to equity accounted investees and to Verbund AG. These valuation effects are also reflected in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, which reduced equity by a\n\n**EVN Annual Financial Report 2022/23 10**\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Condensed consolidated statement of operations                              | 2022/23<br>EURm | 2021/22<br>EURm | +/–    |       | 2020/21<br>EURm |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|-------|-----------------|\n| Revenue                                                                     | 3,768.7         | 4,062.2         | -293.5 | -7.2  | 2,394.9         |\n| Other operating income                                                      | 127.5           | 109.5           | 18.0   | 16.4  | 250.1           |\n| Electricity purchases and primary energy expenses                           | -1,675.5        | -2,278.2        | 602.7  | 26.5  | -1,064.7        |\n| Cost of materials and services                                              | -662.7          | -707.1          | 44.3   | 6.3   | -509.2          |\n| Personnel expenses                                                          | -419.2          | -372.2          | -47.0  | -12.6 | -361.3          |\n| Other operating expenses                                                    | -202.2          | -158.4          | -43.9  | -27.7 | -113.0          |\n| Share of results from equity accounted<br>investees with operational nature | -67.6           | 98.9            | -166.5 | –     | 239.6           |\n| EBITDA                                                                      | 869.0           | 754.8           | 114.2  | 15.1  | 836.5           |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                               | -336.5          | -318.0          | -18.5  | -5.8  | -337.7          |\n| Effects from impairment tests                                               | -3.9            | -105.2          | 101.3  | 96.3  | -112.4          |\n| Results from operating activities (EBIT)                                    | 528.5           | 331.6           | 196.9  | 59.4  | 386.4           |\n| Financial results                                                           | 127.6           | -30.5           | 158.1  | –     | -20.0           |\n| Result before income tax                                                    | 656.2           | 301.2           | 355.0  | –     | 366.4           |\n| Income tax                                                                  | -74.0           | -64.0           | -10.0  | -15.6 | -14.7           |\n| Result for the period                                                       | 582.1           | 237.1           | 345.0  | –     | 351.7           |\n| thereof result attributable to EVN AG shareholders (Group net result)       | 529.7           | 209.6           | 320.1  | –     | 325.3           |\n| thereof result attributable to non-controlling interests                    | 52.4            | 27.5            | -24.9  | 90.5  | 26.4            |\n| Earnings per share in EUR1)                                                 | 2.97            | 1.18            | 1.8    | –     | 1.83            |\n\n1) There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\ntotal of EUR –737.1m in the reporting period (previous year: increased by EUR 895.4m). The equity ratio equalled 58.8% as of 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: 58.9%).\n\nNon-current liabilities declined by 10.4% to EUR 3,029.4m, chiefly due to the reduction in long-term tax liabilities which followed the lower valuation of equity accounted investees and the investment in Verbund AG. The development of non-current financial liabilities reflected the arrangement of four long-term bank loans at a total of EUR 255m, which was contrasted by the reclassification of bank loans (in total, EUR 200m) and the JPY bond (EUR 77.8m) to current financial liabilities. The new loans include a \"green loan\"with the European Investment Bank (EUR 110m), which has already been drawn down by an initial tranche of EUR 105m.\n\nCurrent liabilities fell by 13.0% to EUR 1,502.2m. The main factors for this development included a lower balance of liabilities from derivative transactions and from the procurement of strategic gas reserves, both of which are recorded under other current liabilities. A decline was also recorded in investments by EVN KG in the EVN Group, which are recorded under other current liabilities.\n\n#### **Value analysis**\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after tax – including EVN's specific company and country risks – was set at 5.0% for the purpose of corporate management. The operating return on capital employed (OpROCE) equalled 7.7% for the reporting year (previous year: 5.5%). The economic value added (EVA®) generated in 2022/23 totalled EUR 159.4m (previous year: EUR 29.3m).\n\n#### **Liquidity position**\n\nEVN's net debt including non-current employee-related provisions as of 30 September 2023 amounted to EUR 1,364.3m (previous year: EUR 1,245.1m). The gearing ratio increased from 17.0% to 21.1%.\n\nIn order to safeguard its financial flexibility, the EVN Group holds a syndicated credit line of EUR 400.0m as well as contractually agreed bilateral credit commitments of EUR 286.0m. These bilateral commitments were not drawn as of 30 September 2023 and were therefore available in full. The term of the syndicated credit line which serves as a strategic liquidity reserve will end in May 2025. The remaining terms of the bilateral credit lines concluded with 13 banks range up to two years.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Statement of cash flows**\n\nGross cash flow rose by 49.9% year-on-year to EUR 1,100.7m in 2022/23, chiefly due to the increase in EVN's result before tax. The development of the non-cash earnings components was characterised by the correction of the negative result from the equity accounted EVN KG. The increase was reduced by a reduction in the dividend payments from equity accounted investees and a year-on-year decline in impairment losses and the noncash earnings components in financial results.\n\nCash flow from operating activities totalled EUR 942.4m and was negatively affected by working capital developments and by an increase in income tax payments over 2021/22 but still exceeded the prior year value of EUR 151.0m. Working capital was reduced, in part by the liquidity settlement with EVN KG which followed the capital increases. Other positive effects resulted from the lower capital commitment in the international project\n\n## **Balance sheet structure** % Equity Non-current liabilities Current liabilities Current assets

However, working capital was increased by higher receivables from taxes and from hedges.\n\nCash flow from investing activities totalled EUR –929.0m (previous year: EUR –336.7m) and was influenced mainly by the significant increase in investments and by capital contributions to EVN KG.

EVN AG also had contractually agreed, undrawn credit lines of EUR 686m at its disposal at the end of the reporting year to service potential short-term financing requirements.\n\n|  | Capital structure indicators                             | 30.09.2023<br>EURm | 30.09.2022<br>EURm | +/–<br>Nominal | +/–<br>% | 30.09.2021<br>EURm |\n|--|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------|--------------------|\n|  | Non-current loans and borrowings and leasing liabilities | 1,174.8            | 1,206.1            | -31.4          | -2.6     | 773.9              |\n|  | Current loans and borrowings1)                           | 302.0              | 128.8              | 173.2          | –        | 323.4              |\n|  | Cash and cash equivalents                                | -20.2              | -36.9              | 16.7           | 45.3     | -122.3             |\n|  | Non-current and current securities                       | -337.5             | -285.6             | -51.9          | -18.2    | -473.5             |\n|  | Non-current and current loans receivable                 | -29.5              | -29.4              | -0.1           | -0.3     | -39.6              |\n|  | Financial net debt                                       | 1,089.7            | 983.1              | 106.6          | 10.8     | 461.9              |\n|  | Net debt                                                 | 1,364.3            | 1,245.1            | 119.3          | 9.6      | 813.8              |\n|  | Equity                                                   | 6,464.3            | 7,321.1            | -856.8         | -11.7    | 6,544.3            |\n|  | Gearing (%)2)                                            | 21.1               | 17.0               | 4.1            | 4.1      | 12.4               |\n\n1) Excluding bank overdrafts contained in cash and cash equivalents\n\n2) Changes reported in percentage points\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nCapital expenditure was substantially higher than the previous year at EUR 694.1m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 564.0m). This increase was based on the Strategy 2030 which sets the focal points for EVN's investments in network infrastructure, renewable generation, natural heat and drinking water.\n\nInvestments in the Energy Segment included the completion of the new biomass combined heat and power plant in Krems and, above all, equipment and network expansion measures in the heating business. In the energy services business, investments in e-charging stations also increased.\n\nIn the Generation Segment, investments focused on the expansion of renewable generation and included wind power projects as well as large-scale photovoltaic equipment in Lower Austria.\n\nInvestments in the Lower Austrian network infrastructure continue to increase.

The focus here is on the expansion of cross-regional supply pipelines.\n\n#### **Structure of investments**\n\n%, total in EURm\n\nImage /page/14/Figure/8 description: This image shows a bar graph comparing data from 2020/21, 2021/22, and 2022/23. In 2020/21, the total is 415.0, with segments of 0.0, 4.9, 24.2, 4.9, 60.0, and 6.0. In 2021/22, the total is 564.0, with segments of 0.4, 3.5, 19.5, 7.4, 59.3, and 9.9.

Projects are directed primarily to safeguarding supply security, protecting the environment and resources, and strengthening the company's competitive position. The overriding criterion for all projects is to provide a concrete benefit for customers.\n\nIn 2022/23 EVN spent approximately EUR 4.0m (previous year: approximately EUR 2.6m) on innovation, research and development projects. Public subsidies were received for these projects and represent a subsidy quota of 2.8%.\n\nAn important focal point for EVN's innovation activities during the reporting year was formed by storage solutions that will allow surplus renewable production to be used in periods with lower energy generation from renewable sources. This challenge must be solved, particularly from a seasonal viewpoint, to design a CO₂-free energy system. Electricity generation from wind power and photovoltaics now frequently exceeds demand during the summer half-year due to the expansion of capacity, but low water, wind and sun periods in Central Europe – above all during the\n\nwinter half-year – can create challenging situations for supply security. In light of these developments, EVN is working, for example as a project partner with RAG, on a pilot plant that will use solar energy to operate electrolysis equipment. The resulting green hydrogen will be stored in an idle RAG natural gas storage facility and can be used during the winter to generate emission-free electricity and heat. In other projects, EVN is testing the possibility to use surplus production from renewable sources for sector integration purposes or for the substitution of thermal generation. One example is the pilot hybrid storage facility in Theiss, which combines heat storage equipment with a 5 MW storage battery and photovoltaics.\n\nOther EVN research projects involve innovative approaches to increasingly utilise flexibilities from various customers and smaller electricity producers to adjust the demand for energy over time in a manner that prevents demand peaks and makes it possible to cover requirements with the available renewable energy. Contributions in this area are made by CyberGrid, a subsidiary acquired by EVN in 2022, which offers special IT solutions for the flexibility management of electricity networks as well as individual projects (e.g. for the bi-directional charging of e-vehicles) within the framework of the Green Energy Lab, an interdisciplinary innovation laboratory.\n\nImage /page/15/Figure/6 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Expenditures for innovation, research and development projects and share of subsidies.\" The chart shows the expenditures in EURm and the share of subsidies in %.

As part of this process, a centrally organised corporate risk management department provides the decentralised risk managers with effective methods and tools for identifying and assessing risks. The responsible business units communicate their risk exposures to corporate risk management, which defines suitable actions to minimise these risks. The necessary actions are then implemented by the individual business units. The corporate risk management department is also responsible for analysing EVN's risk exposure. The risks related to sustainability, climate and compliance issues are identified annually and managed by specialised organisational units and/or processes in agreement with central risk management. EVN's risk management process includes the following steps:\n\n- **• Identification:** The survey and/or revision of risks based on the latest risk inventory (review of risk inventory) and the identification of new risk positions and appropriate risk management countermeasures\n- **• Assessment and analysis:** The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the identified risks; the aggregation of risks from different points of view; and the modelling of earnings and cash flow distributions\n- **• Reporting:** Discussion and evaluation of the risk profile by the Risk Working Committee and the Group Risk Committee; the implementation of further risk management measures where necessary; reporting on risk issues to the Audit Committee\n- **• Process review:** Definition of the organisational units that must submit to an explicit risk assessment; regular reviews to determine whether the methods used to identify and assess risks should be modified to reflect changed conditions; routine reviews by the internal audit department\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Risk Working Committee**\n\nThe Risk Working Committee supports the corporate risk management department in the correct implementation of the risk management process. It evaluates and approves changes in risk (assessment) methods and defines the type and scope of risk reporting. The voting members of the committee at the corporate level include the heads of the following corporate functions: controlling, legal and public affairs, finance, accounting, internal audit and the chief compliance officer (CCO) as well as an (internal) energy industry expert.\n\n#### **Group Risk Committee and control**\n\nThe results of the risk inventory and the related reports are presented to and discussed by the Group Risk Committee, which consists of the Executive Board of EVN AG, the heads of the organisational units and the members of the Risk Working Committee. The Group Risk Committee decides on any need for action, can establish working groups and assign specified tasks, and is authorised to approve the results of the risk inventory (risk reports).\n\nGRI indicator: GRI 2-12\n\n#### **Risk profile**\n\nIn addition to the normal industry risks and uncertainties, EVN's risk profile is influenced primarily by political, legal and regulatory challenges and changes in the competitive environment. EVN carries out an annual risk inventory that is updated as needed through ad-hoc risk reports. This inventory includes the following categorisation of risks: market and competition risks, financial risks, operating risks, external risks, strategic and planning risks and other risks. These are largely assessed in terms of their financial impact on the EVN Group. The following table shows the risks classified under the above categories and the measures designated for their minimisation.\n\nIn line with the Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act, the risk inventory aims to systematically identify potential risks and effects of EVN's business activities and business relations on areas of environmental, social and employee-related issues, the observance of human rights and the fight against corruption. The identified risks and their impact were dealt with in accordance with the steps defined by the risk management process.\n\nFor the material impacts, see page 21ff in the EVN Annual Report 2022/23\n\n#### **Potential climate risks**\n\nEVN also places high priority on climate protection, and potential climate risks are therefore identified as part of the risk inventory. Climate risk is consciously not defined as a separate risk category but – wherever applicable – represents interdisciplinary material in the individual risk categories.

stricter requirements could possibly lead to additional costs\n\n• Additional stress for the electricity network due to the ongoing expansion of substantially more volatile renewable generation: transition risk that is assigned to the category \"operating risks\" (\"service disruptions/network breakdowns\")\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity analysis for 2022/23**\n\nIn view of the geopolitical crises during the past two years and the resulting distortions on energy markets, EVN also monitored risk developments in the Group throughout the reporting period. Ad-hoc analyses were not required in 2022/23 but the assessment of the major risks with a potentially high impact was updated at the end of the first half-year. A report on these risks and their effects was also presented to the Audit Committee of EVN's Supervisory Board.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following issues were identified as the major uncertainties with the potentially highest effects and analysed in particular detail in connection with the risk inventory carried out as of 30 September 2023 (excerpt):\n\n- Margin risk and competitive situation\n- Inflation-related increase in procurement costs for investments and maintenance\n- Completion risk for major international projects in the environmental business\n- Cybersecurity\n\nEVN's risk profile is influenced primarily by common industry risks and uncertainties and, in particular, by political, legal and regulatory challenges and changes. All these aspects are categorised as part of EVN's risk management process.\n\n#### **Overall risk profile**\n\nIn addition to the uncertainties connected with the areas of business and operations outside Austria, EVN continues to be confronted with a challenging environment in its home market of Lower Austria. In the 2022/23 financial year, however, the uncertainties decreased. The overall risk profile of EVN is trending downwards, but not yet to pre-crisis levels. To conclude, no future risks can be identified at the present time that could endanger the continued existence of the EVN Group.\n\nThe table on the pages 18 to 20 provides a summary of the material risks and uncertainties to which the EVN Group is exposed. For the first time, this table also includes opportunities for certain categories, if applicable.\n\n#### **Key features of the internal control and risk management system related to accounting processes**\n\nIn accordance with § 267 (3b) and in connection with § 243a (2) of the Austrian Commercial Code, those companies whose shares are admitted for trading on a regulated market are required to disclose the key features of their internal control and risk management system for corporate accounting processes in the management report. The Executive Board is responsible for establishing a suitable internal control and risk management system (ICS) for accounting processes as defined in § 82 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The effectiveness of the ICS must be monitored by the Audit Committee in accordance with § 92 (4a) no. 4b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act.\n\nEVN's ICS for accounting processes is monitored at regular intervals by auditing the processes that are considered to be exposed to risk. The results of these monitoring activities are reported to\n\nthe Executive Board and the Audit Committee. The ICS ensures clear lines of responsibility and eliminates unnecessary process steps, and thereby further improves the security of processes for the preparation of financial statements. The description of the major features of the ICS covers five interrelated components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.\n\n#### **Control environment**\n\nThe Code of Conduct issued by EVN and the underlying values apply to all Group employees.\n\nEVN's Code of Conduct is available under www.evn.at/code-of-conduct\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by Group accounting. The related processes are based on a uniform accounting guideline that defines the accounting policies to be applied as well as key processes and schedules for the entire Group. Binding instructions apply to the reconciliation of intragroup accounts and other work required for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. All employees involved in the accounting process have the necessary qualifications and undergo regular training. Complex actuarial opinions and valuations are prepared by external experts or specially qualified employees. The managers responsible for the specific processes – in general, the heads of the organisational units and corporate services – are responsible for compliance with these processes and the related control measures.\n\n#### **Risk assessment and control activities**\n\nMulti-stage control measures have been implemented to prevent material misstatements in the presentation of transactions in order to ensure that the individual financial statements of all subsidiaries are recorded correctly. These measures include automated controls that are executed by the consolidation software as well as manual controls by the involved corporate services. These corporate service departments carry out extensive plausibility checks of the individual subsidiaries' financial statements to ensure their correct transfer to the consolidated financial statements. The review of the financial statement data includes analyses at the position, segment and Group levels, both before and after consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are not released until these quality controls are complete at all levels.\n\nEVN AG and the major domestic and foreign subsidiaries use SAP software (FI module, finance and accounting) for their accounting. The IFRS consolidated financial statements are prepared with the Hyperion Financial Management software, whereby the data from \n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe individual financial statements of the consolidated companies are transferred by means of an interface. The accounting systems and all upstream systems are protected by restricted access as well as automated and mandatory manual control steps.\n\nThe ICS for financial reporting and all accounting-related processes are reviewed by the auditor at least once each year to verify compliance with the required controls, to evaluate any risk incidents that occurred during the financial year and to determine whether the controls are still suitable to deal with the existing risks. In the reporting period, a number of process adjustments and improvements were made as part of the continuous efforts to further develop the ICS for financial reporting.\n\n#### **Information, communication and monitoring**\n\nThe Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with quarterly reports on EVN's asset, financial and earnings position, together with a statement of financial position and a statement of operations. The Executive Board and the Audit Committee also receive a report on the ICS for financial accounting twice each year, which contains basic information to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ICS and is designed to support the management of the ICS by the responsible corporate bodies. The report is prepared by ICS management in cooperation with the ICS Committee based on information supplied by the managers responsible for ICS, the persons who carried out the controls and the auditors.\n\nThis information is also distributed to management and key personnel in the involved companies to facilitate monitoring and control activities and thereby ensure the accuracy of accounting and reporting procedures. EVN's internal audit department carries out regular reviews of the ICS for financial accounting, and their findings are also included in the continuous improvement of this system.\n\nGRI indicators: GRI 2-12, GRI 2-16\n\n## Consolidated non-financial report\n\nThe consolidated non-financial statement required by the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act was prepared in accordance with § 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code and is presented as an independent non-financial report.\n\nSee page 1ff in the EVN Annual Report 2022/23\n\n## Disclosures required by § 243a of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\n1. The share capital of EVN AG totalled EUR 330,000,000 as of 30 September 2023 and was divided into 179,878,402 zero par value bearer shares, each of which represents an equal stake in share capital. Shareholders are not entitled to the issue of individual share certificates. There is only one class of shares, and all shares carry the same rights and responsibilities. EVN AG shares are traded in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n2. There are no restrictions on voting rights or agreements limiting the transfer of shares which exceed the general requirements of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. However, it should be noted that the transferability of the investment owned by the province of Lower Austria, which holds its shares through NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten, is limited by Austrian federal and provincial constitutional law.\n\nNÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH (\"NLH\") and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH (\"WSTW\") established a tax participation association on 23 September 2021, for which they concluded an \"agreement over the creation of a tax participation association for their investments in EVN AG\". This contract basically calls for the syndicated exercise of voting rights by NLH and WSTW in the Annual General Meetings of EVN but reflects only the voting weight in the Annual General Meeting based on the respective investments held by NLH and WSTW and in accordance with legal regulations and/or the articles of association (NLH continues to hold a simple – but not qualified – majority and WSTW continues to hold a blocking minority).\n\n- 3. Based on the above-mentioned constitutional requirements, the province of Lower Austria is the major shareholder of EVN with a stake of 51.0%. The second largest shareholder is Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH, Vienna, with a stake of 28.4%; this company is wholly owned by the city of Vienna. As of 30 September 2023, EVN held treasury shares representing 0.9% of share capital and free float equalled 19.7%.\n- 4. EVN has not issued any shares with special control rights.\n- 5. Employees who own shares in EVN may exercise their voting rights personally at the Annual General Meeting. EVN does not have a stock option programme.\n- 6. The Executive Board consists of at least two members. The Supervisory Board has a minimum of eight and a maximum of 12 members. Unless another majority is required by law, the Annual General Meeting passes its resolutions with a simple majority of the votes cast or with a majority of the capital represented in cases requiring a majority of capital.\n- 7. There were no authorisations as defined by § 243a (1) no. 7 of the Austrian Commercial Code in effect during the 2022/23 financial year which entitled the Executive Board, in particular, to issue the company's shares. However, the possibility of issuing previously repurchased treasury shares to employees remains intact.\n- 8. A change of control in EVN in the sense of § 243a (1) no. 8 of the Austrian Commercial Code is currently not possible because of the legal regulations described above under points 2. and 3. Therefore, there are no possible consequences of a change of control.\n- 9. There are no agreements to provide compensation to the members of corporate bodies or employees in the event of a public takeover.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Outlook on the 2023/24 financial year\n\nFollowing the new historical level of investments reached during the past financial year, annual investments will range from EUR 700m to EUR 900m up to 2030, whereby three-fourths will focus on Lower Austria. That makes EVN one of the key players in the design of a CO₂-free energy future. The necessary foundation is formed by a high-performance electricity network infrastructure and, consequently, up to EUR 450m will be directed to this area each year. These investments will safeguard Lower Austria's leading position in renewable generation because an efficient and stable network is the basic condition for integrating the electricity generated by the wind, sun and water in the energy system. Marketable solutions must also be found to utilise the surplus production from renewable generation across multiple sectors or – even more decisive for the success of a year-round CO₂-free energy future – to be stored over several seasons. We will continue to address this essential future issue as part of our innovation activities and work to develop solutions, for example together with RAG, through promising projects.\n\nThe expansion of our own renewable generation capacity has also reached a historically high level. In addition to the construction of wind parks, the realisation of large-scale photovoltaic plants has increased rapidly. Our installed photovoltaic capacity will double to roughly 80 MWp in the first quarter of 2023/24 with the commissioning of plants in Dürnrohr and North Macedonia – an important step to reach the goal of 300 MWp for photovoltaics by 2030. In the wind power field, a pipeline of projects in different phases of completion in Lower Austria will help us meet our expansion goal of over 770 MW by 2030.\n\nThe crisis that has influenced the international energy markets for the past two years has, at times, triggered unexpected and erratic price fluctuations. This has led to an enormous burden not only for our customers, but also for the profitability of our energy supply business. We expect a return to positive earnings in 2023/24 after spot and futures prices gradually decline.\n\nIn South East Europe, the sharp rise in electricity prices also created significant challenges in the various market segments. Regulatory measures, for example as compensation for the additional costs for covering network losses, had positive anticipatory effects that will be offset in 2023/24 in accordance with the regulatory mechanism.\n\nWe initiated a structured bidder process for the international project business in September 2023. Its goal is to identify potential new investors for WTE who can support the realisation of the future international project and growth potential that is offered, above all by the successful project in Kuwait.\n\nFor the 2023/24 financial year, EVN expects Group net result within a range of roughly EUR 420m to EUR 460m – under the assumption of a stable regulatory and energy policy environment.\n\nEVN's future dividend policy has also been revised to reflect the investment and growth perspectives up to 2030 and beyond. The dividend will equal at least EUR 0.82 per share in the future, whereby EVN wants its shareholders to appropriately participate in any additional earnings growth. In the mid term, a payout ratio equalling 40% of Group net result, adjusted for extraordinary effects, is targeted.\n\nThese future perspectives underscore EVN's responsibility to remain a reliable operator of energy and drinking water infrastructure. At the same time, EVN also offers attractive opportunities for the capital market.\n\nMaria Enzersdorf, 21 November 2023\n\n**Stefan Szyszkowitz Franz Mittermayer** Spokesman of the Executive Board

General**\n\nEVN AG, as the parent company of the EVN Group (EVN), is a leading listed Austrian energy and environmental services provider. Its headquarters are located in A-2344 Maria Enzersdorf, Austria. In addition to serving its domestic market in the province of Lower Austria, EVN operates in the Bulgarian, North Macedonian, Croatian, German and Albanian energy industry. EVN is also active in the area of environmental services through subsidiaries that provide customers in twelve countries with water supply, wastewater treatment and thermal waste utilisation services.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared as of the balance sheet date of EVN AG. The financial year of EVN AG covers the period from 1 October to 30 September.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of uniform accounting policies. In cases where the balance sheet date of a consolidated company differs from the balance sheet date of EVN AG, interim financial statements are prepared as of 30 September.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical acquisition and production costs, unless indicated otherwise.\n\nCertain items on the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of operations are summarised to achieve a more understandable and clearly structured presentation. These positions are presented individually in the consolidated notes and explained according to the principle of materiality. In order to improve clarity and comparability, the amounts in the consolidated financial statements are generally shown in millions of euros (EURm), unless otherwise noted. Small amounts below TEUR 50 as well as zero values are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements with \"–\" to improve readability. The rounding of individual positions and percentage rates can lead to minimal rounding differences. As far as possible, the legislative basis is presented as is.\n\nThe consolidated statement of operations is prepared in accordance with the nature of expense method.\n\n#### **2. Reporting in accordance with IFRS**\n\nPursuant to § 245a of the Austrian Commercial Code, the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the current guidelines set forth in the IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) that were applicable as of the balance sheet date and had been adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\n#### **Standards and interpretations applied for the first time and changes in accounting policies**\n\nThe following standards and interpretations were applied for the first time in the 2022/23 financial year:\n\n| Standards and interpretations applied for the first time | Effective1)                           | Expected material effects<br>on EVN's consolidated<br>financial statements |      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Revised standards and interpretations                    |                                       |                                                                            |      |\n| IFRS 3                                                   | Reference to the Conceptual Framework | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n| IAS 16                                                   | Proceeds before Intended Use          | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n| IAS 37                                                   | Cost of Fulfilling a Contract         | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n| Several                                                  | Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018–2020 | 01.01.2022                                                                 | None |\n\n1) In accordance with the official Journal of the EU, these standards are applicable to financial years beginning on or after the effective date.\n\nThe first-time mandatory application of the amended standards and interpretations has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Standards and interpretations already adopted by the EU, but not yet compulsory**\n\n|                                       |                                                                                         | Effective¹ | EVN's consolidated financial statements |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| New standards and interpretations     | IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts                                                             | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n| Revised standards and interpretations | IAS 1 Disclosure of Accounting Policies                                                 | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates                                                | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IAS 12 Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IFRS 17 Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information             | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n|                                       | IAS 12 Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - Pillar Two Model                             | 01.01.2023 | None                                    |\n\n1) In accordance with IASB, these standards are applicable to financial years beginning on or after the effective date.\n\nThe IASB announced changes to IAS 12 – International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules in May 2023. The changes include a temporary exemption from the required recording and disclosure of information on deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the implementation of the Pillar Two rules.\n\nThe effects of the global minimum tax are currently the subject of analyses, and detailed statements on the concrete effects are therefore not possible at the present time. However, we assume there will be no effect on the consolidated financial statements. EVN regularly monitors and evaluates developments in connection with the global minimum tax. The future application of not yet binding standards and interpretations is also not expected to have a material effect on EVN's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following standards and interpretations had been issued by the IASB as of 30 September 2023, but have not yet been adopted by the EU:\n\n|               | Standards and interpretations not yet applicable and not yet adopted by the EU                                  | Effective1) | Expected material effects<br>on EVN's consolidated<br>financial statements |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               | Revised standards and interpretations                                                                           |             |                                                                            |\n| IAS 1         | Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current                                                         | 01.01.2024  | None                                                                       |\n| IFRS 16       | Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback                                                                         | 01.01.2024  | None                                                                       |\n| IAS 7, IFRS 7 | Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial<br>Instruments (Supplier Finance Arrangements) | 01.01.2024  | None                                                                       |\n| IAS 21        | Accounting in case of Lack of Exchangeability of a Currency                                                     | 01.01.2025  | None                                                                       |\n\n1) In accordance with IASB, these standards are applicable to financial years beginning on or after the effective date.\n\nEVN regularly monitors and analyses the effects of the application of revised standards and interpretations on the future presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the future disclosures in the consolidated notes.\n\n**Expected material effects on**\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\n#### **3. Consolidation methods**\n\nConsolidation is carried out by offsetting the consideration transferred against the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities.\n\nAll significant companies whose financial and operating activities are directly or indirectly controlled by EVN AG (i. e. subsidiaries) are fully consolidated. EVN is considered to have a controlling interest over a company in which it holds an investment when it has a right to variable returns from the investee and can influence the amount of these returns through its control.\n\nThis is usually the case when EVN's voting rights exceed 50.0%, but may also apply if EVN has the power of disposition over and is the primary beneficiary of any economic benefits arising from the business operations of these companies or if EVN is required to carry most of the risks. Companies are initially consolidated on the acquisition date or at the time EVN gains control and are deconsolidated when control ends.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) obtained through business combinations are recognised at their full fair value, irrespective of any existing non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are carried at the proportional share of net assets (excluding the proportional share of goodwill). Intangible assets are recognised separately from goodwill if they can be separated from the acquired company or arise from statutory, contractual or other legal rights. Any remaining positive differences which represent compensation to the seller for market opportunities or developmental potential that cannot be individually identified are recognised in local currency as goodwill and allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) in the relevant segment (for information on the treatment and recoverability of goodwill, see notes **35. Intangible assets** and **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).** Negative differences are recognised in profit or loss after a repeated measurement of the acquired company's identifiable assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and measurement of the acquisition cost. The differences between fair value and the carrying amount are carried forward in accordance with the related assets and liabilities during the subsequent consolidation. A change in the investment in a fully consolidated company is accounted for directly in equity without recognition through profit or loss.\n\nJoint arrangements are included in the consolidated financial statements of EVN depending on the rights and obligations attributed to the controlling parties by the respective agreement. If only rights to the net assets are involved, the joint arrangement is classified as a joint venture according to IFRS 11 and included at equity. If rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities are involved, the joint arrangement is classified as a joint operation according to IFRS 11 and included in the consolidated financial statements through line-by-line consolidation.\n\nAssociates – i. e. companies in which EVN AG can directly or indirectly exercise significant influence – are included at equity.\n\nSubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are not consolidated if their influence on EVN's asset, financial and earnings position is considered to be immaterial, either individually or in total. These companies are reported at cost less any necessary impairment losses. The materiality of an investment is assessed on the basis of the balance sheet total, the proportional share of equity, external revenue and annual profit or loss as reported in the last available financial statements in relation to the respective Group totals.\n\nIntragroup receivables, liabilities, income and expenses as well as interim profits and losses are eliminated unless they are immaterial. The consolidation procedure for profit or loss includes the effects of income taxes as well as the recognition of deferred taxes if permissible.\n\n#### **4. Scope of consolidation**\n\nThe scope of consolidation is determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 10. Accordingly, 26 domestic and 28 foreign subsidiaries (including the parent company EVN AG) were fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statements as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: 25 domestic and 27 foreign subsidiaries). A total of ten subsidiaries (previous year: 16) were not consolidated due to their immaterial influence on EVN's asset, financial and earnings position, either individually or in total.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fully consolidated subsidiary EVN Energieservices GmbH (previous year: EVN AG), as the limited partner of EVN KG, participates to 100.0% in the profit or loss of EVN KG. The limited partner changed in connection with intragroup reorganisations during 2022/23 (also see the information on the initial consolidation of EVN Energieservices GmbH). EnergieAllianz serves as the general partner of EVN KG, but does not hold an investment in this company. Based on the agreement with EnergieAllianz regarding the management of EVN KG, there is joint control and EVN KG is therefore classified as a joint venture in the sense of IFRS 11 and consolidated at equity. Contractual agreements also lead to the classification of the EnergieAllianz Group (EnergieAllianz and its subsidiaries) as a joint venture in the sense of IFRS 11; the group is therefore included in the consolidated financial statements at equity.\n\nRBG, a fully consolidated company in which EVN AG has an unchanged interest of 50.03%, holds a 100.0% stake in RAG. RAG is consolidated at equity because contractual agreements prevent EVN from exercising control.\n\nBioenergie Steyr, in which EVN Wärme holds a stake of 51.0%, is included in EVN's consolidated financial statements at equity because contractual agreements exclude any possibility of control.\n\nVerbund Innkraftwerke, Germany, in which EVN AG has an unchanged interest of 13.0%, is included at equity due to special contractual arrangements that allow for the exercise of significant influence.\n\nThe criteria for control defined by IFRS 10 are not considered to be met in companies with an investment of 50.0%. These companies are classified as joint ventures in the sense of IFRS 11 based on the respective contractual agreements and are therefore included in the consolidated financial statements at equity.\n\nAn overview of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements is provided under **EVN's investments,** starting on page 115. Notes **49. Non-controlling interests** and **64. Disclosures of interests in other entities** provide detailed information on the subsidiaries with major non-controlling interests as well as joint ventures and associates that are included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe scope of consolidation (including EVN AG as the parent company) developed as follows during the reporting year:\n\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation | Full consolidation | Equity | Total |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|-------|\n| 30.09.2021                            | 55                 | 16     | 71    |\n| thereof foreign companies             | 29                 | 6      | 35    |\n| Initial consolidation                 | –                  | –      | –     |\n| Deconsolidation                       | -3                 | –      | -3    |\n| 30.09.2022                            | 52                 | 16     | 68    |\n| thereof foreign companies             | 27                 | 6      | 33    |\n| Company acquisition                   | 1                  | –      | 1     |\n| Initial consolidation                 | 2                  | 1      | 3     |\n| Deconsolidation                       | –                  | -2     | -2    |\n| Reorganisation1)                      | -1                 | –      | -1    |\n| 30.09.2023                            | 54                 | 15     | 69    |\n| thereof foreign companies             | 28                 | 5      | 33    |\n\n1) Internal reorganisation\n\nThe 100.0% share in WTE Projektentwicklung GmbH, Maria Enzersdorf, and the 50.0% share in EVN-ECOWIND Sonnenstromerzeugungs GmbH, Maria Enzersdorf, which were previously not consolidated due to immateriality, were included in the consolidated financial statements as of 1 January 2023. WTE Projektentwicklung GmbH has been fully consolidated and EVN-ECOWIND consolidated at equity since 1 January 2023. These two first-time consolidations had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN previously held 50% of the shares in sludge2energy GmbH (s2e), Berching, Germany and included this company in the consolidated financial statements at equity. As of 1 January 2023, EVN acquired the remaining 50% of the shares in s2e and now holds an investment of 100%. The company has therefore been included through full consolidation since 1 January 2023.\n\nThe focus point of business for s2e is the planning, construction and operation of plants for the treatment and utilisation of sludge and residual materials as well as the generation of thermal and electrical energy. The company currently has a newly built thermal sewage sludge utilisation plant in Halle-Lochau, Germany, and is constructing a thermal sewage sludge utilisation plant for a German customer. EVN's objective for the acquisition of s2e by the WTE Group is to expand its market position in the planning and turnkey construction of thermal sewage sludge utilisation plants and to improve and increase the attractiveness of the product portfolio for environmental infrastructure projects in the international project business.\n\nThe fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date on 1 January 2023 is as follows:\n\n| Acquired assets and liabilities                     | Fair value |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                | 01.01.2023 |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment | 12.4       |\n| Other non-current assets                            | 1.3        |\n| Current receivables and other assets1)              | 23.5       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                           | 1.5        |\n| Total fair value of assets                          | 38.7       |\n| Trade payables                                      | -4.4       |\n| Current provisions                                  | -9.3       |\n| Other current liabilities                           | -22.7      |\n| Total fair value of liabilities                     | -36.5      |\n| Net assets                                          | 2.2        |\n| Transferred consideration                           | 2.2        |\n| thereof previous at-equity share (50%)              | 1.1        |\n| thereof consideration acquired share (50%)          | 1.1        |\n| Difference                                          | 0.0        |\n\n1) The carrying amounts of current receivables and other assets represent gross receivables and the fair value as of 1 January 2023.\n\nThe purchase price reflected the fair value of the acquired net assets and was paid entirely in cash. s2e recorded revenue of EUR 27.9m and a result for the period of EUR –5.4m from the acquisition date to 30 September 2023. If the company had been fully consolidated from the beginning of the financial year, it would have increased revenue by EUR 33.0m. The company generated a result before tax of EUR 2.0m in the first quarter of 2022/23. Because s2e reported negative equity as of 30 September 2022, the excess losses could not be recognised to profit or loss.\n\nThis transaction represents a business combination through the successive purchase of shares to attain control. The at equity carrying amount before the business combination equalled EUR 0.0m. The next step involved a revaluation of EUR 1.1m to the existing at equity component at fair value. The gain from this revaluation was reported on the consolidated statement of operations under share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN Energieservices GmbH, Maria Enzersdorf, which was previously not consolidated by EVN due to immateriality, was initially consolidated as of 28 February 2023. EVN AG holds all shares in this company. In connection with internal restructuring following the reorientation of sales activities in the EVN Group, the business unit \"sales and energy-related services\" of the equity accounted EVN KG was subsequently transferred to EVN Energieservices GmbH as of 28 February 2023. In the future, EVN KG will concentrate solely on electricity and natural gas deliveries to end customers and EVN Energieservices GmbH on sales and energy-related services. The transfer of this business unit represents an acquisition of a business as defined in IFRS 3. The consideration for the transfer of the business unit equalled EUR 3.4m.\n\nThe for the first time fully consolidated EVN Energieservices GmbH and the acquired business unit \"sales and energy-related services\" were assigned to the Energy Segment. The identified assets and liabilities of the business unit measured at fair value as of the acquisition date on 28 February 2023 are as follows:\n\n| Acquired assets and liabilities                     | Fair value |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                | 28.02.2023 |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment | 9.7        |\n| Inventories                                         | 3.3        |\n| Current receivables and other assets1)              | 13.3       |\n| <b>Total fair value of assets</b>                   | 26.4       |\n| Non-current provisions                              | -1.7       |\n| Other non-current liabilities                       | -2.3       |\n| Current loans and borrowings                        | -0.4       |\n| Trade payables                                      | -3.2       |\n| Other current liabilities                           | -14.0      |\n| <b>Total fair value of liabilities</b>              | -21.6      |\n| Net assets                                          | 4.7        |\n| Transferred consideration                           | 3.4        |\n| Difference                                          | 1.3        |\n\n1) The fair value of receivables and other assets represents the carrying amounts. Gross receivables, however, totalled EUR 14.7m.\n\nThe component considered uncollectible according to best estimates on the acquisition date therefore equals EUR 1.4m.\n\nThe contribution generated a negative difference of EUR 1.3m for the EVN Group on the acquisition date, which was recorded to profit or loss and is reported under other operating income. The agreed consideration of EUR 3.4m was based on the valuation of the business unit as of 30 September 2022. The gain from the transaction resulted primarily from the actual development of the business unit during the first five months of the 2022/23 financial year.\n\nThis business unit contributed revenue of EUR 20.8m and profit before tax of EUR –9.5m from the acquisition date to 30 September 2023. If the business unit had been included in EVN's consolidated statements from the beginning of the financial year, it would have increased revenue by EUR 42.8m. As the results of EVN KG for the period are included in full under the share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature, there would have been no change in Group result for the period apart from the above-mentioned initial consolidation gain.\n\nThe fully consolidated EVN Kraftwerks- und Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, Maria Enzersdorf, was merged with EVN Wärmekraftwerke GmbH. The merger was recorded in the company register on 10 May 2023.\n\nBiowärme Amstetten-West GmbH, Amstetten, which was previously consolidated at equity, was deconsolidated as of 30 June 2023 due to immateriality. This deconsolidation had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN acquired a telecommunications network from Bauer GmbH & Co KG, Loosdorf, through an asset deal as of 30 September 2023. This network, which services the communities of Loosdorf and Pöchlarn, provides customers with cable television as well as coaxial and glass fibre internet services. The transaction covers the entire business operations together with all its constituent parts, in particular the cable network, including all related plant components, employment relationships, the existing customer base and the processes required for business operations. Consequently, the acquisition represents a business combination as defined in IFRS 3. A purchase price of EUR 2.9m was paid as return consideration.\n\nThe business operations were acquired by kabelplus and allocated to the Networks Segment. The transaction will expand kabelplus' supply area and support connections with new customers. The location of the cable network between Melk and St. Pölten is considered ideal and closes a gap for kabelplus, which already provides internet connectivity.\n\nThe fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as of the acquisition date on 30 September 2023 are as follows:\n\n| Acquired assets and liabilities      | Fair value |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| EURm                                 | 30.09.2023 |\n| Intangible assets                    | 1.2        |\n| Property, plant and equipment        | 1.9        |\n| Current receivables and other assets | 0.1        |\n| Total fair value of assets           | 3.1        |\n| Other liabilities                    | 0.1        |\n| Total fair value of liabilities      | 0.1        |\n| Net assets                           | 3.0        |\n| Transferred consideration            | 2.9        |\n| Difference                           | 0.1        |\n\nThe acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included by carrying forward the fair values determined as of the acquisition date. These determined values should be seen as preliminary in accordance with IFRS 3 due to uncertainty.\n\nIn connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation under IFRS 3, the existing customer base was identified as an intangible asset to be recognised separately. The value of the customer base was calculated by applying the residual value method based on future earnings and expenses that could be allocated to the customer base. The fair value of the customer base equalled EUR 1.2m as of 30 September 2023 and will be amortised over a useful life of eight years.\n\nThe acquired current receivables did not include any receivables that are likely to be uncollectible. Consequently, the carrying amount represents the fair value.\n\nIf the business operations had been acquired as of 1 October 2022, they would have increased revenue by EUR 1.1m and the result after tax by EUR 0.3m.\n\nThe transaction led to a minor negative difference of less than EUR 0.1m, which resulted primarily from the negotiating positions of the involved parties.\n\nThere were no other IFRS 3 business combinations in the reporting period.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **5. Foreign currency translation**\n\nAll Group companies record their foreign currency business transactions at the mid exchange rate in effect on the date of the relevant transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the mid exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting foreign currency gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss. The exchange rate applied to the initial recognition of an asset, expense or income is derived from the date on which a company initially recognises the related non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, the annual financial statements of Group companies that are prepared in a foreign currency are translated into euros for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. This translation is based on the functional currency method, under which the assets and liabilities of companies not reporting in euros are converted at the mid exchange rate on the balance sheet date and any income and expenses are converted at the average annual rate. Unrealised currency translation differences from long-term Group loans are recorded under the currency translation reserve in equity without recognition in profit or loss. Currency translation differences directly recognised in equity resulted in a change to equity of EUR –15.9m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 31.3m). Of this amount, EUR 0.0m (previous year: EUR –2.1m) is attributable to transfers to the consolidated statement of operations from partial disposals (redemptions) of net investments and is reported as exchange rate losses in the other financial result (see note **32. Financial results).**\n\nAdditions and disposals are reported at the applicable average exchange rates in all tables. Changes in the mid exchange rates between the balance sheet date for the reporting year and the previous year as well as differences arising from the use of mid exchange rates to translate changes during the financial year are reported separately under currency translation differences in all tables.\n\nGoodwill resulting from the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries is recorded at the exchange rate in effect on the acquisition date. This goodwill is subsequently allocated to the acquired company and translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. When a foreign company is deconsolidated, any related currency differences are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe following key exchange rates were used for foreign currency translation:\n\n| Foreign currency translation | 2022/23                                    |           | 2021/22                                    |           |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Currency                     | Exchange rate on the<br>balance sheet date | Average1) | Exchange rate on the<br>balance sheet date | Average1) |\n| Albanian lek                 | 106.68000                                  | 112.01423 | 116.59500                                  | 120.14423 |\n| Bulgarian lev2)              | 1.95583                                    | 1.95583   | 1.95583                                    | 1.95583   |\n| Bahrain dinar                | 0.39950                                    | 0.40042   | 0.36775                                    | 0.40878   |\n| Japanese yen                 | 158.11000                                  | 148.73692 | 140.99500                                  | 134.31769 |\n| Croatian kuna3)              | –                                          | 7.53476   | 7.52415                                    | 7.53292   |\n| Kuwaiti dinar                | 0.32740                                    | 0.32669   | 0.30215                                    | 0.33036   |\n| North Macedonian denar       | 61.50160                                   | 61.58384  | 61.49500                                   | 61.63175  |\n| Polish zloty                 | 4.62775                                    | 4.61934   | 4.84870                                    | 4.66853   |\n| Russian rouble               | 103.18475                                  | 83.21165  | 59.62660                                   | 78.11961  |\n\n1) Average of the exchange rates on the last day of each month\n\n2) The exchange rate was determined by Bulgarian law.\n\n3) Accession to the euro currency area on 1 January 2023\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n#### **6. Intangible assets**\n\nAcquired intangible assets are recognised at acquisition cost less straight-line amortisation and any impairment losses, unless their useful life is classified as indefinite. Assets with a determinable limited useful life are amortised on the basis of that expected useful life, which as in the previous year, equals three to eight years for software and three to 40 years for rights. Customer relationships capitalised in connection with a business acquisition, which have a determinable useful life because of potential market liberalisation, are amortised on a straight-line basis over five to 15 years. The expected useful lives and amortisation curves are determined by estimating the timing and distribution of cash inflows from the corresponding intangible assets over time. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are measured at cost and tested annually for impairment (see note **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).**\n\nInternally generated intangible assets must meet the requirements of IAS 38 in order to be capitalised. This standard distinguishes between research and development expenses.\n\nService concessions that meet the requirements of IFRIC 12 are classified as intangible assets. Expenses and income are recognised according to the percentage of completion method at the fair value of the compensation received. The percentage of completion is assessed according to the cost-to-cost method. The requirements defined in IFRIC 12 are currently met by the Ashta hydropower plant as well as the sewage treatment plant project in Zagreb, both of which are included at equity.\n\n#### **7. Property, plant and equipment**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition or production cost less scheduled straight-line depreciation and any necessary impairment losses. The acquisition or production cost also includes the estimated expenses for demolition and disposal if there is an obligation to decommission or demolish the plant and equipment or to restore property at the end of the asset's useful life. The present value of the estimated demolition and/or disposal costs is capitalised along with the acquisition or production cost and also recognised as a liability (provision). Production costs for internally generated fixed assets include appropriate material and manufacturing overheads in addition to direct material and labour costs.\n\nOngoing maintenance and repairs to property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss, provided this work does not change the nature of the asset or lead to additional future benefits. If these measures enhance the value of the respective asset, the related expenses must be capitalised retroactively as part of the acquisition or production cost.\n\nIf the construction of property, plant and equipment continues over an extended period of time, these items are classified as \"qualifying assets\". The borrowing costs incurred during the construction period are then capitalised as a part of the production cost in accordance with IAS 23. In keeping with EVN's accounting policies, a project gives rise to a qualifying asset only if construction takes at least twelve months. Interest on borrowed capital is not capitalised if the amounts are insignificant over the entire construction phase.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are depreciated from the time they are available for use. Depreciation for property, plant and equipment subject to wear and tear is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the relevant asset or its components. The expected economic and technical life is evaluated at each balance sheet date and adjusted if necessary.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs in the previous year, straight-line depreciation is based on the following useful lives, which are uniform throughout the Group:\n\n| Expected useful life of property, plant and equipment | Years |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Buildings                                             | 10–50 |\n| Transmission lines and pipelines                      | 15–50 |\n| Machinery                                             | 10–50 |\n| Meters                                                | 5–40  |\n| Tools and equipment                                   | 3–25  |\n\nWhen property, plant and equipment are sold, the acquisition or production cost and accumulated depreciation are reported as a disposal. The difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the carrying amount are recognised in other operating income or expenses.\n\nSome leases include extension and cancellation options which are used by EVN to achieve maximum operating flexibility in the assets used by the Group. The determination of the contract term includes all facts and circumstances which could represent an economic incentive for the exercise of an extension option or the non-exercise of a cancellation option.\n\nEVN evaluates at the beginning of the contract term whether a contract establishes a lease. If a lease is involved, a right of use and corresponding lease liability are recognised. The amount of the right of use represents the amount of the lease liability on the contract's initial recognition date, with an adjustment for any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, payments at or before the beginning of the lease relationship, lease incentives and/or dismantling obligations. The carrying amount of the lease liability is determined by discounting the payments expected during the lease, the expected payments from issued residual value guarantees, the exercise prices for purchase options (if their exercise is sufficiently probable) and any payments for premature cancellation of the contract (if probable).\n\n#### **8. Investments in equity accounted investees**\n\nInvestments in equity accounted investees are initially recognised at cost. In subsequent periods, the carrying amounts of these investments are adjusted by the share of profit or loss attributable to EVN, less any dividends received, and by EVN's share of other comprehensive income and any other changes in equity. Investments accounted for according to the equity method are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 if there are any indications of a loss in value (see note **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).**\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature is reported as part of results from operating activities (EBIT). The share of results from equity accounted investees with financial nature is reported as part of financial results (see notes **30. Share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature, 32. Financial results** and **64. Disclosures of interests in other entities).**\n\n#### **9. Financial instruments**\n\nA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset in one company and a financial liability or an equity instrument in another company.\n\n#### **Primary financial instruments**\n\nPrimary financial instruments are measured in accordance with the rules defined by IFRS 9. Initial recognition is based on fair value as of the settlement date, including transaction costs, unless the financial instruments are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Primary financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when EVN is contractually entitled to receive payment or other financial assets from another party.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing the initial application of IFRS 9, EVN has classified its financial assets under the following measurement categories since 1 October 2018:\n\n- Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\n- Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n- At amortised cost (AC)\n\nThe classification of financial assets on initial recognition is based on the business model and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.\n\nA financial asset is classified at amortised cost (AC) when it is held to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist entirely of interest and principal payments on the outstanding amount. EVN holds loans receivable, trade receivables, remaining other noncurrent assets, cash on hand and cash at banks within the framework of a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows. Consequently, the cash flow criterion is also met and the financial assets are classified at amortised cost (AC).\n\nThe non-current and current securities held by EVN are held within a business model whose objective is neither to collect contractual cash flows nor to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets. These securities are classified at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Derivative financial assets (outside hedge accounting) must be classified at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) (see Derivative financial instruments).\n\nInvestments in equity instruments are generally measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). However, EVN decided, at the time IFRS 9 was initially applied, to exercise the \"FVOCI option\" provided by IFRS 9.5.7.5 and classify all its equity instruments irrevocably at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nFinancial liabilities are still classified under the following measurement categories:\n\n- Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n- At amortised cost (AC)\n\nSubsequent measurement is based on the classification to the measurement categories listed above and the rules applicable to the individual categories. These rules are described in the notes to the individual items on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe introduction of IFRS 9 led to the application at the time of initial recognition of the expected credit loss model (ECL) to debt instruments carried at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, lease receivables and contractual assets as defined in IFRS 15. Under the ECL model, impairment losses are not only recognised for losses which have already occurred but also for expected future credit losses. The related classification is based on a three-stage impairment model. When a financial asset is initially recognised, a loss allowance must be determined for the credit losses expected to occur within one year (risk category 1). Any significant deterioration in the debtor's credit standing leads to the extension of this timeframe to the full term of the financial asset (risk category 2). An impaired credit standing or actual default by the debtor results in reclassification to risk category 3. The criteria for the transfer between risk categories are based on EVN's internal rating system.\n\nEVN determines the expected future credit loss by multiplying the \"probability of default (PoD)\" with the carrying amount of the financial asset \"exposure at default (EAD)\" and the actual loss resulting from customer default \"loss given default (LGD)\".\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn contrast to the above-mentioned ECL model, the simplified approach does not include the measurement of the twelve-month expected credit loss but only the lifetime expected credit loss. A simplified approach must be applied to trade receivables and IFRS 15 contractual assets without a significant financing component. An option is also available to apply the simplified approach to trade receivables and IFRS 15 contractual assets with a significant financing component. EVN uses this option. The option to apply the simplified approach in accordance with IFRS 16 to lease receivables is not applied.\n\nEVN uses the practical expedient defined by IFRS 9.B5.5.35 for trade receivables and measures the expected credit loss with a provision matrix (also see note **13. Trade and other receivables).**\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments**\n\nThe main instruments used by EVN to manage and limit existing exchange rate and interest rate risks in the financial sector are foreign currency and interest rate swaps. EVN uses swaps, futures and forwards to limit energy sector risks arising from changes in commodity and product prices.\n\nThe forward and futures contracts concluded by EVN for the purchase or sale of electricity, natural gas, coal and CO2 emission certificates serve to hedge the purchase prices for expected electricity and natural gas deliveries or CO2 emission certificates as well as the selling prices for planned electricity production. If physical delivery is based on the expected procurement, sale or usage requirements, the criteria for the so-called \"own use exemption\" are met. The contracts are then not considered derivative financial instruments in terms of IFRS 9, but represent pending purchase and sale transactions, which must be assessed for possible impending losses from pending transactions in accordance with IAS 37. If the requirements for the own use exemption are not met – for example, by transactions for short-term optimisation – the contracts are recorded as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9. Corresponding expenses and income from such derivative financial instruments are reported under results from operating activities.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value, which generally reflects the acquisition cost, when the respective contract is concluded and measured at fair value in subsequent periods. The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined on the basis of quoted market prices, information provided by banks or discounting-based valuation methods whereby the counterparty risk is also included. Positive fair values are recorded as receivables from derivative transactions (under other non-current assets or under current receivables and other assets, depending on the term). In contrast, negative fair values are recorded as liabilities from derivative transactions (under other non-current liabilities or under other current liabilities, depending on the term). For counterparties with a master agreement that includes a so-called netting clause, the positive and negative fair values are presented as net amounts for the respective time periods when net settlement is planned (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\nEVN has designated significant parts of the listed derivatives as hedges within the framework of hedge accounting. The requirements defined by IFRS 9 for this designation include an approved underlying transaction or hedging instrument, the formal designation and documentation of the hedge relationship, an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedge as well as an appropriately documented hedging strategy.\n\nCash flow hedges are used to hedge the interest rate risks arising from financial liabilities and foreign exchange risks and to hedge the price risk from planned future electricity sales. At the beginning of the designated hedge relationship, the Group documents the risk management goals and strategies to be followed with regard to the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument as well as expectations as to whether the changes in the cash flows from the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recognised under other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of the changes in fair value, which is recorded under other comprehensive income, is limited to the cumulative change in the fair value of the underlying transaction (based on present value) since the beginning of the hedge. Any ineffective parts of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately to profit or loss.\n\nIf an expected hedged transaction subsequently leads to the recognition of a non-financial item, e. g. inventories, the accumulated amount from the hedging reserve and the reserve for hedging costs is included in the acquisition cost of the non-financial item, if it is recognised.\n\nFor all other expected hedged transactions, the accumulated amount in the hedging reserve and the reserve for hedging costs is reclassified to profit or loss of the period or periods in which the expected future hedged cash flows influence profit or loss. If a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or if the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is terminated prospectively. A so-called \"rebalancing\" is generally carried out when the framework conditions change, and the hedge is only terminated when this is not possible. When cash flow hedge accounting is terminated, the amount in the hedging reserve remains in equity until it is included in the acquisition cost of a non-financial item on initial recognition (for hedging transactions that lead to the recognition of a non-financial item) or until it is reclassified to profit or loss of the period or periods in which the expected hedged future cash flows influence profit or loss (for other cash flow hedges).\n\nIf the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, the amounts in the hedging reserve and the reserve for hedging costs are reclassified immediately to profit or loss.\n\nThe accounting treatment of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used for hedging purposes depends on the type of the hedging transaction.\n\nFair value hedges are used to hedge currency risks (also see notes **61. Risk managment** and **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\nDerivative financial instruments classified as fair value hedges under IFRS 9 serve to hedge recognised assets or liabilities against the risk of a change in fair value. For fair value hedges, the recognition in profit or loss includes the change in the fair value of the derivative as well as the contrasting change in the fair value of the underlying transaction, as far as it reflects the hedged risk. The related earnings are generally reported under the same position in the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying transaction. Changes in the value of the hedges are essentially offset by the changes in the value of the hedged transactions.\n\nThe derivatives used by EVN for hedging purposes constitute effective protection. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by compensating changes in the underlying transactions.\n\n#### **10. Other investments**\n\nOther investments include, in addition to other investments, shares in associated companies which are not included in the consolidated financial statements due to immateriality. These shares are recorded at cost less any necessary impairment losses. The other investments were classified irrevocably at fair value through other comprehensive income (\"FVOCI option\") in accordance with IFRS 9.5.7.5 following the introduction of IFRS 9. The fair value of these investments is based on available information and derived from market quotations, discounted cash flow calculations or the multiplier method. The measurement and deconsolidation results from these equity instruments are recorded under other comprehensive income. Dividends received are still reported on the consolidated statement of operations under income from investments, despite the use of this option (also see note **32. Financial results).** \n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **11. Other non-current assets**\n\nSecurities recorded under other non-current assets are initially recognised as FVTPL. These assets are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and subsequently measured at fair value as of the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nLoans receivable are classified as AC, whereby the carrying amount on the acquisition date corresponds to the fair value. These loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost in keeping with the effective interest rate method and also reflect any necessary impairment losses.\n\nLease receivables arise from the international project business in the Environment Segment. They are classified as finance leases according to IFRS 16.\n\nReceivables arising from derivative transactions are recognised as FVTPL. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of operations or in other comprehensive income (see note **9. Financial instruments).**\n\nThe measurement of the remaining non-current assets is based on acquisition or production cost or the lower net realisable value on the balance sheet date.\n\nCosts incurred for obtaining a contract are capitalised as an asset when EVN assumes these costs can be recovered. The capitalised costs are amortised on a systematic basis depending on how the goods or services are transferred to the customer.\n\n#### **12. Inventories**\n\nThe measurement of inventories is based on acquisition or production cost or the lower net realisable value as of the balance sheet date. For marketable inventories, these values are derived from the current market price. For other inventories, these figures are based on the expected proceeds less future production costs. Risks arising from the length of storage or reduced marketability are reflected in experience-based reductions. The moving average price method is used to determine the consumption of primary energy inventories as well as raw materials, auxiliary materials and fuels.\n\nThe inventories of natural gas held by EVN for trading purposes are measured through profit or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. In accordance with the dealer-broker exception for raw material and commodities traders, measurement is based on fair value less costs to sell. This represents the market price for day-ahead deliveries on the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH).\n\n#### **13. Trade and other receivables**\n\nCurrent receivables are generally recorded at amortised cost, which equals the acquisition cost less impairment losses for the components of the receivables that are expected to be uncollectible. EVN applies the practical expedient provided by IFRS 9.B5.5.35 to trade receivables and determines the expected credit loss with a provision matrix. The input factors for the matrix include analyses of default incidents in previous financial years based on different regional characteristics for the core markets. The expected credit losses determined by the matrix are ranked by the time (over)due based on historical default rates and subsequently written off through profit or loss. The compiled information is reviewed annually, and the default rates are adjusted if necessary. All other receivables are accounted for in accordance with the ECL model (also see note **9. Financial instruments).**\n\nAmortised costs, less any applicable impairment losses, can be considered appropriate estimates of the current value because the remaining term to maturity is generally less than one year.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nExceptions to the above procedure are receivables arising from derivative transactions which are recognised at fair value, and foreign currency items, which are measured at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date.\n\nContract assets consist primarily of the Group's claims to consideration for performance on contract orders from the project business, in cases where the performance was completed but not yet invoiced as of the balance sheet date. Contract assets are reclassified to receivables when the rights become unconditional. This generally occurs when the Group issues an invoice to the customer.\n\n#### **14. Securities**\n\nCurrent securities, which consist mainly of investment certificates, are classified as FVTPL and measured at their fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n#### **15. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash balances in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date.\n\nIn accordance with internal Group guidelines, EVN invests cash and cash equivalents only with reputable financial institutions with good ratings. In this respect, it is assumed that cash and cash equivalents based on the external rating of banks and financial institutions have a low risk of default.\n\n#### **16. Assets and liabilities held for sale**\n\nNon-current assets as well as disposal groups that contain assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale when their sale is highly likely.\n\nThese assets and disposal groups are generally carried at the lower of their respective carrying amount and fair value less disposal costs. Any necessary recognition of an impairment loss to a disposal group is initially allocated to goodwill and, thereafter, to the remaining assets and liabilities on a proportional basis. Impairment losses resulting from the initial classification as held for sale as well as later gains and losses on revaluation are recognised to profit or loss.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised, respectively depreciated once they have been classified as held for sale.\n\n#### **17. Equity**\n\nIn contrast to borrowings, equity is defined by the IFRS framework as the \"residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities\". Equity is thus the residual value of a company's assets and liabilities.\n\nTreasury shares held by EVN are not recognised as securities pursuant to IAS 32, but are instead reported at their (repurchase) acquisition cost and offset against equity. Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of treasury shares relative to the acquisition cost increases or decreases capital reserves.\n\nThe items recorded under other comprehensive income include certain changes in equity that are not recognised through profit or loss as well as the related deferred taxes. For example, this position contains the currency translation reserve, valuation results from equity instruments (FVOCI), the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges as well as all remeasurements according to IAS 19. This item also includes the proportional share of gains and losses recognised directly in equity accounted investees.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **18. Provisions**\n\n#### **Personnel provisions**\n\nThe projected unit credit method is used to determine the provisions for pensions and similar obligations as well as severance payments. The expected pension payments are distributed according to the number of years of service by employees until retirement, taking expected future increases in salaries and pensions into account.\n\nThe amounts of the provisions are determined by an actuary as of each balance sheet date based on an expert opinion. The measurement principles are described in note **52. Non-current provisions.** All remeasurements – at EVN, only gains and losses from changes in actuarial assumptions – are recognised under other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe applied interest rate is based on the market yields for first-class, fixed-interest industrial bonds as of the balance sheet date, whereby the maturities of the benefits were taken into account.\n\nThe service cost added to the provision is reported under personnel expenses, while the interest component of the addition is included under financial results.\n\n#### **Provisions for pensions and pension-related obligations**\n\nThe calculation of the provisions for pensions, as in the previous year, was based on the Austrian mortality tables \"AVÖ 2018-P – Rechnungsgrundlagen für die Pensionsversicherung\", which were issued by the Actuarial Association Austria (AVÖ) on 15 August 2018.\n\nUnder the terms of a company agreement, EVN AG is required to pay a supplementary pension on retirement to employees who joined the company prior to 31 December 1989. This commitment also applies to employees who, within the context of the legal unbundling agreement for the spin-off of the electricity and natural gas networks, are now employed by Netz Niederösterreich. The amount of this supplementary pension is based on performance as well as on the length of service and the amount of remuneration at retirement. EVN, in any case, and the employees, as a rule, also make contributions to the umbrella pension fund VBV Pensionskasse AG (VBV) and the resulting claims are fully credited toward pension payments. Therefore, EVN's obligations toward both retired employees and prospective beneficiaries are covered in part by provisions for pensions as well as by defined contribution payments on the part of VBV.\n\nFor employees who joined the company after 1 January 1990, the supplementary company pension was replaced by a defined contribution plan that is financed through VBV. VBV is responsible for the investment of the pension plan assets. Pension commitments were also made to certain employees, which require EVN to pay retirement benefits under certain conditions.\n\nProvisions for pension-related obligations were recognised for liabilities arising from the vested claims of current employees and the current claims of retired personnel and their dependents to receive benefits in kind in the form of electricity and natural gas.\n\n#### **Provision for severance payments**\n\nAustrian corporations are required by law to make one-off severance payments to employees whose employment began before 1 January 2003 if they are dismissed, in case of dissolution of the employment relationship by mutual consent or when they reach the legal retirement age. The amount of such payments is based on the number of years of service and the amount of the respective employee's remuneration at the time the severance payment is made.\n\nEmployees in Bulgaria and North Macedonia are entitled to severance payments on retirement, which are based on the number of years of service. With regard to severance compensation entitlements, the other EVN employees are covered by similar social protection measures contingent on the legal, economic and tax framework of the country in which they work.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe obligation to make one-off severance payments to employees of Austrian companies whose employment commenced after 31 December 2002 has been transferred to a defined contribution plan. The payments to this external employee fund are reported under personnel expenses.\n\n#### **Other provisions**\n\nThe other provisions reflect all recognisable legal or factual commitments to third parties based on past events, where the amount of the commitments and/or the precise starting point was still uncertain. In these cases, a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation is required. If a reliable estimate is not possible, a provision is not recognised. These provisions are recognised at the discounted settlement amount. They are measured based on the expected value or the amount most likely to be incurred.\n\nRisk-free interest rates are used for the discount rates. If the risks and uncertainties in cash flows cannot be taken into consideration adequately, an adapted discount rate is used.\n\nThe provisions for service anniversary bonuses required by collective wage and company agreements are measured using the same parameters as the provisions for pensions and similar obligations. A new regulation in the collective agreement for salaried employees of Austrian utility companies entitles salaried employees whose employment relationship began after 31 December 2009 to a service anniversary bonus equalling one month's salary after 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 years and to one-half month's salary after 40 years. This was taken into account accordingly. All remeasurements – at EVN, only gains and losses from changes in actuarial assumptions – involving service anniversary bonuses are recognised through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 19. The service cost added to the provision is reported under personnel expenses, while the interest component of the addition is included under financial results.\n\nWaste disposal and land restoration requirements resulting from legal and perceived commitments are recorded at the present value of the expected future costs. Changes in the estimated costs or the interest rate are offset against the carrying amount of the underlying asset. If the decrease in a provision exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the difference is recognised through profit or loss. The related depreciation is corrected in accordance with the residual carrying amount and depreciated over the remaining useful life. If the asset has reached the end of its useful life, all subsequent changes to the provisions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised at the amount of the unavoidable outflow of resources. This represents the lower of the amount that would result from performance of the contract and any compensatory payments to be made in the event of non-performance.\n\n#### **19. Liabilities**\n\nLiabilities are reported at amortised cost, with the exception of liabilities arising from derivative financial instruments or liabilities arising from hedge accounting (see note **9. Financial instruments).** Costs for the procurement of funds are considered part of amortised cost. Non-current liabilities are discounted by applying the effective interest method.\n\nWith respect to financial liabilities, bullet loans and borrowings with a remaining term to maturity of over one year are classified as noncurrent and items with a remaining term to maturity of less than one year are reported under current loans and borrowings (for information on maturities see note **50. Non-current loans and borrowings).**\n\nIf the fulfilment of a liability is expected within twelve months after the balance sheet date, the liability is classified as current. Network subsidies – which constitute payments made by customers to cover previous investments by EVN in the upstream network – represent an offset to the acquisition cost of these assets. In the electricity and natural gas network business, they are related to supply obligations by EVN. The granting of investment subsidies generally requires an operational management structure that complies with legal requirements and has been approved by the authorities.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nNetwork and investment subsidies represent an offset to the acquisition or production cost of the related asset and, in accordance with the application of IAS 20 and IFRS 15, are recognised as liabilities. Network and investment subsidies are released on a straight-line basis over the average useful life of the respective assets. The release of network subsidies from the regulated business is reported under other operating income, while comparable items from the non-regulated business are reported under revenue (also see notes **2. Reporting in accordance with IFRS** and **20. Revenue recognition).**\n\nA contract liability must be reported when consideration (e. g. a prepayment) has been transferred by the customer and the company has not yet provided goods or services. In the EVN Group, this generally takes place in connection with prepayments from the international project business.\n\n#### **20. Revenue recognition**\n\nIFRS 15 provides a five-step model for the recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. Under this model, revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control over a good or service is transferred to the customer. A determination must therefore be made when a contract is concluded as to whether the resulting revenue should be recognised at a specific point in time or over time.\n\nRevenue in the EVN Group results primarily from the sale (energy deliveries) and distribution (network utilisation/network services) of electricity, natural gas, heat and water to industrial, household and commercial customers. The EVN Group also generates revenue from waste utilisation, telecommunications and the international project business. The provision of goods and services by the EVN Group generally takes place over a specific time period, and revenue is therefore recognised over time.\n\nThe major services are described below:\n\n#### **Energy deliveries**\n\nRevenue results primarily from the transfer of electricity, natural gas, heat and water. Since the customer uses these services as they are provided, revenue is recognised over time. Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the services provided and entitled to be invoiced by EVN. In particular for household customers who only receive one invoice per year, the variable consideration is determined by extrapolating the energy consumption based on usage profiles and current temperature trends. The payment terms for energy deliveries generally represent 14 days. There is no significant financing component.\n\n#### **Network utilisation and services**\n\nEVN supplies electricity, natural gas, heat and water to its customers within the framework of network usage. The related performance obligation lies, above all, in the continuous provision and availability of energy through the network infrastructure. Revenue from these services is also recognised over time and when the services are provided, as described above. The payment terms for network usage generally represent 14 days. There is no significant financing component.\n\nNetwork subsidies constitute payments made by customers to cover previous investments by EVN in the upstream network, to the extent they represent compensation for granting usage or purchase rights. Network subsidies in the regulated electricity and natural gas business, where the regulator determines the amount and underlying reason, are recognised as liabilities in accordance with IAS 20 and reported, as in the past, under other operating income as income from the reversal of deferred income from network subsidies. The network subsidies for all other areas are recorded as non-refundable advance payments (liabilities) in accordance with IFRS 15 and have been released to profit or loss under other revenue since 2018/19 (also see note **2. Reporting in accordance with IFRS).**\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **International project business**\n\nRevenue from the international project business is also recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method as defined by IFRS 15. Projects are characterised by individual contract conditions with fixed prices and payments which follow a fixed schedule. If the construction services provided exceed the amount of the payment, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments are higher than the construction services provided, a contract liability is recorded. The percentage of completion is determined by the cost-to-cost method, which calls for the recognition of revenue and contract results in relation to actually incurred production costs as a per cent of the expected total costs. Reliable estimates of the total costs for the contracts, selling prices and incurred costs are available. Any changes in the estimated total contract costs and possible resulting losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period incurred. The technological and financial risks which could occur during the remaining term of a project are included through individual estimates and an appropriate amount is added to the expected total costs. Impending losses from the valuation of projects not yet invoiced are expensed immediately. These losses are realised when it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed the contract revenue. In the case that customers terminate the contract for reasons other than the non-fulfilment of the service promised by the company, EVN has a legal claim that at least the expenses incurred plus the lost profit margin will be reimbursed.\n\n#### **Other**\n\nEVN also generates revenue from telecommunications, waste utilisation and energy services. Most of the related contracts include services which are consumed by the customer as they are provided, and this revenue is also recognised over time. Revenue from waste utilisation is recognised at a point in time.\n\nInterest income is recorded pro rata temporis using the effective interest rate applicable to the particular asset. Dividends are recognised when a legal entitlement to payment arises.\n\nThe costs for obtaining contracts are expensed as incurred if the amortisation period for the related asset equals one year or less. Significant financing components are not included when the period between the transfer to the customer of the promised good or service and payment by the customer is less than one year.\n\n#### **Significant judgments related to revenue recognition**\n\nConsumption-based fees for energy deliveries and network utilisation represent variable consideration, which is determined according to the expected value method defined by IFRS 15.53a. Meter-reading dates are spread over the entire year, especially for household customers with rolling invoices. The volumes of energy consumed during the period between the last meter-reading and the balance sheet date must be extrapolated with statistical methods and therefore estimated. The procedure used by EVN assigns each customer to a standard consumption profile in the form of an annual consumption curve for electricity and/or natural gas and extrapolates each customer individually.\n\nIn the international project business, the percentage of completion is decisive for the recognition of revenue. Progress on the respective projects is determined by an input-based method (cost-to-cost method). This method requires numerous estimates and judgmental decisions, above all for the identification of incurred costs, total contract costs and realisable contract revenue as well as the related contract risks (technical, political and financial risks). These estimates are reviewed regularly and adjusted if necessary.\n\n#### **21. Income taxes and deferred taxes**\n\nThe income tax expense reported in the consolidated statement of operations comprises the current income tax expense for fully consolidated companies, which is based on their taxable income and the applicable income tax rate, as well as the change in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following income tax rates were applied in calculating current income taxes:\n\n| Corporate income tax rates |           |           |\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| %                          | 2022/23   | 2021/22   |\n| Country of residence       |           |           |\n| Austria                    | 24.0      | 25.0      |\n| Albania                    | 15.0      | 15.0      |\n| Bulgaria                   | 10.0      | 10.0      |\n| Germany1)                  | 31.2–32.6 | 31.2–32.6 |\n| Croatia                    | 18.0      | 18.0      |\n| Kuwait                     | 15.0      | 15.0      |\n| Lithuania                  | 15.0      | 15.0      |\n| North Macedonia            | 10.0      | 10.0      |\n| Montenegro                 | 9.0       | 9.0       |\n| Poland                     | 19.0      | 19.0      |\n| Romania                    | 16.0      | 16.0      |\n| Russia                     | 20.0      | 20.0      |\n| Slovenia                   | 19.0      | 19.0      |\n| Czech Republic             | 19.0      | 19.0      |\n| Cyprus                     | 12.5      | 12.5      |\n\n1) The tax rate varies slightly depending on the applicable assessment rate for trade tax.\n\nEVN utilised the corporate tax group option as of 30 September 2023. EVN AG is a member of a participation entity with NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH as the majority participating company and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH as the minority participating company. A group and tax settlement contract was concluded for this purpose. EVN also has the right to designate other corporate entities as members of this tax group.\n\nThe taxable profit of the companies belonging to this group is attributable to EVN AG, which calculates combined results based on the attributed taxable profit. The contract calls for the payment of a positive tax charge, when the aggregated results are positive. As in the previous year, the positive aggregated tax result is based on the allocation method. If the aggregated results are negative, the tax losses are kept on record and offset against future positive results. The related disclosures are reported under income taxes. The transfer of losses from foreign subsidiaries within group taxation leads to the recognition of a liability equal to the nominal amount of the future corporate income tax obligation.\n\nAs an offset for the transferred taxable results, the tax group contracts include a tax charge that is based on the stand-alone method. Transferred tax losses are kept on record as internal loss carryforwards for the respective tax group members and offset against future positive earnings. An exception to this procedure is the contract concluded with Burgenland Holding, which calls for a negative tax charge for this company if its taxable results are negative and the group's total results are positive. In other cases, the loss is recorded as an internal loss carryforward and refunded in later years in the form of a negative tax charge as soon as it is covered by positive earnings.\n\nFuture changes in the tax rate are taken into account if the relevant law has been enacted by the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. The eco-social tax reform adopted in the 2021/22 financial year, which will reduce the corporate income tax rate by one percentage point to 23% from 2024, is therefore taken into account in the measurement of deferred taxes. These changes were reflected in the valuation of deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are calculated according to the liability method at the tax rate expected when short-term differences are reversed. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are calculated and recognised for all temporary differences (i. e. the difference between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the annual financial statements prepared for tax purposes that will balance out in the future).\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable income or taxable temporary differences to utilise these items. Tax loss carryforwards are recognised as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented as a net amount in the consolidated financial statements if there is a legal right and intention to offset these items.\n\n#### **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests**\n\nEVN carries out its impairment tests in accordance with the rules defined by IAS 36. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment when there are internal or external indications of a loss in value. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are tested at least once each year for signs of impairment.\n\nThe impairment testing of goodwill and assets for which no expected future cash flows can be identified is based on an assessment of the respective cash-generating unit (CGU). The decisive criterion used by EVN to classify a generation unit as a CGU is the technical and commercial ability to generate independent revenue. In the EVN Group, this definition applies to the electricity and heat generation plants, electricity, natural gas and water distribution systems, electricity procurement rights, telecommunications networks and facilities in the environmental services business.\n\nThe value in use is calculated in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. Due to the long-term nature of investments in infrastructure assets, EVN uses cash flow projections that correspond to the economic useful life of the respective assets. Impairment tests for hydropower plants are generally based on the assumption that the concession will be reissued and therefore that the respective sites will exist indefinitely. After a detailed planning period of seven years (previous year: four years), a rough planning period follows for infrastructure facilities/long-term projects until the end of the economic useful life, albeit limited to the period in which external electricity price forecasts are available (currently 2050). As the period of the medium-term planning calculations approved by management was aligned with the Strategy 2030 in the 2022/23 financial year, the detailed planning period was also adjusted to seven years.\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal is basically calculated in accordance with the fair value measurement hierarchy defined in IFRS 13. Since it is generally not possible to derive market values for the CGUs and assets of EVN under evaluation, the fair value is estimated in accordance with Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value less costs of disposal for a CGU is calculated with a WACC-based discounted cash flow method, which is conceptually similar to the value in use procedure, but includes adjustments to the parameters in the DCF model to reflect a market participant's viewpoint.\n\nThe calculation of the fair value less disposal costs and the value in use is based on the future cash inflows and outflows which are basically derived from internal medium-term forecasts. The cash flow forecasts are based on the latest financial plans approved by management. The underlying assumptions also take climate-related effects into consideration. The assumptions for the future development of electricity prices are derived from the quotations on the futures market of the European Energy Exchange AG, Leipzig, Germany. For the period extending beyond this time, an average is developed from the forecasts issued by two well-known information service providers in the energy sector. Several scenarios are used for averaging. In this way, the risks that may influence electricity prices in the future are taken into account comprehensively.\n\nA weighted average cost of capital which includes the deduction of income tax (WACC) is used as the discount rate. The equity component of the WACC reflects the risk-free interest rate, a country-specific premium plus a risk premium that incorporates the market risk premium and an appropriate beta coefficient based on peer group capital market indicators. The debt component of the WACC equals the basis interest rate plus a country-specific premium and a rating dependent risk premium. The equity and debt components are weighted according to a capital structure that is appropriate for the CGU based on peer group data at market values. The resulting WACC is used to discount the cash flows in the respective CGU.\n\nFor the purpose of estimating the recoverable amount, EVN initially assesses the value in use. In cases where this amount is lower than the carrying amount of the asset, or the CGU, the fair value less costs of disposal is calculated if necessary.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **23. Accounting estimates and forward-looking statements**\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted IFRS accounting methods requires estimates and assumptions that have an effect on the assets, liabilities, income and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements and on the amounts shown in the notes. The actual values may differ from these estimates. The assumptions and estimates are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nIn particular, the following assumptions and estimates can lead to significant adjustments in the carrying amounts of individual assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\nIn the international project business, changes in estimates for the progress on major projects can have a material effect. These estimates are particularly relevant for the large-scale project in Kuwait (construction of a wastewater treatment plant and corresponding sewage network) and the large-scale project in Bahrain (expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant and contruction of a sewage sludge utilisation plant). Revenue is recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method (see notes **20. Revenue recognition** and **25. Revenue).**\n\nImpairment tests require estimates, especially for future cash surpluses. A change in the general economic, industry or company environment may reduce cash surpluses and therefore lead to signs of impairment. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used to determine the recoverable amounts based on capital market methods. The WACC represents the weighted average interest paid by a company for equity and debt. The weighting applied to the interest on the equity and debt components – which reflects a capital structure at market values – was derived from an appropriate peer group. Given the current volatility on the financial markets, the development of the cost of capital (and above all the country risk premiums) is monitored on a regular basis (see note **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests).**\n\nFor the valuation of the generation portfolio, the price structure beginning with the fifth year (when predictable market prices are no longer available on the electricity exchanges) was based on average forecasts from two well-known market research institutes and information service providers in the energy sector. The most recent studies, which are updated annually due to the current volatility on the electricity markets, were used in each case. The following notes show the sensitivity of these assumptions for the largest CGUs, based on the carrying amount, where a triggering event was identified and for which an impairment loss or reversal was recognised in the financial statements: **35. Intangible assets, 36. Property, plant and equipment** and **37. Investments in equity accounted investees.**\n\nThe most important premises and judgmental decisions used to determine the scope of consolidation are described under notes **4. Scope of consolidation** and **38. Other investments.**\n\nWTE constructed a wastewater treatment plant in Budva, Republic of Montenegro, with a contract value of EUR 58.5m. The customer, the municipality of Budva, subsequently failed to meet its payment obligations to WTE. Following the issue of reminders and an extension period, WTE cancelled the investment contract in May 2018 but operations were temporarily continued as a goodwill gesture by WTE. All efforts by WTE to reach an agreement on the outstanding payments failed due to a lack of cooperation by the municipality of Budva; in particular, the joint commission installed for this purpose was unable to deliver any results due to a lack of cooperation by the municipality of Budva. In December 2019, WTE therefore called the guarantee issued by the Republic of Montenegro (EUR 29.3m) and the municipality of Budva (EUR 64.6m). The Republic of Montenegro met its payment obligation, but the municipality of Budva refused to make payment. WTE terminated its operation of the plant at the end of January 2020 after multiple notifications and transferred these operations to the municipality of Budva. WTE filed an arbitration action in Frankfurt against the municipality of Budva for failure to honour the guarantee; the value in dispute equalled EUR 37.9m, including interest. The court of arbitration issued a decision in favour of WTE at the beginning of October 2023. The municipality of Budva must therefore honour the guarantee provided to WTE. Moreover, WTE filed an arbitration action in Geneva in spring 2021 against the municipality of Budva for non-fulfilment of the investment contract. The outcome of these proceedings can lead to valuation adjustments in future periods (also see note **61. Risk management).**\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe valuation of the provisions for pensions, pension-related obligations and severance payments are based on assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age and life expectancy as well as pension and salary increases. The adjustment of these parameters in future periods can lead to valuation adjustments. Moreover, future changes in electricity and natural gas tariffs can lead to valuation adjustments in the pension-related obligations (see note **52. Non-current provisions).**\n\nAssumptions and estimates are also required to determine the useful life of non-current assets (see notes **6. Intangible assets** and **7. Property, plant and equipment),** and the provisions for legal proceedings and environmental protection (see note **18. Provisions)** as well as estimates for other obligations and risks (see note **65. Other obligations and risks).** In addition, it is necessary to make assumptions and estimates for the valuation of receivables and inventories (see notes **12. Inventories** and **13. Trade and other receivables)** and for the recognition of revenue (see note **20. Revenue recognition),** as well for the usability of tax carry forwards (see note **51. Deferred taxes).** These estimates are based on historical data and other assumptions considered appropriate under the given circumstances.\n\n#### **Information on climate change**\n\nAs an energy and environmental services provider, EVN is committed to making a concrete contribution to climate protection. The company's strategic considerations include the special requirements created by the energy transformation and the far-reaching changes required by this transformation towards climate neutrality as well as the related effects on all sectors of the economy and on private households. Analyses in this context place a special focus on the requirements for climate protection, possible implementation tracks and the implications for the company's business model. These elements create an important basis for evaluating the opportunities and risks for our business resulting, from climate change and the related, rapidly changing regulations.\n\nEVN terminated electricity generation from hard coal in 2020/21. In summer 2021, the company joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and, in this connection, set five reduction goals for its activities. The EVN Climate Initiative \"EVN for the climate\" was launched in 2020/21 to realise these goals. It includes three focal points: the concrete reduction of CO₂ emissions, climate neutrality in selected group companies, and a contribution by EVN's research and development to climate protection. Success in this area will make an important contribution to realising the climate goal agreed in Paris to limit global warming to clearly below 2°C.\n\nThe majority of EVN's assets are subject to unpredictable weather conditions due to the generation and transmission or distribution technologies in use. This applies, in particular, to the in part exposed generation infrastructure (hydropower and wind power plants, photovoltaic equipment) and also to the transmission and distribution infrastructure. Climate changes can have a lasting influence on the hydropower, wind power and photovoltaic offering over the long term, which could lead to more extreme seasonal and annual deviations in generation. Changing climatic conditions can also lead to different demand-related behaviour. The declining demand for heating products will be accompanied by a greater demand for drinking water. In view of the high priority given to climate protection at EVN, potential climate risks are identified and assessed as part of the central risk management process. The active handling of risks can limit the effects on the company or support the conscious perception of opportunities for additional growth.\n\nThe impact of climate change on the recognition and valuation of assets and liabilities is evaluated at regular intervals. Climate-related earnings fluctuations – whether they result from production differences or changes in demand – are analysed with sensitivity and scenario calculations as part of the planning process and, after approval by management, transferred to the forecast calculations. The measures derived from the EVN Climate Initiative also flow into these calculations which, in total, form the basis for the impairment tests required by IAS 36 (see notes **22. Procedures and effects of impairment tests** and **36. Property, plant and equipment).** The risks arising from climate change are also included in the determination of the useful life of depreciable assets (see note **7. Property, plant and equipment),** the measurement of inventories (see note **12. Inventories)** and the recognition and measurement of provisions (see note **18. Provisions).** \n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CO₂ emissions from twelve of our electricity generation and heating supply plants are covered by the EU's emission rights trading scheme (EU-ETS). In accordance with the ETS, we needed 318,582 CO₂ emission certificates in the 2022/23 financial year. The emission certificates required for heat production in Austria were granted free of charge, and the remainder were purchased over the wholesale market (see notes **40. Inventories** and **57. Current provisions).** \n\n#### **Impact of the war in Ukraine**\n\nThe possible effects of the war in Ukraine were evaluated, in particular, with regard to the recoverability of assets as defined by IAS 36 and IFRS 9 and to further uncertainties connected with discretionary assessments.\n\nRussia's assault on Ukraine which began on 24 February 2022 has strained relations between the majority of the international community and the Russian Federation and led to a series of reciprocal sanctions by the EU as well as the Russian Federation. The result was a massive increase in the wholesale prices for electricity and primary energy, which have since stabilised at a level two- to three-times higher than before the crisis. Further developments are uncertain due to the tense situation and can bring an increase in energy prices at any time. Added reciprocal sanctions and/or a possible halt to gas deliveries by Russia could have a significant influence on the energy market and a negative effect on the macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe possible termination of gas deliveries by Russia could, depending on the timing and duration, have an impact on natural gas supplies for EVN's customers. The volume of non-Russian gas and strategic gas inventories were expanded in view of this possibility. Measures to support supply security are connected with higher costs and can have a negative influence on earnings in individual periods.\n\nThe volatile development of energy prices had a negative effect on earnings in the energy supply business. To protect energy supplies, EVN successively purchased natural gas supplies and concluded futures contracts for electricity. The decline in the market prices for electricity and natural gas subsequently led to negative valuation effects for the recorded natural gas inventories and derivative futures in 2022/23. Provisions were also required for contingent losses from onerous customer contracts (see note **30. Share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature).**\n\nAs a consequence of the political developments in Russia, EVN decided in the previous year to withdraw from this market and to sell the two combined heat and power plants in Moscow. The sale negotiations are currently in the approval process by the Russian government commission (see note **43. Assets and liabilities held for sale).**\n\n#### **Effects of the macroeconomic environment**\n\nEVN evaluated the recoverability of assets as defined by IAS 36 and IFRS 9 and further uncertainties connected with discretionary assessments against the backdrop of the current macroeconomic environment.\n\nEconomic developments have led to a higher number of insolvencies across Europe, especially after the expiration of government subsidy measures. These insolvencies are expected to have a negative effect on the macroeconomic environment and cause an increase in receivables defaults. The EVN Group has included the projected increase in potential default incidents through a forward-looking component, similar to the procedure followed in previous years.\n\nEVN determines the impairment losses for trade receivables in accordance with IFRS 9.B5.5.35 based on regionally differentiated analyses of historical default incidents. The inclusion of the forward-looking component led to an increase of EUR 5.0m in the impairment loss allowance for trade receivables (previous year: EUR 6.1m) (see the section on Credit and default risk under note **61. Risk management).**\n\nApart from price increases on the energy markets and the differing effects on EVN's activities and business fields, investments and operating expenses are also affected by the sharp rise in inflation. These cost increases can possibly only be passed on to customers with a delay. The current macroeconomic developments can also have a – direct and indirect – negative influence on the demand for energy and, together with rising costs, have a negative influence on earnings.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nLow net debt and a comfortable base of contractually committed, undrawn credit lines give EVN a constant, high degree of financial flexibility and solid liquidity reserves. The high energy prices in recent months had a substantial negative impact on earnings from energy supply, while renewable energy generation made a positive contribution to earnings. Stabilising effects were provided, above all, by EVN's integrated business model and widely diversified customer portfolio. The EVN Group can therefore be considered a going concern.\n\n#### **24. Principles of segment reporting**\n\nThe identification of operating segments is based on the internal organisational and reporting structure and information prepared for internal management decisions (the \"management approach\"). The Executive Board of the EVN Group (the chief operating decisionmaker as defined in IFRS 8) reviews internal management reports on each operating segment at least once each quarter. EVN has defined the following operating segments: Generation, Energy, Networks, South East Europe, Environment and All Other Segments. This conforms in full to the internal reporting structure. The assessment of all segment information is consistent with the IFRS. EBITDA is used as an indicator to measure the earning power of the individual segments. For each segment, EBITDA represents the total net operating profit or loss before interest, taxes, amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment for the companies included in the segment, taking intragroup income and expenses into account (see note **59. Notes to segment reporting).**\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Notes to the consolidated statement of operations\n\n#### **25. Revenue**\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of a good or service is transferred to the customer. The consideration is recognised in the amount that the company expects to receive in exchange for these goods or services.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, EVN generates other revenue from its ordinary business activities. This revenue is presented separately in the following table:\n\n| Revenue                               |         |         |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                  | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Revenue from contracts with customers | 3,662.9 | 3,995.3 |\n| Other revenue                         | 105.7   | 66.9    |\n| Total                                 | 3,768.7 | 4,062.2 |\n\nOther revenue includes valuation effects of EUR 73.7m (previous year: EUR 44.9m) related to energy derivatives which are attributable to the Energy Segment. Positive and negative results from the valuation of these derivatives are offset for reporting. In addition, EVN recognised operating lease revenue of EUR 32.2m in the 2022/23 financial year (previous year: EUR 22.1m).\n\nThe following table shows the revenue from contracts with customers classified by segment and product:\n\n| Revenue from contracts by segment and product |         |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                          | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Electricity                                   | 437.1   | 405.4   |\n| Natural gas                                   | 191.0   | 57.7    |\n| Heat                                          | 239.6   | 186.3   |\n| Other                                         | 42.4    | 34.3    |\n| Energy                                        | 910.1   | 683.7   |\n| Electricity                                   | 75.7    | 95.3    |\n| Other                                         | 57.0    | 64.2    |\n| Generation                                    | 132.8   | 159.5   |\n| Electricity                                   | 374.6   | 331.3   |\n| Natural gas                                   | 103.0   | 103.7   |\n| Other                                         | 86.8    | 82.2    |\n| Networks                                      | 564.5   | 517.3   |\n| Electricity                                   | 1,464.4 | 1,973.4 |\n| Natural gas                                   | 9.9     | 9.4     |\n| Heat                                          | 11.9    | 11.2    |\n| Other                                         | 13.4    | 8.4     |\n| South East Europe                             | 1,499.7 | 2,002.4 |\n| Environmental services                        | 525.3   | 604.3   |\n| Electricity                                   | 4.9     | 6.1     |\n| Heat                                          | 1.3     | 1.5     |\n| Environment                                   | 531.4   | 611.8   |\n| Other                                         | 24.5    | 20.6    |\n| All Other Segments                            | 24.5    | 20.6    |\n| Total                                         | 3,662.9 | 3,995.3 |\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN generally recognises revenue over time in its core business of energy supplies and deliveries as well as in the international project business. An exception to this practice is the recognition of revenue by EVN Wärmekraftwerke in connection with the thermal waste utilisation plant in Dürnrohr, where revenue is recognised at a specific point in time. The related revenue amounted to EUR 51.9m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 53.1m).\n\nSales revenues which are expected to be realised in future in connection with performance obligations and which have not yet been met or have only been partially met as of 30 September 2023, mainly relate to network subsidies and the international project business.\n\nIn total, the remaining performance obligations amount to EUR 942.5m (previous year: EUR 875.2m) at the balance sheet date. Of this amount, EUR 873.5m (previous year: EUR 812.4m) relates to performance obligations from the international project business. Revenue is recognised on the basis of the percentage of completion and will be recognised within the next five years, depending on the project. The performance obligations from network subsidies are shown in the following table:\n\n| Transaction prices allocated to remaining performance obligations |         |           |          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|----------|\n| 2022/23 financial year                                            |         |           |          |\n| EURm                                                              |         |           |          |\n|                                                                   | <1 year | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Network subsidies                                                 | 7.0     | 28.1      | 34.0     |\n| Total                                                             | 7.0     | 28.1      | 34.0     |\n|                                                                   |         |           |          |\n| 2021/22 financial year                                            |         |           |          |\n| EURm                                                              |         |           |          |\n|                                                                   | <1 year | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Network subsidies                                                 | 6.3     | 25.4      | 30.7     |\n| Total                                                             | 6.3     | 25.4      | 30.7     |\n\nEVN applies the practical expedient provided by IFRS 15.B16 when the respective requirements are met and recognises revenue at the amount it is entitled to invoice. Moreover, contracts for electricity and natural gas deliveries as well as contracts for network utilisation in the household customer business are concluded for an indefinite period. The customer has a unilateral right to terminate the contracts at any time. As a result, EVN does not have a contractual right to transfer the related performance obligations or to receive consideration.

The threshold for the calculation of surplus proceeds was set at EUR 140 per MWh up to 31 May 2023 but reduced to EUR 120 per MWh from 1 June 2023 up to the expiration date on 31 December 2023. The threshold can be increased up to EUR 176 per MWh, respectively EUR 156 per MWh based on the inclusion of allowable investments in renewable energies and energy efficiency measures. A levy to moderate the energy and price crisis was also introduced in North Macedonia during 2022/23, whereby this solidarity tax for companies in North Macedonia was only collected once.\n\nThis levy on surplus proceeds from electricity generation in Austria and the solidarity tax in North Macedonia were reflected in the recognition of expenses totalling EUR 31.2m.\n\nThe increase in business operation taxes and duties resulted primarily from the levy on surplus proceeds from electricity generation in Austria and the solidarity tax in North Macedonia. In addition, provisions were recognised for tax audits in South East Europe.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe position legal and consulting fees, expenses related to process risks also contains the change in the provision for process costs and risks. The item rents includes non-capitalised rental expenses (see note **36. Property, plant and equipment)** as well as changes in provisions for rents for network access in Bulgaria. In addition, expenses which are not under the scope of IFRS 16 are also included.\n\nThe decline in receivables write-offs resulted mainly from a reduction in the balance of receivables in North Macedonia. As in previous years, a forward-looking component was included in 2022/23 to reflect expected future receivables defaults (see note **61. Risk management).**\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses include environmental protection expenses, fees for monetary transactions, licenses, membership fees and administrative and office expenses.\n\n#### **30.

The consolidated financial statements do not include any equity-accounted companies of a financial nature.\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature consists primarily of earnings contributions, impairment losses recognised to assets capitalised in connection with acquisitions and other necessary impairment losses and write-ups (see note **37. Investments in equity accounted investees).**\n\nThe share of results from equity accounted investees with operational nature decreased to EUR –67.6m in financial year 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 98.9m).

The interest expense on liabilities not designated at fair value through profit or loss totalled EUR 46.9m (previous year: EUR 33.8m).\n\nThe increase in the financial result was mainly due to the dividend payment by Verbund AG in the amount of EUR 158.0m.\n\n#### **33.

The effective tax rate is a weighted average of the effective local income tax rates of all consolidated subsidiaries (see note **51. Deferred taxes).**\n\n#### **34. Earnings per share**\n\nEarnings per share were calculated by dividing Group net result (= proportional share of net result attributable to EVN AG shareholders) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding in 2022/23, i. e. 178,225,093 (previous year: 178,187,472) (see note **48. Treasury shares).** This amount may be diluted by so-called potential shares arising from stock options or convertible bonds. Since EVN does not have any such shares, there is no difference between basic and diluted earnings per share. Based on the Group net result of EUR 529.7m for the 2022/23 financial year (previous year: EUR 209.6m), earnings per share equalled EUR 2.97 (previous year: EUR 1.18).\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Notes to the consolidated statement of financial position\n\n## Assets\n\n#### **35.

There was no maximum amount mortgage as of 30 September 2023.\n\nAs in the previous year, no property, plant and equipment or intangible assets were pledged as collateral as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe impairment testing of assets in accordance with IAS 36 led to the recognition of the following impairment losses and write-ups in 2022/23:\n\nVarious heating plants attributable to EVN Wärme in the Energy Segment were tested for impairment due to a deterioration in the economic environment during 2022/23. The related calculations led to the recognition of impairment losses totalling EUR 5.7m to three plants and to revaluations of EUR 1.6m to six plants. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of the value in use and amounted to EUR 23.9m. A WACC after tax ranging from 5.51% to 5.66% was used as the discount rate, which corresponds to an iteratively derived pre-tax WACC of 6.50% to 9.05%.\n\nA building used for operations by EVN Wasser was tested for impairment in 2013/14 following the unscheduled shutdown of a wellfield. The construction and commissioning of a natural filter plant in this operating building led to a revaluation with recognition to profit or loss of EUR 1.6m to the depreciated cost in 2022/23.\n\n#### **EVN as the lessee**\n\nThe most important application area for the EVN Group is formed by lease and easement agreements, as well as leased commercial and warehouse space which are assumed to be based on long-term leases. Rights of use totalling EUR 95.6m (previous year: EUR 74.0m) were contrasted by lease liabilities with a present value of EUR 80.2m (previous year: EUR 61.8m) as of 30 September 2023. The short-term portion of the lease liabilities equalled EUR 8.8m (previous year: EUR 6.4m).\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with subsequent measurement, the rights of use are amortised on a systematic basis over the shorter of the useful life and the remaining term of the lease. The conclusion of new agreements and the recognition of changes in estimates and modifications in 2022/23 led to an addition of EUR 28.6m (previous year: EUR 12.0m). Rights of use from lease agreements are reported as part of property, plant and equipment in accordance with IFRS 16; the development and amortisation of these rights of use are allocated to the following asset classes:\n\n| 2022/23 financial year<br>EURm       | Land and<br>buildings | Lines | Technical<br>equipment | Other plants,<br>tools and<br>equipment | Total |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|\n| Rights of use 30.09.2022             | 58.4                  | 14.8  | 0.3                    | 0.5                                     | 74.0  |\n| Additions                            | 24.2                  | 3.5   | –                      | 1.1                                     | 28.7  |\n| Scheduled depreciation               | –6.5                  | –0.6  | –0.3                   | –0.4                                    | –7.7  |\n| Disposals                            | –0.7                  | –     | –                      | –                                       | –0.7  |\n| Transfers                            | –0.1                  | –     | 0.2                    | –0.1                                    | –     |\n| Change in the scope of consolidation | 1.2                   | –     | –                      | –                                       | 1.3   |\n| Rights of use 30.09.2023             | 76.5                  | 17.7  | 0.1                    | 1.3                                     | 95.6  |\n\n| 2021/22 financial year<br>EURm | Land and<br>buildings | Lines | Technical<br>equipment | Other plants,<br>tools and<br>equipment | Total |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|\n| Rights of use 30.09.2021       | 55.8                  | 11.4  | 1.0                    | 0.4                                     | 68.6  |\n| Additions                      | 7.4                   | 3.9   | 0.4                    | 0.4                                     | 12.0  |\n| Scheduled depreciation         | -4.9                  | -0.5  | -1.0                   | -0.2                                    | -6.6  |\n| Rights of use 30.09.2022       | 58.4                  | 14.8  | 0.3                    | 0.5                                     | 74.0  |\n\nThe determination of the rights of use and corresponding lease liabilities includes all sufficiently probable cash outflows. The cash outflows from leases totalled EUR 19.9m (previous year: EUR 14.0m) in 2022/23. The consolidated statement of operations contains EUR 3.4m (previous year: EUR 2.5m) of expenses from unrecognised leases, which include expenses from low-value leases, expenses from short-term leases (less than twelve months) and expenses from variable lease payments that were not included in the lease liability. The interest expense for lease liabilities totalled EUR 1.3m (previous year: EUR 0.6m) in 2022/23. The difference between the cash outflows presented here and the payments for lease liabilities resulted primarily from advance rental payments made in 2022/23. These advance payments are not reported under cash flow from financing activities because they are not related to lease liabilities; they are instead included under cash flow from investing activities.\n\n#### **37. Investments in equity accounted investees**\n\nThe companies included in the consolidated financial statements at equity are listed in the notes under **EVN's investments** starting on page 115. Note **64. Disclosures of interests in other entities** contains financial information on joint ventures and associates that are included at equity in EVN's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll investments in equity accounted investees were recognised at their proportional share of IFRS income or loss based on an interim or annual report with a balance sheet date that does not precede the balance sheet date of EVN by more than three months. There were no listed market prices for the investments in equity accounted investees included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Reconciliation of investments in equity accounted investees |          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 2022/23 financial year<br>EURm                              |          |\n| Gross value 30.09.2022                                      | 968.3    |\n| Additions                                                   | 329.6    |\n| Disposals                                                   | -5.8     |\n| Gross value 30.09.2023                                      | 1,292.2  |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2022                         | 1,419.7  |\n| Currency translation differences                            | -2.5     |\n| Change in the scope of consolidation                        | 0.9      |\n| Revaluation                                                 | 11.1     |\n| Proportional share of results                               | -78.7    |\n| Dividends                                                   | -105.3   |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income            | -1,434.0 |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2023                         | -188.9   |\n| Net value 30.09.2022                                        | 2,388.0  |\n| Net value 30.09.2023                                        | 1,103.4  |\n\n| 2021/22 financial year                           |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| EURm                                             |         |\n| Gross value 30.09.2021                           | 918.3   |\n| Additions                                        | 50.0    |\n| Gross value 30.09.2022                           | 968.3   |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2021              | 659.2   |\n| Currency translation differences                 | 3.8     |\n| Proportional share of results                    | 98.9    |\n| Dividends                                        | -152.6  |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income | 810.3   |\n| Accumulated amortisation 30.09.2022              | 1,419.7 |\n| Net value 30.09.2021                             | 1,577.5 |\n| Net value 30.09.2022                             | 2,388.0 |\n\nTo protect energy supplies, EVN KG continuously purchased natural gas supplies and concluded futures contracts for electricity. The decline in the market prices for electricity and natural gas subsequently led to negative valuation effects for the recognised natural gas inventories and derivative futures. Provisions were also required for contingent losses from onerous customer contracts. EVN injected new capital to cover the company's losses and ensure its operational capability. The subsidies to EVN KG totalled EUR 318.4m in 2022/23. The at equity carrying amount of EVN KG equalled EUR 0.0m as of 30 September 2023. Value adjustments of EUR 16.9m could not be recorded directly in equity because the at equity carrying amount would then have been negative.\n\nA capital contribution of EUR 8.6m was provided to EnergieAllianz in 2022/23. The at equity carrying amount of EnergieAllianz equalled EUR 0.0m as of 30 September 2023. Value adjustments of EUR 34.1m were not recognised because the carrying amount would then have been negative.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nEVN-ECOWIND Sonnenstromerzeugungs GmbH was included in the consolidated financial statements of EVN AG for the first time in 2022/23. This resulted in the recognition of a EUR 0.5m addition (also see **4. Scope of consolidation).** A shareholder contribution of EUR 2.2m was also made to EVN-ECOWIND.\n\nThe disposals resulted from the transferral of the \"sales and energy-related services\" business unit from EVN KG and to changes in the scope of consolidation in connection with s2e and Biowärme Amstetten-West GmbH (also see note **4. Scope of consolidation).** \n\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted investees, excluding additions and disposals, declined by EUR 1,620.1m in 2022/23. These changes resulted chiefly from adjustments of EUR –1,445.2m to the fair value of derivative financial instruments in the energy business which are designated as cash flow hedges and related to the investments in EVN KG and EnergieAllianz and also included an earnings contribution of EUR –240.3m from EVN KG.\n\n#### **38. Other investments**\n\nThe item other investments includes holdings in affiliates and associates, which are not consolidated due to immateriality, as well as miscellaneous stakes of less than 20.0% that were not included at equity.\n\nThe shares in affiliates and associates which are not consolidated due to immateriality are measured at cost less any necessary impairment losses and totalled EUR 7.0m in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 6.2m). The other investments classified as FVOCI consist primarily of shares in Verbund AG with a value of EUR 3,381.1m (previous year: EUR 3,837.5m) and miscellaneous other investments of EUR 167.4m (previous year: EUR 190.9m). The valuation adjustments were recorded under other comprehensive income, the dividends were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations (also see note **32. Financial results).** \n\nEVN AG and Wiener Stadtwerke Holding AG entered into an agreement on 22 September 2010 for the syndication of their directly and indirectly held shareholdings in Verbund AG. This agreement gives the two companies joint control over approximately 26% of the voting shares in Verbund AG. In spite of the syndicate agreement, the scope of possible influence over the financial and business policies of Verbund AG is very limited. The requirements for classification as a controlling influence (IAS 28) are therefore not met and the shares in Verbund AG are therefore accounted by applying IFRS 9.\n\nThe valuation of the investment in Verbund Hydro Power AG in 2022/23 based on the discounted cash flow method resulted in an impairment loss of EUR 26.2m in the Generation Segment. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (Level 3 according to IFRS 13) and amounted to EUR 132.8m. A WACC after tax of 5.54% was used as the discount rate. The present value model underlying the valuation is based on publicly available information from the annual financial statements and, according to available data for electricity prices, forecasts the development of the years up to 2050 and a perpetual yield without a growth rate.\n\nIn the Networks Segment, the valuation of the investment in AGGM Austrian Gas Grid Management AG based on the discounted cash flow method resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss of EUR 1.3m. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (Level 3 according to IFRS 13) and amounted to EUR 3.0m. A WACC after tax of 4.90% was used as the discount rate. The present value model underlying the valuation is based on a perpetual yield without a growth rate which, in turn, was developed from the average trend of data from the publicly available annual financial statements for 2019–2022 and a forecast for the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn the All Other Segments, the valuation of the investment in Wiener Börse AG based on the discounted cash flow method resulted in an impairment loss of EUR 0.2m in 2022/23. The recoverable amount was determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell (Level 3 according to IFRS 13) and amounted to EUR 30.5m. A WACC after tax of 6.47% was used as the discount rate. The present value model underlying the valuation includes forecasted distributions for the coming year as well as a perpetual yield without a growth rate.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **39.

The carrying amounts correspond to the fair value as of the balance sheet date.\n\nLease receivables relate to project business in connection with PPP-projects. The decline in the fiscal year is mainly due to the contractually agreed redemption payments.\n\nThe reconciliation of the future minimum lease payments to their present value is as follows:\n\n#### **Terms to maturity of non-current lease receivables** EURm\n\n|          | Remaining term to maturity as of 30.09.2023 |                        |       |  | Remaining term to maturity as of 30.09.2022 |                        |       |  |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------|--|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------|--|\n|          | Principal<br>components                     | Interest<br>components | Total |  | Principal<br>components                     | Interest<br>components | Total |  |\n| <5 years | 8.9                                         | 0.7                    | 9.6   |  | 7.6                                         | 0.5                    | 8.2   |  |\n| >5 years | 1.2                                         | 0.1                    | 1.3   |  | 5.0                                         | 0.1                    | 5.1   |  |\n| Total    | 10.1                                        | 0.8                    | 10.9  |  | 12.7                                        | 0.6                    | 13.3  |  |\n\nThe total of the principal components corresponds to the capitalised value of the lease receivables. The interest components correspond to the proportionate share of the interest component of the total lease payment and do not represent discounted amounts. The interest components of the lease payments in 2022/23 were reported as interest income on non-current assets.\n\nReceivables and other assets include claims from trade receivables in North Macedonia that are reported under non-current assets as a result of instalment plan agreements. In addition, non-current receivables from the Bulgarian Post in the amount of EUR 16.4m are included for the first time in the 2022/23 financial year.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nContract costs represent the costs for obtaining contracts, as defined in IFRS 15.91, and are related to the international project business. Contract costs totalling EUR 86.7m were capitalised in financial year 2019/20 and will be amortised on a systematic basis in line with the expected timing of the contract on which the costs are based and depending on how the goods or services are transferred to the customer. Therefore, the original depreciation period is between 2.5 years and 4 years. As a result of the current depreciation of EUR 20.6m (previous year: EUR 20.6m) in the financial year 2022/23, the book value decreased to EUR 15.5m (see note **31. Depreciation and amortisation and effects from impairment tests).**\n\n#### **Current assets**\n\n#### **40. Inventories**\n\n| Inventories<br>EURm                                        | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Primary energy inventories                                 | 67.6       | 120.0      |\n| CO2 emission certificates                                  | 13.6       | 16.9       |\n| Raw materials, supplies, consumables and other inventories | 47.8       | 62.3       |\n| Customer orders not yet invoiced                           | 8.8        | 7.6        |\n| Total                                                      | 137.7      | 206.8      |\n\nPrimary energy inventories consist primarily of natural gas. Gas inventories totalled EUR 61.0m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 117.2m).\n\nPart of the natural gas inventories are measured according to the broker-trader exception because they are held exclusively for trading. Consequently, these natural gas inventories are measured at fair value (Level 1) less costs to sell. The fair value of the inventories held for trading totalled EUR 48.1m (previous year: EUR 0.1m) as of 30 September 2023. Negative changes in the market value resulted in a revaluation through profit or loss of EUR –10.5m (previous year: EUR 0.1m) as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe CO2 emission certificates relate exclusively to certificates purchased to fulfil the requirements of the Austrian Emission Certificate Act and which have not yet been used. The corresponding obligation for any shortfall in the certificates is reported under current provisions (see note **57. Current provisions).** \n\nValuation allowances of EUR 0.9m were recognised to inventories in 2022/23 (previous year: EUR 0.7m) and were contrasted by revaluations of EUR 0.2m (previous year: EUR 0.1m). The inventories are not subject to any restrictions on disposal or other encumbrances.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **41.

Notes to impairment losses and default risks for trade receivables can be found in note **61. Risk management.** \n\nReceivables from investments in equity accounted investees and receivables from non-consolidated subsidiaries arise primarily from intragroup transactions related to energy supplies as well as Group financing and services provided to those companies.\n\nThe receivables arising from derivative transactions consist of the positive market values of derivatives in the energy business. Other receivables and assets include, among others, receivables from insurance and short-term loans receivable, as well as security retained in the international project business. The developement in contract assets resulted primarily from contract orders in the international project business. In 2022/23, as in the previous year, no impairments were recognised in connection with contract assets.\n\nAs of 30 September 2023, as in the previous year, no receivables were pledged as collateral for EVN's own liabilities.\n\n#### **42.

The time deposits reported under this item have a maturity of more than three months.\n\nThe item restricted cash includes bank balances that have been pledged and are therefore not available for general use by the Group.\n\n#### **43. Assets and liabilities held for sale**\n\nEVN, together with its two fully consolidated subsidiaries OOO EVN Umwelt Service and OOO EVN Umwelt, operates two sludge-fired combined heat and power plants in Moscow. These plants are allocated to the Environment Segment. The war in Ukraine has had a negative influence on relations between the majority of the international community of states and the Russian Federation, and the risk of the orderly continuation of business operations in Russia is more difficult to calculate. In view of these developments, EVN evaluated possible exit scenarios and decided to sell the companies. EVN generally assumed that the sale would take place in the 2022/23 financial year, but there were unexpected delays due to additional requirements and bureaucratic hurdles. The agreement with the buyer was already reached in the first quarter of the 2022/23 financial year, but the mandatory approval of the Russian government commission has not yet been granted. EVN fulfills all of the prescribed requirements for the sale of the companies and expects the formal approval of the Russian government commission to be granted within the next twelve months. The assets and liabilities connected with this disposal group are therefore classified as current as of 30 September 2023 in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\nAs of 30 September 2022, other operating expenses included impairment losses of EUR 1.8m. In addition, impairment losses to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were combined into a minor sum of less than EUR 0.1m. A comparison of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell for the disposal group led to a revaluation of EUR 0.4m as of 30 September 2023.\n\nOther comprehensive income includes cumulative expenses connected with the disposal group. The difference from currency translation equalled EUR –5.4m (previous year: EUR –1.5m) as of 30 September 2023.\n\nThe disposal group was measured at fair value less costs to sell as of 30 September 2023 and contains the following assets and liabilities:\n\n| Assets and liabilities held for sale<br>EURm | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current assets                               | 5.8        | 9.3        |\n| Assets held for sale                         | 5.8        | 9.3        |\n| Non-current liabilities                      | -          | 0.5        |\n| Current liabilities                          | 0.4        | 0.8        |\n| Liabilities held for sale                    | 0.4        | 1.3        |\n\nCurrent assets include EUR 4.9m (previous year: EUR 7.5m) of bank deposits which are subject to disposal restrictions due to the sanctions imposed by the Russian Federation.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Liabilities\n\n#### **Equity**\n\nThe development of equity in 2022/23 and 2021/22 is shown on page 29.\n\n#### **44. Share capital**\n\nThe share capital of EVN AG totals EUR 330.0m (previous year: EUR 330.0m) and is divided into 179,878,402 (previous year: 179,878,402) zero par value bearer shares.\n\n#### **45. Share premium and capital reserves**\n\nThe share premium and capital reserves comprise appropriated capital reserves of EUR 205.2m (previous year: EUR 205.2m) from capital increases and unappropriated capital reserves of EUR 58.3m (previous year: EUR 58.3m), both in accordance with Austrian stock corporation law.\n\n#### **46. Retained earnings**\n\nRetained earnings of EUR 3,417.0m (previous year: EUR 2,979.9m) comprise the proportional share of retained earnings attributable to EVN AG and all other consolidated companies from the date of initial consolidation as well as the proportional share of retained earnings from business combinations achieved in stages.\n\nDividends are based on the result of EVN AG as reported in the annual financial statements and developed as follows:\n\n| Reconciliation of EVN AG's result for the period       |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| EURm                                                   | 2022/23 |\n| Reported result for the period 2022/23                 | 416.3   |\n| Plus retained earnings from the 2021/22 financial year | 0.4     |\n| Less additions to voluntary reserves                   | -213.0  |\n| Distributable result for the period                    | 203.7   |\n| Proposed dividend                                      | -203.2  |\n| Retained earnings for the 2023/24 financial year       | 0.5     |\n\nLiabilities do not include the dividend of EUR 1.14 per share for the 2022/23 financial year which will be proposed to the Annual General.\n\nThe 94th Annual General Meeting on 2 February 2023 approved a proposal by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board to distribute a dividend of EUR 0.52 per share for the 2021/22 financial year. This resulted in a total dividend payment of EUR 92.7m. Ex-dividend day was 8 February 2023, dividend payment day was 10 February 2023.\n\n#### **47. Valuation reserves**\n\nThe valuation reserve contains changes in the market value of cash flow hedges and financial assets classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), the IAS 19 remeasurements and the proportional share of changes in the equity of investments in equity accounted investees.\n\nIn addition, the statement of comprehensive income includes EUR –0.9m (previous year: EUR 9.4m) for the share of changes in the valuation reserves that are attributable to non-controlling interests (see **Consolidated statement of comprehensive income,** page 27).\n\nThe part of the valuation reserve attributable to equity accounted investees consists primarily of components from cash flow hedges that were recorded under equity as well as remeasurements in accordance with IAS 19 and the valuation of FVOCI instruments.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                 | 30.09.2023 |        |           | 30.09.2022 |          |           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|\n| Valuation reserves<br>EURm                                                      | Before tax | Tax    | After tax | Before tax | Tax      | After tax |\n| Items recognised under other comprehensive<br>income from                       |            |        |           |            |          |           |\n| Financial assets classified at fair value through<br>other comprehensive income | 3,087.0    | -709.9 | 2,377.1   | 3,566.3    | -820.2   | 2,746.1   |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                                | 28.9       | -3.3   | 25.6      | -206.5     | 55.1     | -151.4    |\n| Remeasurements IAS 19                                                           | -99.6      | 22.3   | -77.3     | -73.0      | 16.3     | -56.7     |\n| Investments in equity accounted investees                                       | -204.9     | 53.5   | -151.3    | 1,229.9    | -289.7   | 940.2     |\n| Total                                                                           | 2,811.4    | -637.4 | 2,174.0   | 4,516.7    | -1,038.4 | 3,478.3   |\n\nIn 2022/23, cash flow hedges totalling EUR –15.4m (previous year: EUR –43.0m) were transferred from other comprehensive income to the consolidated statement of operations. The year-on-year change resulted, above all, from the portfolio hedge as well as from the hedging of net cash flows from the international project business (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).** Due to the ineffectiveness of the hedges an amount of EUR 0.0m (previous year: EUR 0.0m) was recognised in profit or loss.\n\n#### **48. Treasury shares**\n\nA total of 36,287 treasury shares were sold during the reporting year to permit their issue as a special payment in accordance with a company agreement (previous year: 37,888 shares). EVN AG is not entitled to any rights arising from treasury shares. In particular, these shares are not entitled to dividends.\n\nThe number of shares outstanding developed as follows:\n\n| Reconciliation of the number of |                       |                 |                    |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| outstanding shares              | Zero par value shares | Treasury shares | Outstanding shares |\n| 30.09.2021                      | 179,878,402           | -1,697,245      | 178,181,157        |\n| Purchase of treasury shares     | -                     | -               | -                  |\n| Disposal of treasury shares     | -                     | 37,888          | 37,888             |\n| 30.09.2022                      | 179,878,402           | -1,659,357      | 178,219,045        |\n| Purchase of treasury shares     | -                     | -               | -                  |\n| Disposal of treasury shares     | -                     | 36,287          | 36,287             |\n| 30.09.2023                      | 179,878,402           | -1,623,070      | 178,255,332        |\n\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding, which is used as the basis for calculating earnings per share, equals 178,225,093 shares (previous year: 178,187,472 shares).\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **49.

The foreign currency bond is hedged against interest and foreign exchange risk by means of cross-currency swaps.\n\nThe change in the carrying amount of the bonds resulted primarily from the reclassification of one bond to current financial liabilities because of the scheduled maturity within the next 12 months.\n\nThe bonds are carried at amortised cost. Foreign currency liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. In accordance with IFRS 9, hedged liabilities are adjusted to reflect the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged risk in cases where hedge accounting is applied (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\n#### **Bank loans**\n\nThe loans consist of immaterial general borrowings from banks and loans which are subsidised in part by interest and redemption grants from the Austrian Environment and Water Industry Fund. This position also includes EUR 247.0m (previous year: EUR 247.0m) of promissory note loans that were issued in October 2012, April 2020 and in July 2022.\n\nAccrued interest is reported under other current liabilities.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **51.

Deferred tax assets of EUR 75.1m (previous year: EUR 73.9m) related to loss carryforwards were not recognised because they are not expected to be used within the foreseeable future. Of this total, EUR 8.6m will expire during the next five years (previous year: EUR 8.6m). The remaining loss carryforwards that were not capitalised can be carried forward for an indefinite period of time.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities of EUR 110.1m (previous year: EUR 85.7m) on temporary differences of EUR 407.2m (previous year: EUR 325.5m) were not recognised because these differences will remain tax-free in the foreseeable future. These temporary differences arise from differences between the tax base of the participation interest and the proportional share of equity owned less retained earnings, respectively between the tax base of the participation interest and the carrying amount of the equity accounted investees (outside basis differences).\n\nThe changes recorded under other comprehensive income are primarily attributable to financial instruments (EUR –51.8m; previous year: EUR –119.6m), associates (EUR –343.2m; previous year: EUR 178.6m) and employee-related provisions (EUR –6.0m; previous year: EUR 20.9m).\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **52.

Only one parameter was changed at a time during the examination, while the other variables remained constant (ceteris paribus). The method used to calculate the changed obligation reflected the calculation of the actual obligation. The analytical capacity of this method is limited because the interdependencies between the individual actuarial parameters are not taken into account. With respect to the severance compensation obligations, a sensitivity analysis was not carried out for the remaining life expectancy because this parameter has only an immaterial effect on the liability.\n\n#### **Reconciliation of other non-current provisions**\n\nEURm\n\n|                                  | Service<br>anniversary<br>bonuses | Rents<br>for network<br>access | Process costs<br>and risks | Environmental<br>and disposal<br>risks | Other<br>non-current<br>provisions | Total |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|\n| Carrying amount 01.10.2022       | 20.5                              | 6.5                            | 3.1                        | 42.3                                   | 1.9                                | 74.3  |\n| Interest expense                 | 0.8                               | -                              | 0.2                        | 0.4                                    | -                                  | 1.4   |\n| Use                              | -1.6                              | -                              | -0.2                       | -                                      | -                                  | -1.9  |\n| Release                          | -                                 | -0.1                           | -2.0                       | -0.2                                   | -0.2                               | -2.4  |\n| Additions                        | 1.3                               | 0.5                            | 0.8                        | 8.6                                    | 0.5                                | 11.8  |\n| Reclassification                 | -                                 | -0.1                           | 0.4                        | 5.8                                    | 2.2                                | 8.2   |\n| Change in scope of consolidation | 0.1                               | -                              | -                          | -                                      | 1.7                                | 1.7   |\n| Carrying amount 30.09.2023       | 21.0                              | 6.8                            | 2.3                        | 57.0                                   | 6.0                                | 93.1  |\n\nRents for network access involve provisions for rents to gain access to third-party facilities in Bulgaria. Various legal proceedings and lawsuits, which for the most part arise from operating activities and are currently pending, are reported under process costs and risks. Environmental and disposal risks primarily encompass the estimated costs for demolition or disposal as well as provisions for environmental risks and risks related to contaminated sites. At the present time, the use of the provisions for environmental and disposal risks is expected within a timeframe of one to 19 years. Reclassifications consist chiefly of a transfer from the current to the non-current section due to the adjustment of estimates for the time required to meet renaturation obligations.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **53.

EVN AG is allocated to the segments on the basis of data from the cost accounting system.\n\nThe transfer prices for energy between the individual segments are based on comparable prices for special contract customers, and thus represent applicable market prices. For the remaining items, pricing is based on cost plus an appropriate mark-up.\n\n#### **Reconciliation of segment results at the Group level**\n\nServices performed between segments are eliminated in the consolidation column. The results in the total column reflect the amounts shown in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n#### **Group disclosures**\n\nIFRS 8 requires additional segment information classified by products (external revenues broken down by products and services) and countries (external revenues and non-current assets broken down by countries) if this information is not already provided as part of the segment reporting.\n\nInformation on transactions with major external customers is required only if these transactions amount to 10.0% or more of a company's external revenues. EVN has no transactions with customers that meet this criterion because of its large number of customers and diverse business activities.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Other information\n\n#### **60.

Risk management**\n\nMarket risk represents the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate as the result of market risk factors. Market risk is classified in the following three components: interest rate, foreign exchange and other market risks. The goal of risk management in the EVN Group is to reduce the market-based volatility of earnings on the consolidated statement of operations. To manage market risks, the Group acquires and sells derivatives and also enters into financial liabilities. Wherever possible, hedging transactions should be recognised in order to manage earnings volatility. Other relevant risks include credit or default risk and liquidity risk.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nEVN defines interest rate risk as the risk that fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in the market interest rate could adversely affect interest income and expense as well as equity. This risk is minimised through the regular monitoring of interest rate risk and compliance with limits as well as hedging strategies that include the use of derivative financial instruments (also see notes **9. Financial instruments** and **63. Reporting on financial instruments).**\n\nEVN monitors interest rate risk through sensitivity analyses and, among others, with a daily value-at-risk (VaR) calculation. This procedure calculates the VaR with a confidence level of 99.0% for one day according to the variance-covariance method (delta-gamma approach). The interest VaR, including the hedging instruments used by EVN, equalled EUR 6.5m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 10.7m). The decrease noted here is essentially due to slightly lower loans and bonds outstanding and the decreased volatility on the interest markets.\n\n#### **Foreign exchange risk**\n\nFor EVN, the risk to profit or loss arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arises from transactions carried out in currencies other than the euro. EVN is exposed to foreign exchange risk on receivables, liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents that are not held in the Group's functional currency (i. e. BGN, BHD, CZK, JPY, KWD, MKD, PLN, RUB). The major driver of foreign exchange risk for EVN is a bond issued in Japanese yen (JPY). Foreign exchange risk is managed by way of the central compilation, analysis and management of risk positions, and by hedging the bonds denominated in foreign currency (JPY 12bn) through cross-currency swaps (for a nominal value of JPY 10bn). Cross-currency swaps for a nominal value of JPY 2bn were terminated on 15 January 2019 based on the related settlement agreement concluded with a bank. This agreement gave both parties the right to early termination of the cross-currency swap in January 2019. Deposits totalling JPY 2bn were held with financial institutions as at the balance sheet date to hedge foreign exchange risk (see notes **9. Financial instruments** and **50. Non-current loans and borrowings).**\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother material driver for foreign exchange risk is the Umm Al Hayman wastewater treatment project in Kuwait. The EVN Group serves as the general contractor and, as such, is responsible for the planning and construction, above all, of a wastewater treatment plant (contract value: approximately EUR 600m, converted) and – together with partners – of a sewage network with pumping stations (contract value: approximately EUR 950m, converted). The Group is exposed to transactional foreign exchange risks to the extent that the currencies for settlement of the project transactions differ from the Group's functional currency. These transactions are carried out chiefly in euro (EUR), US dollar (USD) and Kuwaiti dinar (KWD). In accordance with the relevant Group guideline, foreign exchange risks from expected project transactions are hedged over the next twelve months. This practice can vary for large-scale projects, where hedging can also extend beyond the twelve-month period. Forward exchange transactions are used to hedge currency risk and formally designated in macro-cash flow accounting. These contracts are principally designated as cash flow hedges.\n\nThe EVN Group is expanding an existing sewage treatment plant in Bahrain and building a sewage sludge incineration plant. As with the project in Kuwait, the company is also exposed to currency risks in Bahrain. Forward exchange transactions were concluded to hedge the highly probable expected net cash flows. The transactions are carried out on the basis of euros (EUR) and Bahraini dinars (BHD).\n\nIn previous years, EVN used forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate for the project, but measured these at fair value. In the 2022/23 financial year, EVN decided to implement a cash flow hedge as for the project in Kuwait. In this respect, newly concluded forward exchange contracts, which were concluded to hedge the highly probable net payments in BHD, were designated as hedging instruments.\n\nThe foreign exchange VaR, based on the major foreign currency risk drivers in the financial area amounted to EUR 0.2m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 1.6m) after the inclusion of hedging instruments. The decrease is mainly due to the abovementioned use of forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges in the Bahrain project.\n\n#### **Other market risks**\n\nEVN defines other market risks as the risk of price changes resulting from market fluctuations in primary energy, CO2 emission certificates, electricity and securities.\n\nIn EVN's energy trading activities, energy trading contracts are entered into for the purpose of managing price risk. Price risks result from the procurement and sale of electricity, natural gas and CO2 emission certificates.\n\nEVN uses futures, forwards and swaps to hedge the prices of the primary energy carriers electricity, natural gas and CO2 emission certificates in the energy business. These swaps are generally fulfilled. The contracts which cover expected procurement, sale or usage requirements are evaluated as own-use transactions (also see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).** An increase or decrease of 5% in the price would have resulted in an aggregated commodity price risk of EUR 2.7m for EVN as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 3.0m).\n\nThe price risk for securities results from fluctuations on the capital markets. The most significant securities position held by EVN is its investment in Verbund AG. The price risk VaR for the Verbund AG shares held by EVN as of the balance sheet date was EUR 145.7m (previous year: EUR 272.0m), whereby the price would be influenced by the sale of a large block of Verbund shares by EVN. The decrease in VaR compared to the last balance sheet date is essentially due to the stable development of the stock market price of the shares of Verbund AG in the past financial year.\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk represents the risk of not being able to raise the required financial resources to settle liabilities on their due date as well as the inability to raise the necessary liquidity at the expected terms and conditions. EVN minimises this risk by means of short-term and medium-term financial and liquidity planning. In concluding financing agreements, special attention is paid to managing the terms to maturity in order to achieve a balanced maturity profile and thus avoid the bundling of repayment dates. The EVN Group uses cash pooling to equalise liquidity balances.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe liquidity reserve as of 30 September 2023 comprised cash and cash equivalents of EUR 70.2m (previous year: EUR 292.0m), short-term time deposits of EUR 12.6m (previous year: EUR 14.4m) and current securities of EUR 216.8m (previous year: EUR 193.3m) which can be sold at any time. Moreover, EVN had EUR 400.0m in a contractually agreed and unused syndicated line of credit (previous year: EUR 400.0m) and EUR 286.0m (previous year: EUR 227.0m) of contractually agreed and unused bilateral lines of credit as of the balance sheet date. The liquidity risk was therefore extremely low. The gearing ratio equalled 21.1% as of the balance sheet date (previous year: 17.0%) and underscores EVN's sound capital structure.\n\n#### **Expected occurrence of cash flows of loans and borrowings and other liabilities**\n\n| 30.09.2023                                         |                 |                     | Contractually stipulated payment flows |           |          |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| EURm                                               | Carrying amount | Total payment flows | <1 year                                | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Bonds                                              | 547.3           | 719.0               | 93.7                                   | 58.6      | 566.7    |\n| Bank loans                                         | 927.1           | 980.2               | 234.7                                  | 259.1     | 486.4    |\n| Lease liabilities                                  | 80.2            | 96.6                | 9.4                                    | 27.8      | 59.4     |\n| Liabilities arising from derivative transactions1) | 39.1            | 42.3                | 33.2                                   | 9.1       | –        |\n| Liabilities from contract costs                    | 15.5            | 15.5                | 15.5                                   | –         | –        |\n| Total                                              | 1,531.4         | 1,853.6             | 386.5                                  | 354.6     | 1,112.5  |\n| 30.09.2022                                         |                 |                     | Contractually stipulated payment flows |           |          |\n| EURm                                               | Carrying amount | Total payment flows | <1 year                                | 1–5 years | >5 years |\n| Bonds                                              | 556.7           | 736.6               | 15.9                                   | 141.9     | 578.7    |\n| Bank loans                                         | 716.4           | 812.0               | 136.0                                  | 279.3     | 396.8    |\n| Lease liabilities                                  | 61.8            | 69.7                | 7.0                                    | 20.8      | 41.9     |\n| Liabilities arising from derivative transactions1) | 294.4           | 326.6               | 268.9                                  | 57.7      | –        |\n| Liabilities from contract costs                    | 20.6            | 20.6                | 14.1                                   | 6.5       | –        |\n| Total                                              | 1,650.0         | 1,965.4             | 441.8                                  | 506.2     | 1,017.4  |\n\n1) Forward exchange transactions (USD/KWD) are included in the carrying amount. Cash flows from forward exchange transactions, however, are shown in the tables on page 105 in the respective foreign currency.\n\nAll financial liabilities not shown in the table are current and the associated cash flows are therefore due within one year.\n\n#### **Credit and default risk**\n\nCredit and default risk represents the risk of a loss when business partners fail to meet their contractual obligations. This risk is inherent to all agreements with delayed payment terms or fulfilment at a later date. Default risk generally arises in connection with trade receivables and the debt instruments held as financial assets by the Group. The carrying amount of the financial assets and contractual assets represents the maximum default risk.\n\nTo limit default risk, the company evaluates the credit standing of its business partners. Internal and external ratings (including Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch and KSV 1870) are used for this purpose, and the business volume is limited in accordance with the rating and the probability of default. Sufficient collateral is required before a transaction is entered into if the partner's credit rating is inadequate.\n\nEVN monitors credit risk and limits default risk for financial receivables and for derivatives and forward transactions which are concluded to hedge the risks connected with EVN's energy business or are related to end customers and other debtors.\n\nIn order to reduce credit risk, hedging transactions are entered into only with well-known banks that have good credit ratings. EVN also ensures that funds are deposited at banks with the best possible credit standing based on international ratings.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default risk for customers is monitored separately at EVN and supported primarily by ratings and experience-based values. Default risk is also minimised with efficient receivables management and the continuous monitoring of customer payment behaviour.\n\nThe recognition of impairment losses to financial assets carried at amortised cost and to contractual assets in accordance with IFRS 15 has been based on the ECL model for expected credit losses since 1 October 2018. EVN measures the impairment losses for trade receivables without a significant financing component and for contractual assets at an amount equal to the expected lifetime credit losses. In contrast, the impairment losses\n\n- for financial assets with a low default risk as of the balance sheet date and\n- for bank deposits without a significant increase in the default risk since initial recognition are based on the expected twelve-month credit loss.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the EVN Group, a financial asset has a low default risk when its credit rating meets the \"investment grade\" definition. The Group sees this condition as met with an internal rating of 5a or higher or with an equivalent rating of BB– or higher from Standard and Poor's (S&P).\n\nEVN uses appropriate and reliable information which is relevant and available without undue expenditure of time and expense to determine whether the default risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and to estimate the expected credit losses. The default risk of a financial asset is assumed to have increased significantly when the related credit rating has declined to 5b on EVN's internal rating scale, which represents the S&P equivalent of B+.\n\nThe EVN Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\n- the debtor is unlikely to meet his/her credit obligations in full without measures by the Group to realise collateral (if available), or\n- the financial asset declines to 5c on EVN's internal rating scale, which represents the S&P equivalent of CCC+, or\n- payment on trade receivables has not been received after a second reminder or insolvency proceedings are opened over a company or private person.\n\nDefault probabilities and collection rates based on the applicable rating category are used to calculate the required impairment loss. The amount of the impairment loss equals the present value of the expected credit loss.\n\nThe following table includes information on the default risk and expected credit losses for financial instruments carried at amortised cost. It does not cover trade receivables, receivables from equity accounted investees, receivables from unconsolidated investments or amounts due from employees. The risk allowance for all financial instruments represents the expected twelve-month credit loss because the default risk is low. The amounts shown in the table include both current and non-current components.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Major financial instruments covered by the ECL model**\n\n| 2022/23 financial year |                | Default           | Loans      | Lease       |                    | Calculated   |\n|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| EURm                   | Equivalent S&P | probability (%)1) | receivable | receivables | Bank deposits2) 3) | impairment4) |\n| EVN rating class 1     | AAA            | –                 | –          | 7.4         | 93.1               | –            |\n| EVN rating class 2     | Up to AA–      | 0.03              | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 3     | Up to A–       | 0.05              | 19.4       | 4.9         | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 4     | Up to BBB–     | 0.22              | 9.2        | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 5a    | Up to BB–      | 0.91              | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 5b    | Up to B–       | 5.53              | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| EVN rating class 5c    | Up to D        | 24.70             | –          | –           | –                  | –            |\n| No rating              | –              | –                 | 0.9        | –           | –                  | –            |\n| Total                  |                |                   | 29.5       | 12.3        | 93.1               | –            |\n\n1) Assumed loss ratio (60% for banks, 80% for corporates)\n\n2) Due to the daily maturity, a one-day probability of default is applied to account balances;\n\nfor money market deposits, the PoD of the average volume-weighted residual term is taken into account.\n\n3) Bank balances also include restricted cash in the amount of EUR 22.9m.\n\n4) The calculated impairments are not recognised in the balance sheet due to their minor magnitude.\n\n#### **Major financial instruments covered by the ECL model**\n\n| 2021/22 financial year<br>EURm | Equivalent S&P | Default<br>probability (%)1) | Loans<br>receivable | Lease<br>receivables | Bank deposits2) 3) | Calculated<br>impairment4) |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| EVN rating class 1             | AAA            | –                            | –                   | 3.3                  | 301.3              | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 2             | Up to AA–      | 0.03                         | –                   | 10.8                 | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 3             | Up to A–       | 0.06                         | 17.2                | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 4             | Up to BBB–     | 0.30                         | 11.0                | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 5a            | Up to BB–      | 1.45                         | –                   | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 5b            | Up to B–       | 7.47                         | –                   | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| EVN rating class 5c            | Up to D        | 9.87                         | –                   | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| No rating                      | –              | –                            | 1.2                 | –                    | –                  | –                          |\n| Total                          |                |                              | 29.4                | 14.1                 | 301.3              | –                          |\n\n1) Assumed loss ratio (60% for banks, 80% for corporates)\n\n2) Due to the daily maturity, a one-day probability of default is applied to account balances;\n\nfor money market deposits, the PoD of the average volume-weighted residual term is taken into account.\n\n3) Bank balances also include restricted cash in the amount of EUR 9.3m.\n\n4) The calculated impairments are not recognized in the balance sheet due to their minor magnitude.\n\nEVN uses the practical expedient provided by IFRS 9.B5.5.35 for trade receivables and calculates the expected credit losses with a provision matrix. The input factors include analyses of default incidents in previous financial years based on different regional characteristics for the core markets. These factors form the basis for the development of a provision matrix with different time ranges.\n\nIn the current situation, it is particularly important to evaluate how the macroeconomic environment will influence the expected credit losses on trade receivables. The economic developments in recent years did not lead to a sharp rise in receivables defaults by customers, in particular because of numerous government support measures. However, this has currently been reflected in an increasing number of insolvencies in Europe, and we expect higher receivables defaults in the future. For this reason, the EVN Group recognised a EUR 5.0m (previous year: EUR 6.1m) higher impairment loss to trade receivables for the 2022/23 financial year via a forward-looking component.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following tables include information on the default risk and expected credit losses for trade receivables, which were determined on the basis of a provision matrix for EVN's core markets:\n\n#### **Expected credit losses in Austria 2022/23** EURm\n\n|                        | Default probability<br>range (%) | Default probability<br>average (%) | Gross amount | Net amount | Cumulative<br>impairment loss |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| Not overdue            | 0.0-0.1                          | –                                  | 98.6         | 98.6       | –                             |\n| Up to 89 days overdue  | 0.1-0.6                          | 1.1                                | 7.9          | 7.8        | 0.1                           |\n| Up to 179 days overdue | 4.6-19.7                         | 13.6                               | 1.9          | 1.6        | 0.3                           |\n| Up to 359 days overdue | 7.9-55.2                         | 18.9                               | 2.7          | 2.2        | 0.5                           |\n| >360 days overdue      | 15.5-100.0                       | 38.6                               | 11.0         | 6.8        | 4.3                           |\n| Total                  |                                  |                                    | 122.2        | 117.0      | 5.2                           |\n\n#### **Expected credit losses in Austria 2021/22**\n\nEURm\n\n|                        | Default probability<br>range (%) | Default probability<br>average (%) | Gross amount | Net amount | Cumulative<br>impairment loss |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-------------------------------|\n| Not overdue            | 0.0-1.2                          | -

Following the conclusion of instalment agreements with customers in North Macedonia, existing trade receivables were reclassified as non-current. These receivables are not considered part of overdue receivables and, consequently, this category carries a higher average probability of default than the category \"up to 89 days overdue\".\n\nThe remaining gross trade receivables of EUR 102.8m (previous year: EUR 84.4m) are related primarily to the international project business. Since the customers are mainly government-related entities, the probability of default was calculated on the basis of external ratings. Impairments totalling EUR 23.7m (previous year: EUR 18.1m) were recognised for receivables with a gross carrying amount of EUR 70.7m (previous year: EUR 59.6m) that fall into Level 3.\n\nIn financial year 2022/23, impairments of EUR 20.7m (previous year: EUR 38.0m) were recognised for trade receivables. The impairments mainly resulted from expected credit losses under consideration of a provision matrix. As in the previous year, no impairment of contract assets was necessary.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the development of impairment losses to trade receivables in 2022/23:\n\n| Impairment losses – trade receivables |         |         |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                  | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Balance on 01.10.                     | 287.1   | 255.0   |\n| Additions                             | 20.7    | 38.0    |\n| Disposal                              | -21.1   | -6.0    |\n| Balance on 30.09.                     | 286.7   | 287.1   |\n\nThe Group's maximum default risk for the items reported on the consolidated statement of financial position as of 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022 reflect the carrying amounts shown in notes **39. Other non-current assets, 41. Trade and other receivables** and **42. Securities and other financial investments,** excluding financial guarantees.\n\nThe maximum default risk for derivative financial instruments equals the positive fair value (see note **63. Reporting on financial instruments).** \n\nThe maximum risk from financial guarantees is described in note **65. Other obligations and risks.**\n\n#### **62. Capital management**\n\nEVN's goal in the area of capital management is to maintain a solid capital structure in order to use the resulting financial strength for value-creating investments and an attractive dividend policy. EVN has defined an equity ratio of more than 40% and net debt coverage of more than 50% as its targets. As of 30 September 2023, the equity ratio equalled 58.8% (previous year: 58.9%). Net debt coverage, which represents the ratio of funds from operations to net debt, equalled 79.4% (previous year: 55.8%). Net debt is calculated as the total of current and non-current financial liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current securities and loans receivable, plus non-current personnel provisions.\n\n| Capital management                                       |            |            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                     | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n| Non-current loans and borrowings and leasing liabilities | 1,174.8    | 1,206.1    |\n| Current loans and borrowings1)                           | 302.0      | 128.8      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                | -20.2      | -36.9      |\n| Non-current and current securities                       | -337.5     | -285.6     |\n| Non-current and current loans receivable                 | -29.5      | -29.4      |\n| <b>Net financial debt</b>                                | 1,089.7    | 983.1      |\n| Non-current personnel provisions2)                       | 274.6      | 262.0      |\n| <b>Net debt</b>                                          | 1,364.3    | 1,245.1    |\n| <b>Funds from operations</b>                             | 1,082.9    | 694.1      |\n| <b>Equity</b>                                            | 6,464.3    | 7,321.1    |\n| <b>Gearing (%)</b>                                       | 21.1       | 17.0       |\n| <b>Net debt coverage (%)</b>                             | 79.4       | 55.8       |\n\n1) Excluding bank overdrafts contained in cash and cash equivalents\n\n2) Excluding provisions for service anniversary bonuses\n\nThe EVN Group uses cash pooling to manage liquidity and optimise interest rates.

Reporting on financial instruments**\n\nFair value generally reflects the listed price on the balance sheet date. If this price is not available, fair value is calculated in accordance with financial methods, e. g. by discounting the expected cash flows at the prevailing market interest rate. The input factors required for the calculations are explained below.\n\nThe fair value of shares in unlisted subsidiaries and other investments is based on discounted expected cash flows or comparable transactions. For financial instruments listed on an active market, the trading price as of the balance sheet date represents fair value. Most of the receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current financial liabilities have short terms to maturity. Therefore, the carrying value of these instruments as of the balance sheet date approximately corresponds to fair value. The fair value of bonds is calculated as the present value of the discounted future cash flows based on prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe following table shows the financial instruments carried at fair value and their classification in the fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13.\n\nLevel 1 input factors are observable parameters such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities. These prices are used for valuation purposes without modification. Level 2 input factors represent other observable parameters which must be adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics of the valuation object. Examples of the parameters used to measure the financial instruments classified under Level 2 are forward price curves derived from market prices, exchange rates, interest structure curves and the counterparty credit risk. Level 3 input factors are non-observable factors which reflect the assumptions that would be used by a market participant to determine an appropriate price. There were no reclassifications between the various levels during the reporting period.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Information on classes and categories of

The operative goal is to ensure the long-term continuity of the Group's earnings. All derivative financial instruments are integrated in a risk management system as soon as the respective contracts are concluded. This allows for the preparation of a daily overview of all main risk indicators.\n\nThe nominal values represent the separate totals of the items classified as financial derivatives on the balance sheet date. These are reference values which do not provide a measure of the risk incurred by the company through the use of these financial instruments. In particular, potential risk factors include fluctuations in the underlying market parameters and the credit risk of the contracting parties. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at their fair value.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nDerivative financial instruments comprise the following:\n\n| Derivative<br>financial instruments  | 30.09.2023 |           |          |          |       | 30.09.2022 |           |          |          |        |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|\n|                                      | Purchases  | Disposals | Positive | Negative | Net   | Purchases  | Disposals | Positive | Negative | Net    |\n| Forward exchange<br>transactions     |            |           |          |          |       |            |           |          |          |        |\n| KWD3)                                | –          | 80.1      | 1.4      | –12.3    | –10.9 | –          | 81.2      | –        | –25.6    | –25.6  |\n| USD3)                                | –          | 111.4     | 2.3      | –3.4     | –1.0  | –          | 174.7     | –        | –19.5    | –19.5  |\n| BHD3)                                | –          | 8.4       | –        | –0.6     | –0.6  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –      |\n| USD                                  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –     | –          | 40.0      | –        | –0.1     | –0.1   |\n| BHD                                  | –          | 4.7       | 0.1      | –        | 0.1   | –          | 33.4      | –        | –1.5     | –1.5   |\n| KWD                                  | –          | 1.8       | –        | –        | –     | –          | 3.5       | –        | –0.2     | –0.2   |\n| PLN                                  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –     | –          | 4.9       | –        | –        | –      |\n| RON                                  | –          | 2.0       | –        | –        | –     | –          | –         | –        | –        | –      |\n| Currency swaps                       |            |           |          |          |       |            |           |          |          |        |\n| JPYm (>5 years)3)                    | 10,000.0   | –         | –        | –19.4    | –19.4 | 10,000.0   | –         | –        | –11.1    | –11.1  |\n| Derivatives energy                   |            |           |          |          |       |            |           |          |          |        |\n| Swaps                                | –          | –         | –        | –        | –     | 36.0       | –36.0     | 10.0     | –8.4     | 1.6    |\n| Futures                              | 1,257.6    | 2,347.7   | 12.7     | –5.6     | 7.1   | 22.0       | –         | –        | –0.4     | –0.4   |\n| Forwards                             | 436.9      | 411.2     | 16.4     | –10.9    | 5.5   | 668.4      | 843.2     | 40.7     | –92.6    | –51.9  |\n| Futures3)                            | –          | 556.0     | 13.7     | –        | 13.7  | –          | –         | –        | –        | –      |\n| Forwards3)                           | 19.9       | 365.4     | 57.8     | –10.6    | 47.2  | 204.1      | 849.3     | 24.3     | –183.0   | –158.7 |\n| Recognition of offsetting<br>clauses | –          | –         | –23.6    | 23.6     | –     | –          | –         | –48.1    | 48.1     | –      |\n| Total after netting out              | –          | –         | 80.9     | –39.1    | 41.2  | –          | –         | 27.0     | –294.4   | –267.4 |\n\n1) In m nominal currency; energy related in GWh\n\n2) In EURm\n\n3) Designated as a hedge in accordance with IFRS 9\n\nPositive fair values are recognised as receivables from derivative transactions under other non-current assets or receivables and other current assets, depending on their remaining term to maturity. Negative fair values are recognised as liabilities from derivative transactions under other non-current liabilities or other current liabilities, depending on their remaining term to maturity. For counterparties with a master agreement that includes an offsetting clause, the positive and negative fair values are presented as a net amount for specific periods because of the applicable net settlement procedure. A maturity analysis of the derivative financial liabilities is provided in the table on liquidity risk (see note **61. Risk management).**\n\nEVN uses hedges to manage earnings volatility. The underlying transaction and the hedge are designed to ensure a match between the parameters relevant for measurement (critical terms match). In order to gauge the effectiveness, the underlying transactions are recorded in the treasury management system as hypothetical derivates and evaluated to determine whether the relationship with the respective hedges was or will be effective. Possible sources of ineffectiveness are, for example, timing shifts or a change in the volume of an existing underlying transaction as well as adjustments for the credit risk of hedges and underlying transactions. All measures are based on internal guidelines.\n\nThe EVN Group applied the hedge accounting rules under IFRS 9 to hedge a bond issued in JPY (see note **50. Non-current loans and borrowings)** as well as for the hedging of the currency risk from the Umm Al Hayman wastewater treatment project. In addition, derivative financial instruments were used as part of cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the price risk from the planned future income from electricity sales at variable prices.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **JPY bond**\n\nThe hedge of the JPY bond primarily involves EUR/JPY cross-currency swaps. These cross-currency swaps (for a nominal value of JPY 12bn up to 15 January 2019 and for a nominal value of JPY 10bn since that date) represent a fair value hedge and are recorded and measured in the treasury management system, designated as a hedge and documented. The corresponding change in the bond liability from the hedge represents a contrary movement to the market value of the swaps. The results from the hedge of the JPY bond with cross-currency swaps totalled EUR 1.2m in 2022/23 (measurement of the bond EUR 9.5m and measurement of the swaps EUR –8.3m; previous year: earnings effect EUR 1.0m, including measurement of the bond EUR 7.8m and measurement of the swaps EUR –6.8m) and were recorded under other financial results. The market value was derived from the information available on the balance sheet date and based on the applicable bond price and exchange rate. A cross-currency swap for a nominal value of JPY 2bn was concluded to hedge the JPY bond through a settlement agreement with a bank. The related agreement entitled both parties to early termination in January 2019, and the cross-currency swap was terminated by the bank as of 15 January 2019. In connection with this termination, EVN dissolved the fair value hedge relationship and collected a settlement payment of EUR 0.6m. The interest rate-based fair value adjustment of the JPY bond related to the terminated EUR –1.2m swap will be released to profit or loss until the bond matures on 9 January 2024 (as of 30 September 2023: EUR –0.1m and as of 30 September 2022: EUR –0.3m).\n\n#### **Umm Al Hayman/Bahrain**\n\nEVN concluded forward exchange contracts to hedge the planned net foreign currency cash flows from the Umm Al Hayman project and, as of the 2022/23 financial year, also from the project in Bahrain. The expected payments are therefore fully hedged. A Group guideline requires the critical terms of these forward exchange contracts to reflect the hedged transaction as best as possible. The hedging does not result in any ineffectiveness if the expectations for the timing and amount remain unchanged.\n\nEVN establishes the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction based on the currency, amount and timing of the respective cash flows. The dollar-offset derivative method is used to evaluate whether the derivative designated in each hedge will presumably be, and was, effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows from the hedged transaction.\n\n#### **Portfolio hedge**\n\nEVN implements a portfolio hedge electricity to hedge the risk from the marketing of the Group's own electricity production. Under cash flow hedge accounting as defined by IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments (electricity forwards and electricity future contracts) used to hedge the price risk from planned future income from electricity sales are carried at variable prices. The underlying transaction represents the portfolio of future highly probable sales of electricity produced by the EVN Group in Austria.\n\nEvaluating the effectiveness of the hedge involves demonstrating an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument. In addition, the default risk may not have a dominant influence on the changes in value. The prospective effectiveness assessment principally takes place on a qualitative basis in accordance with the critical terms match method, which compares the key conditions of the hedging instrument with the underlying transaction. In order to minimise the risk of ineffectiveness from over-hedging, the hedges are not concluded for the total planned sales volumes. The major conditions between the hedging instruments and planned cash flows agree, and it is therefore assumed that the changes in the value of the hedging instruments will be offset in full by the changes in future cash flows. The hedged risks to which both the underlying transaction and hedging instrument are exposed therefore have an opposite influence on the value of the underlying transaction and hedging instrument.\n\nFor hedges of electricity deliveries to foreign markets, the change in the value of the hedging instruments may not always fully offset the change in the value of future cash flows. The higher liquidity on the German market has created a situation where increasingly futures are seeing concluded in this market. The electricity price in Austria consists of a German electricity price plus a DE/AT spread. The futures products concluded in Germany therefore represent a hedge for the price component included in the Austrian electricity prices.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the hedge and the underlying transaction take place on the same market, complete coverage is principally ensured between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument. If hedges are concluded on the German market due to a lack of sufficient liquidity, the risk component of the German price alone represents the underlying transaction for the hedging relationship – and in that way, achieves full coverage between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of hedges can lead to changes in the credit risk of the counterparty or to a reduction in the expected electricity delivery volume.\n\n|                                                                                            | Carrying<br>amount | Balance sheet position

Other obligations and risks**\n\nThe commitments entered into by EVN and the related risks are as follows:\n\n| Other obligations and risks                                                              |            |            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| EURm                                                                                     | 30.09.2023 | 30.09.2022 |\n| Guarantees in connection with energy transactions                                        | 208.6      | 82.5       |\n| Guarantees in connection with projects in the Environment Segment                        | 710.7      | 684.1      |\n| Guarantees related to the construction and operation of                                  |            |            |\n| Energy networks                                                                          | 4.0        | 2.0        |\n| Power plants                                                                             | 84.2       | 87.6       |\n| Order obligations for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment | 266.3      | 218.5      |\n| Further obligations arising from guarantees or other contractual contingent liabilities  | 0.1        | 0.1        |\n| Total                                                                                    | 1,273.9    | 1,074.8    |\n| thereof in connection with equity accounted investees                                    | 195.9      | 82.0       |\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nNeither provisions nor liabilities were recognised for the above-mentioned items because claims to the fulfilment of obligations or the actual occurrence of specific risks were not expected at the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared. The abovementioned obligations were contrasted by corresponding recourse claims of EUR 72.1m (previous year: EUR 21.2m).\n\nOther obligations and risks increased by EUR 199.1m to EUR 1,273.9m compared to 30 September 2022. This change mainly resulted from an increase in guarantees in connection with energy transactions, in guarantees for environmental projects as well as from an increase in scheduled orders for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. This was offset by a reduction in guarantees in connection with the construction and operation of power plants.\n\nContingent liabilities relating to guarantees in connection with energy transactions are recognised in the amount of the actual risk for EVN for those guarantees issued for the procurement or marketing of energy. This risk is measured by the changes between the stipulated price and the actual market price, whereby EVN is only exposed to procurement risks when market prices decline and to selling risks when market prices increase.\n\nAccordingly, fluctuations in market prices may lead to a change in the risk exposure after the balance sheet date. The risk assessment resulted in a contingent liability of EUR 208.6m as of 30 September 2023. The nominal volume of the guarantees underlying this assessment was EUR 538.5m. As of 31 October 2023, the market price risk was EUR 164.1m based on an underlying nominal volume of EUR 544.9m.\n\nVarious legal proceedings and lawsuits related to operating activities are pending or claims may be filed against EVN in the future. The attendant risks were analysed in relation to their probability of occurrence. The evaluation of possible claims showed that the legal proceedings and lawsuits, individually and as a whole, would not have a material negative effect on EVN's business, liquidity, profit or loss or financial position.\n\nAdditional obligations arising from guarantees and other contractual contingent liabilities consisted chiefly of outstanding capital contributions to affiliates as well as liabilities for affiliates' loans.\n\n#### **66. Information on transactions with related parties**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, transactions with related parties arise through direct or indirect control, significant influence or joint management. Related parties further include close family members of the respective natural persons. Key management personnel and their close family members are also considered to be related parties.\n\nEVN's related parties include all companies in the scope of consolidation, other subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that are not included in the consolidated financial statements, as well as people who are responsible for the planning, management and supervision of the Group's activities. In particular, related parties also include the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as their family members. A list of the Group companies can be found starting on page 115 under **EVN's investments.** \n\nThe province of Lower Austria holds 51.0% of the shares of EVN AG through NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten. Therefore, the province of Lower Austria and companies under its control or significant influence are classified as related parties of the EVN Group. Since the province of Lower Austria is a government-related entity which has control over EVN AG due to its majority shareholding, EVN has elected to apply the exemption provided by IAS 24.25. This exemption releases EVN from the requirement to disclose business transactions and outstanding balances with related parties when the related party is a government-related entity. The business transactions with companies under the control or significant influence of NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH are related mainly to the provision of electricity, natural gas, network and telecommunications services.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nNÖ Holding GmbH holds 100% of the shares in NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, which prepares and publishes consolidated financial statements.\n\nWiener Stadtwerke GmbH acquired 51,000,000 EVN shares on 5 August 2020. The closing of this transaction made the company, which is wholly owned by the city of Vienna, the second largest shareholder of EVN AG with an investment of 28.4%. Since the city of Vienna is a government-related entity which, based on the majority shareholding, can exercise significant influence over EVN AG, the exemption provided by IAS 24.25 was applied. This exemption permits the non-disclosure of business transactions and outstanding balances with related parties when the related pary is a government-related entity.\n\n#### **Transactions with related parties**\n\n#### **Main shareholder**\n\nEVN is part of a joint venture with NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH as the main shareholder and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH as the minority shareholder. A group and tax equalisation agreement was concluded to regulate the modalities. On the basis of this agreement, EVN has included further subsidiaries in this group of companies. This resulted in a current receivable of EUR 5.4m from NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: current liability of EUR 28.9m). All business relationships with the main shareholder or companies attributable to the main shareholder are carried out at arm's length.\n\n#### **Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH**\n\nBased on a syndicate agreement, EVN and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH together hold roughly 26% of the voting shares in Verbund AG through their direct and indirect investments (also see note **38. Other investments).**\n\nBased on the group and tax equalisation agreement, there is a current liability to Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH of EUR 3.1m as of 30 September 2023 (previous year: EUR 8.8m).\n\nEnergieAllianz is a joint energy distribution company comprising Burgenland Energie, EVN and Wien Energie GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH. EVN holds 45% of the shares in EnergieAllianz, which is responsible for the trading and sale of electricity, natural gas and energy-related services for industrial, large-scale and business customers.\n\nEVN and Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH jointly operate the project company EVN-Wien Energie Windparkentwicklungs- und Betriebs GmbH & Co KG through their respective subsidiaries, EVN Naturkraft and Wien Energie GmbH, each of which holds an investment of 50% as a limited partner. This company is responsible for the development, construction and operation of wind parks.\n\nFurther joint investments, which are immaterial in scope, exist between the EVN Group and/or subsidiaries controlled by Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH.\n\n#### **Investments in equity accounted investees**\n\nWithin the context of its ordinary business operations, EVN has concluded supply and service contracts with numerous companies included at equity in its consolidated financial statements. Long-term agreements were concluded with EnergieAllianz for the sale and procurement of electricity and natural gas, and long-term procurement contracts were concluded with Verbund Innkraftwerke for electricity.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe value of services provided to the investments in equity accounted investees listed above is as follows:\n\n| Transactions with joint ventures included at equity |         |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                                | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Revenue                                             | 527.2   | 449.1   |\n| Cost of services received                           | -153.5  | -144.5  |\n| Trade accounts receivable                           | 61.2    | 50.6    |\n| Receivables from cash pooling                       | 86.5    | –       |\n| Trade accounts payable                              | 28.8    | 120.1   |\n| Loans                                               | 7.4     | 11.5    |\n| Liabilities from cash pooling                       | –       | 8.2     |\n| Interest income from loans                          | 0.4     | 0.4     |\n\n| Transactions with associates included at equity |         |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURm                                            | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n| Cost of services received                       | -48.1   | -16.2   |\n| Trade accounts payable                          | -       | 1.4     |\n\n#### **Transactions with related individuals**\n\n**Executive Board and Supervisory Board**\n\nThe payments to members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consist primarily of salaries, severance payments, pensions and Supervisory Board remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration paid to the active members of the Executive Board in 2022/23 totalled TEUR 1,360.2 (including compensation in kind and contributions to pension funds; previous year: TEUR 1,253.5).\n\n| Remuneration of the active Executive Board<br>TEUR<br>2022/23 |                       |                            | 2021/22                 |                       |                          |                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                               | Fixed<br>remuneration | Variable<br>remuneration1) | Compensation<br>in kind | Fixed<br>remuneration | Variable<br>remuneration | Compensation<br>in kind |\n| Stefan Szyszkowitz                                            | 477.4                 | 146.0                      | 3.5                     | 446.9                 | 127.4                    | 3.4                     |\n| Franz Mittermayer                                             | 445.5                 | 133.9                      | 14.2                    | 417.1                 | 114.4                    | 14.1                    |\n\n1) Corresponds to the amounts paid in the 2022/23 financial year; the variable remuneration depends on the achievement of targets. Details can be found in the remuneration report.\n\nIn addition, pension fund contributions made in 2022/23 equalled TEUR 72.6 for Stefan Szyszkowitz (previous year: TEUR 67.6) and TEUR 67.1 for Franz Mittermayer (previous year: TEUR 62.5).\n\nIn the 2022/23 financial year, the provision for pension obligations for Stefan Szyszkowitz resulted in an addition of TEUR 856.1 (of which TEUR 151.4 was interest expense and TEUR 568.3 was actuarial gains/losses). In the previous year, the change amounted to TEUR –2,313.9 (thereof TEUR 71.4 interest expense and TEUR –2,609.3 actuarial gains/losses). For Franz Mittermayer, there was an addition to the provision for pension obligations of TEUR 337.7 (of which TEUR 230.4 interest expense and TEUR 107.3 actuarial gains/losses). In the previous year, the change amounted to TEUR –1,707.4 (thereof TEUR 90.3 interest expense and TEUR –2,071.3 actuarial gains/losses).\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe addition to the provision for severance compensation on behalf of Stefan Szyszkowitz equalled TEUR 57.2 (thereof TEUR 10.3 interest expense and TEUR 38.7 of actuarial gains/losses). The change in the previous year equalled TEUR – 20.9 (thereof TEUR 2.8 interest expense and TEUR –32.7 of actuarial gains/losses). The addition to the provision for severance compensation on behalf of Franz Mittermayer equalled TEUR 44.8 (thereof TEUR 11.8 interest expense and TEUR 33.0 of actuarial gains/losses). The addition in the previous year equalled TEUR 23.0 (thereof TEUR 2.8 interest expense and TEUR 9.7 actuarial gains/losses).\n\nIn 2022/23 contributions of TEUR 9.6 (previous year: TEUR 8.8) were made to an external employee fund on behalf of Stefan Szyszkowitz and TEUR 9.1 (previous year: TEUR 8.3) on behalf of Franz Mittermayer.\n\nThe year-on-year change in the remuneration of the active members of the Executive Board is attributable primarily to the change in performance-based components and the annual wage and salary increases mandated by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are also entitled to a contractually agreed pension at retirement, whereby pension payments under the Austrian social security scheme and any payments from the VBV-Pensionskasse are credited against this amount.\n\nThe payments to former members of the Executive Board or their surviving dependents amounted to TEUR 1,034.4 in 2022/23 (previous year: TEUR 1,008.4).\n\nThe additions to the provisions for severance payments and pensions for active members of senior management totalled TEUR 545.5 (thereof TEUR 95.4 interest expense and TEUR 353.4 of actuarial gains/losses). The comparative amounts for the previous year included income of TEUR –1,006.6 (thereof TEUR 35.0 interest expense and TEUR –1,155.4 of actuarial gains/losses).\n\nContributions to the employee fund on behalf of active members of senior management totalled TEUR 19.9 in 2022/23 (previous year: TEUR 18.7) and pension fund contributions amounted to TEUR 337.8 (previous year: TEUR 412.8).\n\nThe above amounts include expenses recognised in accordance with national law, as required by the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. In accordance with IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recorded under other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration totalled TEUR 172.7 in 2022/23 (previous year: TEUR 156.7). The members of the Advisory Committee for Environmental and Social Responsibility received remuneration of TEUR 99.1 during the reporting year (previous year: TEUR 98.4).\n\nThe basic principles underlying the remuneration system are presented in the remuneration report, which is part of the corporate governance report.\n\n#### **Transactions with other related companies**\n\nThe disclosure requirements for the notes do not cover information on intragroup transactions. Therefore, business transactions between EVN and its subsidiaries are not reported. Business transactions with non-consolidated subsidiaries and companies not included at equity are generally not reported because they are immaterial.\n\nRelated parties can also be direct customers of a company within the EVN Group, whereby these business relationships reflect prevailing market rates and conditions and are immaterial in relation to the total income recorded by the EVN Group in 2022/23. The resulting items outstanding as of 30 September 2023 are reported under trade accounts receivable.\n\n#### **67.

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### **Key Audit Matters**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow are the key audit matters, from our viewpoint\n\n- Accounting of the large-scale project Umm Al Hayman in the international project business\n- Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in equity accounted investees\n\n#### **Accounting of the large-scale project Umm Al Hayman in the international project business**\n\n#### **Facts and references to further information**\n\nWith a contract volume of more than EUR 1.2 bn attributable to the Group, the Umm Al Hayman project is currently the largest construction project in EVN's international project division. The subject of this project is the design and construction of a sewage treatment plant or respectively a sewer network with pumping stations in Kuwait. Contract costs have been capitalised and will be amortised based on the project progress.\n\nRevenue is recognised over the period in which the term of the service was rendered, with the stage of completion being measured based on the cost incurred in relation to the expected total cost. As payments are denominated mainly in Kuwaiti dinar and US dollar, derivative financial instruments are used to hedge against exchange rate risks. IFRS 9 hedge accounting is applied, therefore, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Covid 19 pandemic, delays in supply chains as well as project modifications made at the customer`s request resulted in moderate delays, which need to be assessed and accounted for. Overall, the project is classified as significant in terms of value for the consolidated financial statements and requires the application of complex accounting methods.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe risk for the consolidated financial statements lies in the uncertainty of the assumptions and estimates needed to account for this large-scale project. These may result in misstatements in the consolidated statement of financial position or the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n#### **Auditing procedure**\n\nDuring our audit, we have obtained an understanding of the relevant processes and have tested the effectiveness of selected internal controls. Additionally, we have analysed the accounting instructions and files (accounting template) and have assessed them based on the underlying contracts. We have examined the application of the relevant accounting standards (in particular IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers and IFRS 9 – Financial instruments regarding hedge accounting). The recorded costs (third party and own work) have been critically reviewed and a detailed document examination on a sample basis was performed. We have inspected the cost and project reports and questioned the commercial and technical project managers on the current construction process. Finally, we also reconciled the cost element reports with the general ledger and the bookings were matched to the accounting templates.\n\n#### **Reference to further information**\n\nThe principles of revenue recognition for construction projects are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in section 20 (Revenue recognition) of the Accounting and valuation policies. Further information to this project can be found in section 23 Accounting estimates and forward-looking statements, in section 39 Other non-current assets regarding costs for obtaining contracts and in section 61 Risk management regarding foreign exchange risk.\n\n#### **Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investments in equity accounted investees Facts and reference to further information**\n\nIntangible assets, property, plant and equipment (PPE) and investments in equity accounted investees with a total carrying amount of EUR 5,600.3 mn account for 51% of total assets of the group as of 30 September, 2023.\n\nAccounting standards require an assessment to be made at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that the recoverable amount has decreased significantly. For those items of intangible assets, PPE and equity accounted investees, for which impairment losses were recognised in prior periods, the Group assesses whether the impairment loss no longer exists and therefore needs to be reversed.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment for which no separate future cash flows can be identified are tested for impairment at the level of the cash-generating units. By determining the value in use or, if necessary, the value less costs to sell, estimates must be made regarding the development of revenues and expenses and the resulting cash surpluses, as well as assumptions for determining the discount rate used.\n\nThe result of the valuation is therefore subject to estimation uncertainties. A change in the macroe-conomic, industry or corporate situation in the future may lead to a reduction in cashflows and thus to impairment losses. For the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk of incorrect valuation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investments in equity accounted investees.\n\n#### **Auditing procedure**\n\nDuring our audit, we have obtained an understanding of how the Group monitors impairment triggers. In doing so, we critically assessed the processes implemented to determine whether they are suitable for the valuation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investments in equity accounted investees. We also assessed the related key internal controls and evaluated their form and implementation. We critically assessed the triggers for impairments and reversals and have compared them with our own estimates.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have critically discussed and evaluated the underlying forecasts and assumptions for the valuation and assessed their appropriateness based on current and expected developments and other evidence. In consultation with our valuation specialists, we assessed the measurement technique model, planning assumptions and measurement parameter for selected issues, on which the discount rate is based. We assessed the appropriateness of planning estimates by comparing actual cash flows with prior period estimated cash flows on a sample basis and discussing deviations with staff responsible for planning. We agreed that the respective results of the valuations were properly accounted for.\n\n#### **Reference to further information**\n\nThe procedures and effects of impairment tests are described in section 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Further information can be found in section 23 Accounting estimates and forward-looking statements. The effects of impairment tests are presented in section 31 (Depreciation and amortisation and effects from impairment tests) and in sections 35 (Intangible assets), 36 (Property, plant and equipment) and 37 (Investments in equity accounted investees) of the notes to the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### **Other information**\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the Group's management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nWe received the consolidated non-financial report and the consolidated corporate governance report before the date of the auditor's report, and we expect to receive the remaining parts of the annual report after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and of the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU and with requirements stated in § 245a UGB, for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consoli-dated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n#### **Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n#### **Comments on the Group Management Report**\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Group management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether it was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the Group's management report in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing for the audit of the Group's management report.\n\n#### **Opinion**\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the valid legal requirements, comprising the details in accordance with § 243a UGB (Austrian Company Code) and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Statement**\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the thus obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the Group's management report came to our attention.\n\n#### **Additional information in accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation**\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the ordinary General Meeting on 2 February, 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on 3 February, 2023. We have been appointed to audit the consolidated financial statements without interruption since the 2020/21 financial year.\n\nWe confirm that the audit opinion in the section \"Report on the consolidated financial statements\" is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee referred to in article 11 of the EU regulation.\n\nWe declare that no prohibited non-audit services (article 5 par. 1 of the EU regulation) were provided by us and that we remained independent of the audited company in conducting the audit.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsible austrian certified public accountant**\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Mr. Gerhard Posautz, Certified Public Accountant.\n\nVienna, 21 November 2023\n\nBDO Assurance GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\n**Gerhard Posautz**\n\n**Gerhard Posautz Johannes Waltersam** Certified Auditor Certified Auditor\n\nThis report is a translation of the original report in German, which is solely valid.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **EVN AG Jahresabschluss 2022/23**\n\nnach UGB\n\n**EVN AG**\n\nEVN Platz 2344 Maria Enzersdorf Österreich\n\nSitz der Gesellschaft: 2344 Maria Enzersdorf Registriert Landesgericht Wr.

Vor diesem Hintergrund arbeitet die EU laufend an weiteren Gesetzesvorhaben, um einen verbindlichen Rechtsrahmen zur Erreichung dieser ambitionierten Ziele zu schaffen.\n\nIm März 2023 einigten sich die Mitgliedsstaaten auf die Grundlagen des Pakets für den Wasserstoffmarkt und den dekarbonisierten Gasmarkt. Es soll die wesentlichen Rahmenbedingungen für den sukzessiven Übergang von fossilem Erdgas hin zu erneuerbaren Gasen durch die Schaffung eines wettbewerbsfähigen Markts samt der dafür erforderlichen Infrastruktur regeln. Weitere wesentliche Inhalte sind die Regulierung der künftigen Wasserstoffnetze sowie die Verbesserung der Planungs- und Investitionssicherheit für Netze und Speicher.\n\nIm Mai 2023 trat eine neue EU-Richtlinie über die Reform des Emissionshandels in Kraft, die diesen ab 2027 auch auf den Verkehrs- und Gebäudesektor ausweitet. Die Einnahmen aus den neuen Bereichen des Emissionshandels sollen in einen Klima- und Sozialfonds fließen.\n\nIm Herbst 2023 einigten sich EU-Parlament und Rat auf eine Novelle der Erneuerbaren-Energien-Richtlinie (RED III), die deutlich ambitioniertere Ziele für den Anteil erneuerbarer Energien in der Wärme- und Kälteversorgung sowie in den Sektoren Gebäude, Industrie und Verkehr vorsieht. Für die Industrie bedeuten die neuen Ziele auch einen rascheren Umstieg auf erneuerbaren Wasserstoff. Zudem enthält die Richtlinie die Vorgabe, die Dauer der Planungs- und Genehmigungsverfahren für den Ausbau von Anlagen zur Erzeugung von erneuerbaren Energien, Netzen und Energiespeichern zu verkürzen.\n\nVor dem Hintergrund der durch den Ukrainekrieg ausgelösten Energiekrise legte die EU-Kommission 2023 einen Entwurf für ein neues Strommarktdesign vor. Ein wesentliches Ziel der Reformbestrebungen ist es, die negativen Auswirkungen von extremen Preisschwankungen auf den EU-Markt und letztlich auf die Verbraucher einzudämmen. Als eine wesentliche Maßnahme soll künftig für Investitionen in Anlagen zur Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren bzw. nichtfossilen Quellen die Übernahme von Marktpreisrisiken durch den Staat ermöglicht werden. Dies soll einerseits den Kraftwerksbetreibern Investitionssicherheit bieten, andererseits sollen Verbraucher bei steigenden Marktpreisen entlastet werden können. Ermöglicht werden soll das durch den Abschluss sogenannter energiewirtschaftlicher Differenzverträge (Contracts for Difference) zwischen Stromproduzenten und den EU-Mitgliedsstaaten. Die EU ist bestrebt, dass das Gesetzespaket zum Strommarktdesign noch vor den EU-Wahlen im Jahr 2024 beschlossen wird.\n\n## **Österreich**\n\nIn Österreich enthält das im Juli 2021 beschlossene Erneuerbaren-Ausbau-Gesetz (EAG) konkrete Ausbauziele. Bis 2030 soll die erneuerbare Stromerzeugung um insgesamt 27 TWh pro Jahr gesteigert werden, davon sollen 11 TWh auf Photovoltaik, 10 TWh auf Windkraft, 5 TWh auf Wasserkraft und 1 TWh auf Biomasse entfallen.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nZu den für die Aktivitäten der EVN besonders relevanten Inhalten des EAG zählen die Fördermechanismen für die Errichtung neuer erneuerbarer Erzeugungsanlagen sowie Investitionszuschüsse für Elektrolyseanlagen zur Umwandlung von Strom in Wasserstoff oder synthetisches Gas. Darüber hinaus sollen die Investitionssicherheit für bestehende und zukünftige Anlagen zur Erzeugung von erneuerbarem Gas gewährleistet und der Anteil von national produziertem erneuerbarem Gas am österreichischen Gasabsatz bis 2030 auf 5 TWh p. a. erhöht werden. Weitere relevante Inhalte sind die Rahmenbedingungen für Bürgerenergiegemeinschaften und Erneuerbare-Energie-Gemeinschaften.\n\nIm März 2023 wurden durch eine Novelle des Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfungsgesetzes Verfahrenserleichterungen sowie Maßnahmen zur Beschleunigung der Genehmigung für Vorhaben der Energiewende beschlossen.\n\nIm Juni 2023 erfolgte mit der Novelle des Bundes-Energieeffizienzgesetzes die Umsetzung der Energieeffizienz-Richtlinie der EU in Österreich.\n\nIm Oktober 2023 einigte sich die Bundesregierung auf die Inhalte für ein neues Erneuerbare-Wärme-Gesetz, das insbesondere ein Verbot der Errichtung neuer Heizungsanlagen auf Basis fossiler Brennstoffe in Neubauten für Haushalte vorsieht. Ebenfalls im Oktober 2023 beschloss der österreichische Nationalrat im Rahmen einer Gesetzesnovelle einen höheren Standard für die Gasbevorratung. Demnach müssen Gaslieferanten zur Gewährleistung der Versorgungssicherheit künftig einen Versorgungsstandard von 45 Tagen (statt bisher 30 Tagen) gewährleisten. Neu eingeführt wurde auch ein Bevorratungsstandard für Gaskraftwerke (inkl. Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungsanlagen). Zudem wurde die Verlängerung des Vorhaltens der strategischen Gasreserve bis 2026 beschlossen.\n\nDas Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie arbeitet zur Umsetzung der Strombinnenmarktrichtlinie sowie der Erneuerbaren-Richtlinie der EU aktuell am Elektrizitätswirtschaftsgesetz (ElWG), das auch das bestehende Elektrizitätswirtschafts- und -organisationsgesetz (ElWOG) ersetzen soll. Vom ElWG werden somit u. a. klare Regelungen zu Energiegemeinschaften (z. B. in Bezug auf den Betrieb von Speichern) ebenso erwartet wie neue Regelungen für Netzbetreiber (z. B. in Bezug auf die vereinfachte Nutzung von Smart-Meter-Daten für die Planung von Netzflexibilitäten). Auch zusätzliche Konsumentenschutzbestimmungen sollen Eingang in das ElWG finden.\n\n## Bundesgesetz über den Energiekrisenbeitrag-Strom\n\nIn Österreich trat – in Umsetzung einer im Herbst 2022 beschlossenen EU-Verordnung über zeitlich befristete Notfallmaßnahmen – für den Zeitraum 1. Dezember 2022 bis 31. Dezember 2023 das Bundesgesetz über den Energiekrisenbeitrag-Strom in Kraft. Primäres Ziel der EU-Verordnung und der darauf beruhenden nationalstaatlichen Gesetze war es, temporär auf die massiven Verwerfungen auf den internationalen Energiemärkten und die daraus resultierenden Auswirkungen auf die europäische Gesellschaft und Volkswirtschaft zu reagieren. Konkret sollten die Mitgliedsstaaten zur Einhebung einer Solidaritätsabgabe auf Grundlage gestiegener Markterlöse in der Stromerzeugung sowie aus dem Erdöl-, Kohleund Raffineriebereich ermächtigt werden. Die Einnahmen sollten verwendet werden, um Endkunden wie Haushalte sowie kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen angesichts der hohen Energiepreise finanziell zu entlasten.\n\nDas österreichische Bundesgesetz über den Energiekrisenbeitrag-Strom sieht die Abschöpfung von 90 % der Überschusserlöse aus der Stromerzeugung vor. Der Schwellenwert zur Ermittlung der Überschusserlöse lag im Zeitraum 1. Dezember 2022 bis 31. Mai 2023 bei 140 Euro pro MWh bzw. bis zu 176 Euro pro MWh unter Berücksichtigung der anrechenbaren Investitionen in erneuerbare Energien und Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen. Ab 1. Juni 2023 wurde der Schwellenwert aufgrund der mittlerweile gesunkenen Großhandelspreise für Strom auf 120 Euro pro MWh bzw. bis zu 156 Euro pro MWh reduziert.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **WIRTSCHAFTLICHES UMFELD**\n\nNachdem die Weltwirtschaft im Lauf des Jahres 2022 bereits deutlich an Schwung verloren hatte, setzte sich dieser Trend 2023 fort. Im Vorjahr hatte die Energiekrise und der damit verbundene, teilweise drastische Anstieg der Marktpreise für Strom und Erdgas Europa stärker getroffen als die USA, wo die Konjunktur trotz der ausgeprägten Straffung der Geldpolitik robust blieb. Mit einem Plus von 3,3 % fiel das Wachstum in der Eurozone damit 2022 nur moderat aus. Aktuell gehen die Ökonomen mehrheitlich davon aus, dass die in einigen wenigen Ländern einsetzende Rezession von kurzer Dauer sein wird und die Konjunktur sich im nächsten Jahr allgemein wieder verbessern wird. Diese Annahme beruht auf dem im Vergleich zu den Höchstständen deutlichen Rückgang der Energiepreise, den durch die nachlassende Inflation steigenden Realeinkommen sowie auf dem verbesserten weltwirtschaftlichen Umfeld. Für die Eurozone werden für 2023 BIP-Wachstumsraten zwischen 0,4 und 1,1 % bzw. zwischen 1,2 und 1,6 % für 2024 erwartet.\n\nDie österreichische Volkswirtschaft befindet sich gegenwärtig im Sog des internationalen Konjunkturabschwungs in einer Rezession. Nach einem Anstieg um 4,8 % im Jahr 2022 dürfte die Wirtschaftsleistung 2023 um bis zu 0,8 % schrumpfen. Hauptfaktoren dafür sind die Belastungen durch die überdurchschnittlich hohe Inflation, die restriktive Geldpolitik sowie die schwache internationale Wirtschaftsentwicklung. Hinzu kommen eine geringere gesamtwirtschaftliche Nachfrage nach den coronabedingten Aufholeffekten sowie die schwächere wirtschaftliche Entwicklung gerade in den Nachbarländern. Die Industrie leidet unter einem Rückgang bei den Aufträgen und hohem Kostendruck. Für das nächste Jahr wird jedoch eine Belebung der Weltwirtschaft und ein von steigenden Realeinkommen getragenes Wachstum des privaten Konsums erwartet. Damit dürfte das BIP 2024 auch in Österreich etwa um 0,8 bis 1,6 % steigen.\n\n## **ENERGIEWIRTSCHAFTLICHES UMFELD**\n\n|                                                                           |           | 2021/22<br>IST | 2022/23<br>IST |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|\n| Primärenergie und CO2-Zertifikate                                         |           |                |                |\n| Rohölpreis - Brent                                                        | EUR/bbl   | 89,5           | 78,8           |\n| Gaspreis - NCG                                                            | EUR/MWh   | 123,1          | 56,4           |\n| Kohle - API#2                                                             | EUR/Tonne | 258,8          | 150,4          |\n| CO2 - Zertifikate EUA                                                     | EUR/Tonne | 78,0           | 84,2           |\n| Strom - Spot/Forwardmarkt (AT) - \"IST = Spotpreise; Plan = Forwardpreise\" |           |                |                |\n| EEX Grundlaststrom                                                        | EUR/MWh   | 258,7          | 134,4          |\n| EEX Spitzenlaststrom                                                      | EUR/MWh   | 296,3          | 154,8          |\n\nDas Energiegeschäft der EVN ist wesentlich durch externe Einflussfaktoren geprägt. Bei den Haushaltskunden geht vor allem von der Witterung ein starker Einfluss auf die Nachfrage nach Strom, Erdgas und Wärme aus. Die Nachfrage der Industriekunden wiederum ist primär durch die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung bestimmt. Seit Beginn des Ukrainekriegs und der dadurch ausgelösten Energiekrise spielen zudem die Energiesparmaßnahmen, mit denen viele Kunden auf die gestiegenen Energiepreise reagieren, eine wesentliche Rolle. Auch die Marktpreise und damit die Beschaffungspreise der EVN hängen vom geopolitischen Umfeld ab. Für die Energieerzeugung sind das Wind- und Wasserdargebot sowie die Sonneneinstrahlung relevant.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 war der Witterungsverlauf in allen drei Kernmärkten der EVN von milden Temperaturen geprägt. Die Heizgradsumme – sie definiert den temperaturbedingten Energiebedarf – lag in Österreich leicht, in Bulgarien und Nordmazedonien deutlich unter\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\ndem langjährigen Durchschnitt. In Bulgarien erreichte sie sogar nur 77,7 % des üblichen Mittelwerts. Zum Unterschied davon waren die Heizgradsummen im Vorjahr in allen drei Ländern deutlich über dem langjährigen Durchschnitt gelegen.\n\nDie Kühlgradsumme, die den Energiebedarf für Kühlung bemisst, stieg im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 in allen drei Kernmärkten im Vergleich zum Vorjahr deutlich an. In Österreich kam sie leicht, in Bulgarien und Nordmazedonien deutlich über dem langjährigen Durchschnitt zu liegen.\n\nNach den massiven Schwankungen und Verwerfungen im vorangegangenen Geschäftsjahr waren die Primärenergie- und Energiepreise in der Berichtsperiode vor allem während der Sommermonate wieder rückläufig. So halbierte sich der durchschnittliche EEX-Börsepreis für Erdgas von zuvor 123,1 Euro pro MWh auf rund 56,4 Euro pro MWh. Gegen Ende des Berichtsjahres zeichnete sich hier allerdings wieder ein gegenläufiger Trend ab. Eine Ausnahme bildeten die Preise für CO2-Emissionszertifikate: Ihr Preis unterlag zwar geringeren Schwankungen, lag im Schnitt aber mit 84,2 Euro pro Tonne im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 um rund 8 % über dem Vorjahreswert von 78,0 Euro pro Tonne.\n\nDies wirkte sich auch auf die Marktpreise für Strom entsprechend aus: Sie verzeichneten im Berichtsjahr zwar einen deutlichen Rückgang, blieben aber dennoch auf hohem Niveau: Die Spotmarktpreise für Grund- und Spitzenlaststrom lagen bei durchschnittlich 134,4 Euro pro MWh bzw. 154,8 Euro pro MWH (Vorjahr: 258,7 Euro pro MWh bzw. 296,3 Euro pro MWh).\n\n## **WIRTSCHAFTLICHE ENTWICKLUNG**\n\n## **Kennzahlen zur Ertragslage**\n\n|              | 2022/23  | 2021/22  | Veränderung |       |\n|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|-------|\n|              | Mio.

EUR und setzen sich aus Stromerlösen in Höhe von 485,4 Mio. EUR (VJ: 550,3 Mio. EUR), Gaserlösen in Höhe von 242,0 Mio. EUR (VJ: 55,9 Mio. EUR) und sonstigen Umsatzerlösen in Höhe von 209,0 Mio. EUR (VJ: 184,0 Mio. EUR) zusammen.\n\nDie Stromerlöse sanken gegenüber dem Vorjahr um 64,9 Mio. EUR, während die Gaserlöse um 186,0 Mio. EUR und die sonstigen Umsatzerlöse um 25,0 Mio. EUR stiegen. Die Stromerlöse sanken trotz höherer Energieabsatzpreise, was in erster Linie auf positive Effekte aus Absicherungsgeschäften im Vorjahr und gesunkene Erlöse aus dem CO2- Zertifikatehandel zurückzuführen ist. Der Anstieg der Gaserlöse resultiert hauptsächlich aus gestiegenen Absatzpreisen und Arbitragegeschäften zur Optimierung der Nutzung der zur Verfügung stehenden Gasspeicherkapazitäten. Die Preiseffekte gegenüber dem Vorjahr sind also sowohl im Strom- als auch im Gasbereich der Marktpreisentwicklung entgegengesetzt.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nDas begründet sich daraus, dass die EVN AG den Großteil ihrer absatz- und beschaffungsseitigen Geschäfte mehrere Monate im Voraus kontrahiert.\n\n|                                       | Berechnung                                                                                | 2022/23  | 2021/22  | Veränderung |       |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-------------|-------|\n|                                       |                                                                                           | Mio.

EUR (Vorjahr: 48,4 Mio. EUR). Der Rückgang ist auf den Wegfall von Einmaleffekten aus der Auflösung von Rückstellungen im Vorjahr und auf positive Effekte aus Absicherungsgeschäften im Vorjahr zurückzuführen.\n\nDie Aufwendungen für Primärenergie, CO2-Kosten und Strombezug betrugen im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr 682,5 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 564,7 Mio. EUR). Der Anstieg ist in erster Linie auf einen preisbedingten Anstieg der Aufwendungen für Strom- und Gasbezug zurückzuführen. Dieser Effekt wird abgeschwächt durch gesunkene Aufwendungen für CO2 Zertifikate und positive Effekte aus beschaffungsseitigen Derivaten.\n\nAn Materialaufwand und sonstigen bezogenen Leistungen fielen 105,5 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 91,9 Mio. EUR) an. Dies bedeutet gegenüber dem Vorjahr einen Anstieg von 13,6 Mio. EUR.\n\nDer Personalaufwand betrug im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 96,6 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 73,5 Mio. EUR) und ist insbesondere aufgrund von kollektivvertraglichen Anpassungen und Rückstellungsbildungen gegenüber dem Vorjahr gestiegen. Bei der EVN AG waren durchschnittlich 561 Angestellte auf Vollzeitbasis (Vorjahr: 546 Angestellte) beschäftigt. Daraus resultierte ein Personalaufwand pro Mitarbeiter von 0,2 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 0,1 Mio. EUR). Der Umsatz pro Mitarbeiter betrug 1,7 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 1,4 Mio. EUR).\n\nDie Abschreibungen betrugen im Berichtszeitraum 6,5 Mio. EUR und sind damit um 0,1 Mio. EUR höher als im Vorjahr.\n\nDie sonstigen betrieblichen Aufwendungen beliefen sich auf 31,4 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr 27,6 Mio. EUR).\n\nAufgrund der oben angeführten Rahmenbedingungen verzeichnete die EVN AG ein positives Betriebsergebnis in Höhe von 15,1 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr 74,0 Mio. EUR).\n\nDas Finanzergebnis ist vor allem durch Beteiligungserträge, Zinsaufwendungen und -erträge, Wertpapiererträgen und Aufwendungen aus Finanzanlagen geprägt. Das Beteiligungsergebnis stieg gegenüber dem Vorjahr von 300,5 Mio. EUR auf 431,1 Mio. EUR, getrieben durch die höhere Verbund-Dividende. Die sonstigen Zinsen und ähnlichen Erträgen beliefen sich auf 29,6 Mio. EUR (VJ: 8,7 Mio. EUR). Die Erträge aus dem Abgang von und der Zuschreibung zu Finanzanlagen sanken auf 1,9 Mio. EUR (VJ: 8,7 Mio. EUR). Die Aufwendungen aus Finanzanlagen und aus Wertpapieren des Umlaufvermögens stiegen vor allem wegen höherer Abschreibungen auf Anteile an verbundenen Unternehmen auf 33,8 Mio. EUR (VJ: 24,5 Mio. EUR). Die Zinsen und ähnlichen Aufwendungen betrugen im Geschäftsjahr 69,0 Mio. EUR (VJ: 34,6 Mio. EUR).\n\nInsgesamt konnte ein Finanzergebnis in Höhe von 389,6 Mio. EUR erzielt werden, welches um 112,9 Mio. EUR oder 40,8 % über dem Vorjahr liegt.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie beschriebenen Entwicklungen führten zu einem Ergebnis vor Steuern von 404,7 Mio. EUR. Dies bedeutet einen Anstieg von 54,0 Mio. EUR. Das Ergebnis vor Zinsen und Steuern erhöhte sich um 88,4 Mio. EUR auf 473,8 Mio. EUR.\n\n|                          | Berechnung                                              | 2022/23 | 2021/22 |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                          |                                                         | %       | %       |\n| Eigenkapitalrentabilität | Ergebnis vor Steuern<br>durchschnittliches Eigenkapital | 14,6%   | 14,2%   |\n\nDie Eigenkapitalrentabilität belief sich im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 auf 14,6%.

EUR belief sich der Cashflow aus dem Ergebnis im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr auf 541,5 Mio. EUR und der Cashflow aus der laufenden Geschäftstätigkeit auf 402,5 Mio. EUR.\n\nDer Cashflow aus der Investitionstätigkeit betrug -536,4 Mio. EUR, wobei die Veränderung zum Vorjahr vor allem auf höhere Investitionen in Finanzanlagen bei geringeren Einzahlungen aus Anlagenabgängen zurückzuführen ist.\n\nAusgehend von der im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 durchgeführten Ausschüttung aus dem Bilanzgewinn 2021/22 in Höhe von 92,7 Mio. EUR und einem Anstieg der Finanzverbindlichkeiten weist die EVN AG einen Cashflow aus der Finanzierungstätigkeit in Höhe von 10,6 Mio. EUR aus.\n\nInsgesamt resultierte aus dieser Entwicklung eine Reduktion des Finanzmittelbestandes (bestehend aus Forderungen aus Cash Pooling, Taggeldguthaben bei Kreditinstituten und Wertpapieren des Umlaufvermögens) von -123,8 Mio. EUR. Die Veränderung der Verbindlichkeiten aus Cash Pooling werden im Cashflow aus der Finanzierungstätigkeit ausgewiesen.\n\n## **Zweigniederlassungen**\n\nEVN verfügt über keine Zweigniederlassungen im Sinne des § 243 Abs 3 Z 4 UGB.\n\n## **Innovation, Forschung und Entwicklung**\n\nDie Handlungsfelder der Wesentlichkeitsmatrix der EVN geben auch den Themenrahmen für die Innovations-, Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivitäten der Gruppe vor. In diesem Sinn verfolgt die EVN primär Projekte zur Gewährleistung der Versorgungssicherheit, zur Schonung von Klima und Umwelt sowie zur Stärkung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit des Unternehmens. Übergeordnetes Kriterium ist bei allen Projekten die Anforderung, einen konkreten Kundennutzen zu erbringen.\n\nIn der Berichtsperiode hat die EVN insgesamt 1,0 Mio. Euro (Vorjahr: 1,8 Mio. Euro) für Innovations-, Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekte aufgewendet. Für diese Projekte wurden Förderungen in Anspruch genommen, die einer Förderquote von 11,0 % entsprechen.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nEin wesentlicher Schwerpunkt in den Innovationsaktivitäten der EVN gilt Lösungen zur Speicherung erneuerbarer Überschussproduktion für Perioden mit geringer Energieerzeugung aus erneuerbaren Quellen. Besonders in saisonaler Hinsicht ist dies die zu lösende Herausforderung für ein CO2-freies Energiesystem. Denn während die Stromerzeugung aus Windkraft und Photovoltaik im Sommerhalbjahr dank des forcierten Ausbaus mittlerweile häufig die Nachfrage deutlich übersteigt, können Perioden mit geringem Wasser-, Wind- und Sonnenaufkommen in Zentraleuropa – vor allem im Winterhalbjahr – zu herausfordernden Situationen für die Versorgungssicherheit führen. Vor diesem Hintergrund engagiert sich die EVN z. B. als Projektpartner der RAG bei einer Pilotanlage, die Sonnenenergie zum Betrieb einer Elektrolyseanlage nutzt. Der dadurch produzierte grüne Wasserstoff wird in eine natürliche Erdgasspeicherspeicherstätte der RAG eingespeichert und kann im Winter zur emissionsfreien Energie- bzw. Wärmeerzeugung genutzt werden. In anderen Projekten forscht die EVN an Möglichkeiten, Überschussproduktion aus erneuerbaren Quellen für sektorenübergreifende Zwecke oder zur Substitution thermischer Erzeugung zu nutzen. Ein Beispiel ist der Pilot-Hybridspeicher Theiß, eine Kombination eines Wärmespeichers mit einem 5-MW-Batteriespeicher und einer Photovoltaikanlage.\n\nWeitere Forschungsschwerpunkte der EVN betreffen innovative Ansätze zur vermehrten Nutzung von Flexibilitäten verschiedener Abnehmer und kleinerer Stromproduzenten, um die Energienachfrage zeitlich so zu verändern, dass Nachfragespitzen vermieden und der Bedarf mit den gerade verfügbaren Energiemengen aus erneuerbarer Produktion gedeckt werden kann. Beiträge leisten in diesem Bereich etwa die 2022 von der EVN erworbene Tochtergesellschaft CyberGrid mit speziellen IT-Lösungen zum Flexibilitätsmanagement von Stromnetzen sowie Einzelprojekte (z. B. solche zum bidirektionalen Laden von E-Fahrzeugen) im Rahmen des Green Energy Lab, eines branchenübergreifenden Innovationslabors.\n\n## **Risikomanagement**\n\n## **Risikodefinition**\n\nIm EVN Konzern ist Risiko als die potenzielle Abweichung von geplanten Unternehmenszielen definiert.\n\n## **Risikomanagementprozess**\n\nPrimäres Ziel des Risikomanagements ist die gezielte Sicherung bestehender und zukünftiger Ertrags- und Cash-Flow-Potenziale durch aktive Risikosteuerung. Dazu stellt ein zentral organisiertes Risikomanagement den dezentralen Risikoverantwortlichen im Rahmen des Risikomanagementprozesses geeignete Methoden und Werkzeuge zur Identifikation und Bewertung von Risiken zur Verfügung. Die risikoverantwortlichen Geschäftseinheiten kommunizieren ihre Risikopositionen an das zentrale Risikomanagement. Hier werden geeignete Maßnahmen zur Risikominimierung definiert, für deren Umsetzung wiederum die dezentralen Geschäftseinheiten verantwortlich sind. Ebenso erfolgt hier die Analyse des Risikoprofils der EVN. Die jährliche Erfassung und das Management von Risiken mit Bezug auf Nachhaltigkeit, Klima und Compliance erfolgen im Einklang mit dem zentralen Risikomanagementprozess durch darauf spezialisierte Organisationseinheiten bzw. Prozesse. Insgesamt umfasst der Risikomanagementprozess der EVN die folgenden Schritte:\n\n• **Identifikation:** Erhebung bzw. Überarbeitung der Risiken auf Basis der letzten Risikoinventur (Review des Risikoinventars) und Identifikation von neuen Risiken und entsprechenden Risikosteuerungsmaßnahmen\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **Bewertung und Analyse:** Qualitative und quantitative Bewertung der identifizierten Risiken, Aggregation der Risiken nach unterschiedlichen Betrachtungsperspektiven und Modellierung der Ergebnis- und Cash-Flow-Verteilungen\n- **Berichterstattung:** Diskussion und Beurteilung des Risikoprofils im Risikoarbeitsausschuss und im Konzernrisikoausschuss sowie gegebenenfalls Einleitung von weiteren Risikosteuerungsmaßnahmen; Risikoberichterstattung an den Prüfungsausschuss\n- **Prozess-Review:** Definition jener organisatorischen Einheiten, die einer expliziten Risikobetrachtung zu unterziehen sind; regelmäßige Überprüfung, ob die festgelegten Methoden bei geänderten Verhältnissen modifiziert werden müssen; regelmäßige Prüfung durch die Interne Revision\n\n## **Aufgaben des Risikoarbeitsausschusses**\n\nDer Risikoarbeitsausschuss unterstützt das zentrale Risikomanagement bei der ordnungsgemäßen Umsetzung des Risikomanagementprozesses. Er beurteilt und genehmigt Änderungen in Bezug auf die (Bewertungs-)Methodik und definiert Art und Umfang der Risikoberichterstattung. Mitglieder des Risikoarbeitsausschusses auf Konzernebene sind die Leiter der Konzernfunktionen Controlling, Recht und Public Affairs, Finanzwesen, Rechnungswesen, Interne Revision, der Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) sowie ein (unternehmensinterner) energiewirtschaftlicher Experte.\n\n## **Konzernrisikoausschuss und Kontrolle**\n\nIm Konzernrisikoausschuss, der aus dem Vorstand der EVN AG, den Leitern der Organisationseinheiten und den Mitgliedern des Risikoarbeitsausschusses besteht, werden die Ergebnisse der Risikoinventur sowie die Berichte präsentiert und diskutiert. Er entscheidet über den weiteren Handlungsbedarf, kann Arbeitsgruppen einberufen sowie Arbeitsaufträge erteilen und verabschiedet die Ergebnisse der Risikoinventur (Risikoberichte).\n\n## **Risikoprofil**\n\nNeben den branchenüblichen Risiken und Ungewissheiten ist das Risikoprofil der EVN vor allem durch politische, rechtliche und regulatorische Herausforderungen und Veränderungen im Wettbewerbsumfeld geprägt. Im Rahmen der jährlich durchgeführten Risikoinventur, deren Ergebnisse im Bedarfsfall um Ad-hoc-Risikomeldungen aktualisiert werden, erfolgt eine Kategorisierung in Markt- und Wettbewerbs-, Finanz-, Betriebs-, Umfeld-, Strategie- und Planungsrisiken sowie sonstige Risiken. Diese werden großteils bezüglich ihrer finanziellen Auswirkungen auf den EVN Konzern bewertet. In der nachfolgenden Tabelle werden die entsprechend diesen Kategorien ermittelten wesentlichen Risiken sowie Maßnahmen zu deren Minimierung beschrieben.\n\nIn der Risikoinventur werden in der EVN im Sinn des NaDiVeG sowohl potenzielle Risiken als auch Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN und ihrer Geschäftsbeziehungen auf Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelange, die Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Bekämpfung von Korruption systematisch erhoben. Die identifizierten Risiken bzw. Auswirkungen wurden entsprechend den im Risikomanagementprozess vorgesehenen Schritten weiter behandelt.\n\n## **Potenzielle Klimarisiken**\n\nAngesichts des hohen Stellenwerts des Themas Klimaschutz bei der EVN werden im Zuge der Risikoinventur gezielt auch potenzielle Klimarisiken erhoben. Klimarisiko ist jedoch bewusst nicht als eigene Risikokategorie definiert, sondern wird – sofern zutreffend – als Querschnittsmaterie den einzelnen Risikokategorien der EVN zugeordnet. Dabei wird zwischen Transitionsrisiken und physischen Risiken unterschieden.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nZu den Transitionsrisiken zählen Unsicherheiten, die aus dem Übergang in Richtung eines erneuerbaren Energiesystems resultieren. Physische Risiken betreffen hingegen Ereignisse und Veränderungen, die unmittelbare klimatische Ursachen haben.\n\nIm Folgenden einige Beispiele, die die Zuordnung potenzieller Klimarisiken zu den Risikokategorien der EVN illustrieren:\n\n- Nachfragerückgang aufgrund eines milderen Winters: physisches Risiko, das der Kategorie Deckungsbeitragsrisiko zugeordnet wird\n- Rückgang der Stromproduktion durch ein klimabedingt geringes Wasserdargebot: physisches Risiko, das der Kategorie Deckungsbeitragsrisiko zugeordnet wird\n- Schaden durch ein Extremwetterereignis: physisches Risiko, das der Kategorie Störungen/Netzausfall zugeordnet wird\n- Änderung von Umweltauflagen: Transitionsrisiko, das der Kategorie Umfeldrisiko zugeordnet wird; strengere Auflagen könnten potenziell Mehrkosten verursachen\n- Zunehmende Belastung für das Stromnetz durch den laufenden Ausbau der deutlich volatileren, erneuerbaren Erzeugung: Transitionsrisiko, das der Kategorie Betriebsrisiko (Störungen/Netzausfall) zugeordnet wird\n\n## **Risiko- und Chancenanalysen im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23**\n\nVor dem Hintergrund der geopolitischen Krisen während der vergangenen beiden Jahre und der daraus resultierenden Verwerfungen auf den Energiemärkten führt EVN auch unterjährig ein engmaschiges Monitoring der Risikoentwicklung für die Gruppe durch. Adhoc-Analysen waren im Berichtszeitraum nicht erforderlich, es erfolgte jedoch zum Ende des ersten Halbjahres 2022/23 eine Aktualisierung der Bewertung der wesentlichen Risiken mit potenziell hohen Auswirkungen. Das Risikomanagement berichtete über diese Risiken sowie deren Auswirkungen auch dem Prüfungsausschuss des Aufsichtsrats der EVN.\n\nIn der zum Bilanzstichtag durchgeführten Risikoinventur wurden u. a. folgende wesentliche Unsicherheiten mit potenziell hohen Auswirkungen identifiziert und folglich mit besonderem Augenmerk analysiert (Auswahl):\n\n- Margenrisiko und Wettbewerbssituation; Weitergabemöglichkeit der Energiebeschaffungskosten an Endkunden\n- Inflationsbedingt steigende Beschaffungskosten für Investitionen und Instandhaltungsmaßnahmen\n- Fertigstellungsrisiko bei internationalen Großprojekten im Umweltbereich\n- Cybersecurity\n\nDas Risikoprofil des EVN Konzerns ist vor allem durch die branchenüblichen Risiken und Ungewissheiten und insbesondere durch politische, rechtliche und regulatorische Herausforderungen geprägt. Die Kategorisierung all dieser Aspekte folgt dem Risikomanagementprozess der EVN.\n\n## **Wesentliche Merkmale des internen Kontroll- und -Risikomanagementsystems im Hinblick auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess**\n\nDie Einrichtung eines angemessenen internen Kontroll- und Risikomanagementsystems (IKS) im Hinblick auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess liegt gemäß § 82 AktG in der Verantwortung des Vorstands und ist gemäß § 92 Abs. 4a Z. 4b AktG vom Prüfungsausschuss auf seine Wirksamkeit hin zu überwachen.\n\nDas IKS für den Rechnungslegungsprozess der EVN wird durch Kontrollen der identifizierten risikobehafteten Prozesse in regelmäßigen Abständen überwacht, und die Ergebnisse daraus werden dem Management und dem Prüfungsausschuss berichtet. Das IKS gewährleistet klare Zuständigkeiten und eliminiert überflüssige Prozessschritte, wodurch die Sicherheit in den Abläufen für die Erstellung der Finanzberichterstattung weiter erhöht wird.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie Beschreibung der wesentlichen Merkmale besteht aus den fünf zusammenhängenden Komponenten Kontrollumfeld, Risikobeurteilung, Kontrollmaßnahmen, Information und Kommunikation sowie Überwachung.\n\n## **Kontrollumfeld**\n\nDer von der EVN festgelegte Verhaltenskodex und die darin zugrunde gelegten Wertvorstellungen gelten für alle Mitarbeiter des gesamten Konzerns. Zum EVN Verhaltenskodex siehe www.evn.at/verhaltenskodex.\n\nDie Erstellung des Jahresabschlusses erfolgt durch die kaufmännischen Konzernfunktionen der EVN. Der Abschlussprozess der EVN basiert auf einer einheitlichen Bilanzierungsrichtlinie, die neben den Bilanzierungsvorschriften auch die wesentlichen Prozesse und Termine konzernweit festlegt. Für die konzerninternen Abstimmungen und die sonstigen Abschlussarbeiten bestehen verbindliche Anweisungen. Die am Rechnungslegungsprozess beteiligten Mitarbeiter erfüllen die qualitativen Anforderungen und werden regelmäßig geschult. Komplexe versicherungsmathematische Gutachten und Bewertungen werden durch darauf spezialisierte Dienstleister oder qualifizierte Mitarbeiter erstellt. Für die Einhaltung der Prozesse sowie der korrespondierenden Kontrollmaßnahmen sind die jeweiligen Prozessverantwortlichen – das sind im Wesentlichen die Leiter der Organisationseinheiten sowie der Konzernfunktionen – verantwortlich.\n\n## **Risikobeurteilung und Kontrollmaßnahmen**\n\nZur Vermeidung von wesentlichen Fehldarstellungen bei der Abbildung von Transaktionen wurden mehrstufig aufgebaute Sicherungsmaßnahmen mit dem Ziel implementiert, dass die Einzelabschlüsse sämtlicher Tochtergesellschaften richtig erfasst werden. Diese Maßnahmen umfassen sowohl automatisierte Kontrollen in der Konsolidierungssoftware als auch manuelle Kontrollen in den kaufmännischen Konzernfunktionen. Auf Basis der Abschlüsse der Tochterunternehmen führen diese Fachabteilungen umfangreiche Plausibilitätsüberprüfungen durch, damit die Daten der Einzelabschlüsse ordnungsgemäß in den Konzernabschluss übernommen werden. Die Überprüfung der Abschlussdaten sieht vor, dass die Daten vor und nach der Konsolidierung zentral auf Positions-, Segment- und Konzernebene analysiert werden. Erst nach Durchführung dieser Qualitätskontrollen auf allen Stufen erfolgt die Freigabe des Konzernabschlusses.\n\nDas Rechnungswesen der EVN AG und der wichtigsten in- und ausländischen Tochtergesellschaften wird mit dem ERP-Softwaresystem SAP, Modul FI (Finanz- /Rechnungswesen) geführt. Die Erstellung des Konzernabschlusses nach IFRS erfolgt mit der Software Hyperion Financial Management, in die die Werte der Einzelabschlüsse der konsolidierten Gesellschaften mittels Schnittstelle übernommen werden. Die Rechnungswesensysteme sowie alle vorgelagerten Systeme sind durch Zugriffsberechtigungen und automatische sowie zwingend im Prozess vorgesehene manuelle Kontrollschritte geschützt.\n\nDas IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung und die für das Rechnungswesen relevanten Prozesse werden mindestens einmal jährlich vom zuständigen Assessor dahingehend überprüft, ob die Kontrollen durchgeführt worden sind, ob es im Geschäftsjahr Risikovorfälle gegeben hat und ob die Kontrollen weiterhin geeignet sind, die vorhandenen Risiken abzudecken. Im Berichtszeitraum wurden im Sinn der kontinuierlichen Weiterentwicklung des IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung Prozessanpassungen und verbesserungen durchgeführt.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Information, Kommunikation und Überwachung**\n\nDer Aufsichtsrat wird vom Vorstand vierteljährlich mit einem umfassenden Bericht über die Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage, der sowohl eine Bilanz als auch eine Gewinn-und-Verlust-Rechnung enthält, informiert. Darüber hinaus ergeht zweimal jährlich ein Bericht über das IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung an den Vorstand und den Prüfungsausschuss, der als Informationsgrundlage zur Beurteilung der Effizienz und Effektivität des IKS dient und die Steuerbarkeit des IKS durch die dafür vorgesehenen Gremien gewährleisten soll. Dieser Bericht erfolgt durch das IKS-Management in Zusammenarbeit mit dem IKS-Komitee auf Basis der Informationen der IKS-Bereichsverantwortlichen, der Kontrolldurchführenden und der Assessoren.\n\nZur Wahrnehmung der Überwachungs- und Kontrollfunktion im Hinblick auf eine ordnungsgemäße Rechnungslegung und Berichterstattung werden die relevanten Informationen zudem auch den Leitungsorganen und wesentlichen Mitarbeitern der jeweiligen Gesellschaft zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Interne Revision der EVN führt regelmäßig Prüfungen des IKS für die Finanzberichterstattung durch, deren Ergebnisse ebenfalls bei den laufenden Verbesserungen des IKS Berücksichtigung finden.\n\n## **Einsatz von Finanzinstrumenten**\n\nDie EVN setzt derivative Finanzinstrumente zur Absicherung des Unternehmens gegen Marktpreisänderungs-, Liquiditäts-, Wechselkurs- und Zinsänderungsrisiken ein. Zu diesem Zweck hat das Unternehmen ein Kontrollumfeld geschaffen, welches im Rahmen des Risikomanagements Richtlinien und Abläufe für die Beurteilung der Anwendung von Derivaten umfasst. Weitere Informationen finden sich im Anhang der EVN AG im Kapitel 3.2.7.\n\n## **Gesamtrisikoprofil**\n\nNeben den Ungewissheiten im Zusammenhang mit Geschäftsfeldern und -betrieben außerhalb Österreichs ist die EVN auch im Heimmarkt Niederösterreich mit einem weiterhin herausfordernden Umfeld konfrontiert. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 haben die Unsicherheiten allerdings abgenommen. Damit hat sich das Gesamtrisikoprofil der EVN tendenziell reduziert, jedoch noch nicht bis auf das Vorkrisenniveau. Gegenwärtig sind keine Risiken für die Zukunft erkennbar, die den Fortbestand des EVN Konzerns gefährden könnten.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn der folgenden Tabelle werden die wesentlichen Risiken und Ungewissheiten zusammenfassend erläutert. Erstmals werden in dieser Tabelle, sofern zutreffend, auch die Chancen für die einzelnen Kategorien erwähnt.\n\n| Risiko-/Chancenkategorie                                                                 | Beschreibung                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Maßnahme zur<br>Risikominimierung                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Markt- und Wettbewerbsrisiken/-chancen                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Deckungsbeitragsrisiko/-<br>chance<br>(Preis- und<br>Mengeneffekte)                      | Energievertrieb und -produktion:<br>Nichterreichen der geplanten<br>Deckungsbeiträge<br>• Volatile bzw. vom Plan<br>abweichende Bezugs-<br>und Absatzpreise (insb. für<br>Energieträger)<br>• Nachfragerückgänge (insb.<br>beeinflusst durch Witterung<br>bzw.

Per 30. September 2023 betrug das Grundkapital der EVN AG 330.000.000 Euro und war unterteilt in 179.878.402 Stück auf Inhaber lautende nennwertlose Stückaktien, die jeweils im gleichen Umfang am Grundkapital beteiligt sind. Der Anspruch auf Einzelverbriefung der Aktien ist ausgeschlossen. Es existiert nur diese eine Aktiengattung. Alle Aktien verkörpern die gleichen Rechte und Pflichten und werden auf dem Prime Market der Wiener Börse gehandelt.\n- 2. Es gibt keine über die Bestimmungen des Aktiengesetzes hinausgehenden Beschränkungen der Stimmrechte bzw. Vereinbarungen über die Beschränkung der Übertragbarkeit von Aktien. Hinzuweisen ist jedoch darauf, dass die Übertragbarkeit der Beteiligung des Landes Niederösterreich, das seine Anteile über die NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH, St. Pölten, hält, durch bundes- und landesverfassungsgesetzliche Bestimmungen eingeschränkt ist.\n\nDie NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding GmbH (\"NLH\") und die Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH (\"WSTW\") haben am 23. September 2021 eine steuerliche Beteiligungsgemeinschaft gegründet, wofür sie einen \"Vertrag über die Bildung einer steuerlichen Beteiligungsgemeinschaft betreffend Anteile der Parteien an der EVN AG\" abgeschlossen haben. Dieser Vertrag sieht grundsätzlich eine syndizierte Ausübung der Stimmrechte von NLH und WSTW in der Hauptversammlung der EVN AG vor, bildet aber nur das sich ohnehin nach Gesetz und/oder Satzung auf Grund des jeweiligen Aktienbesitzes von NLH und WSTW ergebende Stimmgewicht in der Hauptversammlung ab (im Ergebnis verfügt NLH weiterhin über die einfache (nicht aber eine qualifizierte) Mehrheit und WSTW weiterhin über eine Sperrminorität).\n\n- 3. Auf Basis dieser verfassungsrechtlichen Vorschriften ist das Land Niederösterreich mit 51,0 % Mehrheitsaktionär der EVN AG. Zweitgrößter Aktionär der EVN AG ist mit 28,4 % die Wiener Stadtwerke GmbH, Wien, die zu 100 % im Eigentum der Stadt Wien steht. Der Anteil der von der EVN AG gehaltenen eigenen Aktien betrug zum Stichtag 0,9 %; der Streubesitz belief sich somit auf 19,7 %.\n- 4. Es wurden keine Aktien mit besonderen Kontrollrechten ausgegeben.\n- 5. Mitarbeiter, die im Besitz von Aktien sind, üben ihr Stimmrecht unmittelbar selbst bei der Hauptversammlung aus. Es besteht in der EVN AG kein Aktienoptionsprogramm.\n- 6. Der Vorstand besteht aus mindestens zwei Mitgliedern. Der Aufsichtsrat besteht aus mindestens acht und höchstens zwölf Mitgliedern. Sofern das Gesetz nicht zwingend eine andere Mehrheit vorschreibt, beschließt die Hauptversammlung mit einfacher Mehrheit der abgegebenen Stimmen und in Fällen, in denen eine Kapitalmehrheit erforderlich ist, mit einfacher Mehrheit des bei der Beschlussfassung vertretenen Grundkapitals.\n- 7. Befugnisse des Vorstands im Sinn des § 243a Abs. 1 Z. 7 UGB, insbesondere hinsichtlich der Möglichkeit, Aktien auszugeben, bestanden im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 nicht. Davon unberührt blieb jedoch die Möglichkeit, bereits zurückgekaufte eigene Aktien an Mitarbeiter auszugeben.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n- 8. Aufgrund der oben, insbesondere in Punkt 2. und 3., erwähnten Rechtslage kann in der EVN AG derzeit ein Kontrollwechsel im Sinn des § 243a Abs. 1 Z. 8 UGB nicht eintreten. Dasselbe gilt für allfällige Folgewirkungen eines Kontrollwechsels.\n- 9.

Oktober 2022 bis 30. September 2023.\n\n## **Analyse wesentlicher Themen und Stakeholder-Einbeziehung**\n\nDie EVN bekennt sich zum Konzept der nachhaltigen Unternehmensführung und strebt in diesem Sinn eine ausgewogene Berücksichtigung ökonomischer, ökologischer und sozialer Gesichtspunkte an. Damit sind alle ethischen, sozialen und umweltbezogenen Aspekte – sprich die Themenfelder Environment, Social und Governance (ESG) – umfasst, für die die EVN auch den Überbegriff \"Nachhaltigkeit\" verwendet. Ein angemessener Ausgleich der Anliegen aller am Unternehmen Interessierten – der Stakeholder – ist dabei das Leitmotiv. Grundlegende Aussagen zu Vision, Mission und Unternehmenswerten sowie verbindliche Dokumente zu konzernweiten Verhaltens- und Handlungsregeln bilden gemeinsam das Wertegerüst der EVN. Als Mitglied des UN Global Compact bekennt sie sich zudem explizit zur Einhaltung globaler Prinzipien ethischen wirtschaftlichen Handelns.\n\nDen Kern des Stakeholder-Managements bildet ein institutionalisierter Dialog mit den diversen Stakeholder-Gruppen, die aus nachstehender Darstellung ersichtlich sind. Ihre Identifikation und Priorisierung erfolgen regelmäßig im Rahmen der Aktualisierung der Wesentlichkeitsmatrix. Dabei überprüft die EVN auch stets die Relevanz der einzelnen Stakeholder-Gruppen für das Unternehmen.\n\nDie EVN Wesentlichkeitsmatrix wird im Dreijahresrhythmus aktualisiert. Die letzte Stakeholder-Befragung fand im Frühjahr 2021 statt. Dazu wurde eine repräsentative Auswahl interner und externer Stakeholder ersucht, mittels Online-Fragebogen die Relevanz der Handlungsfelder sowie deren Auswirkungen auf die Unternehmenstätigkeit zu beurteilen. Ziel dieses strukturierten Erhebungsprozesses war es, auf jene Themen zu fokussieren, die den höchsten Stellenwert für die Stakeholder der EVN aufweisen und gleichzeitig die größten ökonomischen, ökologischen oder sozialen Auswirkungen auf die Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN haben. Die wesentlichsten Themen und Handlungsfelder, auf die sich die Berichterstattung konzentriert, sind jene, die in der Wesentlichkeitsmatrix eine mittlere bis sehr hohe Relevanz für die EVN aufweisen. Im Rahmen eines Lenkungsausschusses Nachhaltigkeit hat die EVN für den Berichtszeitraum validiert und bestätigt, dass die wesentlichsten Themen und Handlungsfelder für die EVN weiterhin gültig sind.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Wichtigste Stakeholder-Gruppen der EVN**\n\nImage /page/149/Figure/2 description: The image contains a diagram and a matrix. The diagram is made up of puzzle pieces arranged in a circular fashion. Each puzzle piece contains a label, such as \"Medien Bürgerbeteiligungen NGOs\", \"Projekt-anrainer\\*innen\", \"Zivilgesellschaft\", \"Wissenschaft Forschung\", \"Politik\", \"Behörden\", \"Kund\\*innen\", \"Kapitalmarkt\", \"Investor\\*innen (institutionelle, private)\", \"Kreditgeber\\*innen Analyst\\*innen\", \"Mitarbeiter\\*innen\", \"Vorstand Führungskräfte Geschäfts-führer\\*innen\", \"Aufsichtsrat\", \"Mitbewerber\\*innen\", \"Interessen-vertretungen\", \"Geschäfts-partner\\*innen\", and \"Verbände Branchenverbände Betriebsrät\\*innen\".

The x-axis is labeled \"Durchschnittliche Auswirkung der Unternehmenstätigkeit\" and ranges from \"Mittel\" to \"Sehr hoch\" with values 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0. The y-axis is labeled \"Durchschnittliche Relevanz für Stakeholder\" and ranges from \"Mittel\" to \"Sehr hoch\" with values 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0. Several data points are plotted on the matrix, including \"Klimaschutz\", \"Versorgungssicherheit\", \"Kund\\*innenorientierung\", \"Innovation und Digitalisierung\", \"Attraktive Arbeitgeberin\", \"Umweltschutz\", \"Stakeholder-Dialog\", and \"Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung\".\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Handlungsfelder**\n\nAls Grundlage für den Abgleich zwischen der Strategie und den Stakeholder-Interessen dient die EVN Wesentlichkeitsmatrix mit ihren acht Handlungsfeldern:\n\n- Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung\n- Versorgungssicherheit\n- Kundenorientierung\n- Attraktive Arbeitgeberin\n- Klimaschutz\n- Umweltschutz\n- Innovation und Digitalisierung\n- Stakeholder-Dialog\n\nDie nachstehende Tabelle liefert einen Überblick hinsichtlich der Zuordnung der einzelnen Handlungsfelder zu den gemäß NaDiVeG geforderten Angaben und Leistungsindikatoren zu den im Fokus stehenden Belangen in Bezug auf Umwelt, Soziales, Arbeitnehmer, Achtung der Menschenrechte und Bekämpfung von Korruption.\n\n| EVN Handlungsfeld                      | Nichtfinanzielle Informationen gem.<br>NaDiVeG                      |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung | Strategie, Achtung der Menschenrechte,<br>Bekämpfung von Korruption |\n| Versorgungssicherheit                  | Strategie                                                           |\n| Kundenorientierung                     | Einbindung Stakeholder                                              |\n| Attraktiver Arbeitgeber                | Arbeitnehmerbelange, Achtung der<br>Menschenrechte, Sozialbelange   |\n| Klimaschutz                            | Umweltbelange                                                       |\n| Umweltschutz                           | Umweltbelange                                                       |\n| Innovation und Digitalisierung         | Strategie, Arbeitnehmerbelange                                      |\n| Stakeholder-Dialog                     | Einbindung der Stakeholder, Sozialbelange                           |\n\n## **Nachhaltigkeitsorganisation**\n\nDie folgende Darstellung illustriert die Nachhaltigkeitsorganisation der EVN, die – im Einklang mit der europäischen Best Practice – insbesondere den folgenden Grundsätzen folgt:\n\n- In der EVN ist die Verantwortung für das Themenfeld Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) – also sämtliche Aspekte und Agenden in Sachen Umweltschutz, Soziales und nachhaltige Unternehmensführung – und deren Weiterentwicklung beim Gesamtvorstand und damit auf der höchsten Unternehmensebene angesiedelt. Alle diese Themen fließen in die EVN Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie ein, die ihrerseits von der (ebenfalls vom Vorstand verantworteten) Konzernstrategie abgeleitet wird. Zudem tauscht sich der Vorstand regelmäßig mit dem Aufsichtsrat zur Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie aus und berichtet diesem quartalsweise über wesentliche Entwicklungen und Maßnahmen im ESG-Bereich. Angesichts der hohen Relevanz von ESG-Themen und um die Nachhaltigkeitsexpertise im Prüfungsausschuss noch stärker zu verankern, wurde im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 zusätzlich eine Nachhaltigkeitsexpertin in den Prüfungsausschuss des Aufsichtsrats bestellt.\n- Vierteljährlich tagt zudem der Lenkungsausschuss Nachhaltigkeit, der sich aus dem Gesamtvorstand, aus Führungskräften, aus Geschäftsführern der wesentlichen österreichischen und internationalen Konzerngesellschaften sowie aus Mitgliedern eines abteilungsübergreifenden Nachhaltigkeitsteams zusammensetzt. Das Gremium behandelt aktuelle ESG-Themen, beschließt wesentliche ESG-Aktivitäten und stellt dank seiner breiten Zusammensetzung sicher, dass die behandelten Strategien, Maßnahmen und Ziele operativ auf den Gesamtkonzern ausgerollt und flächendeckend umgesetzt werden.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **EVN Nachhaltigkeitsorganisation**\n\nImage /page/151/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram outlining the structure of sustainability management within an organization.

Oberstes Prinzip ist dabei die angemessene und gut ausbalancierte Berücksichtigung jener Anliegen, die von verschiedenen Stakeholder-Gruppen an die EVN herangetragen werden. Ein regelmäßiger, proaktiver und offener Dialog mit diesen Stakeholdern ist daher auch im EVN Verhaltenskodex als wichtiger Managementgrundsatz verankert.\n\n27\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Projektkommunikation**\n\nDie EVN hält engen und offenen Kontakt zu relevanten NGOs und Interessenvertretungen, um vertrauensvolle und langfristige Beziehungen zu entwickeln. Dieser offene Austausch fördert gegenseitiges Verständnis und ist die entscheidende Voraussetzung dafür, dass im Fall divergierender Interessen gemeinsam Lösungen gefunden werden können. Neben einer höherer Planungsqualität und -sicherheit hat dies auch den positiven Effekt, dass die Kommunikation mit Anrainern und lokalen Initiativen intensiver und professioneller wird. Dabei fließt die Erfahrung aus bereits realisierten Projekten ebenfalls positiv mit ein.\n\nVon Beginn der Planung an werden sowohl ökologische als auch soziale Aspekte in die Projektentwicklung und auch in die Due-Diligence-Prüfungen einbezogen. Diese Prüfungen, die vor jedem Projektstart durchgeführt werden, bilden die Grundlage für interne Entscheidungsprozesse des Vorstands und bei größeren Projekten auch des Aufsichtsrats. Der intensive Dialog verfolgt dabei insbesondere die folgenden Ziele:\n\n- Hohe Akzeptanz bei allen Stakeholdern\n- Unterstützung der Realisierbarkeit von Projekten\n- Positive Wahrnehmung des Unternehmens und seiner Aktivitäten\n- Reduktion von Risiken und Vermeidung von Imageschäden\n\n## **Verantwortungsvoller Umgang mit den Anliegen lokaler Stakeholder**\n\nDen Dialog mit den unmittelbar von einem geplanten Projekt der EVN betroffenen Menschen führen wir stets nach folgenden Grundsätzen:\n\n- Frühzeitiges Identifizieren der unterschiedlichen Erwartungen und Ansprüchen\n- Transparente und umfassende Projektinformation\n- Professionelle, strukturierte und proaktive Kommunikation mit allen lokalen Stakeholdern (inklusive politischer Entscheidungsträger)\n- Unterstützung der Kommunen bei der Kommunikation und gegebenenfalls Vermittlung bei Konflikten\n\nDie Informationsaktivitäten zu den verschiedenen Projekten der EVN erfolgen in enger Abstimmung und Zusammenarbeit mit den Projektleitern und -verantwortlichen. Selbstverständlich bietet die EVN die Möglichkeit, dass sich lokale Stakeholder mit ihren Anliegen jederzeit von sich aus an die EVN wenden können. Neben einer direkten Kontaktaufnahme mit den Projektleitern unter der E-Mail-Adresse dialog@evn.at stehen dafür auch das EVN Servicetelefon bzw. die E-Mail-Adresse info@evn.at zur Verfügung.\n\n## **Krisenmanagement**\n\nFür weite Teile der Geschäftstätigkeit – insbesondere für Gefährdungsbereiche, die auch die Bevölkerung sowie die Umwelt betreffen – verfügt die EVN über umfassende Krisen-, Katastrophen- und Notfallpläne sowie über dazugehörige Schulungsprogramme. An allen Standorten werden Maßnahmen für Krisensituationen regelmäßig trainiert. In Niederösterreich veranstaltet die EVN darüber hinaus regelmäßig interne und externe Übungen und Schulungen zum Thema Krisenmanagement abgehalten. Mitarbeiter im Störungsdienst werden laufend geschult, ebenso erfolgen jährlich Trainings für Diensthabenden sowie Sicherheitsunterweisungen für alle Mitarbeiter.\n\n## **Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung der Projektkommunikation**\n\nBei Projekten in den Bereichen erneuerbare Energieerzeugung, Netze und Trinkwasserversorgung sind zwei Trends zu beobachten: Zum einen wird die Öffentlichkeit immer kritischer gegenüber solchen Projekten, und zum anderen steigen die Anforderungen an eine erfolgreiche Projektkommunikation aus Sicht aller Interessengruppen. Als Reaktion darauf hat die EVN das Team \"Projektkommunikation und Klimadialog\" geschaffen und ein spezielles Aus- und Weiterbildungsprogramm entwickelt, das die kommunikativen und strategischen Fähigkeiten der Projektleiter stärken soll.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nExterne Experten begleiteten die Schulung, die insgesamt 40 Stunden umfasste, und vermittelten den Teilnehmern wertvolles Wissen und bewährte Strategien, mit denen eine erfolgreiche Kommunikation mit wichtigen Interessengruppen gewährleistet werden kann. Die Schulungsinhalte umfassten auch den Umgang mit schwierigen Situationen und Konflikten, wie sie bei Infrastrukturprojekten auftreten können. Dank der Schulung können die Teilnehmer nun die Kommunikation mit relevanten Stakeholdern wie NGOs und Bürgerinitiativen optimieren und Konflikte frühzeitig lösen, um Vertrauen und Akzeptanz zu stärken und die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Projekten zu unterstützen.\n\n## **Unterstützung von Interessenvertretungen und Initiativen**\n\nDa die vielfältigen Geschäftsaktivitäten einen wesentlichen Beitrag zum öffentlichen Leben und zur Wirtschaft insgesamt leisten, ist die EVN Mitglied in diversen gesetzlichen und freiwilligen nationalen und internationalen Organisationen und Interessenvertretungen, nicht zuletzt um durch diese Vernetzung die Aufgaben der EVN noch besser und im Sinn der Stakeholder erfüllen zu können. Beispiele für Branchenverbände sind Oesterreichs Energie oder Eurelectric, zu den Initiativen im Kontext sozialer und ökologischer Themen zählen u.a. UN Global Compact oder respACT. Alle Aktivitäten im Zusammenhang mit diesen Mitgliedschaften erfolgen im Einklang mit dem Verhaltensrahmen des Compliance-Management-Systems. Gemäß den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen ist die EVN auch in das österreichische Lobbying- und Interessenvertretungsregister sowie in das Transparenzregister der EU eingetragen.\n\n## **Unternehmensstrategie**\n\nEin klares Wertegerüst und die Fokussierung auf Handlungsfelder, die regelmäßig gemeinsam mit allen Stakeholdern reflektiert und entsprechend priorisiert werden, bilden die Grundlage für das unternehmerische Handeln der EVN. Auf diesem Fundament ruhen nicht nur alle Grundsätze und Regeln in Bezug auf das Verhalten der Mitarbeiter, Lieferanten und Geschäftspartner, sondern die gesamte Konzernstrategie der EVN. In der jährlichen Risikoinventur werden im Sinn des NaDiVeG und der EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung sowohl potenzielle Risiken als auch Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN und ihrer Geschäftsbeziehungen auf Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelange, die Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Bekämpfung von Korruption systematisch erhoben und hinsichtlich ihrer finanziellen Auswirkungen auf den EVN Konzern bewertet. Als wichtigste Verpflichtung gegenüber ihren Kunden betrachtet die EVN die Sicherstellung einer flächendeckenden und stets verlässlichen Versorgung mit ihren Produkten und Dienstleistungen.\n\nAls Energie- und Umweltdienstleisterin sieht sich die EVN in der Verantwortung, einen wesentlichen Beitrag im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel zu leisten. Dies betrifft insbesondere die Minimierung der von der EVN Tätigkeit verursachten Emissionen. Den Fokus legt die EVN hier auch auf den Umbau des Energiesystems in Richtung einer klimaneutralen Erzeugung – und hier vor allem auf den Ausbau der Windkraft- und Photovoltaikkapazitäten. Bereits im Geschäftsjahr 2020/21 hat die EVN die Stromerzeugung aus Kohle endgültig beendet. Im Sommer 2021 trat die EVN der Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) bei und setzte sich insgesamt fünf Reduktionsziele. Damit leistet sie einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Verwirklichung des in Paris vereinbarten Klimaziels, den Anstieg der Erderwärmung auf deutlich unter 2°C zu beschränken. Für das Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 ist die Ausarbeitung eines Transitionsplans auf das 1,5°C-Ziel geplant.\n\nEine wesentliche Rolle spielten im Strategieprozess die für den Energiesektor relevanten internationalen Rahmenwerke wie die Sustainable Development Goals der Vereinten Nationen und die Zielsetzungen der Energie- und Klimapolitik, z. B. das Pariser Klimaabkommen oder der European Green Deal. Denn sie verändern das Umfeld und die für eine Energieversorgerin maßgeblichen rechtlichen und regulatorischen Vorgaben teils massiv.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie bestimmende Veränderung für die Energiebranche – und damit auch ein zentraler Faktor für die EVN Strategie – ergibt sich aus dem gesellschaftlichen und politischen Bestreben, das auf eine möglichst rasche Transformation in ein funktionierendes CO2-freies Energiesystem abzielt, um die branchenspezifischen Klimaeinflüsse noch deutlicher und schneller zu minimieren. Um diesen Entwicklungen in angemessener Weise gerecht zu werden, hat die EVN auf Basis der Strategie 2030 die EVN Klimainitiative entwickelt. Dadurch wurden maßgebliche Zielsetzungen wie die mit der Science Based Targets Initiative akkordierten Dekarbonisierungsziele oder die Klimaneutralität ausgewählter Konzerngesellschaften eng mit der Gesamtstrategie der EVN verknüpft.\n\n## **EVN Klimainitiative**\n\nBasierend auf der Strategie 2030 hat die EVN bereits im Geschäftsjahr 2020/21 die EVN Klimainitiative entwickelt. Sie besteht aus den folgenden drei Säulen und untermauert das Engagement der EVN für den Klimaschutz durch konkrete Maßnahmen, Ziele und Projekte.\n\n- Science Based Targets Initiative\n- Klimaneutralität in ausgewählten Tochtergesellschaften\n- Beitrag von Forschung und Entwicklung zum Klimaschutz\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Unsere Kernstrategien 2030**\n\nImage /page/155/Figure/2 description: The image shows a diagram outlining strategies and trends.

The diagram is divided into three main sections, each with a title in a red circle. The first section, titled \"Wachstum und Effizienzsteigerung in Südosteuropa\" (Growth and Efficiency Increase in Southeastern Europe), lists key points such as high growth potential in renewable energy, the need for efficiency improvements in the grid, and the challenge of progressive liberalization for energy sales. The second section, titled \"Verstärkter Fokus auf Trinkwasserversorgung in Niederösterreich\" (Increased Focus on Drinking Water Supply in Lower Austria), highlights increasing water consumption due to demographic changes and rising quality requirements in water supply. The third section, titled \"Fokussierung auf Konzepte im Bereich Kreislaufwirtschaft\" (Focus on Concepts in the Field of Circular Economy), mentions bans on sewage sludge and stricter EU regulations regarding the separation and recycling of household waste. Below each section, there are further details. For the first section, it includes growth through new wind and photovoltaic projects, commitment to security and quality of supply, reduction of network losses, and efficiency improvements in operations. For the second section, it mentions capacity increases in pumping stations, construction of natural filter systems, and development of new drinking water sources. For the third section, it includes the operation of own plants for thermal waste and sewage sludge treatment in Lower Austria. The bottom of the diagram includes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 in red circles, and the phrases \"Branchenumfeld und Trends\" (Industry Environment and Trends) and \"Unsere Strategie\" (Our Strategy) are also present.\n\n#### **Handlungsfelder**\n\n- **1** Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung **2** Versorgungssicherheit\n- **3** Kund\\*innenorientierung\n\n**4** Innovation und Digitalisierung **5** Klimaschutz **6** Umweltschutz\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit auf Gesellschaft, Umwelt und Wirtschaft**\n\nIm Rahmen der jährlichen Risikoinventur werden im Sinn des NaDiVeG und der EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung sowohl potenzielle Risiken als auch Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit der EVN und ihrer Geschäftsbeziehungen auf Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelange, die Achtung der Menschenrechte und die Bekämpfung von Korruption systematisch erhoben und hinsichtlich ihrer finanziellen Auswirkungen auf die EVN bewertet.\n\nDamit steht ein klar strukturierter und definierter Prozess zur Verfügung, um potenzielle Risiken bzw. Auswirkungen auf unterschiedlichen organisatorischen und hierarchischen Ebenen zu identifizieren und zu analysieren sowie geeignete Gegenmaßnahmen zu entwickeln. Die Einbindung der Führungs- und der Vorstandsebene wird dabei insbesondere dadurch gewährleistet, dass die Erkenntnisse und Analysen der Risikoinventur im Risikoarbeits- und im Konzernrisikoausschuss präsentiert und diskutiert werden.\n\nDie nachfolgende Tabelle fasst die wesentlichen potenziellen Auswirkungen zusammen. Sie enthält zudem beispielhaft Instrumente und Maßnahmen, die – im Einklang mit dem EVN Verhaltenskodex und den übergeordneten Verhaltensnormen zum Thema Compliance – zur Minimierung allfälliger negativer Auswirkungen genutzt bzw. gesetzt werden.\n\n## **Nachhaltigkeits- und insbesondere Klimarisiken im Fokus**\n\nGemäß EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung werden Klimarisiken anhand von Klimaszenarien analysiert. Auch im Rahmen der Risikoinventur werden potenzielle Klimarisiken sowie Auswirkungen der Geschäftstätigkeit im Zusammenhang mit dem Thema Klimawandel erhoben. Im Risikomanagementprozess ist Klimarisiko jedoch bewusst nicht als eigene Risikokategorie definiert, sondern wird als Querschnittsmaterie den einzelnen Risikokategorien der EVN zugeordnet. Dabei wird unterschieden zwischen Transitionsrisiken und physischen Risiken. Zu den Transitionsrisiken zählen Unsicherheiten, die aus dem Übergang in Richtung eines erneuerbaren Energiesystems resultieren. Physische Risiken betreffen hingegen Ereignisse und Veränderungen, die unmittelbare klimatische Ursachen haben.\n\nKlimatisch verursachte Ergebnisschwankungen werden aber nicht nur durch das Risikomanagement erfasst, sondern mögliche quantitative Auswirkungen auch im Planungsprozess in Form entsprechender Sensitivitäts- und Szenarioanalysen analysiert. Vergleichbare Fragestellungen prägen auch die Auswahl der Szenarien für die Betrachtung der künftigen Preisentwicklung von Energie und Primärenergieträgern. Auf dieser Basis werden der Klimawandel und seine Auswirkungen auf die EVN Geschäftstätigkeit auch auf Ebene der Führungskräfte, des Vorstands und des Aufsichtsrats erläutert.\n\nSchäden durch Extremwetterereignisse stellen wiederum eine Bedrohung für die Versorgungssicherheit dar. In einem weiter gefassten Nachhaltigkeitskontext umfassen Risiken in diesem Bereich auch Versorgungsunterbrechungen oder die Gefährdung von Leib und Leben sowie der Infrastruktur durch Explosionen oder Unfälle. Um einen störungsfreien Betrieb und die technische Sicherheit der Kraftwerke – beides maßgebliche Voraussetzungen für eine verlässliche Versorgung – zu gewährleisten, werden regelmäßig Revisionen und Wartungsarbeiten durchgeführt, die geplante Stillstandszeiten mit sich bringen. Tatsächliche Unterbrechungen der Stromversorgung werden im Netzbereich anhand der Kennzahlen System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) – der mittleren Unterbrechungshäufigkeit – und System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) – der durchschnittlichen jährlichen Dauer der ungeplanten Stromunterbrechungen gemessen und überwacht.\n\nArbeitssicherheit und Unfallvermeidung nehmen in allen Einheiten des Unternehmens ebenfalls einen zentralen Stellenwert ein. Das geforderte hohe Sicherheitsniveau wird dabei vor allem durch Schulungen und Bewusstseinsbildung gewährleistet.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nIn Ergänzung der geltenden gesetzlichen Vorschriften wurde dafür ein umfangreiches internes Regelwerk aus Geschäftsanweisungen und Richtlinien entwickelt. Im EVN Konzern werden sämtliche Arbeitsunfälle zentral über den sicherheitstechnischen Dienst erfasst und ausgewertet. Wie in nebenstehender Tabelle beim Handlungsfeld \"Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung\" beschrieben, beziehen sich die Mitarbeiterrisiken aber auch auf den Abgang von hochqualifizierten Mitarbeitern. Diesem Risiko wird vor allem mit der Schaffung eines attraktiven Arbeitsumfelds und mit flexiblen Arbeitszeitmodellen begegnet. In der Risikobetrachtung umfasst sind auch bewusste bzw. unbewusste Fehldarstellungen von Transaktionen bzw. Jahresabschlussposten, die durch das interne Kontrollsystem (IKS) vermieden werden sollen.\n\nDie Erfassung und Analyse der ökologischen Auswirkungen der Unternehmenstätigkeit in Bereichen wie Ressourceneinsatz, Energie- und Wasserverbrauch, Emissionen, Biodiversität, Transport sowie Abwasser und Abfall (Umweltrisiken) obliegen der Stabsstelle Innovation, Nachhaltigkeit und Umweltschutz. Diese unterstützt die operativen Einheiten auf Basis ihrer Analysen auch darin, Umweltauswirkungen zu verhindern bzw. zu minimieren.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Überblick über die wesentlichen potenziellen Auswirkungen unserer Unternehmenstätigkeit (Auswahl)**\n\n#### **EVN Handlungsfeld und Definition**\n\n#### **Nachhaltige Unternehmenswertsteigerung**\n\n… steht für eine unternehmerische Haltung, die bei strategischen Entscheidungen stets auf ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen wertorientierten Investitionen und einer attraktiven Vergütung für die Aktionär\\*innen achtet.

Auch im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 stand das EVN Kundenservice deshalb vor enormen Herausforderungen. Um die Servicequalität kontinuierlich zu steigern, hat die EVN im Berichtszeitraum zudem ein Projekt zur Verbesserung der Resilienz und Stabilität und zur Schaffung einer schlagkräftigen, effizienten Organisationsstruktur im Bereich Customer Relations gestartet. Dieser Prozess wurde von externen Beratern begleitet. Maßnahmen zur Entlastung des Customer-Relations-Teams umfassten u. a. Kapazitätserhöhungen sowohl intern als auch durch die Unterstützung externer Call-Center-Partner. Zudem fanden unter externer Begleitung Teamcoachings zur Steigerung der mentalen Stärke und somit zur besseren Bewältigung des hohen Arbeitspensums statt. 37 Herausforderungen.

Zudem fanden unter externer Begleitung Teamcoachings zur Steigerung der mentalen Stärke und somit zur besseren Bewältigung des hohen Arbeitspensums statt.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nUm möglichst viele der EVN Kunden persönlich über die Ablöse des bisherigen Klassik-Tarifs und die Optionen für einen Wechsel zu einem neuen Tarif zu informieren, startete die EVN im Frühjahr 2023 wieder eine Informationskampagne mit dem EVN Info-Bus. Im Rahmen dieser Kampagne besuchten EVN Mitarbeiter insgesamt 469 Gemeinden Niederösterreichs, um die Kunden vor Ort umfassend über den Tarifwechsel aufzuklären und zu informieren. Der EVN Info-Bus hatte sich bereits im Herbst 2022 im Rahmen der Informationskampagne über Entlastungsmaßnahmen und Einsparungspotenziale sehr bewährt und wurde auch diesmal äußerst positiv aufgenommen.\n\nHohen Stellenwert misst die EVN auch einem aktiven Beschwerdemanagement bei, in dessen Rahmen alle Rückmeldungen unzufriedener Kunden dokumentiert, ausgewertet und regelmäßig eingehend analysiert werden, um daraus spezifische Verbesserungsmaßnahmen abzuleiten. Zudem setzt die EVN intensiv auf Schulungen und Trainings für das Customer-Relations-Team – zunehmend auch mittels digitaler E-Learning-Formate.\n\nDie EVN legt großen Wert auf Diversität, sowohl in Bezug auf ihre eigenen Mitarbeiter als auch im Umgang mit ihren Kunden. Für Kunden, deren Muttersprache nicht Deutsch ist, werden Beratungsdienste in ihrer jeweiligen Muttersprache angeboten. Möglich wird dies durch die große Vielfalt im Team, dem viele Kollegen mit unterschiedlichen Muttersprachen angehören.\n\nNach umfassenden Vorbereitungen wurde der frühere Kundenbeirat der EVN im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 in einem neuen, digitalen Format aufgesetzt. Das bestehende Beratungsgremium, in dem seit dem Jahr 2011 gewählte Kundenvertreter ihre Anliegen und Bedürfnisse mit dem Management und Experten erörtert hatten, wurde dadurch auf eine zeitgemäße und wesentlich breitere Basis gestellt. Feedbackwillige Kunden können sich nun auf freiwilliger Basis online unter https://mein-feedback.at/ anmelden. Dadurch soll eine große Gruppe an Testkunden entstehen, die online sowie vor Ort – und damit rasch, flexibel und niederschwellig – um ihre Meinung zu bestehenden sowie geplanten Produkt- und Serviceangeboten gebeten werden kann. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 will die EVN darüber hinaus Real-Time-Feedback in einem digitalen Format auf Echtzeitbasis einführen. Dies soll eine rasche Erhebung und Auswertung der Qualität von Kundenkontakten ermöglichen.\n\nDie EVN setzt darüber hinaus auf den für die spezifischen Anforderungen des Unternehmens definierten Customer Loyalty Index, um die Zufriedenheit der Kunden mit unterschiedlichen Aspekten ihrer Geschäftsbeziehung zur EVN zu evaluieren. Dabei wird anhand verschiedener Indikatoren die Loyalität der Kunden auf monatlicher Basis beobachtet und gemessen. Der Index ermöglicht es, Veränderungen des Kundenverhaltens und deren Ursachen frühzeitig zu erkennen und rasch darauf zu reagieren.\n\nIm Frühjahr 2023 absolvierte das EVN Kundenservice erfolgreich die Re-Zertifizierung nach ISO 18295-1. Die Schwerpunkte der dafür erforderlichen Überprüfung lagen auf den Abläufen im Kundenservice sowie auf dem Schulungskonzept für das Customer-Relations-Team. In allen Bereichen wurden die umfassenden Anforderungen der ISO-Norm erfüllt. Das neue Zertifikat ist bis Dezember 2028 gültig.\n\nDas Wertegerüst der EVN schließt auch das klare Bekenntnis zu sozialer Verantwortung mit ein, das im aktuellen Umfeld nochmals stark an Bedeutung gewinnt. Über unterschiedliche Kanäle (persönlich, telefonisch oder online) bieten geschulte Mitarbeiter in Customer Relations und in den Service Centern individuelle Beratung von Energiespartipps bis hin zum Umgang mit Zahlungsschwierigkeiten und halten aktiv den Kontakt mit den Kunden. Seit vielen Jahren bewähren sich Maßnahmen wie Kooperationen mit der Caritas, der Schuldnerberatung Niederösterreich, der Diakonie sowie dem Niederösterreichischen Armutsnetzwerk. Diese Zusammenarbeit hat die EVN zuletzt weiter intensiviert. Einen Fokus bilden hier Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen sowie die Ausschöpfung von Einsparpotenzialen, durch die sich oft erhebliche Kostenreduktionen erzielen lassen.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nDer regelmäßige Austausch mit den genannten Organisationen erleichtert es zudem, im Einzelfall gezielte Maßnahmen für sozial benachteiligte Kunden abzustimmen. Dazu zählen individuelle Vereinbarungen über Stundungen oder Ratenzahlungen ebenso wie Lösungen, die in Kooperation mit Hilfsorganisationen und Anbietern sozialer Hilfsleistungen erarbeitet werden. Für den Zeitraum von 1. Dezember 2022 bis 30. April 2023 hat die EVN auf Abschaltungen bei Haushaltskunden für Strom überhaupt ganz verzichtet, und auch im laufenden Geschäftsjahr werden im Zeitraum von 1. Dezember 2023 bis 31. März 2024 bei Haushaltskunden keine Abschaltungen bei Strom, Erdgas oder Wärme vorgenommen. Zur Unterstützung besonderer sozialer Härtefälle wurde im Herbst 2022 ein mit 3 Mio. Euro dotierter Energiehilfe-Fonds eingerichtet, der betroffene Haushalte mit professioneller Energieberatung, Gerätetausch oder einer Überbrückungsfinanzierung für Energierechnungen unterstützen soll. Die Abwicklung der von diesem Fonds gewährten Unterstützungen erfolgt über soziale Institutionen.\n\n## **Umweltbelange**\n\nDie grundlegenden Ziele und Werte der EVN in Sachen Klima- und Umweltschutz sind einerseits im Umweltleitbild der EVN und andererseits in der EVN Klimainitiative verankert. Im Bereich Umweltschutz umfasst das Leitbild Vorgaben zur Minimierung von Umweltbeeinträchtigungen, zur verantwortungsvollen Nutzung von Ressourcen, zum Erhalt der natürlichen Lebensräume von Tieren und Pflanzen im Umfeld der Anlagen und Projekte sowie zu einem umweltgerechten Abfallmanagement. Die lückenlose Erfüllung vom Umweltgesetzen und -auflagen in allen Aktivitäten der EVN ist dabei selbstverständlich. Im Bereich Klimaschutz wiederum legt die Klimainitiative den Fokus auf einen schrittweisen Systemumbau in Richtung einer klimaneutralen Energieerzeugung mit den Schwerpunkten Windkraft und Photovoltaik bei gleichzeitiger Gewährleistung der Versorgungssicherheit.\n\nDie Tätigkeitsbereiche der EVN AG umfassten im Geschäftsjahr im Wesentlichen Handelsund Verwaltungstätigkeit. Energieverbrauch und Emissionen sind deshalb für den Einzelabschluss nicht wesentlich, weswegen auf eine diesbezügliche Angabe verzichtet wird.\n\n## **Umweltmanagement in der EVN**\n\nBereits seit 1995 betreibt die EVN auf freiwilliger Basis Umweltmanagementsysteme gemäß dem Eco Management und Audit Scheme (EMAS) sowie nach ISO 14001. Die EMAS-Verordnung schreibt unter anderem die Festlegung von messbaren Umweltzielen vor, deren Zielsetzung einen kontinuierlichen Verbesserungsprozess vorsieht. Für die Zertifizierung nach EMAS sind die lückenlose Einhaltung von umweltrelevanten Gesetzen und deren engmaschige Überprüfung zwingende Grundvoraussetzungen. Alle thermischen Anlagen in Niederösterreich sowie 74 Wärmeerzeugungs- und Kälteanlagen der EVN entsprechen diesen Standards.\n\nDas Engagement der EVN zum Klimaschutz orientiert sich an einem ausgewogenen Mix aus optimaler Versorgungssicherheit und minimalen Umweltauswirkungen. Mit den folgenden Initiativen und strategischen Ansätzen erbringt die EVN einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Erreichung der österreichischen und europäischen Klimaziele:\n\n- Forcierte Nutzung der erneuerbaren Energiequellen Wasser, Wind, Sonne, Biomasse und erneuerbares Gas\n- Steigerung der Energieeffizienz eigener Produktionsanlagen und Netze\n- Aktive Teilnahme an Innovations-, Entwicklungs- und Forschungsprojekten\n- Information und Beratung der Kunden im Hinblick auf die Reduktion ihres Energiebedarfs\n- Regionale Wertschöpfung durch die Nutzung heimischer Energieträger wie Biomasse und erneuerbares Gas\n- Nutzung von Fahrzeugen mit alternativen Antrieben wie z.B. E-Autos\n- Steigerung des Anteils erneuerbarer Energien am Produktmix der EVN\n- Zunehmender Einsatz erneuerbarer Energien zur Deckung des Eigenbedarfs\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n• Unterstützung der Transformation der Gasnetze hin zu erneuerbarem Gas und Wasserstoff\n\n## **Nachhaltigkeitsbeirat**\n\nDer Nachhaltigkeitsbeirat der EVN berät den Vorstand der Gesellschaft in wichtigen Fragen der nachhaltigen Unternehmensführung in den Bereichen Umwelt- und Klimaschutz, Anpassung an den Klimawandel, Kreislaufwirtschaft, Biodiversität, nachhaltige Wasserwirtschaft, Digitalisierung, Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit, Arbeitssicherheit und Arbeitsschutz sowie Soziales und Menschenrechte. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 trat das aus 28 Mitgliedern bestehende Gremium zu zwei Sitzungen zusammen. Ein besonderer Fokus wurde dabei neben den Themen Versorgungssicherheit und Energietransformation, energiewirtschaftliche Situation in Niederösterreich und aktuelle Marktsituation und Aktivitäten des EVN Vertriebsgeschäfts auch auf die Herausforderungen des Arbeitsmarkts sowie von der Ausbildung über das Finden und Halten von Arbeitskräften als auch auf die Skills der Zukunft gelegt.\n\n## **Abfall**\n\nDie EVN achtet darauf, dass Wertstoffe – soweit möglich – intern wiederverwendet werden, bevor sie als Abfall deklariert werden. Eine innerbetriebliche Behandlung oder Recycling von Abfällen wird aufgrund der rechtlich dafür notwendigen Behandlungserlaubnis nicht durchgeführt. Gemäß der EU-Gesetzgebung geschieht dies über die direkte Beauftragung von geeigneten Entsorgern oder Verwertern, die eine fachgerechte Verwertung und Entsorgung der Abfälle nach der europäischen Abfallhierarchie gewährleisten und so sicherstellen, dass Wertstoffe nicht verloren gehen.\n\nAlle regelmäßig anfallenden gefährlichen und nicht gefährlichen Abfälle gibt die EVN auf Basis von Rahmenverträgen an berechtigte Entsorgungsunternehmen ab, die diese Abfälle entsprechend den gesetzlichen Vorschriften des jeweiligen Landes umweltgerecht entsorgen. In der Berichtsperiode entsorgte die EVN keine gefährlichen oder nicht gefährlichen Abfälle grenzüberschreitend.\n\n| Abfallmengen gesamt¹⁾                                    |   | 2022/23 | 2021/22 | 2020/21 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---|---------|---------|---------|\n| Nicht gefährliche Abfälle                                | t | 203     | 267     | 339     |\n| davon zur Rückgewinnung umgeleitete Abfälle              | t | 180     | -       | -       |\n| davon dem Recycling zugeführt                            | t | 176     | -       | -       |\n| davon sonstigen Verfahren zur Rückgewinnung zugeführt    | t | 4       | -       | -       |\n| davon zur Entsorgung weitergeleitete Abfälle             | t | 23      | -       | -       |\n| davon in die Verbrennung mit Energierückgewinnung        | t | 21      | -       | -       |\n| davon zur Deponierung                                    | t | 1       | -       | -       |\n| davon zu sonstigen Entsorgungsverfahren                  | t | 1       | -       | -       |\n|                                                          |   |         |         |         |\n| Gefährliche Abfälle                                      | t | 33      | 35      | 31      |\n| davon der Verwertung zugeführte gefährliche Abfälle      | t | 8       | -       | -       |\n| davon zur Entsorgung weitergeleitete gefährliche Abfälle | t | 25      | -       | -       |\n\n1) Ohne Baurestmassen\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Sozialbelange**\n\nIm Bewusstsein der Verantwortung gegenüber den unterschiedlichen Interessengruppen setzt die EVN in ihrem Verantwortungsbereich auch außerhalb des operativen Kerngeschäfts Initiativen zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität der Menschen. Nachfolgend einige Beispiele für diese Aktivitäten im gesellschaftlichen Kontext:\n\n- **EVN Junior-Ranger-Programm:** An zwei Samstagen vermittelten externe Experten insgesamt 17 Jugendlichen Theorie- und Praxiswissen zu Themen wie Hydrobiologie, Flora und Fauna in Flussauen, Gewässerökologie, Fischerei sowie Natur- und Gewässerschutz. Die Wissensvermittlung fand am und um den Stausee Erlaufklause, ein Wasserkraftwerksstandort der EVN, statt.\n- **EVN Sozialfonds:** Der EVN Sozialfonds ist mit jährlich rund 120.000 Euro dotiert und unterstützt Kinder- und Jugendprojekte niederösterreichischer Institutionen. Über die Auswahl der Förderprojekte entscheidet ein Expertengremium, das zweimal pro Jahr zusammentritt. Seine Empfehlungen zur Mittelverwendung an den Vorstand der EVN erfolgen einstimmig auf Basis eines vordefinierten Kriterienkatalogs. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 unterstützte der Fonds 18 Projekte mit einem Gesamtbeitrag von rund 122.000 Euro.\n- **Bonuspunkte spenden:** In der EVN Bonuswelt bietet die EVN ihren Kunden vielfältige Möglichkeiten zur Verwendung jener Bonuspunkte, die sie im Rahmen ihres Energiebezugs oder der Nutzung anderer EVN Services laufend sammeln. Die Bonuspunkte können wahlweise als finanzielle Vergütung für die Kunden selbst oder aber zur Unterstützung verschiedener wohltätiger Projekte eingelöst werden. Spendenaktionen gab es zuletzt u.a. für Menschen mit psychischen Erkrankungen, für Tierheime oder für Sozialmärkte.\n- **evn sammlung:** Seit 1995 besteht die evn sammlung, eine Kollektion zeitgenössischer Kunst aus aller Welt, die von dem mit renommierten Experten besetzten EVN Kunstrat kuratiert wird. Die Firmensammlung versteht sich als Plattform zur Auseinandersetzung mit bildender Kunst und richtet sich gleichermaßen an Mitarbeiter und ihre Familien wie an Kunstinteressierte von außerhalb des Unternehmens.\n\n## **Arbeitnehmerbelange**\n\nDie EVN sieht es als ihre Verantwortung, zeitgerecht auf die aktuellen Herausforderungen zu reagieren und ein optimales Arbeitsumfeld für ihre Mitarbeiter zu schaffen, in dem sie sich weiterentwickeln und zielorientiert am gemeinsamen Erfolg arbeiten können. Mit dem Projekt \"EVN Arbeitswelt\" versucht die EVN, diesen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden und ein möglichst flexibles Arbeitsumfeld für ihre Mitarbeiter zu schaffen. Länderspezifische gesetzliche Bestimmungen und internationale Regelwerke, etwa die Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte, sowie die grundlegenden Formulierungen in unserem Verhaltenskodex bilden die grundsätzlichen Leitgedanken der EVN Unternehmenskultur, wenn es um den Umgang mit Mitarbeitern geht. Eine Reihe weiterer verbindlicher Dokumente zur Unternehmens- und Führungskultur, so etwa das Führungsleitbild und die Menschenrechts-Policy, definiert und konkretisiert die Prinzipien und Richtlinien der EVN für den alltäglichen Umgang miteinander.\n\nIm Umgang mit den Mitarbeitern kommt die EVN aber nicht nur den gesetzlich definierten Pflichten nach, sondern erbringt darüber hinaus viele zusätzliche freiwillige Leistungen, um dem Anspruchsbild einer fairen Arbeitgeberin zu entsprechen.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\nFundamentale Prinzipien wie z.B. Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit, Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf, Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit, betriebliche Gesundheitsvorsorge, betriebliche Sozialpartnerschaft und interne Kommunikation sowie betriebliche Zusatzleistungen prägen hierbei die Unternehmenskultur.\n\nZum Bilanzstichtag am 30. September 2023 beschäftigte die EVN 626 Mitarbeiter (Kopfzahl). Die Belegschaft setzt sich aus Menschen unterschiedlicher Nationalitäten, Kulturen und Generationen zusammen. Sie spielen durch ihre hohe Qualifikation in allen Geschäftsaktivitäten der EVN eine zentrale Rolle.\n\n## **Diversität**\n\nZum Bilanzstichtag 30. September 2023 gehörten der EVN AG 182 Frauen (29,1 %) und 444 Männer (70,9 %) an. Zur Erhöhung des Frauenanteils in der EVN sowie zur Unterstützung der Karriereplanung insbesondere hoch qualifizierter bietet das Programm \"Frauen@ EVN\" u. a. die Möglichkeit, bedarfsorientiert Seminare zu besuchen und interne Netzwerkmöglichkeiten wahrzunehmen. Auch ein Mentoring-Programm wurde vor einigen Jahren ins Leben gerufen. Damit will die EVN die Mitarbeiterinnen in ihren Führungspositionen stärken und gleichzeitig die Voraussetzungen für eine Steigerung der Anzahl weiblicher Führungskräfte schaffen. Auch die Möglichkeit, als Teilzeitbeschäftigter Führungsverantwortung zu übernehmen, wird von der EVN bewusst unterstützt und gelebt.\n\n10 Frauen und 9 Männer sind in der Berichtsperiode neu in das Unternehmen eingetreten, während 5 Frauen und 8 Männer das Unternehmen verlassen haben. Zum Stichtag 30. September 2023 gab es in der EVN AG in Summe 76 Teilzeitbeschäftigte, davon 59 Frauen und 17 Männer. Der Anteil an teilzeitbeschäftigten Mitarbeitern an der Gesamtbelegschaft der EVN AG zum Bilanzstichtag entspricht somit 12,1 %.\n\n## **Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit**\n\nIm Einklang mit der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte, den Prinzipien des UN Global Compact sowie den Grundsätzen der International Labour Organization werden alle Mitarbeiter der EVN ungeachtet von Geschlecht, Alter, ethnischer Herkunft, Hautfarbe, sexueller Orientierung, Religion, Weltanschauung oder allfälligen Beeinträchtigungen gleichwertig behandelt. Außerdem lehnt die EVN jede Diskriminierung von Mitarbeitern in Bezug auf Einstellung, Fortbildung, Personalentwicklung, Beschäftigungsbedingungen und Entlohnung bei gleicher fachlicher und persönlicher Qualifikation ausdrücklich ab.\n\nDie Vergütung aller Mitarbeiter richtet sich nach dem jeweils gültigen Kollektivvertrag bzw. nach ihrer jeweiligen Tätigkeit und Qualifikation. Damit bestehen in der EVN bei gleichwertiger Ausbildung und Tätigkeit keine Unterschiede in der Vergütung zwischen Frauen und Männern. Zu unserem grundsätzlichen Bekenntnis zu Gleichbehandlung und Chancengleichheit zählt auch die Förderung der Integration von Menschen mit besonderen Bedürfnissen. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 beschäftigte die EVN AG 15 Menschen aus dieser Personengruppe. Dies entspricht einem Anteil von 2,4 % der Gesamtbelegschaft.\n\n## **Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf**\n\nEin weiteres zentrales Anliegen der EVN ist eine ausgewogene Balance zwischen dem Berufs- und Familienleben ihrer Mitarbeiter. Als eines der ersten Unternehmen hat die EVN bereits im Mai 2011 die \"Charta zur neuen Vereinbarkeit Eltern – Wirtschaft\" – eine Initiative des Landes und der Wirtschaftskammer Niederösterreich – unterzeichnet und damit ein Zeichen für eine elternorientierte Personalpolitik gesetzt. In vielen Bereichen können Mitarbeiter ihre Arbeitszeit frei gestalten, sofern nicht betriebliche Erfordernisse wie etwa Schichtdienste dem entgegenstehen. Die Grundlage dafür bildet ein Gleitzeitmodell ohne Kernzeit, das sehr hohe Flexibilität ermöglicht, Verschiedene Teilzeitmodelle sowie fixe Modelle für mobiles Arbeiten, die z.B. auch eine Kombination von Arbeitseinsatz im Außendienst und mobilem Arbeiten innerhalb eines Arbeitstags ermöglichen, erleichtern den Mitarbeitern die Vereinbarkeit von beruflichen und familiären Verpflichtungen.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie Modelle für mobiles Arbeiten sehen einen Rahmen von bis zu 1.280 Stunden pro Jahr vor, in denen die Mitarbeiter ortsungebunden arbeiten können. Mitarbeiter mit Familienverantwortung werden außerdem mit Einrichtungen wie einem Eltern-Kind-Büro oder mit dem betreuten Kinderferienprogramm der EVN unterstützt.\n\nAlle Mitarbeiter der EVN haben nach der Geburt eines Kindes gesetzlichen Anspruch auf Karenzzeit sowie dem sogenannten Papamonat. Die EVN gewährt die Karenzzeit mit einer möglichen Arbeitsfreistellung bis zum 36. Lebensmonat des Kindes sogar über die bestehende gesetzliche Verpflichtung hinaus. Während der Karenzzeit hält die EVN den Kontakt zu ihren Mitarbeitern gezielt aufrecht und erleichtert damit ihren beruflichen Wiedereinstieg. Darüber hinaus stehen den Mitarbeitern in Karenz weiterhin spezifische Informationsveranstaltungen und ein umfassendes Aus- und Weiterbildungsprogramm offen. Auch immer mehr männliche Mitarbeiter der EVN nutzen dieses Angebot, und beinahe alle Mütter und Väter kehren nach ihrer Karenz wieder zur EVN zurück.\n\n## **Gesundheitsvorsorge, Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit**\n\nDie Gewährleistung der Sicherheit und Gesundheit der Mitarbeiter sowie die Bestrebungen im Interesse von Arbeitssicherheit und Unfallvermeidung bilden ein zentrales Element der EVN Unternehmenskultur. In Ergänzung zu europäischen und länderspezifischen gesetzlichen Vorschriften, die durchwegs zur Gänze eingehalten werden, sind sie für sämtliche Unternehmenseinheiten im EVN Verhaltenskodex, Menschenrechts-Policy, Sicherheitsleitbild und -strategie sowie in internen Geschäftsanweisungen und Richtlinien fest verankert, die Sicherheitsrisiken definieren und entsprechende Gegenmaßnahmen vorgeben.\n\nSämtliche Arbeitsunfälle nahezu aller Mitarbeiter und Leiharbeiter der EVN werden über einen zentralen sicherheitstechnischen Dienst erfasst und analysiert, und es werden gegebenenfalls entsprechende Maßnahmen eingeleitet. Zur Erfassung erkannter Risiken und Vorfälle sowie zum Monitoring getroffener Maßnahmen orientiert sich die EVN an den Anforderungen der Norm ISO 45001. Durch den engen Kontakt zwischen den Sicherheitsvertrauenspersonen in den einzelnen Unternehmensbereichen und den zentralen Sicherheitsfachkräften wird außerdem sichergestellt, dass erkannte Risiken und Maßnahmen zur Gefahrenvermeidung in alle Sicherheits- und Gesundheitsschutzdokumente einfließen. Bei sicherheitstechnischen Fragen ist die jeweils zuständige Sicherheitsvertrauensperson mit ihrer fachlichen Kompetenz hinsichtlich des konkreten Arbeitsprozesses und ihrer Kenntnisse im Arbeitsschutz die erste Anlaufstelle für Betroffene. Darüber hinaus werden alle Mitarbeiter und Leasingmitarbeiter von Sicherheitsvertrauenspersonen in Arbeitsausschüssen vertreten, die Arbeitsschutzprogramme überwachen und über solche beraten. Dieser Austausch erfolgt gemäß den gesetzlichen Vorgaben einmal jährlich.\n\nAls Basis der regelmäßigen Unterweisungen dient das eigens auf die Arbeitsbedingungen in der Energiewirtschaft ausgerichtete \"Handbuch Sicherheit\" der Branchenvereinigung Oesterreichs Energie. Das für den Konzern zentral organisierte Team der EVN Arbeitssicherheit setzt auch eine Vielfalt an konkreten Maßnahmen um, wie z.B. Sicherheitsgespräche mit dem Vorgesetzten, E-Learning-Module und Videoclips zu Arbeitsweisen und zur Handhabung von Arbeitsmitteln, Fachseminare, Artikel in der Mitarbeiterzeitung sowie im Intranet zu unterschiedlichen Aspekten der Arbeitssicherheit sowie die Verleihung des jährlichen \"Oskar für Arbeitssicherheit\" an jene Abteilungen bzw. Organisationen, die ein unfallfreies Jahr hinter sicher gebracht haben.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 ereigneten sich bei der EVN AG zwei Arbeitsunfälle (Vorjahr: 5); der Lost Time Injury Frequency Index (LTIF) betrug 1,6 (Vorjahr: 1,7).\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nUm auch unserer Verantwortung für die Gesundheit der Mitarbeiter gerecht zu werden, bietet die EVN eine weit über das gesetzliche Maß hinausgehende arbeitsmedizinische Betreuung. Zwei Arbeitsmediziner stehen für alle Fragen rund um Gesundheitsvorsorge, Bewusstseinsbildung sowie Erhaltung und Förderung der Gesundheit am Arbeitsplatz zur Verfügung und betreuen die Mitarbeiter im Rahmen der Arbeitnehmerschutzbestimmungen und darüber hinaus. Zu den zahlreichen angebotenen Maßnahmen zählen u.a. Gesundenuntersuchungen, Impfungen, Seh- und Hörtests, Präventionsmedizin sowie Erste-Hilfe-Kurse, aber auch psychologische Beratung, Coaching, Tipps für gesunde Ernährung sowie spezifische Angebote für Mitarbeiter, die besonderen Belastungen ausgesetzt sind. Die EVN ist nicht in Ländern aktiv, in denen ein erhöhtes Risiko durch übertragbare Krankheiten besteht oder Arbeitsbedingungen vorherrschen, die die Gesundheit der Mitarbeiter dauerhaft gefährden könnten. Dennoch hat die EVN Konzernanweisungen für Ernstfälle in allen Konzerngesellschaften entwickelt – darunter z.B. die \"Pandemievorsorge EVN\", die nach dem Ausbruch von Covid-19 im März 2020 als wertvolle Grundlage für die gesetzten Maßnahmen diente.\n\nNeben den direkt vom Unternehmen getragenen Maßnahmen eröffnet die EVN Kultur- und Sportvereinigung allen Mitarbeitern ein vielfältiges Angebot an Aktivitäten von Laufsport über Tennis, Fußball und Flugsport bis hin zu Film und Fotografie. Bei vielen dieser Aktivitäten nimmt die Gesundheitsförderung ebenfalls einen wichtigen Stellenwert ein.\n\n## **Betriebliche Sozialpartnerschaft**\n\nBei wesentlichen unternehmerischen Entscheidungen achtet die EVN auf Transparenz und steht damit im Einklang mit ihrem Führungsleitbild, mit allen gesetzlichen Bestimmungen sowie mit der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte. In diesem Sinn werden auch die Arbeitnehmervertreter laufend und zeitgerecht über wesentliche unternehmerische Entscheidungen informiert bzw. in die Entscheidungsprozesse eingebunden. Dies gilt für strategische Entscheidungen ebenso wie für Änderungen oder Anpassungen im Personalbereich. 100 % der Mitarbeiter in der EVN AG werden durch Belegschaftsvertretungen wie Betriebsräte oder Gewerkschaften vertreten und sind hinsichtlich ihrer Bezahlung durch kollektivvertragliche, tarifliche oder gesetzliche Mindestlöhne geschützt. Regelmäßig werden die Belegschaftsvertretungen in die Kollektivvertragsverhandlungen eingebunden. Insgesamt orientiert sich das Gehaltsschema von allen Mitarbeitern der EVN AG an diesen Kollektivverträgen. Mitarbeiterthemen werden auch in Arbeits- und Sicherheitsausschüssen behandelt, die sich u.a. aus Betriebsräten oder Gewerkschaftsvertretern zusammensetzen. Außerdem können sich Vertreter des Betriebsrats im Aufsichtsrat sowie im Nachhaltigkeitsbeirat äußern.\n\n## **Personalentwicklung und -förderung**\n\nDie hohe Qualifikation der Mitarbeiter hat für die EVN große strategische Bedeutung und ist wesentlich für die Sicherung des nachhaltigen Unternehmenserfolgs. Daher bilden die Wahrung, aber auch die Verbesserung der hohen Kompetenz der Mitarbeiter zentrale Schwerpunkte des Personalmanagements bei EVN. Vor dem Hintergrund des aktuellen Arbeits- und Fachkräftemangels hat die zielgerichtete, individuelle und effiziente Personalentwicklung nochmals an Bedeutung gewonnen. Im Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 absolvierte jeder Mitarbeiter der EVN AG im Schnitt 11,1 Stunden an Weiterbildungsveranstaltungen.\n\nEntscheidender Erfolgsfaktor im Wettbewerb um die klügsten Köpfe ist es, die Erwartungen und Bedürfnisse seiner potenziellen und auch bestehenden Mitarbeiter zu kennen und diesen so weit wie möglich entgegenzukommen. Die EVN betrachtet ihre Mitarbeiter sehr differenziert über den gesamten Employee Life Cycle hinweg, von der Phase der Orientierung und Jobsuche bis hin zum Pensionsantritt und auch noch danach. Ein umfassendes Onboarding stellt mit Infoveranstaltungen, Einschulungen, E-Learnings, Patensystem und regelmäßigen Feedbackschleifen sicher, dass die neuen Mitarbeiter auch tatsächlich im Unternehmen ankommen.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nDamit die Mitarbeiter in ihrer jeweiligen Situation wahrgenommen und gefördert werden und sich weiterentwickeln können, spielt auch regelmäßiges Feedback – z. B. im Rahmen der jährlichen Mitarbeitergespräche – und die laufende Erhebung der Mitarbeiterzufriedenheit durch den \"Stimmungsbarometer\" eine ganz wesentliche Rolle.\n\nZur Gewinnung von qualifizierten neuen Mitarbeitern nutzt die EVN seit vielen Jahren auch gezieltes Employer Branding. Dazu gibt sie u. a. auf digitalen Plattformen authentische Einblicke in das Unternehmen und die vielfältigen Aufgabenbereiche. Ebenso gibt es seit einigen Jahren ein erfolgreiches Empfehlungsprogramm \"Mitarbeiter werben Mitarbeiter\" sowie ein Jobbotschafter-Programm. Grundidee ist in beiden Fällen die stärkere und aktive Einbindung bestehender Kollegen ins Recruiting.\n\nDas umfangreiche Aus- und Weiterbildungsangebot der EVN wird durch die EVN Akademie umgesetzt, die jährlich rund 200 Veranstaltungen organisiert und mehr als 70 unterschiedliche Ausbildungspläne zu technischen Themenstellungen und Inhalten wie auch zur Persönlichkeitsentwicklung koordiniert. Für Führungskräfte und High Potentials gibt es darüber hinausgehende Ausbildungsprogramme und vielfältige Karrieremöglichkeiten.\n\nIm Bewusstsein um den hohen Stellenwert von Aus- und Weiterbildung bekennt sich die EVN auch zu Bildungskarenz und Bildungsteilzeit. Entsprechende Ansuchen werden nach Prüfung der betrieblichen Möglichkeiten und Interessen vonseiten der Arbeitgeberin unter Berücksichtigung definierter Rahmenbedingungen grundsätzlich genehmigt. Auch das Modell der befristeten Wiedereingliederungsteilzeit wird fallweise genutzt, um Mitarbeiter z.B. nach einer längeren Krankheit die schrittweise Rückkehr in den Arbeitsalltag zu erleichtern. Die Möglichkeit der Altersteilzeit wiederum nutzen Mitarbeiter, um ihre Arbeitszeit bis zum Pensionsantritt schrittweise zu reduzieren.\n\n## **Achtung der Menschenrechte und Bekämpfung von Korruption**\n\nNeben den grundlegenden Formulierungen zu Vision, Mission und Unternehmenswerten definiert eine Reihe weiterer verbindlicher Dokumente den Verhaltens- und Handlungsrahmen der EVN. Als Mitglied des UN Global Compact bekennt sich die EVN zudem explizit zur Einhaltung globaler Prinzipien ethischen wirtschaftlichen Handelns.\n\nDie EVN legt größten Wert auf ethisch und rechtlich einwandfreies Verhalten aller Mitarbeiter, Geschäftspartner und Lieferanten. Um die Einhaltung dieses Bekenntnisses zu lückenloser Regeltreue wirksam zu gewährleisten, hat die EVN konzernweit Compliance-Richtlinien und Maßnahmen implementiert. Zentrales Dokument ist dabei der in zehn Themenbereiche gegliederte EVN Verhaltenskodex, der auf Basis des EVN Unternehmensleitbilds u. a. jene Aspekte der Geschäftstätigkeit regelt, die Menschenrechte, Governance, Unternehmensethik, Korruptionsprävention, Datenschutz, Vertraulichkeit und Wettbewerbsverhalten, Arbeitsschutz und Unfallvermeidung sowie Klima- und Umweltschutz betreffen. Lückenlose Compliance sowie die strikte Einhaltung des EVN Verhaltenskodex bilden konzernweit die verbindliche Richtschnur für das Verhalten. Die Regelungen des Verhaltenskodex setzen auf verschiedenen Grundlagen auf, die jeweils auf die Gegebenheiten und Anforderungen des Unternehmens umgelegt werden. Ihr Bogen reicht von länderspezifischen gesetzlichen Bestimmungen und internationalen Regelwerken, etwa Leitsätzen und Übereinkommen der OECD sowie des UN Global Compact, über Grundsatzerklärungen und Prinzipien der International Labour Organisation (ILO) bis hin zu internen Organisationsvorschriften und Unternehmensgrundsätzen, die über geltendes Recht hinausgehen.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Menschenrechte**\n\nSeit jeher ist im EVN Verhaltenskodex das uneingeschränkte und unmissverständliche Bekenntnis zur Achtung, zur Einhaltung sowie zum Schutz der Menschenrechte sowie zur Berücksichtigung ethischer Grundsätze im Umgang mit allen Mitarbeitern an allen Standorten sowie in allen Geschäftsbeziehungen verankert. Die Ablehnung von Kinder- und Zwangsarbeit zählt ebenso dazu wie die Forderung, niemanden aufgrund von Gender, Alter, ethnischer Herkunft, Hautfarbe, sexueller Orientierung, Religion, Weltanschauung oder allfälligen Beeinträchtigungen zu diskriminieren. Weitere Elemente sind die Gewährung von Mitspracherechten, die Umsetzung von Maßnahmen für Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit sowie die Berücksichtigung von Menschenrechtsfragen in der Lieferkette (insbesondere bei internationalen Projekten).\n\nDen Handlungsrahmen für die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte und des sozialen Mindestschutzes bilden interne Regelungen, die ihrerseits auf relevanten Gesetzen und internationalen Regelwerken beruhen, insbesondere auf den zehn Prinzipien des UN Global Compact und auf den Leitsätzen der OECD, der Vereinten Nationen sowie der International Labour Organization. Als international tätiges Unternehmen ist die EVN in Ländern mit unterschiedlicher Geschichte und Entwicklung in Menschenrechtsfragen tätig. Auch wenn dies primär in der Verantwortung der jeweiligen Regierungen liegt, fühlt sich die EVN dazu verpflichtet, die Wahrung der Menschenrechte sicherzustellen und ihre Einhaltung im Rahmen der Möglichkeiten auch außerhalb des unmittelbaren Wirkungsbereichs zu fördern.\n\nDie Aspekte Menschenrechte und sozialer Mindestschutz werden im EVN Konzern als Querschnittsmaterien von unterschiedlichen Organisationseinheiten (insbesondere Personalwesen, Arbeitsschutz und -sicherheit, Beschaffung und Einkauf sowie der Stabsstelle Corporate Compliance Management) verantwortet. Im Geschäftsjahr 2021/22 wurden – insbesondere mit Blick auf die erstmalige Berichterstattung gemäß der EU-Taxonomie-Verordnung – die internen Prozesse und Regelwerke zu den Themen Menschenrechte und sozialer Mindestschutz überprüft und diese im Berichtszeitraum weiterentwickelt. Damit sollte sichergestellt werden, dass die für diese Themenbereiche etablierten Managementansätze und organisatorischen Regelungen lückenlos eingehalten werden.\n\nBegleitend erfolgte im Lauf der letzten beiden Geschäftsjahre – vor allem für die besonders mit den Aspekten Menschenrechte befassten Organisationen – eine vertiefte Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema, die auch durch externe Experten begleitet wurde. Vorstand und Führungskräfte wurden regelmäßig über Fortschritte und neu implementierte Maßnahmen informiert. Darüber hinaus wurde im Jahr 2022 eine EVN Menschenrechts-Policy formuliert und vom Vorstand genehmigt sowie ein EVN Menschenrechtsbeauftragter ernannt und in der Stabsstelle Corporate Compliance Management etabliert. Ab dem Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 sind bereits konkrete Weiterentwicklungsmaßnahmen geplant: Zu Beginn stehen Sensibilisierungsmaßnahmen und verpflichtende Schulungen. Diese sollen konzernweit das Verständnis zur Achtung der diversen Aspekte zum Thema Menschenrechte verstärken. Zudem soll ein Impact Assessment zum Thema Menschenrechte durchgeführt werden, um mögliche Risiken und Auswirkungen strukturiert zu erheben, zu bewerten und gegebenenfalls weitere Maßnahmen zu entwickeln.\n\nRisiken in Bezug auf die Nichteinhaltung der Menschenrechte werden konzernweit im Rahmen der jährlichen Risikoinventur erhoben.\n\n## **Korruptionsprävention**\n\nDie EVN tritt entschieden gegen jede Art von Korruption auf und fasst den Begriff Korruption sehr weit. Er beinhaltet für die EVN neben gesetzwidrigen Zahlungen (z.B. Bestechung, Kick-back-Zahlungen, fingierten Leistungen, Falschklassifizierung/-kontierung) auch alle anderen Arten von Zuwendungen (z.B. Geschenke, Einladungen, nicht drittübliche Vergünstigungen, immaterielle Vorteile wie Auszeichnungen und Protektion).\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nSowohl die Annahme als auch die Gewährung solcher Vorteile sind für die Mitarbeiter der EVN und deren Angehörige konzernweit verboten. Ausgenommen davon sind bei pflichtgemäßer Abwicklung von Geschäften lediglich die Annahme bzw. Gewährung ortsund landesüblicher Aufmerksamkeiten geringen Werts.\n\nUmfassende präventive Maßnahmen – darunter eigene Verhaltensregeln sowie spezifische Aus- und Weiterbildungsveranstaltungen – sollen Mitarbeiter gerade zum Thema Korruptionsvermeidung sensibilisieren. Deshalb legt die EVN bei der regelmäßigen Erhebung von Compliance-Risiken auch besonders Augenmerk auf das Thema Korruption.\n\n## **Organisation des Compliance-Managements**\n\nBei der EVN besteht seit 2012 ein eigenes Compliance-Management-System (CMS). Es gibt einen konzernweit einheitlichen Rahmen vor, der die EVN Mitarbeiter im Arbeitsalltag dabei unterstützen soll, sich integer und gesetzestreu zu verhalten.\n\nEs baut auf drei Säulen auf:\n\n- Prävention durch Bewusstseinsbildung und Schulungen\n- Identifikation von Compliance-Risikofeldern und Verstößen gegen den Verhaltenskodex\n- Reaktion durch Aufklärung und Verbesserung sowie gegebenenfalls Setzen von Maßnahmen\n\nDie Führung und die laufende Weiterentwicklung des CMS werden von der direkt dem Gesamtvorstand unterstellten Stabsstelle Corporate Compliance Management (CCM) verantwortet. Neben dem Chief Compliance Officer und den Mitarbeitern von CCM wurden in den einzelnen operativen Bereichen der EVN dezentrale Compliance Officer eingesetzt.\n\n## **Erhebung von Compliance-Risiken**\n\nCompliance-Risiken, die bei der EVN auch die Themen Menschenrechte und Korruptionsprävention umfassen, werden bei der EVN jährlich systematisch und aus unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln für den Gesamtkonzern erhoben. Ein wichtiger Anlass dafür ist etwa die jährliche Risikoinventur, da Compliance-Verstöße aus Sicht des Risikomanagements der EVN einen Risikofaktor darstellen. Darüber hinaus achtet auch die Interne Revision im Rahmen aller Prüfungsprojekte auf die Einhaltung sämtlicher Vorgaben und Regelungen im Zusammenhang mit Compliance. Die Ergebnisse dieser Erhebungen werden den Führungskräften, dem Gesamtvorstand und dem Prüfungsausschuss des Aufsichtsrats vorgelegt.\n\n## **Hinweisgeberverfahren**\n\nFür den Fall eines (vermuteten) Compliance-Verstoßes steht internen und externen Personen ein vertrauliches und anonymes Hinweisgeberverfahren (\"Whistle Blowing\") zur Verfügung. Alle Bedenken in Bezug auf ethisch nicht vertretbares oder rechtswidriges Verhalten können dabei niederschwellig entweder persönlich, telefonisch, über spezifische Compliance E-Mail-Adressen oder über ein von einem externen Dienstleister gehostetes Hinweisgebersystem erfolgen. Diese Möglichkeiten bestehen konzernweit und in allen wesentlichen Landessprachen des EVN Konzerns. Das Hinweisgeberverfahren wurde dabei mit der Zielsetzung ausgestaltet, eine lückenlose, objektive und effiziente Aufklärung gemeldeter Verstöße gegen den EVN Verhaltenskodex zu gewährleisten. Anonym abgegebene Hinweise werden stets von der EVN behandelt. Eine eigene Konzernanweisung regelt insbesondere die Vorgehensweise bei der Behandlung der gemeldeten Bedenken sowie die Vorkehrungen zum Schutz der Hinweisgeber vor Repressalien.\n\nCompliance-Verstöße stellen eine Verletzung von Dienstpflichten dar, in manchen Fällen sind sie zudem strafrechtlich relevant. Dies ist von den dazu berufenen Einrichtungen zu beurteilen. Sollte sich ein Verdacht bestätigen, führt dies je nach Schwere und Schadensumfang zu arbeits- bzw. zivilrechtlichen Konsequenzen.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeshalb sind Mitarbeiter, die im Rahmen ihrer Arbeit in Interessen- oder Loyalitätskonflikte geraten, aufgerufen, sich direkt und rechtzeitig an den EVN Compliance Officer zu wenden.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2022/23 wurden der EVN AG keine Fälle von vermuteter Diskriminierung gemeldet. In der Berichtsperiode hat die EVN AG keine Meldungen über Vorwürfe vermuteter Korruption erreicht und kein – aus vor der Berichtszeit – gemeldeter Fall war Gegenstand von Klagen. Auch eine Vertragsaufkündigung mit Geschäftspartnern aus Gründen von Verstößen gegen den EVN Verhaltenskodex ist nicht erfolgt.\n\nDie Verpflichtung zur Einhaltung hoher ethischer Standards gilt explizit auch für Geschäftspartner der EVN. Besonderen Wert wird hier auf die Themen \"Menschenrechte\", \"Arbeitsbedingungen und -rechte\", \"Umwelt- und Klimaschutz\" sowie \"Geschäftsethik\" gelegt. Im gesamten Konzern verfolgt die EVN das Ziel, Geschäftsbeziehungen zu Unternehmen zu vermeiden, denen direkte oder indirekte Verstöße gegen die Menschenrechte bzw. das Korruptions-, Kartell- oder Wirtschaftsrecht zur Last gelegt werden oder gar nachgewiesen wurden. Bei der Überprüfung potenzieller Geschäftspartner, die auch das Screening von Sanktionslisten mit einschließt, folgt die EVN einem risikoorientierten Ansatz und berücksichtigt insbesondere Branchen- und Länderrisiken. Die EVN nutzt zudem die Compliance-Datenbank und -Software eines spezialisierten externen Dienstleisters. Sofern diese Screenings sensible Ergebnisse erbringen, werden entsprechende Maßnahmen zur Risikoreduktion gesetzt.\n\n## **Compliance-Schulungen**\n\nDas CMS der EVN stellt mit einem sorgsam entwickelten und kontinuierlich verbesserten Schulungs- und Kommunikationskonzept konzernweit sicher, dass sich alle Mitarbeiter regelmäßig mit Compliance-Themen befassen und die Themenbereiche des EVN Verhaltenskodex jährlich wiederholt werden. Schulungsschwerpunkte sind insbesondere Menschenrechte, Unternehmensethik, Korruptionsprävention und Wettbewerbsverhalten.\n\nDas im Geschäftsjahr 2021/22 in Abstimmung mit den Führungskräften neu konzipierte mehrstufige Compliance-Schulungsprogramm stellt nun mehr den konzernweit verpflichtenden Schulungsstandard zum EVN Verhaltenskodex dar, der von allen neu eingetretenen Mitarbeitern (inklusive externer Arbeitskräfte) absolviert werden muss. Sämtliche Module dieses umfassenden Lernpfads zeichnen sich durch einen hohen Grad an Interaktion und Praxisbezug aus. Die Präsenztrainings, Webinare und E-Learnings kombinieren zudem Einheiten zum Selbststudium samt Wissensüberprüfungen mit der Möglichkeit zur gemeinsamen Arbeit an Fallbeispielen.\n\nNeben diesem umfangreichen Schulungsprogramm setzt CCM regelmäßig auch auf alternative Kommunikationsmaßen (z.B. solche im Intranet oder in der Mitarbeiterzeitung der EVN) sowie auf die Wissensvermittlung durch Führungskräfte, die laufend in die Vertiefung und Weiterentwicklung der Compliance-Grundsätze und -Regeln sowie der ethischen Prinzipien eingebunden sind.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n**EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf** \n\n#### **Ausblick Ausblick**  Die EVN AG wird im Geschäftsjahr 2023/24 den mit der Strategie 2030 vorgegebenen Kurs konzentriert weiterverfolgen.

ALLGEMEINE ANGABEN**\n\nDer vorliegende Jahresabschluss zum 30.09.2023 der EVN AG wurde vom Vorstand der Gesellschaft nach den Vorschriften des Unternehmensgesetzbuches (UGB) aufgestellt.\n\nDie Gesellschaft ist eine große Kapitalgesellschaft gemäß § 221 UGB.\n\nDie bisherige Form der Darstellung des Jahresabschlusses wurde bei der Erstellung des vorliegenden Jahresabschlusses beibehalten.\n\nDas Unternehmen ist Mutterunternehmen und gehört dem Konsolidierungskreis des EVN-Konzerns an. Der Konzernabschluss ist beim Firmenbuchgericht Wiener Neustadt hinterlegt.\n\nBeginnend mit dem Geschäftsjahr 2020/21 sind die NÖ Landes-Beteiligungsholding (NLH) und die WIENER STADTWERKE GmbH (WSTW) übereingekommen, dass die EVN AG in eine steuerliche Beteiligungsgemeinschaft iSd § 9 KStG einbezogen wird. Die EVN AG kann ihrerseits nach freiem Ermessen einzelne oder mehrere ihrer qualifizierenden Tochter- und Beteiligungsgemeinschaften in die Gruppe der Beteiligungsgemeinschaft einbeziehen. Die NLH und die WSTW sind selbst jeweils Gruppenträger einer Unternehmensgruppe. NLH bleibt als hauptbeteiligte Gesellschaft der Beteiligungsgemeinschaft Gruppenträger der EVN, WSTW ist minderbeteiligte Gesellschaft.\n\nZum 30. September 2023 hat die EVN AG ihrerseits mit der EVN Wasser GmbH, Netz Niederösterreich GmbH, EVN Wärme GmbH, evn naturkraft Erzeugungsgesellschaft m.b.H, EVN Energieservices GmbH, EVN Kroatien Holding GmbH, EVN Croatia Plin d.o.o., kabelplus GmbH, Utilitas Dienstleistungs- und Beteiligungs-Gesellschaft m.b.H, EVN Wärmekraftwerke GmbH, Burgenland Holding AG, RAG-Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft, RAG Austria AG, RAG Energy Storage GmbH, RAG Exploration & Production GmbH, EVN Umweltholding und Betriebs-GmbH, EVN Business Service GmbH, EVN Geoinfo GmbH, Netz Niederösterreich Beteiligung 31 GmbH, Netz Niederösterreich Liegenschaftsbesitz 31 GmbH sowie der EVN Umwelt Beteiligungs und Service GmbH eine Gruppen- und Steuerumlagevereinbarung abgeschlossen und bildet mit diesen Gesellschaften die steuerliche EVN Gruppe.\n\nDie Steuerumlagen in der \"EVN Gruppe\" werden jeweils nach der Belastungsmethode (\"stand-alone\"-Methode) ermittelt. Dabei werden bei überrechneten steuerlichen Verlusten, diese auf Seite der Gruppenmitglieder als \"interne Verlustvorträge\" evident gehalten und mit künftigen positiven Ergebnissen verrechnet. Eine Ausnahme davon bildet der Vertrag mit der Burgenland Holding AG, der vorsieht, dass der Burgenland Holding AG im Falle der Zurechnung eines negativen steuerlichen Ergebnisses auch dann eine negative Steuerumlage gutgeschrieben wird, wenn das Gruppenergebnis insgesamt positiv ist. Die EVN AG entrichtet ihrerseits eine Steuerumlage an die NLH und WSTW die sich vom steuerlichen Ergebnis der \"EVN Gruppe\" bemisst.\n\nIm Zuge einer konzerninternen Umstrukturierung infolge einer Neuausrichtung der Vertriebsaktivitäten des EVN Konzerns wurde mit 28. Februar 2023 der Teilbetrieb \"vertriebs- und energienahe Dienstleistungen\" der EVN KG in die 100%ige Tochtergesellschaft EVN Energieservice GmbH eingebracht. Die EVN KG soll sich damit künftig ausschließlich auf Stromund Gaslieferungen an Endkund\\*innen konzentrieren, während die EVN Energieservices sich auf vertriebs- und energienahe Dienstleistungen fokussiert. Weiters erfolgte eine Einbringung der Anteile an der EnergieAllianz Austria GmbH (EAA) in die EVN Energieservice GmbH. Dementsprechend werden die Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten an die EVN KG und EAA nunmehr als Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber Dritten ausgewiesen. Nachdem im Vorjahr der Ausweis unter Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber beteiligten Unternehmen erfolgte, sind die Vorjahreszahlen nur bedingt vergleichbar.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie Gewinn-und-Verlust-Rechnung wurde gem. § 231 Abs 1 in Verbindung mit Abs. 2 UGB nach dem Gesamtkostenverfahren erstellt.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2. BILANZIERUNGS- UND BEWERTUNGSMETHODEN**\n\n## **2.1. Allgemeine Grundsätze**\n\nDer Jahresabschluss wurde unter Beachtung der Grundsätze ordnungsmäßiger Buchführung und Bilanzierung erstellt und entspricht der Generalnorm für den Jahresabschluss, ein möglichst getreues Bild der Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage des Unternehmens zu vermitteln.\n\nBei der Erstellung des Jahresabschlusses wurde der Grundsatz der Vollständigkeit eingehalten.\n\nBei den angewandten Bilanzierungs- und Bewertungsmethoden wird gemäß § 237 Abs 1 Z1 UGB von der Fortführung des Unternehmens ausgegangen.\n\nBei Umgründungen werden die Buchwerte aus dem letzten Jahresabschluss oder einer Zwischenbilanz, die nach dem auf den letzten Jahresabschluss angewandten Bilanzierungsund Bewertungsmethoden zu erstellen ist, fortgeführt.\n\nBei den Vermögensgegenständen und Schulden wurde der Grundsatz der Einzelbewertung angewandt.\n\nDem Vorsichtsgrundsatz wurde Rechnung getragen, indem nur die am Abschlussstichtag verwirklichten Gewinne zum Ausweis gelangten und alle erkennbaren Risiken und drohenden Verluste, die bis zum Bilanzstichtag entstanden sind, berücksichtigt wurden.\n\nDie bisherigen angewandten Bilanzierungs- und Bewertungsmethoden wurden beibehalten.\n\n## **2.2. Anlagevermögen**\n\n**Immaterielle Vermögensgegenstände** werden zu Anschaffungskosten, vermindert um lineare, planmäßige Abschreibungen bewertet. Gemäß den steuerrechtlichen Vorschriften nimmt die Gesellschaft für Zugänge im ersten Halbjahr eine volle Jahresabschreibung, für Zugänge im zweiten Halbjahr eine halbe Jahresabschreibung vor. Außerplanmäßige Abschreibungen auf einen zum Abschlussstichtag niedrigeren beizulegenden Wert werden vorgenommen, soweit die Wertminderung voraussichtlich von Dauer ist.\n\n**Gegenstände des Sachanlagevermögens** werden zu Anschaffungs- bzw. Herstellungskosten, vermindert um lineare, planmäßige Abschreibungen bewertet. Gemäß den steuerrechtlichen Vorschriften nimmt die Gesellschaft für Zugänge im ersten Halbjahr eine volle Jahresabschreibung, für Zugänge im zweiten Halbjahr eine halbe Jahresabschreibung vor.\n\nAußerplanmäßige Abschreibungen auf einen zum Abschlussstichtag niedrigeren beizulegenden Wert werden vorgenommen, soweit die Wertminderung voraussichtlich von Dauer ist.\n\nDie Herstellungskosten enthalten Material- und Fertigungseinzelkosten sowie angemessene Teile der Material- und Fertigungsgemeinkosten. Aufwendungen der allgemeinen Verwaltung sowie Fremdkapitalzinsen werden nicht aktiviert. Die der Aktivierung von Eigenleistungen zugrundeliegenden Personalstundensätze berücksichtigen auch Aufwendungen für freiwillige Sozialleistungen, Abfertigungen und überbetriebliche Altersversorgung. Ein Ausscheiden überhöhter Gemeinkosten infolge offenbarer Unterbeschäftigung war nicht erforderlich.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\nDer betriebsgewöhnlichen Nutzungsdauer werden branchenübliche Richtwerte zugrunde gelegt. Die Abschreibungssätze sind nachstehender Tabelle zu entnehmen.\n\n| Abschreibungen nach Anlagenkategorien                       | Nutzungsdauer in Jahren | Planm         äßige Abschreibung in % |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Rechte                                                      | 4-40                    | 2,5-25                                |\n| Geb         äude                                            | 10-50                   | 2-10                                  |\n| Kraftwerks- und Erzeugungsanlagen                           | 20                      | 5                                     |\n| andere Anlagen, Betriebs- und Gesch         äftsausstattung | 3-20                    | 5-33,3                                |\n\nGeringwertige Vermögensgegenstände werden im Zugangsjahr aktiviert und sofort abgeschrieben. Die Ausbuchung dieser Anlagen erfolgt nach Ablauf der Nutzungsdauern, die für die definierten Anlagengruppen grundsätzlich gelten.\n\nDie **Finanzanlagen** werden zu Anschaffungskosten oder, falls ihnen ein niedrigerer Wert (z.

Börsekurs) beizulegen ist, mit diesem angesetzt, wenn die Wertminderungen voraussichtlich von Dauer sind.\n\nBei der Bewertung von Anteilen an verbundenen Unternehmen müssen vor allem in Bezug auf künftige Zahlungsmittelüberschüsse Schätzungen unter Unsicherheit vorgenommen werden. Eine Änderung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen, der Branchen- oder der Unternehmenssituation in der Zukunft kann zu einer Reduktion bzw. Erhöhung der Zahlungsmittelüberschüsse und somit zu Wertminderungen bzw. Wertaufholungen führen.\n\nDen Bewertungen wird auf Basis der voraussichtlichen Entwicklung ein kapitalwertorientiertes Verfahren zugrunde gelegt, bei dem die gewichteten durchschnittlichen Kapitalkosten (Weighted Average Cost of Capital = WACC) verwendet werden. Diese entsprechen der durchschnittlichen gewichteten Verzinsung von Eigen- und Fremdkapital. Die Gewichtung von Eigen- und Fremdkapitalverzinsung – diese entspricht einer Kapitalstruktur zu Marktwerten – werden aus einer adäquaten Peer Group abgeleitet. Vor dem Hintergrund des derzeit volatilen Finanzmarktumfelds stellt die Entwicklung der Kapitalkosten (und insbesondere der Länderrisikoprämien) eine Unsicherheit dar und wird laufend beobachtet.\n\nAls Preisgerüst dienen ab dem fünften Jahr (keine aussagekräftigen Marktpreise an den Strombörsen mehr verfügbar) Prognosen zweier renommierter Marktforschungsinstitute und Informationsdienstleister in der Energiewirtschaft, welche aufgrund der derzeitigen Volatilität der Strommärkte jährlich aktualisiert werden.\n\n**Ausleihungen** werden zu Anschaffungskosten, unverzinsliche bzw. niedrig verzinsliche Ausleihungen zum Barwert bilanziert. Außerplanmäßige Abschreibungen werden nur im Fall einer voraussichtlich dauernden Wertminderung vorgenommen.\n\n**Zuschreibungen zu Vermögensgegenständen des Anlagevermögens** werden vorgenommen, wenn die Gründe für die außerplanmäßige Abschreibung weggefallen sind. Die Zuschreibung erfolgt auf maximal den Nettobuchwert, der sich unter Berücksichtigung der Normalabschreibungen, die inzwischen vorzunehmen gewesen wären, ergibt.\n\n## **2.3. Umlaufvermögen**\n\nDie Bewertung der Vorräte erfolgt zu Anschaffungs- bzw. Herstellungskosten oder dem niedrigeren Wert aus Anschaffungskosten oder beizulegendem Wert am Bilanzstichtag. Die Anschaffungskosten für den Gasvorrat werden nach dem gleitenden Durchschnittspreisverfahren ermittelt. Bestandsrisken, die sich aus der Lagerdauer sowie geminderter Verwendbarkeit ergeben, werden durch angemessene Wertabschläge berücksichtigt.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nFür notwendige Beschaffungen von CO2-Emissionszertifikaten erfolgt die Bilanzierung zu Anschaffungskosten, für Zuführungen zu Rückstellungen aufgrund allfälliger Unterdeckungen mit dem Zeitwert zum Bilanzstichtag. Als Verbrauchsfolgeverfahren von CO2 Zertifikaten wird das First-in-first-out Prinzip angewendet.\n\nForderungen und sonstige Vermögensgegenstände werden mit dem Nennbetrag angesetzt. Längerfristige unverzinsliche bzw. niedrig verzinsliche Forderungen werden entsprechend diskontiert. Für erkennbare Risiken werden Einzelwertberichtigungen gebildet. Für das allgemeine Kreditrisiko erfolgt eine pauschale Einzelwertberichtigung je nach Außenstandsdauer mit folgenden Wertberichtigungssätzen:\n\n| Außenstandsdauer: | Wertberichtigungsprozentsatz: |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| noch nicht fällig | 0,06%                         |\n| 1 - 89 Tage       | 0,13%                         |\n| 90 - 179 Tage     | 83,43%                        |\n| 180 - 359 Tage    | 79,30%                        |\n| 360 - 719 Tage    | 81,14%                        |\n| 720 - 1079 Tage   | 91,68%                        |\n| >1080 Tage        | 92,02%                        |\n\nDie Wertpapiere des Umlaufvermögens werden zu Anschaffungskosten oder dem niedrigeren beizulegendem Wert zum Bilanzstichtag bewertet.\n\nZuschreibungen zu Vermögensgegenständen des Umlaufvermögens werden vorgenommen, wenn die Gründe für die Abschreibung weggefallen sind.\n\n## **2.4. Latente Steuern**\n\nLatente Steuern werden gemäß § 198 Abs 9 und 10 UGB nach dem bilanzorientierten Konzept und ohne Abzinsung auf Basis des Steuersatzes der im Zeitpunkt der Umkehr der befristeten Unterschiede gelten wird gebildet. Die im Geschäftsjahr 2021/22 beschlossene ökosoziale Steuerreform, den Körperschaftsteuersatz ab dem Jahr 2023 etappenweise auf 24 % und ab dem Jahr 2024 auf 23 % zu senken, wird dementsprechend bei der Bewertung der latenten Steuern berücksichtigt.\n\n## **2.5. Rückstellungen**\n\nDie Ermittlung der Rückstellungen für Abfertigungen sowie für Pensionen und pensionsähnlichen Verpflichtungen erfolgt nach versicherungsmathematischen Grundsätzen unter der Anwendung der \"Projected-Unit-Credit\"-Methode gemäß IAS 19. Die Berechnung erfolgt mit einem Rechnungszinssatz von 4,30 % (Abfertigungen) (VJ: 3,60 %) bzw. 4,30 % (Pensionen) (VJ: 3,70 %) sowie unter Berücksichtigung von künftigen jährlichen Gehaltssteigerungen und Erhöhungen von Pensionen von 7,0 % (VJ: 3,50 %) im nächsten Jahr, einer jährlichen Steigerung von 3,5 % für 2025 (VJ: 2,25 %) und einer jährlichen Steigerung von 2,25 % für Folgejahre (VJ: 2,25 %).\n\nDas Pensionsantrittsalter wurde für Männer und Frauen nunmehr einheitlich mit 63 Jahren angesetzt. Für Frauen wurde zusätzlich die Übergangsregelung 60 - 63 Jahre berücksichtigt. (Vorjahr: Männer 65 Jahre, Frauen 60 - 65 Jahre). Hinsichtlich der Sterbewahrscheinlichkeit kommen die Berechnungstafeln (\"AVÖ 2018–P\") zur Anwendung.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **EVN AG, Maria Enzersdorf**\n\nDer Rückstellung für Jubiläumsgeldverpflichtungen liegt eine versicherungsmathematische Berechnung nach IAS 19 zugrunde. Es werden dieselben Parameter wie bei den Berechnungen der Rückstellungen für Pensionsverpflichtungen angewandt.\n\nDer Rechnungszinssatz für alle Sozialkapitalrückstellungen ist ein Stichtagszinssatz basierend auf Renditen von hochwertigen, festverzinslichen Unternehmensanleihen, wobei die Fälligkeiten der zu zahlenden Leistungen entsprechend berücksichtigt werden. Die Zinsen auf die Rückstellungen für Sozialkapital sowie Auswirkungen aus einer Änderung des Zinssatzes werden im Finanzergebnis ausgewiesen.\n\nIn den sonstigen Rückstellungen werden unter Beachtung des Vorsichtsprinzips alle zum Zeitpunkt der Bilanzerstellung erkennbaren Risiken und der Höhe sowie dem Grunde nach ungewissen Verbindlichkeiten mit den Beträgen berücksichtigt, die nach vernünftiger kaufmännischer Beurteilung erforderlich sind.\n\nLangfristige Rückstellungen werden in Abhängigkeit von ihrer erwarteten Laufzeit mit einem Zinssatz von 0,91 % (VJ: 0,43 %) abgezinst.\n\n## **2.6. Verbindlichkeiten**\n\nDie Verbindlichkeiten sind mit dem Erfüllungsbetrag unter Bedachtnahme auf den Grundsatz der Vorsicht angesetzt.\n\n## **2.7. Währungsumrechnung**\n\nDie Währungsumrechnung erfolgt zum Zeitpunkt des Geschäftsvorfalles mit dem aktuellen Kurs. Zum Bilanzstichtag erfolgt bei den Forderungen eine Abwertung, sofern der Stichtagskurs niedriger als der Entstehungskurs ist, bei den Verbindlichkeiten eine Aufwertung sofern der Stichtagskurs höher als der Entstehungskurs ist. In Fremdwährung angeschaffte Gegenstände des Anlage- oder Umlaufvermögens werden mit dem Entstehungskurs erfasst, wobei keine weitere Umwertung erfolgt.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3.

Bei diesen Transaktionen hat sich die EVN AG verpflichtet, in bestimmten Verzugs- und Verlustfällen an die Österreichische Elektrizitätswirtschafts-Aktiengesellschaft (Verbund AG) Kostenersatz zu leisten.\n\nFür die im Auftrag der EVN AG getätigten Geschäfte der ENERGIEALLIANZ Austria GmbH für den Eigenhandel sowie die Beschaffung von Elektrizität und Gas wurden gegenüber den Handelspartnern Patronatserklärungen erteilt. Die Eventualverbindlichkeiten hierfür werden in Höhe des tatsächlichen Risikos für die EVN AG angesetzt. Dieses Risiko bemisst sich an Veränderungen zwischen vereinbartem Preis und aktuellem Marktpreis, wobei sich bei Beschaffungsgeschäften ein Risiko nur bei gesunkenen Marktpreisen und bei Absatzgeschäften ein Risiko nur bei gestiegenen Marktpreisen ergibt.\n\nDementsprechend kann sich das Risiko aufgrund von Marktpreisänderungen nach dem Stichtag entsprechend verändern. Aus dieser Risikobewertung resultierte per 30. September 2023 eine Eventualverbindlichkeit in Höhe von EUR 204.946.727,06 (VJ: TEUR 19.765). Das dieser Bewertung zugrundeliegende Nominalvolumen der Garantien betrug EUR 496.600.253,99. Zum 31. Oktober 2023 betrug das Risiko betreffend Marktpreisänderungen EUR 159.343.258,85 bei einem zugrundeliegenden Nominalvolumen von EUR 502.834.861,40.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3.2.6. Art, Zweck und finanzielle Auswirkungen sonstiger nicht in der Bilanz ausgewiesener oder angegebener Geschäfte**\n\nDie Gesellschaft hat im Geschäftsjahr folgende wesentliche Verträge mit Wirkung für die Folgeperioden abgeschlossen:\n\n- 1. Kontrahierung von Gasspeichernutzungsmöglichkeiten im Umfang von bis zu 643 MW Ausspeicherleistung für den Zeitraum 01.04.2023 bis 31.03.2027. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 3 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 2. Abschluss von Großhandelskontrakten Strom mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 mit einer Netto-Verkaufsmenge von 666.636 MWh. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 117 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 3. Abschluss von Großhandelskontrakten Erdgas mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 mit einer Netto-Verkaufsmenge von 1.071.648 MWh. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 293 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 4. Abschluss von Bezugsverträgen über den Bezug von Energie aus Erneuerbaren Energieträgern mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 im Umfang von 23.629 MWh. Die Kontrahierung dieser Mengen erfolgte im Wege von 2 Einzeltransaktionen.\n- 5. Abschluss von Bezugs- und Lieferverträgen über den Bezug von elektrischer Energie in Verbindung mit Herkunftsnachweisen mit Lieferung nach dem 30.09.2023 im Umfang 584.346 MWh.\n- 6. Abschluss eines Netzreservevertrages mit APG über die Vorhaltung von 470 MW Leistung für die Zwecke des Engpassmanagement für den Zeitraum 01.10.2023 bis 30.09.2024.\n\nHinsichtlich der wertmäßigen Auswirkung der derivativen Verträge wird auf den Abschnitt zu den derivativen Finanzinstrumenten verwiesen.\n\n## **3.2.7. Finanzinstrumente**\n\nDie Bilanzierungs- und Bewertungsgrundsätze sind beim jeweiligen Bilanzposten angeführt. Käufe und Verkäufe von Finanzinstrumenten werden zum Settlement-Stichtag gebucht.\n\nLangfristige Veranlagungen dienen dem Aufbau des für das Sozialkapital erforderlichen Deckungsstocks und erfolgen im Rahmen von extern verwalteten Investmentfonds.\n\nDas Kreditrisiko von Forderungen entspricht den in der Bilanz ausgewiesenen, um vorgenommene Wertberichtigungen reduzierten Wertansätzen.\n\nAlle Finanzinstrumente werden sofort nach Abschluss in einem Treasury- und Risikomanagementsystem erfasst. Dies ermöglicht einen tagesaktuellen Überblick über alle wesentlichen Risikokennzahlen. Für das Risiko-Controlling wurde zudem ein eigenes Team im Finanzwesen mit Stabstellecharakter eingerichtet, das laufend Risikoanalysen, u.a. basierend auf der Value-at-Risk-Methode erstellt.\n\nDerivative Finanzinstrumente dienen in erster Linie der Absicherung des Unternehmens gegen Marktpreisänderungsrisiken (insbesondere Wechselkurs- und Zinsänderungsrisiken) sowie zur Bereitstellung der benötigten liquiden Mittel in der erforderlichen Währung. Ziel des Marktrisikomanagements ist es, wirtschaftliche Effekte, die sich aus Marktpreisschwankungen ergeben, zu minimieren. Das aktive Marktrisikomanagement führt zu einer verbesserten Planbarkeit in Bezug auf Ergebnisgrößen, erwartete Zahlungsströme und Bilanzpositionen.\n\nDie Nominalwerte sind die saldierten Summen der zu den jeweiligen Finanzderivaten gehörenden Einzelpositionen zum Bilanzstichtag. Sie entsprechen zwar den zwischen den Vertragspartnern vereinbarten Beträgen, sind jedoch kein Maßstab für das Risiko des Unternehmens aus dem Einsatz dieser Finanzinstrumente. Das Risikopotenzial umfasst insbesondere Schwankungen der zugrunde liegenden Marktparameter. Die Bewertung der Finan-\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nzinstrumente erfolgt mittels marktgängiger, stichtagsbezogener Wechselkurse sowie Zinsstrukturkurven. Das Kreditrisiko der Vertragspartner findet dabei Berücksichtigung.\n\nFür derivative Finanzinstrumente werden die Nominalwerte sowie die aktuellen Marktwerte (Fair Values) angegeben.\n\nDie derivativen Finanzinstrumente setzen sich zum Bilanzstichtag wie folgt zusammen und sind in den folgenden Bilanzpositionen erfasst:\n\n| Derivative Finanzinstrumente mit Sicherungsbeziehung |                        |            |                      |            |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|----------------------|------------|\n|                                                      | Nominalwert in Mio JPY |            | Marktwert in Mio EUR |            |\n|                                                      | 30.09.2023             | 30.09.2022 | 30.09.2023           | 30.09.2022 |\n| Währungsswaps                                        |                        |            |                      |            |\n| JPY (unter 1 Jahr)                                   | 10.000,0               | 10.000,0   | -19,4                | -11,2      |\n\nDie in obiger Tabelle ausgewiesenen Währungsswaps sind Cross-Currency Swaps zur Absicherung der Zins- und Währungsrisiken der in fremder Währung begebenen Anleihe (JPY-Anleihe). Die Laufzeit der Währungsswaps ist ident mit der Laufzeit der Anleihe bis 2024.\n\nDie Effektivität der Sicherungsbeziehung der Cross-Currency Swaps wird zumindest quartalsweise geprüft. Prospektiv wird die Critical-Terms-Match-Methode angewandt. Retrospektiv erfolgt diese Prüfung mittels Dollar-Offset-Methode (ergänzt um eine Regressionsanalyse), wobei die verschiedenen gesicherten Risiken (Zins- und Währungsrisiken) mit Hilfe von hypothetischen Derivaten einzeln gemessen werden. Per 30.09.2023 beträgt die auf das Zinsrisiko bezogene Effektivität aufgrund der kurzen Restlaufzeit lediglich 52 %. Mittels Regressionsanalyse, die ein Bestimmtheitsmaß von 0,99992 ergibt, wird jedoch die Effektivität nachgewiesen. Die auf das Währungsrisiko bezogene Effektivität beläuft sich auf 97 %.\n\nEine dokumentierte Widmung der Verträge wurde vollzogen, indem das abzusichernde Risiko identifiziert, der Beginn der Sicherungsbeziehung festgelegt und das Vorliegen aller materiellen Voraussetzungen nachvollziehbar begründet wurde. In materieller Hinsicht gilt hier dazu, dass die Sicherungsgeschäfte die qualitative Eignung des abgesicherten Grundgeschäfts besitzen, ein Absicherungsbedarf auf Basis des Preisänderungsrisikos aus dem Grundgeschäft vorliegt, eine bestehende Absicherungsstrategie existiert und die Derivate qualitativ geeignet als Sicherungsinstrument sind.\n\nFür derivative Instrumente mit negativem Marktwert wird keine Drohverlustrückstellung gebildet, sofern eine Sicherungsbeziehung mit den jeweils zugrundeliegenden Geschäften besteht.\n\n## **Energiebereich:**\n\nDie nachfolgende Tabelle zeigt die saldierten Werte der derivativen Finanzinstrumente ausgenommen Geschäfte, die im Portfolioansatz (siehe unten) enthalten sind.
