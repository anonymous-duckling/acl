This involves substantially contributing to one or more environmental objectives, not significantly harming any other environmental objective, complying with minimum social safeguards, and meeting the technical screening criteria.**\n\n#### Taxonomically eligible activities\n\nWithin this framework, technical selection criteria are established to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation. The regulation defines what is known as a taxonomically eligible activity. This refers to an economic activity described in the delegated acts, which establish the technical criteria for activities with the potential to mitigate climate change, regardless of whether the economic activity meets some or all of the technical selection criteria.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/4 description: A person is using a microscope to examine a red cylindrical object. The microscope is white and blue, and the person's hand is dark-skinned. The object is sitting on a clear glass slide, and the person is holding it in place with their fingers. The background is blurry, but it appears to be a laboratory setting.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/0 description: The image is an abstract, out-of-focus shot featuring a gradient of blues and grays. The left side of the image is lighter, with a swirling, circular pattern that fades into darker shades of blue and gray on the right. A faint, diagonal line of light cuts across the lower right portion of the image.\n\nIn line with this definition, Tubacex assesses whether the Group's activities fall within the scope of the Regulation. The criteria established in 2022 for the eligibility analysis are maintained, considering steel manufacturing activities (Aceralava) and excluding other subsidiaries engaged in the production of tubes and other tubular products, machined products, or additional complementary services added to the final product.\n\nSimultaneously, following the approval of the Environmental Delegated Regulation on June 13, 2023, by the European Commission, which defines complementary activities in accordance with the remaining four environmental objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems), the company analyzes whether its activities are covered by the said Delegated Regulation. It concludes that they are excluded as they do not adhere to the descriptions of the incorporated activities.\n\n#### Taxonomically Aligned Activities\n\nA taxonomically aligned economic activity meets all the requirements set forth in the aforementioned Regulation:\n\n- Substantially contribute to one of the environmental objectives: Climate change mitigation and adaptation, water and marine resources protection, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n- Do not significantly harm other objectives: The assessment ensures that the taxonomy itself does not include economic activities that undermine any of the other five environmental objectives.\n- Meet minimum social safeguards: Compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights is required.\n\nIn accordance with the criteria defined for the eligibility analysis, the scope of alignment evaluation focuses on the stainless-steel long products manufacturing activity carried out by the Group's steel plant, Aceralava, and the products from this plant commercialized through TSS. Compliance is achieved in this case using scrap in EAF furnaces, with over 70% of fine steel production derived from scrap consumption.\n\n#### Results\n\nFor the calculation of indicators, Tubacex considers eligible and, according to the analysis performed, aligned sales from Aceralava to third parties, as well as sales from the trading companies (TSS) of steel (eligible activity) versus other products (non-eligible activity), considering TSS sales \"by material origin\" (Aceralava). For CAPEX and OPEX, the corresponding entries from Aceralava and the proportion of TSS used for the related activity are taken into account.\n\nFor denominators, the calculation is based on the following criteria. The percentages of eligibility and alignment in revenue, OPEX, and CAPEX for the climate change mitigation objective are detailed below, as no activities associated with the other environmental objectives have been identified.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                  |                 | Sales (%)  | Sales (€ thousand) |\n|------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------|\n| 2023             |                 |            |                    |\n| Elegible         | Aligned (1)     | 10.81      | 92,185             |\n|                  | Non-aligned (2) |            |                    |\n| Non-eligible (3) |                 | 89.19      | 760,280            |\n| <b>TOTAL</b>     |                 | <b>100</b> | <b>852,392</b>     |\n| 2022             |                 |            |                    |\n| Elegible         | Aligned (1)     | 11.2       | 80,195             |\n|                  | Non-aligned (2) |            |                    |\n| Non-eligible (3) |                 | 88.8       | 634,520            |\n\n| CAPEX            |                 |           |                    |\n|------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| 2023             |                 | CAPEX (%) | CAPEX (€ thousand) |\n| Elegible         | Aligned (1)     | 3.75      | 3,264              |\n|                  | Non-aligned (2) |           |                    |\n| Non-eligible (3) |                 | 96.25     | 83,706             |\n| TOTAL            |                 | 100       | 86,969.7           |\n| 2022             |                 | CAPEX (%) | CAPEX (€ thousand) |\n| Elegible         | Aligned (1)     | 10.7      | 2,902.2            |\n|                  | Non-aligned (2) |           |                    |\n| Non-eligible (3) |                 | 89.3      | 24,289.8           |\n| TOTAL            |                 | 100       | 27.192             |\n\n#### OPEX\n\n| 2023             |                 | OPEX (%) | OPEX (€ thousand) |\n|------------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|\n| Eligible         | Aligned (1)     | 21.28    | 4,845.08          |\n|                  | Non-aligned (2) |          |                   |\n| Non-eligible (3) |                 | 78.72    | 17,920.82         |\n| TOTAL            |                 | 100      | 22,765.90         |\n| 2022             |                 | OPEX (%) | OPEX (€ thousand) |\n| Eligible         | Aligned (1)     | 25.3     | 6,713.8           |\n|                  | Non-aligned (2) |          |                   |\n| Non-eligible (3) |                 | 74.7     | 19,826.2          |\n\n*(1) Revenue / CAPEX / OPEX from environmentally sustainable activities (aligned with the taxonomy).*\n\n*(2) Revenue / CAPEX / OPEX from activities eligible under the taxonomy but not environmentally sustainable (not aligned with the taxonomy).*\n\n*(3) Revenue / CAPEX / OPEX from activities not eligible under the taxonomy.*\n\n*The reduction in eligible CAPEX for 2023 compared to 2022 is due to the inclusion of CAPEX related to Tubacex's growth project in the Middle East and the greater weight it represents within the Group.

GARCÍA SANZ** CEO **JESÚS ESMORÍS ESMORÍS**\n\n## NT2: THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND TUBACEX'S NEW STRATEGIC CYCLE IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nWe are at the beginning of a transformative period in our company's history, driven by our strategic plan NT2, \"A New Tubacex in the Energy Transition,\" which we presented at the Capital Markets Day on November 21, 2023, in Madrid. This new phase is transforming our organization into a provider of advanced industrial products and services for the energy and mobility sectors.\n\nAs we present the 2023 annual report, we are proud to highlight that this has been a year of historic achievements for Tubacex. We recorded a notable turnover of 852.4 million euros, reflecting a 19.3% increase from the previous year, and our EBITDA grew by 35.6%, reaching 125.2 million euros. This significant improvement is marked by an EBITDA margin of 14.7%, the best in Tubacex's history.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/0 description: The image shows a dark background with streaks of light in various colors, including blue, purple, and gold. The streaks of light are arranged in a circular pattern, creating a sense of movement and energy. The overall effect is abstract and visually striking.\n\nDuring this fiscal year, we exceeded our established forecasts, registering remarkable growth in key product and service segments and achieving a historic order book worth 1.6 billion euros. This robust performance results from our commitment to diversification, innovation, and our ability to anticipate market needs, particularly in the low-carbon segment.\n\nIn this context, the launch of NT2 is particularly noteworthy, renewing our commitment to growth, innovation, sustainability, and the security of energy supply. The updated strategic plan establishes the creation of Tubacex's low-carbon division, based on technologies such as CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) and hydrogen.\n\nOur goal is to lead the low-carbon segment, reduce our exposure to the oil & gas sector to one-third, and achieve a turnover between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros by 2027, with an EBITDA exceeding 200 million euros and a debt/ EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times.\n\nDiversification and international expansion, including over 30 long-term agreements and the new CRA OCTG plant in Abu Dhabi, are highlights of our strategy.\n\nIn this context, our share price increased by 75.2% in 2023, reaching 3.5 euros per share, proposing a gross dividend of 14.5 million euros, with a payout of 40%.\n\nThe Tubacex Foundation continues to be our vehicle for social traction, working on training, diversity (equity and equality), CO2 impact reduction, and community support.\n\nTubacex continues to deploy its roadmap aligned with the Paris Agreement, called Ambition 2030. This plan aims to mitigate the environmental impact of our industrial activity with the ultimate goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nFinally, we extend our most sincere gratitude to the entire Tubacex team for their effort and dedication, which have been fundamental in achieving these exceptional results.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/0 description: The image shows a large white number \"1\" on the left side of the image, with a background of green and black curved lines.

Strategic Plan Update\n\nThe first significant event is the early achievement of the 2022- 2025 Strategic Plan, two years ahead of schedule, prompting the company to update it for the 2024-2027 period (chapter 2). Under the name NT2 (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition), the new roadmap maintains the five pillars of the previous plan: leadership in sustainability, net debt reduction, operational stability and profitability, competitiveness, efficiency, and diversification. However, it sets more ambitious goals supported by the energy transition, aiming to achieve a turnover of between 1.2 billion euros and 1.4 billion euros, an EBITDA of over 200 million euros, and a Net Financial Debt/EBITDA ratio below 2 times (currently 2.5), according to the Group's estimates.\n\nThe presentation of this updated Strategic Plan took place at the Capital Markets Day held in Madrid on November 21, 2023. Following this event, the company's shares began a rally, increasing by more than 30% by the end of the year and by 70% compared to the end of 2022 (chapter 5).\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/0 description: A man wearing a white hard hat and black earmuffs is seen from the back, wearing a black jacket with yellow stripes and the words \"TUBACEX GROUP\" on the back. He is standing on a platform with a blue sky in the background.\n\n#### 2.Record Results\n\nThis milestone is only achievable following another significant accomplishments the record-breaking results (chapter 5). These include record sales of 852.4 million euros (+19.3%), an EBITDA of 125.2 million euros (+35.6%), and an EBITDA margin of 14.7%. Additionally, the order backlog was maintained at a historic level of 1.6 billion euros.\n\n#### 3. Low Carbon\n\nIn terms of sustainability, within the framework of its \"Ambition 2030\" program, Tubacex promotes a decarbonization plan that allows it to meet the emission reduction targets set by the European Union and offers sustainable solutions to help its clients achieve these goals, thus anticipating their needs. Tubacex is reducing emissions through improvements in manufacturing and recycling processes, while also helping its clients reduce their emissions by enhancing efficiency, lifespan, and lifecycle.\n\nA third significant milestone is the promotion of the Low Carbon division, poised to become the spearhead of the company as a global leader in the energy transition. This division develops solutions for new sustainable technologies, such as the growing CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) business by providing tubular solutions for CO2 capture, transport, and sequestration, and the emerging hydrogen market as a substitute for fossil fuels.\n\nAll these measures are supported by prominent ESG certification bodies, including Science Based Targets (SBT) commitments for emission reduction and S&P sustainability standards.\n\nThese milestones highlight how the company aims to anticipate global trends, positioning itself as a leader not only in sectoral changes but also in social advancements.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/0 description: A group of five people are standing in front of a dark brown wall with the number 8 on it.

Board of Directors\n\nThe year 2023 marked the second full year for the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who, as an independent director, succeeded Mr. Álvaro Videgain in 2021. The Board has established several committees to assist in its duties and ensure proper governance of Tubacex. Specifically, these committees are the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, the Sustainability and Good Governance Committee, and the Strategy and Monitoring Committee.\n\nWith these committees, the Tubacex Board of Directors strengthens its commitment to transparency, integrity, and sustainability, ensuring efficient and responsible management that benefits all its stakeholders.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/0 description: A group of seven people are standing in a row.

These regulations incorporated all the responsibilities assigned to this delegated body by the Capital Companies Act, best practices for listed companies, and the recommendations of the Good Governance Code for listed companies approved in 2020.\n\nAmong its functions, notable responsibilities include the supervision of the process for preparing and presenting both financial and non-financial information, as well as the oversight of non-financial risks.\n\n#### Appointments and Remunerations Committee\n\nSimilarly, the company's highest decision-making body approved new regulations for the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, incorporating the content provided for this committee in the Capital Companies Act and the CNMV Technical Guide. By doing so, Tubacex adopts the best practices in this area, reinforcing the role of this committee in relation to the Board concerning the executive team, for whom it establishes policies on appointments, remuneration, and dismissals. Additionally, the committee plays a key role in managing conflicts of interest.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Commission on Sustainability and Good Governance\n\nTo strengthen the governance structure and in line with existing recommendations and best practices, the Board of Directors of Tubacex agreed in 2021 to establish a new Sustainability and Good Governance Committee. The functions of this committee are outlined in the \"Regulations of the Sustainability and Good Governance Committee\" and consist of:\n\n- 1. Promoting the company's ESG policies to ensure they are geared towards value creation through sustainable behaviors.\n- 2. Ensuring that the Group's Strategic Plan integrates and develops ESG policies.\n- 3. Understanding, supervising, and evaluating the relationship processes with various stakeholders.\n- 4. Ensuring that ESG-related risks are adequately integrated into the Group's risk management and control models.\n- 5. Determining the guidelines, criteria, and general principles that should govern the content of the Non-Financial Information Statement and any other equivalent reporting system.\n- 6. Collaborating with the Tubacex Foundation to identify elements of the Group's strategy that can be promoted\n\nthrough specific ESG projects, making the Foundation an instrument of sustainability policy.\n\n7. Encouraging the Group's compliance with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approved by the United Nations.\n\n#### Strategy and Monitoring Committee\n\nThe Regulations of the Strategy and Monitoring Committee were approved in 2022. This committee is chaired, as usual, by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn all committee meetings, the secretary of the Board of Directors acts as the secretary to ensure the required coordination as mandated by the Board's Regulations.\n\nAt the end of 2023, following the annual evaluation exercise of the Board, the work of each committee for 2024 has been planned, along with the calendar for the entire year. This annual evaluation has been conducted by the Board of Directors since 2002 to continuously improve the functioning of the Board, its delegated bodies, and its main statutory roles, namely the chairman, the CEO, and the secretary of the Board.\n\nAs a novelty, the most recent evaluation was conducted internally, following an external evaluation the previous year, thereby applying the best corporate governance practices for listed companies.\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/15 description: The image shows a stack of white pipes.

The pipe is connected to a larger system of pipes and equipment. The image also contains the text \"2.1 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE MARKET\".\n\n**The geopolitical tensions generated from the wars between Russia and Ukraine, as well as between Gaza and Israel, along with attacks in the Red Sea, the lingering effects of COVID-19 in China, and the subsequent reopening of its economy, and the still persistent inflation with consequent interest rate hikes to curb it, are some of the uncertainties that have marked 2023. Although the scare of recession has faded, the global economic growth remains weak and is trending downward as we head into the new fiscal year.**\n\nThis year, the industrial sector has experienced a decline in energy and raw material prices, following the significant increase registered the previous year due to the war in Europe. Currently, the industry is focusing on the evolution of demand and metal prices, influenced by the tightening of financing conditions and the instability of international trade.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of industrial pipes and valves. The pipes are various shades of gray and green. The green pipe has a valve with white accents and is connected to a gray pipe with bolts. The pipes are supported by a metal structure. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an industrial setting with other pipes and equipment.\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/1 description: A person wearing a yellow welding mask and brown gloves is welding a metal pipe. The person is standing in front of a red metal structure and a metal can. The background is dark and blurry.\n\nIn the backdrop, the mandated decarbonization of economies requires significant investments to undertake the energy transition and agility to adapt to the new 'green' regulatory framework.\n\nIn this context, Regulation 2023/956, dated May 10, 2023, establishes the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a mechanism that, when fully implemented, will require importers of goods into the European Union to purchase certificates equivalent to the carbon price they would have paid if the goods had been produced under EU carbon pricing rules. To comply with this regulation, Tubacex is developing an adaptation project to address the first phase (transition period) of this regulation and report quarterly the emissions generated in its imports.\n\nWithin the regulatory framework directly impacting Tubacex's business, there are positive news following the extension until March 2025 of the suspension of rebalancing tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum products by the European Union, in exchange for the U.S. reviewing Section 232 and replacing it with a quota system.\n\nAdditionally, Tubacex's European production centers benefit from the European Commission's decision to extend the import protection regime by one more year (until June 2024).\n\nThere are also positive regulatory developments from China, as the anti-dumping tariffs on tubes originating from the Chinese giant are under review, with a possible extension in 2024 for an additional five years.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2.2 BUSINESS STRATEGY\" on the left side of the image. On the right side of the image, there is a picture of an oil rig in the ocean.\n\n**Despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, in 2023, Tubacex achieved a milestone that highlights the value of the roadmap designed after the pandemic to strengthen the Group and prepare it for sustainability with a key role in the energy transition, contributing to energy supply security. This milestone is the achievement of the objectives of its 2022-2025 Strategic Plan two years ahead of schedule, leading the company to update it for the 2024-2027 period.**\n\nThroughout the year, the strong performance of the industrial sector, combined with the competitiveness and high performance of the company's advanced industrial solutions, has not only ensured revenue stability but also resulted in excellent outcomes accompanied by a solid order backlog valued at 1.6 billion euros. The current plan estimated sales of between 1 billion euros and 1.2 billion euros for 2025, but the quarterly results of 2023 indicate the company's positive momentum and suggest an upward revision of the targets.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/0 description: The image shows three risk matrices representing climate change risks over time: Short Term (2025), Mid Term (2030), and Long Term (2050). Each matrix plots Impact against Probability, with different icons indicating various types of risks. The risks include Acute physical risks, Chronical physical risks, Risks of market transition, Technical transition risks, Reputational transition risks, and Policy & Legal transition risks. The positions of these icons within the matrices shift over time, indicating changes in the perceived impact and probability of each risk category.\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/1 description: A man wearing a face mask and safety glasses is operating a CNC machine.

The man is focused on his work, and he appears to be skilled in operating the machine.\n\nUnder the name NT2 (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition), the new Strategic Plan retains the essence of the previous one, setting more ambitious goals based on energy transition and the transformation of the company with the Low Carbon business unit, along with a strong commitment to diversification as a spearhead.\n\nThus, by 2027, the company aims to achieve a turnover of between 1.2 billion euros and 1.4 billion euros, an EBITDA of over 200 million euros, and a Net Financial Debt/EBITDA ratio below 2 times (currently 2.5).\n\nThe plan sets new targets to address the challenges of energy transition and business transformation, paving the way for a new Tubacex. To understand the challenges of NT2, it is essential to recall the foundations and key aspects of its predecessor.\n\n#### 2.2.1 Strategic Plan (2022-2025): Key supplier for energy and mobility sectors\n\nHaving regained financial stability and strategic momentum (efficiency, expansion, and diversification) after the impact of COVID-19, Tubacex closes a cycle focused on the design and manufacture of comprehensive tubular solutions and opens a new one with a Strategic Plan (2022-2025) aimed at becoming a provider of sophisticated industrial products and high\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nvalue added services, primarily for the energy and mobility sectors. This plan is supported by three essential pillars: sustainability, profitability, and competitiveness.\n\nThe company targets the energy transition at a time when its order backlog stands at 1.6 billion euros, the highest in the last four years. The Strategic Plan projects sales of 1 billion euros by the end of the period, leveraging the expansion cycle of traditional businesses and the growth of low-emission energy and mobility sectors.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to prepare the business for 2030 to be divided into three pillars:\n\n**Support for Decarbonization:** Helping clients on their path to energy transition by developing powerful solutions that promote carbon emission reductions and improve process efficiency. This includes segments like CRA OCTG (Oil Country Tubular Goods), which encompasses tubular products used in the oil and gas industry (exploration and extraction activities), and SURF (subsea), which includes subsea applications, umbilicals, risers, and flowlines for offshore energy generation.\n\n**Low Emission Energy:** Laying the foundations for what is set to become the crown jewel of the new Tubacex, the Low Carbon division, which is propelled by NT2 and focuses on innovating with technologies necessary for the energy transition.\n\n**Growth Opportunities:** Developing and/or seeking new businesses in energy and mobility through organic and inorganic growth.\n\n#### 2.2.2 NT2 Strategic Plan (2024-2027): Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition\n\nPresented on November 21, 2023, at the Capital Markets Day held in Madrid, NT2 builds upon the foundations of the previous Strategic Plan but leverages corporate transformation and the energy transition to respond to emerging trends and the need for a balanced coexistence between conventional and renewable energies.\n\nIn addition to being a leader in sustainability, Tubacex's new roadmap aims to reduce the cyclicality of its activities and decrease its exposure to oil and gas.\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/10 description: A woman in a white lab coat is sitting at a desk in a laboratory. She is looking at a computer screen that is displaying an image of a sample. There is a microscope to her left and a computer tower to her right. A keyboard and mouse are in front of her.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Growth Drivers: five strategic pillars\n\nInherited from the previous strategic cycle, Tubacex has redesigned a roadmap based on five pillars to guide and support its transformation while ensuring revenue stability, improving competitiveness, and increasing diversification. This is evidenced by the historic annual results recorded in 2023 (chapter 5) and the solid order backlog mentioned earlier.\n\n**1. Sustainability:** With the aim of contributing to human progress by promoting responsible business activity, the sustainability plan is supported by four key areas:\n\n- Advancing towards energy neutrality and enhancing business circularity.\n- Contributing to the development of innovative solutions in energy transition.\n- Caring for people and local ecosystems where the company operates.\n- Promoting transparency.\n\n**2. Debt reduction:** Throughout 2023, net debt was reduced to 2.2x Net Financial Debt/EBITDA, compared to 3.1x at the end of 2022. This decrease results from the positive sector cycle, allowing the company to focus on cash generation through six actions:\n\n- Optimization of working capital requirements.\n- Optimal inventory levels per plant.\n- Divestment from non-strategic businesses.\n- Discipline and rigor in capital investment (CAPEX).\n- Cash pooling strategy.\n- Maintaining a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2-3 times.\n\n**3. Business stability:** To mitigate fluctuations and, therefore, cyclicality, Tubacex diversifies its product mix with premium solutions and its business geographically, covering raw materials and energy, and especially through long-term contracts with top-tier clients (over 30 signed already), providing high revenue visibility. Examples include two CRA OCTG contracts with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi and Petrobras in Brazil and one in the umbilical tubes sector with Aker Solutions in Norway. In the subsea business, there are several framework agreements with strategic clients in the aerospace, petrochemical, and H&I (Hydraulic and Instrumentation) sectors.\n\n**4. Competitiveness and Efficiency:** The common denominator for reducing debt and maintaining business stability is the effort to be competitive. As indicated at the beginning of this chapter, the pandemic's impact\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/16 description: The image shows a close-up of a complex mechanical device, possibly a jet engine or turbine. The device is made of various metal components, including pipes, gears, and blades. The blades are arranged in a circular pattern and appear to be glowing with heat. The overall impression is one of power and complexity.\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/0 description: A man wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and ear protection is holding a large metal pipe. He is wearing a black jacket with yellow stripes on the sleeves and torso. The man is smiling and looking to the right. In the background, there is a yellow machine and a metal fence.\n\nforced Tubacex to undergo a restructuring to prepare for the 2022-2025 Strategic Plan and adapt to the new market situation: strict control of operating costs and raw materials and scrap management, and operational excellence supported by digitalization. Actions in this area include the Lean Manufacturing model through:\n\n- Operational efficiency supported by digital capabilities.\n- Continuous improvement through the TxPS system.\n- Workforce flexibility.\n- Cost reduction.\n\n**5. Diversification:** Aligned with decarbonization requirements, the company accelerates its diversification plan to achieve a more balanced business mix, focusing on gas as a transition energy towards green energy and an alternative to coal, and its Low Carbon business unit as a fundamental lever in this balance. This is done without neglecting the traditional aerospace and nuclear sectors.\n\n#### Key Points of the New Strategic Plan\n\n**Low Carbon:** This business unit emerges as a central pillar, developing support solutions to advance sustainability and energy transition through carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen technologies. CCUS has become an ally in the path to sustainability as one of the few technologies capable of reducing CO2 emissions from industries such as steel and cement. This aligns with the goal of achieving zero emissions, where Tubacex has a portfolio of projects delivering advanced industrial solutions, currently focusing on the CO2 injection process. By 2027, revenues of 100 million euros are expected.\n\n**Financial objectives:** Tubacex projects an EBITDA of over 200 million euros for 2027, with estimated sales between 1.2 billion euros and 1.4 billion euros. The company also aims to maintain a Net Financial Debt (NFD) / EBITDA ratio below 2 times, reflecting a continuous trend towards financial deleveraging and strengthening cash flow.\n\n**Reducing dependence on Oil & Gas:** The plan aims to reduce exposure to these energy sources to less than one-third of total activity, mainly in the case of oil.\n\n**Shareholder remuneration policy:** Maintaining an attractive remuneration policy with a payout ratio of 30% to 40%.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/34/Picture/0 description: A close-up shot depicts a construction worker wearing a white hard hat and a yellow safety vest.

A chain hangs in the background, adding depth to the scene.\n\nTHE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN (NT2) PROJECTS ESTIMATED SALES OF BETWEEN 1.2 AND 1.4 BILLION EUROS BY 2027\n\nImage /page/34/Picture/2 description: The image shows a close-up of a jet engine. The engine is black and silver, and the blades are curved. The engine is in focus, and the background is blurred.\n\n**Future Vision:** Position Tubacex as a global leader in advanced solutions for energy and mobility, with all businesses contributing significantly to the Group's growth.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe NT2 plan is deployed in three simultaneous cycles:\n\n**1. Strengthening traditional products and services:** Focusing on decarbonization and efficiency in high-profitability segments. This involves supporting clients in their decarbonization processes with products and services from traditional and new markets that minimize environmental impact and improve efficiency. Concurrently, Tubacex continues to consolidate its leadership position in high-profitability segments.\n\n**2. Focus on low-emission energies:** Developing clean solutions. Under the Low Carbon business unit, innovative technological solutions are developed for the generation, storage, and transportation of energy in emerging hydrogen and CCUS markets.\n\n**3. Diversification and growth:** Exploring expansion opportunities in energy and mobility. To sustain growth through diversification, the company does not rule out growth through M&A operations alongside organic growth. Expansion opportunities in the energy and mobility sectors will be analyzed, with a special emphasis on fostering new businesses. The portfolio of businesses aligned with diversification encompasses three main blocks:\n\n- *Core Business:* Includes traditional businesses like Oil & Gas E&P or energy generation, along with diversification businesses such as aerospace.\n- *Low Carbon Business:* Tubacex already has a presence in this key growth area after developing specific materials and alloys, translating into advanced industrial products for energy generation and storage, as well as projects related to CCUS, storage and utilization, hydrogen, circular economy, and renewable energies.\n- *New Businesses:* Focused on analyzing growth opportunities in the energy and mobility sectors through the development of new businesses in-house or through inorganic operations.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows the number 2.3 in a simple, minimalist style. The numbers are drawn with thin, black lines against a light gray background. The decimal point is a small, solid black circle.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n**To implement the Strategic Plan, a roadmap is necessary to prevent, monitor, and address potential risks of any kind. This roadmap is embodied in the General Risk Control and Management Policy.** \n\nDuring the 2023, the Tubacex Board of Directors updated this document to include the basic principles and general action framework, materialized through a comprehensive risk control and management system. This system is based on an adequate definition and allocation of functions and responsibilities at the operational and supervisory levels and on procedures, methodologies, support tools, and information systems adapted to the various stages and activities of the system.\n\nThe General Risk Control and Management Policy is structured into three levels of protection and defense to address and manage significant risks:\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/5 description: A man wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and ear protection is inspecting metal cylinders. The cylinders are stacked on top of each other and have numbers written on them. The man is holding a piece of paper and appears to be comparing the numbers on the paper to the numbers on the cylinders. The man is wearing a black vest with yellow and green stripes. The background is blurry and appears to be a warehouse or factory.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/0 description: Two people wearing hard hats and safety glasses are standing next to each other. The person on the left is holding a tablet and wearing a white shirt. The person on the right is wearing an orange jumpsuit with a Brazilian flag patch on the shoulder.\n\nFOR THE FIRST TIME, THE AENOR CERTIFICATE WAS OBTAINED, CERTIFYING THE AVAILABILITY OF A RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNE-ISO 31000:2018 STANDARD\n\n- **Audit and Compliance Committee:** Periodically reviews internal control and risk management systems, including tax-related risks, to adequately identify, analyze, and report the main risks. In terms of ESG, this function is performed in coordination with the Sustainability and Good Governance Committee, as established in the company's Board of Directors Regulations.\n- **Internal Audit Directorate:** Informs, advises, and reports to the Committee on risks and the functional activity areas regarding the identification, measurement, and existing control over these risks.\n- **Management Committee:** Responsible for carrying out integrated risk management and control within business processes and decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, the policy identifies risk factors, indicating that these may vary depending on business conditions and evolution, mentioning the following:\n\na) Business risks.\n\nb) Market risks.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n- c) Operational, technological, environmental, social, and legal risks.\n- d) Corporate governance, ethics, and compliance risks.\n\ne) Credit risks.\n\n- f) Strategy and innovation risks.\n- g) Regulatory and political risks.\n- h) Reputational risk.\n\nAnnually, within the framework of the strategic reflection process, the Group updates the corporate risk map to identify and measure the risks it is exposed to, providing an analytical view of the underlying causal relationships and offering a broad perspective on the organization's overall exposure.\n\nRisk identification is carried out through questionnaires and personal interviews with the heads of various business units and relevant corporate areas (primarily members of the Management Committee). Once identified, risks are evaluated based on their probability of occurrence and impact on strategic objectives.\n\nThe projects defined by management within the framework of their strategic plan mitigate identified risks and allow for their monitoring.\n\nRisk and control functions include:\n\n- •Coordinating the process of risk identification, evaluation, and quantification for the subsequent preparation/update of the risk map.\n- Ensuring proper control and monitoring of risk management to keep it within acceptable levels.\n- Ensuring appropriate reporting to the Management Committee, Audit and Compliance Committee, and Board of Directors.\n\nImage /page/37/Picture/14 description: The image shows a green hydrogen production facility with wind turbines in the background.

The sky is blue and the ground is covered in green grass.\n\n#### 2 STRATEGY\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nAn important milestone in 2023 was the issuance of the AENOR certificate, which confirms that Tubacex has a Risk Management System in accordance with UNE-ISO 31000:2018, thus meeting an internal milestone and reinforcing the organization's commitment to risk management.\n\nThe audit required for certification was conducted in line with corporate processes, reviewing activities associated with risk management such as:\n\n- Activities related to determining context and stakeholders.\n- Processes related to communication and consultation.\n- Activities linked to risk identification.\n- Processes related to risk evaluation.\n- Activities related to risk treatment plans.\n- Activities associated with risk monitoring and measurement.\n- Activities linked to registration and reporting.\n- Risk management in activities within the scope of certification.\n\nAlong with the corporate risk map, progress was made in the previous fiscal year on developing a specific ESG risk map, which was further strengthened in 2023. The double materiality analysis, conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), served as a source for identifying risks and opportunities. This analysis helps identify sustainability-related impacts (positive and negative) and measure their economic impact in case of realization (chapter 3).\n\nImage /page/38/Picture/11 description: A green and gray striped cylinder is mounted on a white base on a concrete structure.

The graph shows the reduction of CO2 emissions over time with different methods. The methods listed are efficiency, oxy-combustion, CO2 capture, H2 blending, and electrification. The graph shows that by 2025, there will be an approximate 30% reduction in CO2 emissions. By 2030, there will be an approximate 60% reduction in CO2 emissions. The graph also shows that with I+D, there will be an approximate 100% reduction in CO2 emissions.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/15 description: This is a high-angle shot of a road cutting through a dense forest. The road is dark and narrow, winding its way through the trees. The trees are mostly green, with some variation in color and texture. The forest is dense and lush, with the trees growing close together. The overall impression is one of nature and tranquility.\n\nThe vector of Tubacex's Strategic Plan (chapter 2) is to become a leader in sustainability. By 2030, the company aims to base its business on three pillars: supporting decarbonization, driving new technologies necessary for the transition (such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)) through its Low Carbon unit, and identifying new growth opportunities in energy and mobility.\n\nTubacex's commitment to sustainability and environmental management is recognized and validated by leading certification authorities. Additionally, its sustainability and environmental policies for emission reduction are backed by Science Based Targets (SBT), an initiative in collaboration with the CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, and S&P sustainability standards.\n\nEach year, the company undertakes actions to advance towards these goals. In 2023, Tubacex implemented numerous policies and manuals focused on ESG to reduce its environmental impact, promote social actions, and improve governance.

The background of the image is a blurred, out-of-focus image of what appears to be a series of pipes or tubes. The pipes are arranged in parallel rows, and there are some blue clamps or fasteners visible on some of the pipes.\n\n**The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the methodology developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) establish common standards for presenting non-financial information. According to these standards, a material aspect is one that can impact people or the environment and/or have financial effects on the business.**\n\nTo identify potentially material issues, Tubacex uses a benchmarking analysis with other companies, the most relevant aspects of the 2030 agenda. As a new element in 2023, the company stablishes the SASB standards from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which identify financially important ESG information to evaluate how an organization creates business value.\n\nFrom the resulting catalog of issues, Tubacex prioritizes them through the following activities:\n\n**1. Impact Materiality Analysis:** Each impact (positive or negative, potential or real) is analyzed and assessed considering its severity and reversibility (only for negative impacts) and probability (for potential impacts). A sustainability issue includes those caused or contributed to by the company, directly related to its operations, products, and services, and through its business relationships.\n\n**2. Financial Materiality Analysis:** For financial materiality analysis, the probability of occurrence and the magnitude of potential financial effects are assessed, suitable to the size and volume of the company.\n\nAfter evaluating each parameter, the results are analyzed separately, and the materiality of each element is assessed.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/0 description: The image shows a scatter plot titled \"Short term\".

The number 3 is on the left, followed by a decimal point, and then the number 4.\n\nAMBITION\n\n2030\n\n**For the past two decades, Tubacex has actively participated in the United Nations Global Compact, the most significant voluntary initiative for promoting human rights, labor standards, environmental** \n\n**protection, and anti-corruption measures.**\n\nBy signing the Global Compact, Tubacex commits to advancing the fundamental pillars necessary to address the major challenges of sustainable development. This involves promoting the 10 universal principles and annually reporting progress on these commitments. Additionally, Tubacex demonstrates its dedication to addressing the significant challenges of sustainable development through the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), from which all other proposals, policies, and strategies of international sustainability frameworks are derived.\n\nCONTRIBUTING TO HUMAN PROGRESS BY DRIVING RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/4 description: A man wearing a white hard hat, safety glasses, and gloves is inspecting a metal structure.

Section 1, titled \"Advancing towards neutrality and enhancing business circularity,\" includes statistics such as \"<60% Intensity of emissions,\" \"40% Green energy,\" and \"95% Of waste circularity.\" Section 3, labeled \"Caring for our people and local environment,\" shows \"<75% Accidents,\" \"< 2% Pay Gap,\" and \"1% Profit invested In social action.\" Section 2, \"Contributing to the development of innovative solutions for energy transition,\" presents figures like \"€50M Billed to new energy source,\" \"80% R&D energy transition projects,\" and \"1%-2% Of sales invested in R&D,\" along with the terms \"Corporate policies\" and \"Remuneratio link to esg.\" Section 4, \"Doing what is right and promoting transparency,\" mentions \"Sustainable financing\" and \"Risk management.\"\n\nImage /page/50/Figure/1 description: The image shows a circular chart divided into four quadrants. The top-left quadrant is dark blue, the bottom-left is light pink, the bottom-right is light gray, and the top-right is white. In the center of the circle is the number 1.\n\n#### 3.4.1 Advancing towards neutrality and enhancing business circularity\n\n#### Decarbonization\n\nIn 2023, Tubacex continues its decarbonization plans to enhance its climate performance. Aceralava is the primary recipient of these investment plans due to its nature and high energy consumption. This decarbonization plan is part of the Ambition 2030 climate roadmap, aiming to reduce GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 60% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n#### Circularity\n\nThe company continues to make progress in recovering all the scrap generated in the steel mill, extending the recovery project to other Group production plants. In this regard, it advances with the revaluation process of slag, the main waste from the steel mill, at a recovery plant in Europe specializing in treating products from the stainless steel industry. This initiative prevents the disposal of around 15,000 tons per year in landfills, recovering minerals that re-enter the manufacturing process and are used in road asphalt products. These projects are in addition to existing ones for using recycled material or other improvements in waste management and water consumption diagnostics.\n\n#### Responsible supply chain\n\nRegarding the evaluation of the supply chain, the company has already assessed 829 suppliers on ESG criteria through its pilot supplier risk management tool. This highlights the review of its management processes to drive its supply chain within the framework of its sustainability commitments.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Climate Risks\n\nTubacex has integrated physical and transition risks into its global risk model. The evaluation is conducted according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This involves assessing both physical risks (acute and chronic) resulting from the effects of climate change on operations, and transition risks arising from the impacts of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe risks are analyzed across three different time horizons: short-term (2025), medium-term (2030), and long-term (2050). For each type of risk, potential sources are identified, and their probability of occurrence is evaluated under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, along with the possible impact on the business and the timeframe for their realization.\n\n| Sustainability<br>issue                  | Items / Material Aspect                           | Strategic Lines                                                                                                                           | SDG                      |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Energy transition and<br>climate change  | Energy transition                                 | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7 and 13      |\n| Energy transition and<br>climate change  | Sustainable energy management                     | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7 and 13      |\n| Energy transition and<br>climate change  | Climate change mitigation<br>and adaptation to it | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7 and 13      |\n| Regulatory<br>compliance                 | Compliance with<br>environmental regulation       | Adhering to the highest ethical<br>and compliance standards                                                                               | Image: SDG 16 and 8      |\n| Responsible<br>Supply Chain              | Sustainable management<br>of suppliers            | Sustainable supply chain                                                                                                                  | Image: SDG 12            |\n| Water consumption<br>and water resources | Sustainable water management                      | Fostering business circularity                                                                                                            | Image: SDG 12, 6, and 13 |\n| Circular Economy<br>and waste management | Waste management                                  | Fostering business circularity                                                                                                            | Image: SDG 12            |\n| Circular Economy<br>and waste management | Circular economy                                  | Fostering business circularity                                                                                                            | Image: SDG 12 and 13     |\n| Environmental<br>management              | Environmental management                          | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7, 12, and 13 |\n| Biodiversity                             | Impact on biodiversity                            | Sustainable supply chain.<br>Working with our customers on the<br>development of innovative<br>solutions that facilitate their transition | Image: SDG 15            |\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/5 description: The image shows a stack of metal pipes with red caps on the ends.

The goal is to strengthen the culture of reporting as a mechanism to prevent and detect threats to the public interest and provide adequate protection against reprisals for those who report potential violations.\n\nThis mandatory and confidential reporting, investigation, and inquiry channel connects with the organization's criminal compliance model.

There are also some wooden supports for the shelves.\n\ncompany. Tubacex exclusively handles the analysis of the communications' content, with specialized external advisors as needed.\n\n#### Human Rights\n\nTubacex is fully committed to respecting human rights, always guided by the fundamental principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as expressed in its code of conduct. These principles form the basis of the applicable legislation across all business units.\n\nTo affirm this commitment, the company's Board of Directors approved its Human Rights Policy in 2023. This policy represents the organization's dedication to developing a culture that implements internationally recognized human rights support policies and seeks to avoid complicity in human rights violations.\n\nIn parallel, Tubacex has identified the key human rights issues affecting the company, particularly those related to economic rights, and has analyzed them individually to identify opportunities and impacts. These aspects have also been incorporated into the materiality analysis. The key human rights issues identified include:\n\n- Job creation.\n- Respect for labor rights.\n- Establishing responsible and transparent labor relations.\n- Occupational health and safety.\n- Attraction and retention of talent.\n- Employee training.\n- Equality and diversity.\n- Child labor.\n- Indigenous peoples' rights.\n- Development of local communities.\n\n#### Tubacex Foundation\n\nIn February 2016, the Tubacex Foundation was established as an entity closely aligned with the company's business strategy and the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The Foundation serves as a fundamental channel for promoting projects in three major areas of action: quality education, corporate diversity, and social action.\n\nThrough the Foundation, support programs for society are defined, and common lines of work are established for the rest of the Group's business units, aligned with the identified material aspects:\n\n- **Quality Education:** Focused on attracting and retaining talent while promoting youth employment and employability. Through quality education, action plans are implemented to invest in future generations and professionals.\n- **Corporate Diversity:** In addition to promoting gender equality through various plans and policies, the Group, through the Foundation, promotes the socio-labor integration of people with diverse talents. This includes collaboration with entities specialized in hiring people with disabilities.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for TUBACEX foundation. The word \"TUBACEX\" is written in large, bold, black letters. Below it, the word \"foundation\" is written in smaller, black letters. To the right of the text is a red, circular shape that resembles a flower.\n\n**• Development of Local Communities:** The company supports the development of communities where it operates through direct and indirect employment and by promoting collaboration projects with NGOs.\n\nIn 2023, the focus on education and corporate diversity was reactivated after being affected in the previous two years by the situation in plants that housed the largest number of students. Additionally, the Foundation continues to support social action programs in developing countries, as well as the aid program for Ukrainian refugee families that began in 2022 due to the Russian invasion.\n\n#### Actions Developed During 2023\n\n#### Social Action\n\nThrough the NGO Colabora Birmania, the Tubacex Group continues to support educational centers to promote the development of displaced Burmese children. This program focuses on promoting comprehensive education, covering the entire development cycle of the child: from orphanages and nurseries to schools and access to the labor market in adulthood.\n\nA specific action in 2023 is the proposed construction of a new building on the grounds of a school (KM 42) to accommodate secondary education students.\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/8 description: A high-angle shot captures a large group of children, all smiling and holding up peace signs. The children are closely packed together, creating a sense of unity and joy. Their faces are partially covered with a white substance, possibly makeup or face paint, adding a unique element to their appearance. The background is blurred, drawing focus to the children and their expressions.\n\n#### 3 SUSTAINABILITY\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### DOING WHAT IS RIGHT AND PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/1 description: A group of children are standing in front of a sign that says \"KM42\". The children are all smiling and have their hands raised in the air. The sign is yellow with a black border and red text. The children are wearing a variety of clothing, including t-shirts, shorts, and jeans. The background is a light gray wall.\n\n#### KM 42 School:\n\n- 225 children.\n- 12 teachers.\n- Proposed construction of a building for secondary education, currently halted due to the death of the landowner and ongoing negotiations with heirs.\n- Currently, 25 children are studying secondary education at this center.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/7 description: Four young girls are standing together and laughing. They are all wearing casual clothes, and they appear to be happy and carefree.

The students are wearing white shirts and are focused on their work. There is a mural on the wall behind the students that says \"KEN SCHOOL\".\n\n4\n\n#### Chicken School:\n\n- 123 children.\n- 5 teachers.\n- Primary education following the same curriculum as KM 42 School.\n- 26 students participate in the nonformal primary education program.\n- Educational system regulated by Myanmar (families intend to return to their home country).\n\n#### Training\n\nIn the area of training, international scholarships promoted in collaboration with the Basque Government are noteworthy. In the 2022/2023 edition, five engineers applied for vacancies in Austria, Thailand, and the USA, of which two remained on staff after their internship period. The 2023/2024 edition offers vacancies in Thailand, Italy, the USA, and Austria.\n\nAnother training initiative includes dual programs that combine learning at educational centers and workplaces. In Austria, these programs are developed at a dedicated center (FutureZone), training 18 apprentices in 2023. In Spain, eight students participate in this training modality.\n\nAs an extension and novelty in this area, a program to attract international talent was activated in 2023. Although it did not result in the recruitment of talent, it helped refine the proposal for candidates for 2023/2024.\n\n#### Emergency Aid: SOS Ukraine\n\nIn response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Tubacex launched an aid program in 2022, primarily targeting workers and families of a partner company located in a war-torn region with close commercial ties to Tubacex.\n\nA total of five families were relocated from the Hungarian border to the Basque Country. Thanks to the support and collaboration of the SOS Ukraine organization, they were initially integrated into foster homes.\n\nIn 2023, after completing the transition period in foster homes, four families returned to regions near the Ukrainian border or other destinations, while one family remained in the Basque Country, soon joined by a second family. Both families are now housed in rental apartments funded by the Tubacex Foundation and integrated into Basque society.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/0 description: The image shows a large, white number 4 against a dark background with subtle, swirling patterns.

The number 4 is on the left, followed by a period, and then the number 1 on the right.\n\n## BUSINESS EVOLUTION\n\n**Despite the complex and challenging environment described in chapter 2, Tubacex achieved the best results in its history in 2023 (chapter 5), with revenues of 852.4 million euros (+19.3%), EBITDA of 125.2 million euros (+35.6%), and an EBITDA margin of 14.7%. Additionally, the company maintained a historic order backlog of 1.6 billion euros.** \n\nThese record results represent the consolidation of pre-pandemic activity levels and demonstrate the success of the Group's strategic diversification in products, services, and geographic areas, as well as its strategic focus on providing premium solutions to clients, anticipating their needs, and becoming a key player in the energy transition.\n\nThe business evolution is influenced by the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate hikes to curb inflation, which caused a slowdown in sales of lower value added products.\n\nSignificant progress was made in gas upstream activity in Asia and the Middle East, with sustainable orders and strong positioning with strategic clients through long-term agreements.\n\n#### Products and services\n\nThree key drivers significantly impacted the 2023 income statement: the shift towards renewable energies in response to decarbonization, increased air traffic, and the positive evolution of the oil and gas\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows a cargo ship transporting containers filled with hydrogen.

The ship has a sign that says \"NO SMOKING\".\n\nexploration and production (upstream) market. All of these drivers increased their share in the Group's mix.\n\nRegarding the trend towards sustainability, increased activity in two energy sources that provide stability and visibility for the medium and long-term business is notable. These transition energies include gas, which accounts for a significant portion of high value added products, and nuclear energy, which has experienced significant growth.\n\nIn parallel, there is potential growth with the development of new sustainable solutions through hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)\n\nwith injection wells, where orders have already been received. Tubacex's roadmap for positioning as a leader in the energy transition is outlined in the new NT2 2024-2027 strategic plan (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition) (chapter 2), with a focus on the Low Carbon division, the motor of this new phase, projecting sales of 100 million euros by 2027.\n\nIn traditional sectors, the aerospace one stands out, with record orders for high-tech products, and the upstream activity leading the post-pandemic recovery, with the price of oil stabilizing around 80 dollars per barrel. Despite the uncertain economic and geopolitical context, energy companies present a good financial situation, with ambitious expansion plans and solid medium and long-term viability prospects for the projects presented. This translates into a significant increase in the CRA OCTG portfolio, particularly umbilicals, supported by long-term supply contracts with key clients.\n\nThe year saw two distinct periods, with the second half experiencing an acceleration in the project market, compensating for a slight cooling in tubular solutions for distributors (through the business led by TSS), more focused on maintenance. This improvement, coupled with Tubacex's strategic positioning to support and add value to the client with long-term supply contracts, is key to achieving the historic order volume that will be reflected in sales in the coming quarters, ensuring stability in results\n\n#### Sector dynamics\n\n#### Industrial (35%)\n\nThroughout 2023, Tubacex increased its positioning in premium products in China and India, countries with strong refining capacity growth forecasts, while the LNG and Gas Processing sectors maintained high levels of activity and visibility, particularly in North America and the Middle East.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/0 description: The image shows a pie chart titled \"SECTOR BREAKDOWN\". The pie chart is divided into five sectors: Industrial (35%), E&P Gas (24%), Powergen (7%), New markets (15%), and E&P Oil (19%). The pie chart is superimposed on a background image of a green, hilly landscape.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Mid&Downstream segment showed a reactivation in the awarding of large projects, especially in the Middle East and Asia, although orders for lower value added products slowed due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates.\n\n#### E&P Gas (24%) & E&P Oil (19%)\n\n*Upstream:* In America, operations continue in Brazil's deep waters, where Tubacex has already supplied equipment to 10 wells in the Búzios field. Continued operations by Petrobras are expected in the coming months with comprehensive solutions supplied from the Macaé hub. In the Middle East, the construction of the new CRA OCTG plant in Abu Dhabi continues as part of the 10 year project signed with ADNOC, marking the largest contract in the company's history. The drilling and special machining segments also performed well.\n\n*Subsea***:** This segment registered a record order intake, with key strategic projects on all five continents. The offshore segment has proven to be one of the most resilient and geopolitically stable markets for state energy security. It has a backlog with delivery times exceeding 12 months in some cases, indicating positive medium-term prospects. Additionally, significant discoveries are being made in new locations: Namibia, Suriname, Guyana, Brazil (Amazon Basin), and Tanzania. Tubacex has established strategic agreements with leading umbilical manufacturers. The creation of a joint venture between SLB and AKER (SLB Onesubsea) offers Tubacex an opportunity to strengthen its positioning in E&P Gas.\n\n#### New Markets (15%)\n\n*Low Carbon:* Tubacex positions this unit as the flagship of sustainability, projecting sales of 100 million euros by 2027. In 2023, significant orders for CCUS (carbon\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/0 description: The image shows a pie chart titled \"FINAL DESTINATION BREAKDOWN\".

In 2023, the nuclear segment performed well, particularly in Europe, where a long-term agreement was signed with the French energy company EDF for the maintenance of its existing plants and the construction of future ones. There are also promising prospects for the SMR (Small Modular Reactors) market, especially in Canada, the U.S., and Europe, and for Ultra Super Critical (USC) power plants in China and India. Tubacex is collaborating with several engineering firms for the development of design and materials.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows the number 4.2 in a simple, minimalist style. The numbers are drawn with thin, black lines against a light gray background. The decimal point is a small, solid black circle.\n\nMARKET\n\nSITUATION\n\n**Tubacex's local manufacturing strategy brings the company closer to key markets with operational presence in Guyana, Brazil, and Kazakhstan, where the company has directly engaged with end users in implementing its solutions, resulting in order intake growth.** \n\nThese new production facilities add to the Group's existing 24 plants and 14 service centers worldwide. This presence is complemented by a network of commercial offices in five major geographical areas (Europe, America, Asia, the Caspian region, and the Middle East) and agents covering the global market.\n\n#### Geographical Market Situation\n\nThe strength of the American market continues to gain ground in the geographical mix and in 2023, it already doubles the pre-pandemic share, while the Asian market (including the Middle East) more than recovers the dynamism lost in 2022. In Europe, the robust Norwegian market continues. This diversified global presence ensures regional balance, increasing\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/6 description: Two scientists are working in a lab.

The image is well-lit, and the colors are accurate.\n\nTubacex's resilience and protection against potential geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe 2023 fiscal year was characterized by the good performance of the American market and the deepening of the strategy to strengthen key markets with local implementation. Notable is the ongoing project to develop production capacity in Abu Dhabi.\n\n#### **Asia & ME (43%)**\n\nTubacex's largest contract ever, with a minimum committed value of 1 billion dollars, for gas production in Abu Dhabi, began execution and in 2023, the construction of a CRA OCTG tube finishing and threading plant started. Operations are expected to begin at the end of 2024. This order marks a turning point in the company's growth and global positioning, becoming the world's leading supplier in the CRA OCTG segment.\n\nMedium and long-term growth expectations in this region are solid. East Asia experienced an improvement over 2022, thanks to increased sales in India, where there are good prospects in premium products and the nuclear sector, and the recovery of China, particularly in the petrochemical sector.\n\n#### **America (33%)**\n\nIn 2023, the American market performed well again, with record sales levels. Four key drivers stand out: At the sector level, the aerospace business records a historic volume of orders, and the energy sector boosts its momentum thanks to the global leadership of the U.S. and Canada in the demand for Tubacex's deep CO2 storage solutions through injection wells and the high volume of material and service sales for offshore extraction activities by Brazilian Petrobras. Lastly, there is strong growth in the sales of instrumentation tubes.\n\nFrom a production perspective, the capacity of the Salem Tube, Tubacex Durant, and NTS Amega West plants is consolidated.\n\n#### **Europe (21%)**\n\nStrong sales growth continues in Norway, with high demand for complex machined products and distribution projects through TSS Norway. Other notable aspects in Europe include long-term contracts with umbilical manufacturers, opportunities in the nuclear segment in France, and good prospects for gas processing plants in the Caspian Sea.\n\n#### **África (3%)**\n\nNew offshore projects in Tanzania, Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa.\n\n#### Subsidiaries\n\nAmong the various subsidiaries, in 2023, Tubacex Service Solutions (TSS), a distributor of seamless stainless steel tube, stood out with a high turnover volume, more intense in the first half. Any slight decline in order volumes was offset by an increase in the project market order book.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/0 description: The image shows the number 5 in white, with the word \"RESULTS\" in pink below it.

In addition to these achievements, the company also maintained a historic order backlog volume of 1.6 billion euros.\n\nThe 2023 results were recorded in an environment of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, with high-interest rates, demonstrating the success of the restructuring undertaken following the pandemic and the effective diversification of activities and business as outlined in the 2022-2025 Strategic Plan (chapter 02). The Group achieved the plan's objectives two years ahead of schedule, prompting an update in November 2023 for the 2024-2027 period under the name NT2 (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition), focusing on two pillars: energy transition and mobility.\n\n#### Profit and loss account\n\nSales grew by 19.3% compared to 2022, which had already set a revenue record, and more than doubled the figures from 2021, reaching 852.4 million euros in 2023.\n\nRegarding the breakdown of revenue by sectors, 35% of the Group's product revenues originated from the Industrial sector, 24% from gas E&P, 19% from oil E&P, 15% from new markets, and 7% from Powergen.\n\nAs for the final destinations of sales, there is significant geographical diversification in revenue sources: 43% of sales were generated in Asia and the Middle East (where the Group has substantial exposure to the gas segment, both for extraction and processing), 33% in America (with a growing importance of the instrumentation and control tube segment and record orders in the aerospace and aeronautical sector), 21%\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### PROFIT FOR THE YEAR\n\n| (€M)                    | FY 2022 | FY 2023 | % variation |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|-------------|\n|                         |         |         |             |\n| Sales                   | 714.7   | 852.4   | 19.3%       |\n| EBITDA                  | 92.3    | 125.2   | 35.6%       |\n| EBITDA margin           | 12.9%   | 14.7%   |             |\n| EBIT                    | 44.5    | 80.7    | 81.6%       |\n| EBIT margin             | 6.2%    | 9.5%    |             |\n| Profit before tax       | 26.9    | 49.6    | 84.5%       |\n| Margin                  | 3.8%    | 5.8%    |             |\n| Attributable Net Profit | 20.2    | 36.3    | 79.5%       |\n| Net margin              | 2.8%    | 4.3%    |             |\n\n| (€M)                             | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023 | €M variation |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Circulating Capital              | 230.0      | 234.5      | +4.5         |\n| Working Capital / Sales          | 32.2%      | 27.5%      |              |\n| Net Financial Debt               | 287.1      | 280.7      | -6.4         |\n| Net Financial Debt / EBITDA      | 3.1x       | 2.2x       |              |\n| Structural Net Financial Debt(1) | 57.1       | 46.2       | -10.9        |\n\n(1) Total Net Financial Debt - Working Capital\n\nin Europe (with strong demand for complex machined products in the North Sea and long-term agreements with umbilical manufacturers), and the remaining 3% in Africa (with new offshore projects in Tanzania, Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa).\n\nThe favorable market conditions and strategic positioning with key clients have enabled Tubacex to consolidate EBITDA growth to historic levels. This indicator rose to 125.2 million euros, a 35.6% increase over the previous year. The EBITDA margin stands at 14.7%, also the highest level recorded by the company. The positive evolution of these two metrics in recent years is attributable to an improved product mix, a commitment to innovation, a strategic repositioning of client types, increased productivity, and cost reduction.\n\nAs a result, the net attributable profit increased by 79.5%, reaching 36.3 million euros.\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/7 description: The image shows a close-up of several metal pipes.

Consequently, the debt ratio (Net Financial Debt/ EBITDA) is 2.2 times at the end of the fiscal year, once again meeting the strategic objective, with a forecast for further reduction in upcoming periods as outlined in the Strategic Plan update.\n\nThis has been achieved despite substantial investments aimed at acquiring minority stakes in Saudi Arabia and Norway, the commencement of the Abu Dhabi plant construction, and the dividend payment to shareholders based on 2022 results. These operations, along with CAPEX, have led to a cash outflow of over 55 million euros. Nevertheless, the Group's strong cash flow generation capability has balanced the situation, reducing net financial debt to 280.7 million euros as of December 31, 2023, down from 287.1 million euros at the end of the previous fiscal year (3.1 times NFD/EBITDA).\n\nThus, the company's liquidity position exceeds 300 million euros, with 179 million euros in cash.\n\nThanks to the visibility of order volumes, the company is expected to continue improving cash flow generation over the coming quarters.\n\nImage /page/74/Figure/7 description: This image is a bar chart showing the net operating income from 2019 to 2023.

GARCÍA SANZ** CEO **JESÚS ESMORÍS ESMORÍS**\n\n## NT2: THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND TUBACEX'S NEW STRATEGIC CYCLE IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nWe are at the beginning of a transformative period in our company's history, driven by our strategic plan NT2, \"A New Tubacex in the Energy Transition,\" which we presented at the Capital Markets Day on November 21, 2023, in Madrid. This new phase is transforming our organization into a provider of advanced industrial products and services for the energy and mobility sectors.\n\nAs we present the 2023 annual report, we are proud to highlight that this has been a year of historic achievements for Tubacex. We recorded a notable turnover of 852.4 million euros, reflecting a 19.3% increase from the previous year, and our EBITDA grew by 35.6%, reaching 125.2 million euros. This significant improvement is marked by an EBITDA margin of 14.7%, the best in Tubacex's history.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/0 description: The image shows a dark background with streaks of light in various colors, including blue, purple, and gold. The streaks of light are arranged in a circular pattern, creating a sense of movement and energy. The overall effect is abstract and visually striking.\n\nDuring this fiscal year, we exceeded our established forecasts, registering remarkable growth in key product and service segments and achieving a historic order book worth 1.6 billion euros. This robust performance results from our commitment to diversification, innovation, and our ability to anticipate market needs, particularly in the low-carbon segment.\n\nIn this context, the launch of NT2 is particularly noteworthy, renewing our commitment to growth, innovation, sustainability, and the security of energy supply. The updated strategic plan establishes the creation of Tubacex's low-carbon division, based on technologies such as CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) and hydrogen.\n\nOur goal is to lead the low-carbon segment, reduce our exposure to the oil & gas sector to one-third, and achieve a turnover between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros by 2027, with an EBITDA exceeding 200 million euros and a debt/ EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times.\n\nDiversification and international expansion, including over 30 long-term agreements and the new CRA OCTG plant in Abu Dhabi, are highlights of our strategy.\n\nIn this context, our share price increased by 75.2% in 2023, reaching 3.5 euros per share, proposing a gross dividend of 14.5 million euros, with a payout of 40%.\n\nThe Tubacex Foundation continues to be our vehicle for social traction, working on training, diversity (equity and equality), CO2 impact reduction, and community support.\n\nTubacex continues to deploy its roadmap aligned with the Paris Agreement, called Ambition 2030. This plan aims to mitigate the environmental impact of our industrial activity with the ultimate goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nFinally, we extend our most sincere gratitude to the entire Tubacex team for their effort and dedication, which have been fundamental in achieving these exceptional results.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/0 description: The image shows a large white number \"1\" on the left side of the image, with a background of green and black curved lines.

Strategic Plan Update\n\nThe first significant event is the early achievement of the 2022- 2025 Strategic Plan, two years ahead of schedule, prompting the company to update it for the 2024-2027 period (chapter 2). Under the name NT2 (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition), the new roadmap maintains the five pillars of the previous plan: leadership in sustainability, net debt reduction, operational stability and profitability, competitiveness, efficiency, and diversification. However, it sets more ambitious goals supported by the energy transition, aiming to achieve a turnover of between 1.2 billion euros and 1.4 billion euros, an EBITDA of over 200 million euros, and a Net Financial Debt/EBITDA ratio below 2 times (currently 2.5), according to the Group's estimates.\n\nThe presentation of this updated Strategic Plan took place at the Capital Markets Day held in Madrid on November 21, 2023. Following this event, the company's shares began a rally, increasing by more than 30% by the end of the year and by 70% compared to the end of 2022 (chapter 5).\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/0 description: A man wearing a white hard hat and black earmuffs is seen from the back, wearing a black jacket with yellow stripes and the words \"TUBACEX GROUP\" on the back. He is standing on a platform with a blue sky in the background.\n\n#### 2.Record Results\n\nThis milestone is only achievable following another significant accomplishments the record-breaking results (chapter 5). These include record sales of 852.4 million euros (+19.3%), an EBITDA of 125.2 million euros (+35.6%), and an EBITDA margin of 14.7%. Additionally, the order backlog was maintained at a historic level of 1.6 billion euros.\n\n#### 3. Low Carbon\n\nIn terms of sustainability, within the framework of its \"Ambition 2030\" program, Tubacex promotes a decarbonization plan that allows it to meet the emission reduction targets set by the European Union and offers sustainable solutions to help its clients achieve these goals, thus anticipating their needs. Tubacex is reducing emissions through improvements in manufacturing and recycling processes, while also helping its clients reduce their emissions by enhancing efficiency, lifespan, and lifecycle.\n\nA third significant milestone is the promotion of the Low Carbon division, poised to become the spearhead of the company as a global leader in the energy transition. This division develops solutions for new sustainable technologies, such as the growing CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) business by providing tubular solutions for CO2 capture, transport, and sequestration, and the emerging hydrogen market as a substitute for fossil fuels.\n\nAll these measures are supported by prominent ESG certification bodies, including Science Based Targets (SBT) commitments for emission reduction and S&P sustainability standards.\n\nThese milestones highlight how the company aims to anticipate global trends, positioning itself as a leader not only in sectoral changes but also in social advancements.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/0 description: A group of five people are standing in front of a dark brown wall with the number 8 on it.

These regulations incorporated all the responsibilities assigned to this delegated body by the Capital Companies Act, best practices for listed companies, and the recommendations of the Good Governance Code for listed companies approved in 2020.\n\nAmong its functions, notable responsibilities include the supervision of the process for preparing and presenting both financial and non-financial information, as well as the oversight of non-financial risks.\n\n#### Appointments and Remunerations Committee\n\nSimilarly, the company's highest decision-making body approved new regulations for the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, incorporating the content provided for this committee in the Capital Companies Act and the CNMV Technical Guide. By doing so, Tubacex adopts the best practices in this area, reinforcing the role of this committee in relation to the Board concerning the executive team, for whom it establishes policies on appointments, remuneration, and dismissals. Additionally, the committee plays a key role in managing conflicts of interest.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Commission on Sustainability and Good Governance\n\nTo strengthen the governance structure and in line with existing recommendations and best practices, the Board of Directors of Tubacex agreed in 2021 to establish a new Sustainability and Good Governance Committee. The functions of this committee are outlined in the \"Regulations of the Sustainability and Good Governance Committee\" and consist of:\n\n- 1. Promoting the company's ESG policies to ensure they are geared towards value creation through sustainable behaviors.\n- 2. Ensuring that the Group's Strategic Plan integrates and develops ESG policies.\n- 3. Understanding, supervising, and evaluating the relationship processes with various stakeholders.\n- 4. Ensuring that ESG-related risks are adequately integrated into the Group's risk management and control models.\n- 5. Determining the guidelines, criteria, and general principles that should govern the content of the Non-Financial Information Statement and any other equivalent reporting system.\n- 6. Collaborating with the Tubacex Foundation to identify elements of the Group's strategy that can be promoted\n\nthrough specific ESG projects, making the Foundation an instrument of sustainability policy.\n\n7. Encouraging the Group's compliance with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approved by the United Nations.\n\n#### Strategy and Monitoring Committee\n\nThe Regulations of the Strategy and Monitoring Committee were approved in 2022. This committee is chaired, as usual, by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn all committee meetings, the secretary of the Board of Directors acts as the secretary to ensure the required coordination as mandated by the Board's Regulations.\n\nAt the end of 2023, following the annual evaluation exercise of the Board, the work of each committee for 2024 has been planned, along with the calendar for the entire year. This annual evaluation has been conducted by the Board of Directors since 2002 to continuously improve the functioning of the Board, its delegated bodies, and its main statutory roles, namely the chairman, the CEO, and the secretary of the Board.\n\nAs a novelty, the most recent evaluation was conducted internally, following an external evaluation the previous year, thereby applying the best corporate governance practices for listed companies.\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/15 description: The image shows a stack of white pipes.

Although the scare of recession has faded, the global economic growth remains weak and is trending downward as we head into the new fiscal year.**\n\nThis year, the industrial sector has experienced a decline in energy and raw material prices, following the significant increase registered the previous year due to the war in Europe. Currently, the industry is focusing on the evolution of demand and metal prices, influenced by the tightening of financing conditions and the instability of international trade.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of industrial pipes and valves.

The person is standing in front of a red metal structure and a metal can. The background is dark and blurry.\n\nIn the backdrop, the mandated decarbonization of economies requires significant investments to undertake the energy transition and agility to adapt to the new 'green' regulatory framework.\n\nIn this context, Regulation 2023/956, dated May 10, 2023, establishes the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a mechanism that, when fully implemented, will require importers of goods into the European Union to purchase certificates equivalent to the carbon price they would have paid if the goods had been produced under EU carbon pricing rules. To comply with this regulation, Tubacex is developing an adaptation project to address the first phase (transition period) of this regulation and report quarterly the emissions generated in its imports.\n\nWithin the regulatory framework directly impacting Tubacex's business, there are positive news following the extension until March 2025 of the suspension of rebalancing tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum products by the European Union, in exchange for the U.S. reviewing Section 232 and replacing it with a quota system.\n\nAdditionally, Tubacex's European production centers benefit from the European Commission's decision to extend the import protection regime by one more year (until June 2024).\n\nThere are also positive regulatory developments from China, as the anti-dumping tariffs on tubes originating from the Chinese giant are under review, with a possible extension in 2024 for an additional five years.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows the text \"2.2 BUSINESS STRATEGY\" on the left side of the image. On the right side of the image, there is a picture of an oil rig in the ocean.\n\n**Despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, in 2023, Tubacex achieved a milestone that highlights the value of the roadmap designed after the pandemic to strengthen the Group and prepare it for sustainability with a key role in the energy transition, contributing to energy supply security. This milestone is the achievement of the objectives of its 2022-2025 Strategic Plan two years ahead of schedule, leading the company to update it for the 2024-2027 period.**\n\nThroughout the year, the strong performance of the industrial sector, combined with the competitiveness and high performance of the company's advanced industrial solutions, has not only ensured revenue stability but also resulted in excellent outcomes accompanied by a solid order backlog valued at 1.6 billion euros. The current plan estimated sales of between 1 billion euros and 1.2 billion euros for 2025, but the quarterly results of 2023 indicate the company's positive momentum and suggest an upward revision of the targets.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/0 description: The image shows three risk matrices representing climate change risks over time: Short Term (2025), Mid Term (2030), and Long Term (2050).

The man is focused on his work, and he appears to be skilled in operating the machine.\n\nUnder the name NT2 (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition), the new Strategic Plan retains the essence of the previous one, setting more ambitious goals based on energy transition and the transformation of the company with the Low Carbon business unit, along with a strong commitment to diversification as a spearhead.\n\nThus, by 2027, the company aims to achieve a turnover of between 1.2 billion euros and 1.4 billion euros, an EBITDA of over 200 million euros, and a Net Financial Debt/EBITDA ratio below 2 times (currently 2.5).\n\nThe plan sets new targets to address the challenges of energy transition and business transformation, paving the way for a new Tubacex. To understand the challenges of NT2, it is essential to recall the foundations and key aspects of its predecessor.\n\n#### 2.2.1 Strategic Plan (2022-2025): Key supplier for energy and mobility sectors\n\nHaving regained financial stability and strategic momentum (efficiency, expansion, and diversification) after the impact of COVID-19, Tubacex closes a cycle focused on the design and manufacture of comprehensive tubular solutions and opens a new one with a Strategic Plan (2022-2025) aimed at becoming a provider of sophisticated industrial products and high\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nvalue added services, primarily for the energy and mobility sectors. This plan is supported by three essential pillars: sustainability, profitability, and competitiveness.\n\nThe company targets the energy transition at a time when its order backlog stands at 1.6 billion euros, the highest in the last four years. The Strategic Plan projects sales of 1 billion euros by the end of the period, leveraging the expansion cycle of traditional businesses and the growth of low-emission energy and mobility sectors.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to prepare the business for 2030 to be divided into three pillars:\n\n**Support for Decarbonization:** Helping clients on their path to energy transition by developing powerful solutions that promote carbon emission reductions and improve process efficiency. This includes segments like CRA OCTG (Oil Country Tubular Goods), which encompasses tubular products used in the oil and gas industry (exploration and extraction activities), and SURF (subsea), which includes subsea applications, umbilicals, risers, and flowlines for offshore energy generation.\n\n**Low Emission Energy:** Laying the foundations for what is set to become the crown jewel of the new Tubacex, the Low Carbon division, which is propelled by NT2 and focuses on innovating with technologies necessary for the energy transition.\n\n**Growth Opportunities:** Developing and/or seeking new businesses in energy and mobility through organic and inorganic growth.\n\n#### 2.2.2 NT2 Strategic Plan (2024-2027): Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition\n\nPresented on November 21, 2023, at the Capital Markets Day held in Madrid, NT2 builds upon the foundations of the previous Strategic Plan but leverages corporate transformation and the energy transition to respond to emerging trends and the need for a balanced coexistence between conventional and renewable energies.\n\nIn addition to being a leader in sustainability, Tubacex's new roadmap aims to reduce the cyclicality of its activities and decrease its exposure to oil and gas.\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/10 description: A woman in a white lab coat is sitting at a desk in a laboratory. She is looking at a computer screen that is displaying an image of a sample. There is a microscope to her left and a computer tower to her right. A keyboard and mouse are in front of her.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Growth Drivers: five strategic pillars\n\nInherited from the previous strategic cycle, Tubacex has redesigned a roadmap based on five pillars to guide and support its transformation while ensuring revenue stability, improving competitiveness, and increasing diversification. This is evidenced by the historic annual results recorded in 2023 (chapter 5) and the solid order backlog mentioned earlier.\n\n**1. Sustainability:** With the aim of contributing to human progress by promoting responsible business activity, the sustainability plan is supported by four key areas:\n\n- Advancing towards energy neutrality and enhancing business circularity.\n- Contributing to the development of innovative solutions in energy transition.\n- Caring for people and local ecosystems where the company operates.\n- Promoting transparency.\n\n**2. Debt reduction:** Throughout 2023, net debt was reduced to 2.2x Net Financial Debt/EBITDA, compared to 3.1x at the end of 2022. This decrease results from the positive sector cycle, allowing the company to focus on cash generation through six actions:\n\n- Optimization of working capital requirements.\n- Optimal inventory levels per plant.\n- Divestment from non-strategic businesses.\n- Discipline and rigor in capital investment (CAPEX).\n- Cash pooling strategy.\n- Maintaining a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2-3 times.\n\n**3. Business stability:** To mitigate fluctuations and, therefore, cyclicality, Tubacex diversifies its product mix with premium solutions and its business geographically, covering raw materials and energy, and especially through long-term contracts with top-tier clients (over 30 signed already), providing high revenue visibility. Examples include two CRA OCTG contracts with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi and Petrobras in Brazil and one in the umbilical tubes sector with Aker Solutions in Norway. In the subsea business, there are several framework agreements with strategic clients in the aerospace, petrochemical, and H&I (Hydraulic and Instrumentation) sectors.\n\n**4. Competitiveness and Efficiency:** The common denominator for reducing debt and maintaining business stability is the effort to be competitive. As indicated at the beginning of this chapter, the pandemic's impact\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/16 description: The image shows a close-up of a complex mechanical device, possibly a jet engine or turbine.

He is wearing a black jacket with yellow stripes on the sleeves and torso. The man is smiling and looking to the right. In the background, there is a yellow machine and a metal fence.\n\nforced Tubacex to undergo a restructuring to prepare for the 2022-2025 Strategic Plan and adapt to the new market situation: strict control of operating costs and raw materials and scrap management, and operational excellence supported by digitalization. Actions in this area include the Lean Manufacturing model through:\n\n- Operational efficiency supported by digital capabilities.\n- Continuous improvement through the TxPS system.\n- Workforce flexibility.\n- Cost reduction.\n\n**5. Diversification:** Aligned with decarbonization requirements, the company accelerates its diversification plan to achieve a more balanced business mix, focusing on gas as a transition energy towards green energy and an alternative to coal, and its Low Carbon business unit as a fundamental lever in this balance. This is done without neglecting the traditional aerospace and nuclear sectors.\n\n#### Key Points of the New Strategic Plan\n\n**Low Carbon:** This business unit emerges as a central pillar, developing support solutions to advance sustainability and energy transition through carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen technologies. CCUS has become an ally in the path to sustainability as one of the few technologies capable of reducing CO2 emissions from industries such as steel and cement. This aligns with the goal of achieving zero emissions, where Tubacex has a portfolio of projects delivering advanced industrial solutions, currently focusing on the CO2 injection process. By 2027, revenues of 100 million euros are expected.\n\n**Financial objectives:** Tubacex projects an EBITDA of over 200 million euros for 2027, with estimated sales between 1.2 billion euros and 1.4 billion euros. The company also aims to maintain a Net Financial Debt (NFD) / EBITDA ratio below 2 times, reflecting a continuous trend towards financial deleveraging and strengthening cash flow.\n\n**Reducing dependence on Oil & Gas:** The plan aims to reduce exposure to these energy sources to less than one-third of total activity, mainly in the case of oil.\n\n**Shareholder remuneration policy:** Maintaining an attractive remuneration policy with a payout ratio of 30% to 40%.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/34/Picture/0 description: A close-up shot depicts a construction worker wearing a white hard hat and a yellow safety vest.

The engine is black and silver, and the blades are curved. The engine is in focus, and the background is blurred.\n\n**Future Vision:** Position Tubacex as a global leader in advanced solutions for energy and mobility, with all businesses contributing significantly to the Group's growth.\n\n#### Implementation\n\nThe NT2 plan is deployed in three simultaneous cycles:\n\n**1. Strengthening traditional products and services:** Focusing on decarbonization and efficiency in high-profitability segments. This involves supporting clients in their decarbonization processes with products and services from traditional and new markets that minimize environmental impact and improve efficiency. Concurrently, Tubacex continues to consolidate its leadership position in high-profitability segments.\n\n**2. Focus on low-emission energies:** Developing clean solutions. Under the Low Carbon business unit, innovative technological solutions are developed for the generation, storage, and transportation of energy in emerging hydrogen and CCUS markets.\n\n**3. Diversification and growth:** Exploring expansion opportunities in energy and mobility. To sustain growth through diversification, the company does not rule out growth through M&A operations alongside organic growth. Expansion opportunities in the energy and mobility sectors will be analyzed, with a special emphasis on fostering new businesses. The portfolio of businesses aligned with diversification encompasses three main blocks:\n\n- *Core Business:* Includes traditional businesses like Oil & Gas E&P or energy generation, along with diversification businesses such as aerospace.\n- *Low Carbon Business:* Tubacex already has a presence in this key growth area after developing specific materials and alloys, translating into advanced industrial products for energy generation and storage, as well as projects related to CCUS, storage and utilization, hydrogen, circular economy, and renewable energies.\n- *New Businesses:* Focused on analyzing growth opportunities in the energy and mobility sectors through the development of new businesses in-house or through inorganic operations.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows the number 2.3 in a simple, minimalist style. The numbers are drawn with thin, black lines against a light gray background. The decimal point is a small, solid black circle.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n**To implement the Strategic Plan, a roadmap is necessary to prevent, monitor, and address potential risks of any kind. This roadmap is embodied in the General Risk Control and Management Policy.** \n\nDuring the 2023, the Tubacex Board of Directors updated this document to include the basic principles and general action framework, materialized through a comprehensive risk control and management system. This system is based on an adequate definition and allocation of functions and responsibilities at the operational and supervisory levels and on procedures, methodologies, support tools, and information systems adapted to the various stages and activities of the system.\n\nThe General Risk Control and Management Policy is structured into three levels of protection and defense to address and manage significant risks:\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/5 description: A man wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and ear protection is inspecting metal cylinders. The cylinders are stacked on top of each other and have numbers written on them. The man is holding a piece of paper and appears to be comparing the numbers on the paper to the numbers on the cylinders. The man is wearing a black vest with yellow and green stripes. The background is blurry and appears to be a warehouse or factory.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/0 description: Two people wearing hard hats and safety glasses are standing next to each other. The person on the left is holding a tablet and wearing a white shirt. The person on the right is wearing an orange jumpsuit with a Brazilian flag patch on the shoulder.\n\nFOR THE FIRST TIME, THE AENOR CERTIFICATE WAS OBTAINED, CERTIFYING THE AVAILABILITY OF A RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNE-ISO 31000:2018 STANDARD\n\n- **Audit and Compliance Committee:** Periodically reviews internal control and risk management systems, including tax-related risks, to adequately identify, analyze, and report the main risks. In terms of ESG, this function is performed in coordination with the Sustainability and Good Governance Committee, as established in the company's Board of Directors Regulations.\n- **Internal Audit Directorate:** Informs, advises, and reports to the Committee on risks and the functional activity areas regarding the identification, measurement, and existing control over these risks.\n- **Management Committee:** Responsible for carrying out integrated risk management and control within business processes and decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, the policy identifies risk factors, indicating that these may vary depending on business conditions and evolution, mentioning the following:\n\na) Business risks.\n\nb) Market risks.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n- c) Operational, technological, environmental, social, and legal risks.\n- d) Corporate governance, ethics, and compliance risks.\n\ne) Credit risks.\n\n- f) Strategy and innovation risks.\n- g) Regulatory and political risks.\n- h) Reputational risk.\n\nAnnually, within the framework of the strategic reflection process, the Group updates the corporate risk map to identify and measure the risks it is exposed to, providing an analytical view of the underlying causal relationships and offering a broad perspective on the organization's overall exposure.\n\nRisk identification is carried out through questionnaires and personal interviews with the heads of various business units and relevant corporate areas (primarily members of the Management Committee). Once identified, risks are evaluated based on their probability of occurrence and impact on strategic objectives.\n\nThe projects defined by management within the framework of their strategic plan mitigate identified risks and allow for their monitoring.\n\nRisk and control functions include:\n\n- •Coordinating the process of risk identification, evaluation, and quantification for the subsequent preparation/update of the risk map.\n- Ensuring proper control and monitoring of risk management to keep it within acceptable levels.\n- Ensuring appropriate reporting to the Management Committee, Audit and Compliance Committee, and Board of Directors.\n\nImage /page/37/Picture/14 description: The image shows a green hydrogen production facility with wind turbines in the background.

The sky is blue and the ground is covered in green grass.\n\n#### 2 STRATEGY\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nAn important milestone in 2023 was the issuance of the AENOR certificate, which confirms that Tubacex has a Risk Management System in accordance with UNE-ISO 31000:2018, thus meeting an internal milestone and reinforcing the organization's commitment to risk management.\n\nThe audit required for certification was conducted in line with corporate processes, reviewing activities associated with risk management such as:\n\n- Activities related to determining context and stakeholders.\n- Processes related to communication and consultation.\n- Activities linked to risk identification.\n- Processes related to risk evaluation.\n- Activities related to risk treatment plans.\n- Activities associated with risk monitoring and measurement.\n- Activities linked to registration and reporting.\n- Risk management in activities within the scope of certification.\n\nAlong with the corporate risk map, progress was made in the previous fiscal year on developing a specific ESG risk map, which was further strengthened in 2023. The double materiality analysis, conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), served as a source for identifying risks and opportunities. This analysis helps identify sustainability-related impacts (positive and negative) and measure their economic impact in case of realization (chapter 3).\n\nImage /page/38/Picture/11 description: A green and gray striped cylinder is mounted on a white base on a concrete structure.

The graph shows the reduction of CO2 emissions over time with different methods. The methods listed are efficiency, oxy-combustion, CO2 capture, H2 blending, and electrification. The graph shows that by 2025, there will be an approximate 30% reduction in CO2 emissions. By 2030, there will be an approximate 60% reduction in CO2 emissions. The graph also shows that with I+D, there will be an approximate 100% reduction in CO2 emissions.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/15 description: This is a high-angle shot of a road cutting through a dense forest. The road is dark and narrow, winding its way through the trees. The trees are mostly green, with some variation in color and texture. The forest is dense and lush, with the trees growing close together. The overall impression is one of nature and tranquility.\n\nThe vector of Tubacex's Strategic Plan (chapter 2) is to become a leader in sustainability. By 2030, the company aims to base its business on three pillars: supporting decarbonization, driving new technologies necessary for the transition (such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)) through its Low Carbon unit, and identifying new growth opportunities in energy and mobility.\n\nTubacex's commitment to sustainability and environmental management is recognized and validated by leading certification authorities. Additionally, its sustainability and environmental policies for emission reduction are backed by Science Based Targets (SBT), an initiative in collaboration with the CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, and S&P sustainability standards.\n\nEach year, the company undertakes actions to advance towards these goals. In 2023, Tubacex implemented numerous policies and manuals focused on ESG to reduce its environmental impact, promote social actions, and improve governance. These efforts build upon the initiatives launched in previous years.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Policies and Manuals Available:\n\n#### Initiatives Approved in 2023\n\n**Integrated Environmental Policy:** Aims to expand commitments in environmental management, addressing climate, water, pollution, circularity, and biodiversity aspects.\n\n**Equality, Diversity, and Equity Policy:** Enhances commitment to full equality in relationships within the company and between employees and external entities.

The background of the image is a blurred, out-of-focus image of what appears to be a series of pipes or tubes. The pipes are arranged in parallel rows, and there are some blue clamps or fasteners visible on some of the pipes.\n\n**The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the methodology developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) establish common standards for presenting non-financial information. According to these standards, a material aspect is one that can impact people or the environment and/or have financial effects on the business.**\n\nTo identify potentially material issues, Tubacex uses a benchmarking analysis with other companies, the most relevant aspects of the 2030 agenda. As a new element in 2023, the company stablishes the SASB standards from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which identify financially important ESG information to evaluate how an organization creates business value.\n\nFrom the resulting catalog of issues, Tubacex prioritizes them through the following activities:\n\n**1. Impact Materiality Analysis:** Each impact (positive or negative, potential or real) is analyzed and assessed considering its severity and reversibility (only for negative impacts) and probability (for potential impacts). A sustainability issue includes those caused or contributed to by the company, directly related to its operations, products, and services, and through its business relationships.\n\n**2. Financial Materiality Analysis:** For financial materiality analysis, the probability of occurrence and the magnitude of potential financial effects are assessed, suitable to the size and volume of the company.\n\nAfter evaluating each parameter, the results are analyzed separately, and the materiality of each element is assessed.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/0 description: The image shows a scatter plot titled \"Short term\". The x-axis is labeled \"Financial materiality Internal Stakeholder Groups\", and the y-axis is labeled \"Impact Materiality External Stakeholder Groups\". The y-axis ranges from 0 to 10, and the x-axis ranges from 0 to 20. There are several data points plotted on the graph. The data points are (1,1), (6,3), (6,4), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (9,1), (9,6), (10,2), (12,1), (13,4), (13,6), (14,2), (15,7), (16,4), (16,8), (18,1), (18,6), (18,8). There are text boxes around the plot that say \"Impact of the company's activities on its social and environmental context\", \"Severity\\* occurrence of the impact on the social and environmental context\", \"Severity\\* occurrence of the impact on the economic value of the company\", \"Impact of the context on the\", and \"A sustainability issue or aspect meets the criteria of Double Materiality if it is material from: 1. The perspective of impact 2. The financial perspective 3. Or from both perspectives\".\n\n| Sustainability item                           | Impact materiality | Financial materiality |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Data privacy                                  | Critical           | Critical              |\n| Cybersecurity                                 | Critical           | Critical              |\n| Energy transition                             | Critical           | Critical              |\n| Mitigating and adapting to climate change     | Critical           | -                     |\n| Sustainable management of suppliers           | Critical           | Significant           |\n| Waste management                              | Significant        | Critical              |\n| Sustainable water management                  | Significant        | Significant           |\n| Fiscal transparency                           | Critical           | Minimum               |\n| Respect for labor rights                      | Critical           | Minimum               |\n| Equality and diversity                        | Critical           | Minimum               |\n| Occupational health and safety                | Critical           | Important             |\n| Quality of the products and services supplied | Critical           | -                     |\n| Ethics and compliance                         | Critical           | -                     |\n| Risk management                               | Critical           | -                     |\n| Environmental management                      | Critical           | -                     |\n| Compliance with environmental regulation      | Critical           | -                     |\n| Customer satisfaction                         | Critical           | -                     |\n| Talent attraction and retention               | Critical           | -                     |\n| Customer health & safety                      | Critical           | -                     |\n| Development of local communities              | Critical           | -                     |\n| Employee training                             | -                  | Critical              |\n| Circular economy                              | -                  | Significant           |\n| Sustainable energy management                 | -                  | Significant           |\n| Sustainability performance                    | -                  | Significant           |\n| Sustainable innovation                        | -                  | Significant           |\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\n**TUBACEX**\nGROUP\n\n**economic value of the company**\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/0 description: The image shows the number 3.4.

Aceralava is the primary recipient of these investment plans due to its nature and high energy consumption. This decarbonization plan is part of the Ambition 2030 climate roadmap, aiming to reduce GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 60% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\n#### Circularity\n\nThe company continues to make progress in recovering all the scrap generated in the steel mill, extending the recovery project to other Group production plants. In this regard, it advances with the revaluation process of slag, the main waste from the steel mill, at a recovery plant in Europe specializing in treating products from the stainless steel industry. This initiative prevents the disposal of around 15,000 tons per year in landfills, recovering minerals that re-enter the manufacturing process and are used in road asphalt products. These projects are in addition to existing ones for using recycled material or other improvements in waste management and water consumption diagnostics.\n\n#### Responsible supply chain\n\nRegarding the evaluation of the supply chain, the company has already assessed 829 suppliers on ESG criteria through its pilot supplier risk management tool. This highlights the review of its management processes to drive its supply chain within the framework of its sustainability commitments.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Climate Risks\n\nTubacex has integrated physical and transition risks into its global risk model. The evaluation is conducted according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This involves assessing both physical risks (acute and chronic) resulting from the effects of climate change on operations, and transition risks arising from the impacts of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe risks are analyzed across three different time horizons: short-term (2025), medium-term (2030), and long-term (2050). For each type of risk, potential sources are identified, and their probability of occurrence is evaluated under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, along with the possible impact on the business and the timeframe for their realization.\n\n| Sustainability<br>issue                  | Items / Material Aspect                           | Strategic Lines                                                                                                                           | SDG                      |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Energy transition and<br>climate change  | Energy transition                                 | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7 and 13      |\n| Energy transition and<br>climate change  | Sustainable energy management                     | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7 and 13      |\n| Energy transition and<br>climate change  | Climate change mitigation<br>and adaptation to it | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7 and 13      |\n| Regulatory<br>compliance                 | Compliance with<br>environmental regulation       | Adhering to the highest ethical<br>and compliance standards                                                                               | Image: SDG 16 and 8      |\n| Responsible<br>Supply Chain              | Sustainable management<br>of suppliers            | Sustainable supply chain                                                                                                                  | Image: SDG 12            |\n| Water consumption<br>and water resources | Sustainable water management                      | Fostering business circularity                                                                                                            | Image: SDG 12, 6, and 13 |\n| Circular Economy<br>and waste management | Waste management                                  | Fostering business circularity                                                                                                            | Image: SDG 12            |\n| Circular Economy<br>and waste management | Circular economy                                  | Fostering business circularity                                                                                                            | Image: SDG 12 and 13     |\n| Environmental<br>management              | Environmental management                          | Moving forward in decarbonization<br>and energy efficiency                                                                                | Image: SDG 7, 12, and 13 |\n| Biodiversity                             | Impact on biodiversity                            | Sustainable supply chain.<br>Working with our customers on the<br>development of innovative<br>solutions that facilitate their transition | Image: SDG 15            |\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/5 description: The image shows a stack of metal pipes with red caps on the ends.

There are also some wooden supports for the shelves.\n\ncompany. Tubacex exclusively handles the analysis of the communications' content, with specialized external advisors as needed.\n\n#### Human Rights\n\nTubacex is fully committed to respecting human rights, always guided by the fundamental principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as expressed in its code of conduct. These principles form the basis of the applicable legislation across all business units.\n\nTo affirm this commitment, the company's Board of Directors approved its Human Rights Policy in 2023. This policy represents the organization's dedication to developing a culture that implements internationally recognized human rights support policies and seeks to avoid complicity in human rights violations.\n\nIn parallel, Tubacex has identified the key human rights issues affecting the company, particularly those related to economic rights, and has analyzed them individually to identify opportunities and impacts. These aspects have also been incorporated into the materiality analysis. The key human rights issues identified include:\n\n- Job creation.\n- Respect for labor rights.\n- Establishing responsible and transparent labor relations.\n- Occupational health and safety.\n- Attraction and retention of talent.\n- Employee training.\n- Equality and diversity.\n- Child labor.\n- Indigenous peoples' rights.\n- Development of local communities.\n\n#### Tubacex Foundation\n\nIn February 2016, the Tubacex Foundation was established as an entity closely aligned with the company's business strategy and the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The Foundation serves as a fundamental channel for promoting projects in three major areas of action: quality education, corporate diversity, and social action.\n\nThrough the Foundation, support programs for society are defined, and common lines of work are established for the rest of the Group's business units, aligned with the identified material aspects:\n\n- **Quality Education:** Focused on attracting and retaining talent while promoting youth employment and employability. Through quality education, action plans are implemented to invest in future generations and professionals.\n- **Corporate Diversity:** In addition to promoting gender equality through various plans and policies, the Group, through the Foundation, promotes the socio-labor integration of people with diverse talents. This includes collaboration with entities specialized in hiring people with disabilities.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for TUBACEX foundation. The word \"TUBACEX\" is written in large, bold, black letters. Below it, the word \"foundation\" is written in smaller, black letters. To the right of the text is a red, circular shape that resembles a flower.\n\n**• Development of Local Communities:** The company supports the development of communities where it operates through direct and indirect employment and by promoting collaboration projects with NGOs.\n\nIn 2023, the focus on education and corporate diversity was reactivated after being affected in the previous two years by the situation in plants that housed the largest number of students. Additionally, the Foundation continues to support social action programs in developing countries, as well as the aid program for Ukrainian refugee families that began in 2022 due to the Russian invasion.\n\n#### Actions Developed During 2023\n\n#### Social Action\n\nThrough the NGO Colabora Birmania, the Tubacex Group continues to support educational centers to promote the development of displaced Burmese children. This program focuses on promoting comprehensive education, covering the entire development cycle of the child: from orphanages and nurseries to schools and access to the labor market in adulthood.\n\nA specific action in 2023 is the proposed construction of a new building on the grounds of a school (KM 42) to accommodate secondary education students.\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/8 description: A high-angle shot captures a large group of children, all smiling and holding up peace signs.

In the 2022/2023 edition, five engineers applied for vacancies in Austria, Thailand, and the USA, of which two remained on staff after their internship period. The 2023/2024 edition offers vacancies in Thailand, Italy, the USA, and Austria.\n\nAnother training initiative includes dual programs that combine learning at educational centers and workplaces. In Austria, these programs are developed at a dedicated center (FutureZone), training 18 apprentices in 2023. In Spain, eight students participate in this training modality.\n\nAs an extension and novelty in this area, a program to attract international talent was activated in 2023. Although it did not result in the recruitment of talent, it helped refine the proposal for candidates for 2023/2024.\n\n#### Emergency Aid: SOS Ukraine\n\nIn response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Tubacex launched an aid program in 2022, primarily targeting workers and families of a partner company located in a war-torn region with close commercial ties to Tubacex.\n\nA total of five families were relocated from the Hungarian border to the Basque Country. Thanks to the support and collaboration of the SOS Ukraine organization, they were initially integrated into foster homes.\n\nIn 2023, after completing the transition period in foster homes, four families returned to regions near the Ukrainian border or other destinations, while one family remained in the Basque Country, soon joined by a second family. Both families are now housed in rental apartments funded by the Tubacex Foundation and integrated into Basque society.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/0 description: The image shows a large, white number 4 against a dark background with subtle, swirling patterns.

The number 4 is on the left, followed by a period, and then the number 1 on the right.\n\n## BUSINESS EVOLUTION\n\n**Despite the complex and challenging environment described in chapter 2, Tubacex achieved the best results in its history in 2023 (chapter 5), with revenues of 852.4 million euros (+19.3%), EBITDA of 125.2 million euros (+35.6%), and an EBITDA margin of 14.7%. Additionally, the company maintained a historic order backlog of 1.6 billion euros.** \n\nThese record results represent the consolidation of pre-pandemic activity levels and demonstrate the success of the Group's strategic diversification in products, services, and geographic areas, as well as its strategic focus on providing premium solutions to clients, anticipating their needs, and becoming a key player in the energy transition.\n\nThe business evolution is influenced by the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate hikes to curb inflation, which caused a slowdown in sales of lower value added products.\n\nSignificant progress was made in gas upstream activity in Asia and the Middle East, with sustainable orders and strong positioning with strategic clients through long-term agreements.\n\n#### Products and services\n\nThree key drivers significantly impacted the 2023 income statement: the shift towards renewable energies in response to decarbonization, increased air traffic, and the positive evolution of the oil and gas\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows a cargo ship transporting containers filled with hydrogen.

The ship has a sign that says \"NO SMOKING\".\n\nexploration and production (upstream) market. All of these drivers increased their share in the Group's mix.\n\nRegarding the trend towards sustainability, increased activity in two energy sources that provide stability and visibility for the medium and long-term business is notable. These transition energies include gas, which accounts for a significant portion of high value added products, and nuclear energy, which has experienced significant growth.\n\nIn parallel, there is potential growth with the development of new sustainable solutions through hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)\n\nwith injection wells, where orders have already been received. Tubacex's roadmap for positioning as a leader in the energy transition is outlined in the new NT2 2024-2027 strategic plan (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition) (chapter 2), with a focus on the Low Carbon division, the motor of this new phase, projecting sales of 100 million euros by 2027.\n\nIn traditional sectors, the aerospace one stands out, with record orders for high-tech products, and the upstream activity leading the post-pandemic recovery, with the price of oil stabilizing around 80 dollars per barrel. Despite the uncertain economic and geopolitical context, energy companies present a good financial situation, with ambitious expansion plans and solid medium and long-term viability prospects for the projects presented. This translates into a significant increase in the CRA OCTG portfolio, particularly umbilicals, supported by long-term supply contracts with key clients.\n\nThe year saw two distinct periods, with the second half experiencing an acceleration in the project market, compensating for a slight cooling in tubular solutions for distributors (through the business led by TSS), more focused on maintenance. This improvement, coupled with Tubacex's strategic positioning to support and add value to the client with long-term supply contracts, is key to achieving the historic order volume that will be reflected in sales in the coming quarters, ensuring stability in results\n\n#### Sector dynamics\n\n#### Industrial (35%)\n\nThroughout 2023, Tubacex increased its positioning in premium products in China and India, countries with strong refining capacity growth forecasts, while the LNG and Gas Processing sectors maintained high levels of activity and visibility, particularly in North America and the Middle East.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/0 description: The image shows a pie chart titled \"SECTOR BREAKDOWN\". The pie chart is divided into five sectors: Industrial (35%), E&P Gas (24%), Powergen (7%), New markets (15%), and E&P Oil (19%). The pie chart is superimposed on a background image of a green, hilly landscape.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Mid&Downstream segment showed a reactivation in the awarding of large projects, especially in the Middle East and Asia, although orders for lower value added products slowed due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates.\n\n#### E&P Gas (24%) & E&P Oil (19%)\n\n*Upstream:* In America, operations continue in Brazil's deep waters, where Tubacex has already supplied equipment to 10 wells in the Búzios field. Continued operations by Petrobras are expected in the coming months with comprehensive solutions supplied from the Macaé hub. In the Middle East, the construction of the new CRA OCTG plant in Abu Dhabi continues as part of the 10 year project signed with ADNOC, marking the largest contract in the company's history. The drilling and special machining segments also performed well.\n\n*Subsea***:** This segment registered a record order intake, with key strategic projects on all five continents. The offshore segment has proven to be one of the most resilient and geopolitically stable markets for state energy security. It has a backlog with delivery times exceeding 12 months in some cases, indicating positive medium-term prospects. Additionally, significant discoveries are being made in new locations: Namibia, Suriname, Guyana, Brazil (Amazon Basin), and Tanzania. Tubacex has established strategic agreements with leading umbilical manufacturers. The creation of a joint venture between SLB and AKER (SLB Onesubsea) offers Tubacex an opportunity to strengthen its positioning in E&P Gas.\n\n#### New Markets (15%)\n\n*Low Carbon:* Tubacex positions this unit as the flagship of sustainability, projecting sales of 100 million euros by 2027. In 2023, significant orders for CCUS (carbon\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/0 description: The image shows a pie chart titled \"FINAL DESTINATION BREAKDOWN\".

In 2023, the nuclear segment performed well, particularly in Europe, where a long-term agreement was signed with the French energy company EDF for the maintenance of its existing plants and the construction of future ones. There are also promising prospects for the SMR (Small Modular Reactors) market, especially in Canada, the U.S., and Europe, and for Ultra Super Critical (USC) power plants in China and India. Tubacex is collaborating with several engineering firms for the development of design and materials.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows the number 4.2 in a simple, minimalist style. The numbers are drawn with thin, black lines against a light gray background. The decimal point is a small, solid black circle.\n\nMARKET\n\nSITUATION\n\n**Tubacex's local manufacturing strategy brings the company closer to key markets with operational presence in Guyana, Brazil, and Kazakhstan, where the company has directly engaged with end users in implementing its solutions, resulting in order intake growth.** \n\nThese new production facilities add to the Group's existing 24 plants and 14 service centers worldwide. This presence is complemented by a network of commercial offices in five major geographical areas (Europe, America, Asia, the Caspian region, and the Middle East) and agents covering the global market.\n\n#### Geographical Market Situation\n\nThe strength of the American market continues to gain ground in the geographical mix and in 2023, it already doubles the pre-pandemic share, while the Asian market (including the Middle East) more than recovers the dynamism lost in 2022. In Europe, the robust Norwegian market continues. This diversified global presence ensures regional balance, increasing\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/6 description: Two scientists are working in a lab.

Notable is the ongoing project to develop production capacity in Abu Dhabi.\n\n#### **Asia & ME (43%)**\n\nTubacex's largest contract ever, with a minimum committed value of 1 billion dollars, for gas production in Abu Dhabi, began execution and in 2023, the construction of a CRA OCTG tube finishing and threading plant started. Operations are expected to begin at the end of 2024. This order marks a turning point in the company's growth and global positioning, becoming the world's leading supplier in the CRA OCTG segment.\n\nMedium and long-term growth expectations in this region are solid. East Asia experienced an improvement over 2022, thanks to increased sales in India, where there are good prospects in premium products and the nuclear sector, and the recovery of China, particularly in the petrochemical sector.\n\n#### **America (33%)**\n\nIn 2023, the American market performed well again, with record sales levels. Four key drivers stand out: At the sector level, the aerospace business records a historic volume of orders, and the energy sector boosts its momentum thanks to the global leadership of the U.S. and Canada in the demand for Tubacex's deep CO2 storage solutions through injection wells and the high volume of material and service sales for offshore extraction activities by Brazilian Petrobras. Lastly, there is strong growth in the sales of instrumentation tubes.\n\nFrom a production perspective, the capacity of the Salem Tube, Tubacex Durant, and NTS Amega West plants is consolidated.\n\n#### **Europe (21%)**\n\nStrong sales growth continues in Norway, with high demand for complex machined products and distribution projects through TSS Norway. Other notable aspects in Europe include long-term contracts with umbilical manufacturers, opportunities in the nuclear segment in France, and good prospects for gas processing plants in the Caspian Sea.\n\n#### **África (3%)**\n\nNew offshore projects in Tanzania, Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa.\n\n#### Subsidiaries\n\nAmong the various subsidiaries, in 2023, Tubacex Service Solutions (TSS), a distributor of seamless stainless steel tube, stood out with a high turnover volume, more intense in the first half. Any slight decline in order volumes was offset by an increase in the project market order book.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/0 description: The image shows the number 5 in white, with the word \"RESULTS\" in pink below it.

In addition to these achievements, the company also maintained a historic order backlog volume of 1.6 billion euros.\n\nThe 2023 results were recorded in an environment of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, with high-interest rates, demonstrating the success of the restructuring undertaken following the pandemic and the effective diversification of activities and business as outlined in the 2022-2025 Strategic Plan (chapter 02). The Group achieved the plan's objectives two years ahead of schedule, prompting an update in November 2023 for the 2024-2027 period under the name NT2 (Driving the New Tubacex towards the Next Transition), focusing on two pillars: energy transition and mobility.\n\n#### Profit and loss account\n\nSales grew by 19.3% compared to 2022, which had already set a revenue record, and more than doubled the figures from 2021, reaching 852.4 million euros in 2023.\n\nRegarding the breakdown of revenue by sectors, 35% of the Group's product revenues originated from the Industrial sector, 24% from gas E&P, 19% from oil E&P, 15% from new markets, and 7% from Powergen.\n\nAs for the final destinations of sales, there is significant geographical diversification in revenue sources: 43% of sales were generated in Asia and the Middle East (where the Group has substantial exposure to the gas segment, both for extraction and processing), 33% in America (with a growing importance of the instrumentation and control tube segment and record orders in the aerospace and aeronautical sector), 21%\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### PROFIT FOR THE YEAR\n\n| (€M)                    | FY 2022 | FY 2023 | % variation |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|-------------|\n|                         |         |         |             |\n| Sales                   | 714.7   | 852.4   | 19.3%       |\n| EBITDA                  | 92.3    | 125.2   | 35.6%       |\n| EBITDA margin           | 12.9%   | 14.7%   |             |\n| EBIT                    | 44.5    | 80.7    | 81.6%       |\n| EBIT margin             | 6.2%    | 9.5%    |             |\n| Profit before tax       | 26.9    | 49.6    | 84.5%       |\n| Margin                  | 3.8%    | 5.8%    |             |\n| Attributable Net Profit | 20.2    | 36.3    | 79.5%       |\n| Net margin              | 2.8%    | 4.3%    |             |\n\n| (€M)                             | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023 | €M variation |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Circulating Capital              | 230.0      | 234.5      | +4.5         |\n| Working Capital / Sales          | 32.2%      | 27.5%      |              |\n| Net Financial Debt               | 287.1      | 280.7      | -6.4         |\n| Net Financial Debt / EBITDA      | 3.1x       | 2.2x       |              |\n| Structural Net Financial Debt(1) | 57.1       | 46.2       | -10.9        |\n\n(1) Total Net Financial Debt - Working Capital\n\nin Europe (with strong demand for complex machined products in the North Sea and long-term agreements with umbilical manufacturers), and the remaining 3% in Africa (with new offshore projects in Tanzania, Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa).\n\nThe favorable market conditions and strategic positioning with key clients have enabled Tubacex to consolidate EBITDA growth to historic levels. This indicator rose to 125.2 million euros, a 35.6% increase over the previous year. The EBITDA margin stands at 14.7%, also the highest level recorded by the company. The positive evolution of these two metrics in recent years is attributable to an improved product mix, a commitment to innovation, a strategic repositioning of client types, increased productivity, and cost reduction.\n\nAs a result, the net attributable profit increased by 79.5%, reaching 36.3 million euros.\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/7 description: The image shows a close-up of several metal pipes.

In 2020, the net profit was -25.3 million euros. In 2021, the net profit was -32.2 million euros. In 2022, the net profit was 20.2 million euros. In 2023, the net profit was 36.3 million euros.\n\n(2) The Net Profit for 2020 includes extraordinary negative adjustments made voluntarily, with no cash impact, amounting to a total of 20.3 million euros.\n\n#### 5 RESULTS\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Balance Sheet and Financial Position\n\nDespite significant sales growth, Tubacex made substantial efforts throughout the year to contain working capital, which stands at 234.5 million euros, representing 27.5% of sales, below the strategic target of 30%.\n\nWithin the working capital, inventory amounts to 411.1 million euros, mostly corresponding to work in progress and finished products already sold but not yet invoiced.\n\nRegarding financial debt, Tubacex continues its trend of deleveraging and strengthening its financial solidity. Consequently, the debt ratio (Net Financial Debt/ EBITDA) is 2.2 times at the end of the fiscal year, once again meeting the strategic objective, with a forecast for further reduction in upcoming periods as outlined in the Strategic Plan update.\n\nThis has been achieved despite substantial investments aimed at acquiring minority stakes in Saudi Arabia and Norway, the commencement of the Abu Dhabi plant construction, and the dividend payment to shareholders based on 2022 results. These operations, along with CAPEX, have led to a cash outflow of over 55 million euros. Nevertheless, the Group's strong cash flow generation capability has balanced the situation, reducing net financial debt to 280.7 million euros as of December 31, 2023, down from 287.1 million euros at the end of the previous fiscal year (3.1 times NFD/EBITDA).\n\nThus, the company's liquidity position exceeds 300 million euros, with 179 million euros in cash.\n\nThanks to the visibility of order volumes, the company is expected to continue improving cash flow generation over the coming quarters.\n\nImage /page/74/Figure/7 description: This image is a bar chart showing the net operating income from 2019 to 2023.

This involves substantially contributing to one or more environmental objectives, not significantly harming any other environmental objective, complying with minimum social safeguards, and meeting the technical screening criteria.**\n\n#### Taxonomically eligible activities\n\nWithin this framework, technical selection criteria are established to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation. The regulation defines what is known as a taxonomically eligible activity. This refers to an economic activity described in the delegated acts, which establish the technical criteria for activities with the potential to mitigate climate change, regardless of whether the economic activity meets some or all of the technical selection criteria.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/4 description: A person is using a microscope to examine a red cylindrical object. The microscope is white and blue, and the person's hand is dark-skinned. The object is sitting on a clear glass slide, and the person is holding it in place with their fingers. The background is blurry, but it appears to be a laboratory setting.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/0 description: The image is an abstract, out-of-focus shot featuring a gradient of blues and grays. The left side of the image is lighter, with a swirling, circular pattern that fades into darker shades of blue and gray on the right. A faint, diagonal line of light cuts across the lower right portion of the image.\n\nIn line with this definition, Tubacex assesses whether the Group's activities fall within the scope of the Regulation. The criteria established in 2022 for the eligibility analysis are maintained, considering steel manufacturing activities (Aceralava) and excluding other subsidiaries engaged in the production of tubes and other tubular products, machined products, or additional complementary services added to the final product.\n\nSimultaneously, following the approval of the Environmental Delegated Regulation on June 13, 2023, by the European Commission, which defines complementary activities in accordance with the remaining four environmental objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems), the company analyzes whether its activities are covered by the said Delegated Regulation. It concludes that they are excluded as they do not adhere to the descriptions of the incorporated activities.\n\n#### Taxonomically Aligned Activities\n\nA taxonomically aligned economic activity meets all the requirements set forth in the aforementioned Regulation:\n\n- Substantially contribute to one of the environmental objectives: Climate change mitigation and adaptation, water and marine resources protection, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n- Do not significantly harm other objectives: The assessment ensures that the taxonomy itself does not include economic activities that undermine any of the other five environmental objectives.\n- Meet minimum social safeguards: Compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights is required.\n\nIn accordance with the criteria defined for the eligibility analysis, the scope of alignment evaluation focuses on the stainless-steel long products manufacturing activity carried out by the Group's steel plant, Aceralava, and the products from this plant commercialized through TSS. Compliance is achieved in this case using scrap in EAF furnaces, with over 70% of fine steel production derived from scrap consumption.\n\n#### Results\n\nFor the calculation of indicators, Tubacex considers eligible and, according to the analysis performed, aligned sales from Aceralava to third parties, as well as sales from the trading companies (TSS) of steel (eligible activity) versus other products (non-eligible activity), considering TSS sales \"by material origin\" (Aceralava). For CAPEX and OPEX, the corresponding entries from Aceralava and the proportion of TSS used for the related activity are taken into account.\n\nFor denominators, the calculation is based on the following criteria.
