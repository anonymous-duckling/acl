Application of the European Green Taxonomy**\n\n#### *4.3.6.1. Presentation — Publication Obligation*\n\nIn order to promote transparency and a long-term vision in economic activities, and to redirect capital flows toward environmentally sustainable investments, the European Union (EU) action plan on financing for sustainable growth has led to the creation of a common classification system for corporate activities, allowing for the identification of economic activities considered to be sustainable.\n\nThis system is defined in European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the \"Taxonomy Regulation\") and aims to define the EU's environmental objectives and corresponding economic activities.\n\nSustainable economic activities, or aligned activities, are defined in Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nTo determine whether an activity can be considered sustainable, it must:\n\n- *(i) contribute substantially to one or more of the following six environmental objectives: (i) climate change mitigation; (ii) climate change adaptation; (iii) the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; (iv) the transition to a circular economy; (v) pollution prevention and control; and (vi) the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.*\n- *(ii) do no significant harm to any of the other five environmental objectives;*\n- *(iii) be carried out in compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the eight core ILO Conventions and the International Bill of Human Rights.*\n\nThe European Commission adopted:\n\n- on June 4, 2021, Delegated Regulation EU 2021/2139 (the \"Climate Regulation\"), which establishes the technical screening criteria relating to the first two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation) and identifies more than 80 economic activity sub-sectors representing 93% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union and requiring priority action (\"European taxonomy-eligible\" activities).\n- on June 27, 2023:\n\t- Supplementary Delegated Regulations establishing the technical screening criteria determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\t- Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485, which amends the Climate Regulation by adding a new activity to Notes I, entitled \"3.18. Manufacture of automotive and mobility components\" and establishing technical screening criteria relating to climate change mitigation and adaptation for this new economic activity.\n\nPursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Act relating to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation published on July 6, 2021, the Group must publish its sensitivity to the European Green Taxonomy and sustainability indicators such as:\n\n- the proportion of turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) associated with \"eligible\" activities, i.e. those classified in the European Taxonomy, and \"noneligible\" activities;\n- the proportion of its turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) associated with \"sustainable\" activities, i.e. activities that comply with the technical criteria associated with each of the \"eligible\" activities, do not harm other environmental objectives (DNSH) and respect minimum social safeguards.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor 2023, the Group must publish:\n\n- the proportion of \"taxonomy-eligible\" and \"taxonomy-non-eligible\" economic activities for its total turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx), with regard to all published environmental objectives;\n- the proportion of \"taxonomy-aligned\" and \"taxonomy-non-aligned\" economic activities for its total turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx), only with regard to the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives.\n\n#### *4.3.6.2. Methodology — Scope*\n\nThe various analyses were based on a cross-functional approach involving the Group's finance, legal and nonfinancial teams.\n\nThe scope of analysis covers the following points:\n\n- the turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenses considered cover all the Group's activities corresponding to the scope of companies under its control;\n- companies in which the Group and its companies exercise joint control or significant influence are excluded from the calculation of the ratios defined by the delegated act relating to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation published on July 6, 2021 (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178);\n\nFinancial data is taken from the consolidated annual accounts as at December 31, 2023, and turnover and capital expenditure can therefore be reconciled with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *4.3.6.3. Eligibility Analysis of Activities*\n\nThe eligibility analysis consists of identifying the Group's activities listed in the various Delegated Acts of the Taxonomy Regulation. These activities are referred to as \"eligible.\"\n\nThe analysis of Akwel's turnover under activity 3.3 \"Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\" in 2022 did not lead to the conclusion of eligibility, as recommended by the European Commission's \"Draft commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets,\" dated December 19, 2022.\n\nIn 2023, Akwel carried out a new eligibility analysis of its activities:\n\n#### **Result of Analysis on Climate Change Mitigation Objectives**\n\n| Number | Activity                                                                 | TURNOVER | CAPEX | OPEX |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|------|\n| 3.18   | Manufacture of automotive and mobility components                        | X        | X     | -    |\n| 6.5    | Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light<br>commercial vehicles | -        | X     | -    |\n| 7.2    | Renovation of existing buildings                                         | -        | X     | -    |\n| 7.3    | Installation, maintenance and repair of energy<br>efficiency equipment   | -        | X     | -    |\n| 7.7    | Acquisition and ownership of buildings                                   | -        | X     | -    |\n\n#### **Result of the Analysis on Transition to a Circular Economy Objectives**\n\n| Number | Activity                                  | TURNOVER | CAPEX | OPEX |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------|----------|-------|------|\n| 5.1    | Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing | X        | X     | -    |\n| 5.2    | Sale of spare parts                       | X        | -     | -    |\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.6.4. Activity Alignment Review*\n\nA review of the Group's activities with regard to the technical criteria identified the following elements:\n\n#### *4.3.6.4.1. Revenue*\n\n#### **Activity 3.18 — Manufacture of Automotive and Mobility Components**\n\nPart of the Group's activities consists of manufacturing products (the Flush Handle) to ensure and improve the environmental performance of electric vehicles.\n\n#### *4.3.6.4.2. CAPEX*\n\n#### **Activity 6.5 — Transport by Motorbikes, Passenger Cars, and Light Commercial Vehicles**\n\nThe Group has invested in greening its vehicle fleet, either by acquiring electric vehicles or leasing them.\n\n#### **Activity 7.2 — Renovation of Existing Buildings**\n\nRenovation work at the Group's head office was considered to be in line with the technical criteria.\n\n#### **Activity 7.3 — Installation, Maintenance and Repair of Energy Efficiency Equipment**\n\nCapital expenditure on LED relamping at the AKWEL Juarez site in Mexico has been accepted as aligned, as it meets the technical criteria.\n\n#### *4.3.6.4.3. OPEX*\n\nOperating expenses as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation are not material in relation to the total operating expenses shown in AKWEL's consolidated income statement.\n\nAnalyses led to the conclusion that the OPEX ratio was not material, as it was not relevant to the Group's activities (i.e. less than 10%).\n\nConsequently, the exemption criterion was applied and the OPEX KPI was not calculated.\n\n#### *4.3.6.5. Compliance with Do No Significant Harm*\n\nIn accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation, the Group has reviewed all the DNSH (Do No Significant Harm) criteria for eligible activities to in order to characterize the alignment of these activities.\n\n#### *4.3.6.6. Compliance with Minimum Social Safeguards*\n\nAccording to the Taxonomy Regulation, to be considered aligned with one of the environmental objectives, an activity must comply with minimum safeguards in four areas:\n\n**Human rights**: the Group is committed to respecting human rights, notably through its Ethics Charter. This Charter defines the way in which employees must interact with business partners, suppliers, communities and other stakeholders. It also sets out the Group's whistleblowing procedure.\n\n**Corruption**: the Group has implemented its procedures with regard to French Law 20166-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life, known as \"Sapin II.\" Actions have been implemented across all eight pillars.\n\n**Taxation**: the Group has not made any arrangements to artificially reduce its corporate tax burden or transfer its taxable income to low-tax countries;\n\n**Fair competition**: as detailed in its Ethics Charter, the Group is committed to ensuring that competition is fair and equitable. No Group action may prevent, restrict or distort competition.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.6.7. Publication*\n\n#### *4.3.6.7.1.

Certain details are sensitive to the methodological choices, assumptions and/or estimates used in its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Entity**\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for:\n\n- selecting or establishing appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- drawing up a Statement in compliance with legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies applied with regard to these risks as well as the results of these policies, including key performance indicators and, in addition, the information provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy);\n- implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary to enable the preparation of Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been drawn up by applying the entity's Reporting Criteria as mentioned above.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Independent Third Party**\n\nIt is our responsibility, on the basis of our work, to formulate a reasoned opinion expressing a conclusion of moderate assurance on:\n\n- compliance of the Statement with the provisions of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the fair presentation of the historical information (observed or extrapolated) provided pursuant to 3° of I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, namely the results of policies, including key performance indicators and actions relating to the main risks.\n\nAs it is our responsibility to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by the management, we are not authorized to be involved in the preparation of said Information, as this could compromise our independence.\n\nOur responsibility does not include expressing an opinion on:\n\n- the entity's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements (in particular with regard to the information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy), the vigilance plan and the fight against corruption and tax evasion plan);\n- the fair presentation of the details provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy);\n- the compliance of products and services with applicable regulations.\n\n#### **Applicable Regulations and Professional Standards**\n\nOur work described below was carried out in accordance with the provisions of Articles A. 225-1 et seqq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional standards of the French National Institute of Auditors (*Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes* — CNCC) relating to this work in lieu of an audit program, and ISAE 3000 (revised).\n\n#### **Independence and Quality Control**\n\nOur independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. In addition, we have implemented a quality control system that includes documented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, ethical rules and the professional standards of the CNCC.\n\n#### **Means and Resources**\n\nOur work involved the skills of three people and took place between March 8 and April 25, 2024, over a total period of 15 days.\n\nWe called on our sustainable development and corporate social responsibility specialists to assist us in carrying out our work. We conducted three interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement, representing in particular General Management, Administration and Finance, Risk Management, Compliance, Human Resources, Health and Safety, Environment and Purchasing.\n\n#### **Nature and Scope of Our Work**\n\nWe planned and performed our work under consideration of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe believe that the procedures we have performed in exercising our professional judgment have allowed us to provide a conclusion of moderate assurance:\n\n- we have familiarized ourselves with the activities of all the entities included in the scope of consolidation and with the description of the main risks;\n- we have assessed the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and comprehensibility, taking into account best practices in the sector, where appropriate;\n- we have verified that the Statement covers each category of information specified in III of Article L. 225- 102-1 concerning social and environmental issues, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion;\n- we have verified that the Statement includes the information required under II of Article R. 225-105 when relevant to the principal risks and includes, where appropriate, an explanation of the reasons for the absence of the information required under paragraph 2 of III of Article L. 225-102-1;\n- we have verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the main risks associated with the activity of all the entities included in the scope of consolidation, including, where relevant and proportionate, the risks created by its business relationships, products or services, as well as policies, actions and results, including key performance indicators relating to the main risks;\n- we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews in order to:\n\t- assess the process used to select and validate the main risks, as well as the consistency of the results, including the key performance indicators selected, in relation to the main risks and policies presented, and\n\t- corroborate the qualitative details (actions and results) we considered most important, as presented in Notes 1.

EXECUTIVE BOARD**\n\n#### Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nAfter celebrating the Group's 50th anniversary, we have entered a new decade by reaffirming our **values** (*Simplicity, Reliability, Collaboration and Performance*), pushing forward our **mission** (*AKWEL manufactures reliable, eco-friendly and competitive products to help its customers offer more environmentally friendly vehicles*) and adopting a **vision** (*AKWEL wants to be a trusted third party recognized by its customers and shareholders, thanks to the pride and autonomy of its teams*), in order to affirm our identity and share it with all our stakeholders.\n\nFor AKWEL in general, and for its teams in particular, 2023 has once again been a complicated year in terms of maintaining an acceptable financial situation in a highly inflationary environment and protecting our fundamentals: the security of our teams and tools, the satisfaction of our customers and the effort to bring about change that the market demands of us. I would therefore like to thank all those who have worked so hard throughout the year, who have committed themselves to the Group's present and future, and who have put their skills into action, as there have been some excellent achievements as a result. We have had to face problems that we have solved, but which have underscored our limitations and our need to improve time and time again, in an increasingly complex and unpredictable environment.\n\nIn a rapidly evolving, unstable and challenging automotive and truck market, new players are positioning themselves. The demand for us to stand out from our competitors continues to rise, with ever-increasing competition to renew sales. All this drives us to reinvent ourselves, to imagine new actions to be taken, to invest for the future, to incorporate new expertise, and to innovate.\n\nIn 2024, we will be introducing new key initiatives such as the AKWEL Academy to bolster the skills and commitment of our employees and managers. We will continue our efforts to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, particularly in relation to Scope 3, by working with our suppliers to achieve our targets. Our business will become ISO 27001 and Tisax certified to demonstrate the soundness of our IT and cybersecurity policy. We will increase our use of green electricity to replace fossil fuels and move closer to the end of fuel consumption. We will reduce our water consumption and integrate more green materials into our products. We will continue our remanufacturing and repair projects for our most complex products, so that they can be given a second life. And to keep pace with market trends and new product needs, we will continue to develop our industrial facilities and production resources by opening new plants and possibly restructuring.\n\nWe will continue our efforts to adapt in the face of new market demands in such a fast-changing environment, with the motto \"Between possible and impossible, there are only two letters' difference and a state of mind.\"\n\n> Mathieu Coutier President of the Executive Board\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>**ADMINISTRATION, MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION**\n\n| André Coutier                                              | President of the Supervisory Board      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Nicolas Job                                                | Vice-President of the Supervisory Board |\n| Geneviève Coutier                                          | Member                                  |\n| Émilie Coutier                                             | Member                                  |\n| COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT<br>represented by Christophe Coutier | Member                                  |\n| Guillaume Wesolowski (*)                                   | Member                                  |\n| Anne Vignat Ducret                                         | Member                                  |\n\n# **1.

Presentation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts**\n\n#### **Accounting Standards**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the AKWEL Group (hereinafter the \"Group\") were prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.\n\nDuring the year, the Group adopted the mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations over the reporting period. These texts had a limited impact on the Group's net income and financial position.\n\n### **1.1. Significant Events during the Reporting Period**\n\n### **1.1.1. Vigorous Growth in Europe**\n\nIn an automotive production market up by 5.7% in 2023, the Group posted turnover of €1,066.4 million, an increase of +7.7% as reported compared to the previous year. This is a return to a level close to that of 2019, the last year before the health crisis and the global market downturn. On a like-for-like basis with constant exchange rates, the increase in annual turnover was +9.6%. Growth was particularly noticeable in France and Europe, while North America's figures were slightly down. The most dynamic product lines were cooling, fuel and decontamination, thanks in particular to the successful repositioning on gas and hybrid vehicles. The Group's top three customers (Stellantis, Ford and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi) accounted for 73.1% of its business, compared to 65.9% in 2022 (on a like-for-like basis). Overall, the Group's top ten customers accounted for 88.2% of its turnover (87.9% in 2021). The Group's two largest markets in terms of sales were France and the United States.\n\n# **1.1.2. Highlights of Financial Year 2023**\n\nDuring the past financial year, significant operations and events in terms of scope or organization were as follows:\n\n- Decision to close the Gournay plant;\n- The gradual impact on our customers of price increases for raw materials and other costs.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.2. Analysis of the Consolidated Annual Accounts**\n\nThe consolidated key figures for financial year 2023 were as follows:\n\n| (in thousands of euro)   | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022<br>(restated)* |\n|--------------------------|------------|---------------------------|\n| Turnover excl. tax       | 1,066.4    | 989.5                     |\n| Current operating income | 61.0       | 37.2                      |\n| Operating income         | 49.3       | 36.3                      |\n| Net income, Group share  | 35.7       | 25.3                      |\n| Cash flow                | 84.7       | 46.9                      |\n\n(\\*) The 2022 annual accounts have been restated (*see consolidated annual accounts, not[e 1.3.1.1](#page-173-0)*).\n\nThe value-added ratio rose to 38.0% of turnover, compared to 36.1% in 2022. This improved performance is due to higher sales prices, which partially offset increases in material costs.\n\nPersonnel costs, including those for temporary staff and any employee profit-sharing, amounted to €298.4 million, up 9.7% compared to the previous financial year. This increase was mainly due to wage inflation.\n\nEBITDA amounted to €101.9 million, up 26.1% compared to the previous financial year. At 9.6% of turnover, EBITDA for 2023 was 1.4 points higher than that of 2022.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to €38.6 million, compared to €40.5 million in 2022.\n\nNet allocations to provisions amounted to €(2.3) million, compared to €(3.1) million in 2022.\n\nCurrent operating income stood at €61.0 million, up 64.1% compared to the previous financial year. At 5.7% of turnover, profitability for financial year 2023 saw a net increase on the previous year (3.8%).\n\nOther revenue and non-current expenses amounted to €(11.8) million, compared to €(0.9) million in 2022. The recognition of restructuring costs for €9.2 million, linked to the closure of the Gournay site, weighed heavily on financial year 2023.\n\nThe cost of net financial debt remained stable at €0.3 million.\n\nOther financial income and expenses represented an expense of €0.1 million, compared to an income of €2.1 million in 2022.\n\nThe income tax expense amounted to €13.0 million, the same as in 2022.\n\n#### **1.3. Analysis of the Group's Financial Position, Particularly Its Debt Position**\n\nNet income, Group share amounted to €35.5 million, compared to €25.3 million in 2022 (restated figure). Net profitability stood at 3.3%, up from 2.5% in 2022.\n\nNet cash, including lease obligations, amounted to €105.0 million, compared to €113.7 million in 2022. Gross cash amounted to €151.5 million, compared to €166.5 million in 2022.\n\n#### **1.4. Investment Policy**\n\nShareholders' equity stood at €610.3 million, compared to €593.3 million (restated) the previous financial year. This accounted for 69.1% of the balance sheet total (and over 83% excluding cash and cash equivalents).\n\nNon-financial investments amounted to €59.3 million, compared to €33.2 million the previous financial year.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>**1.5. Significant Events since the Financial Year-End and the Date of Preparation of the Management Report**\n\nNo significant events have occurred since the financial year-end and the date of preparation of the management report.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>**1.6. Foreseeable Trends and Future Prospects**\n\nFinancial year 2024 should continue along the same lines as 2023, with stable automotive production in the European and North American markets. The Group anticipates stable turnover and profitability compared to 2023.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-9-2\"></span>**1.7. Risk Factors**\n\nThe Group has reviewed the risks that could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial position, results, prospects or ability to achieve its objectives, and considers that there are no significant risks other than those presented.\n\nThe criticality of the risks presented has been assessed in terms of the likelihood of occurrence and the financial impact on the Group, taking into account the risk mitigation measures implemented by the Group (net risks).\n\nThe results are classified into four categories (major, high, moderate and low) and presented by theme in the remainder of this chapter.\n\nHowever, other risks may exist or arise of which the Group is unaware as at the date of this financial report, or the occurrence of which is not considered likely, as at such date, to have a material adverse impact on the Group, its business, financial position, results or prospects.\n\nThere are no risk factors specific to the Group; its main risks are inherent in a business that operates almost entirely in the automotive original equipment industry.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.7.1.

Details of the Group's Main Risks**\n\nThis section describes the main general risks facing the Group. The risk categories listed below are not presented in order of importance.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1. Operational Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.1. Risks related to dependence on the automotive industry and customers*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's turnover depends directly on the level of automotive production worldwide, particularly in Europe, North America, Türkiye and Asia. This production can be affected by the general economic situation, government programs (notably vehicle purchase incentives), trade agreements, regulatory changes, and social issues (including strikes and work stoppages).\n\nIn addition, the Group does 61% of its business directly with the two automakers Stellantis and Ford. The performance of these two manufacturers therefore has a considerable impact on the Group's revenue.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a major impact on the Group.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nA downturn in the automotive market, or a change in regulations, tariffs, taxes or other trade barriers or restrictions in the regions where the Group and its customers operate, could lead to a decline in the Group's results and/or the failure of some of its customers or suppliers, and affect its financial position.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThe Group operates in 20 countries. It also benefits from the diversification of its sales by region, customer, and vehicle make and model, which reduces its exposure to unfavorable trends in any one of its markets.\n\nThe Group is working to expand its customer portfolio.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.2. Supplier risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is dependent on its suppliers to manufacture the products it sells to its customers. Securing operations by managing supplier risks remains a major strategic challenge for the Group.\n\nAgainst the current backdrop of geopolitical, economic and regulatory tensions, operational risks (quality and logistics) are compounded by the risk of failure of suppliers weakened by successive crises and the global economic slowdown.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nAs the Group's production is partly dependent on its suppliers, this risk could have a negative impact on the Group's results, as it would be unable to deliver to customers products that meet their expectations in terms of quality and quantity.\n\nSuch a situation would have a negative short-term financial impact, with a drop in sales, as well as an unfavorable non-financial impact, with damage to the Group's reputation.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nFaced with the risks of shortages, supplier failures or supply chain disruptions, the Group has implemented a purchasing and supplier location strategy aimed at reducing the Group's dependence on a single supplier and/or country. As a result, the top direct supplier, the top five and the top ten respectively account for 4%, 18% and 28% of the Group's production purchases.\n\nThe integration of suppliers into the pool and the monitoring of supplier performance comply with current quality standards, in order to minimize the risks inherent in suppliers. Selection criteria include financial, quality, logistical, environmental, ethical, social, technical and logistical parameters, as well as dependence on the Group.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.3. Risk related to the development and launch of new products*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is subject to the risks inherent in the development and launch of new products. The Group may face issues related to project management, from design to industrialization, including the management of modifications after order intake.\n\nOwing to its international activities, the Group is also exposed to risks related to possible changes in legislation or regulations affecting its products in all or part of its markets, or in export control systems.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a high impact on the Group.\n\nFailure to deliver innovative solutions on time, or to meet changing standards, or to deliver products expected by customers on time, could damage the Group's reputation and affect its financial position.\n\nThe Group could also be subject to administrative and criminal sanctions, and customers and/or suppliers could temporarily or permanently suspend their activities.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nBefore acceptance, all new projects are subject to a standardized profitability analysis, with profitability and return on investment criteria set by the Executive Board. Once a project has been accepted, it is monitored from startup to series production, with milestones at which all financial and technical data are analyzed and corrected if necessary.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.4. Risks of cyber-attacks and information system failures*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe development, implementation and uninterrupted performance of the Group's hardware, network, website and other IT systems, including those that may be supplied by third parties, play an essential role in the Group's business, in particular purchasing and shipping management, production, customer order processing, plant performance monitoring, and new product design and development.\n\nThe Group is also dependent on its IT systems in the financial and administrative fields (invoicing, reporting, consolidation operations).\n\nRisks to information systems may take the form of attacks on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data and transactions processed by information systems (system malfunction, data theft, destruction or loss of data integrity).\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a high impact on the Group.\n\nThere are many sources of the disruptions likely to affect the Group's business, many of which are beyond the Group's control; notably:\n\n- loss of power and failure of telecommunication systems;\n- software and hardware errors, failures, defects or interruptions;\n- computer viruses and similar disruptive problems;\n- fires, floods and other natural disasters;\n- network attacks or damage to computer systems, software and other systems that are carried out by hackers or cybercriminals;\n- the performance of third-party suppliers.\n\nAny disruption or significant slowdown in the Group's information systems may:\n\n- result in the loss or delayed transmission of information, including data relating to customer orders and deliveries;\n- have a material adverse impact on the Group's business (delays in product delivery to customers), financial position and operating results, as well as on its reputation and image.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThe Group has implemented a series of safeguards, processes and regular analyses to mitigate the impact of a potential key system outage and to optimize its resilience:\n\n- incident monitoring;\n- backup and restoration of all application environments;\n- preventive maintenance plan;\n- business continuity plan.\n\nTo guard against cyber-attacks, cyber threats and cyber espionage, information systems security has been reinforced by the implementation of a security policy (ISSP), technical protection (firewalls, antivirus) and risk prevention through employee awareness-raising and training.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nAll the rules governing the use of information systems are set out in the Group's Charter for the proper use of IT resources, and applied by all users of the Group's information systems and technological tools.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.5. Risks related to dependence on new models*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nSupply contracts with automakers take the form of open orders for all or part of a vehicle model's equipment requirements, with no guarantee of volume. They are awarded separately for each vehicle function, and are generally valid for the life of the model.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a low impact on the Group.\n\nThe Group's turnover, results and financial position could be affected by the commercial failure of a model and/or by the fact that the Group is not selected for a new generation of models. In addition, in certain cases the manufacturer may reserve the right to change supplier at its own discretion during the life of the model.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThese risks are widespread, as the Group offers a wide range of products, installed or used on a large number of vehicle types.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.6. Risks related to changes in the technological environment*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's growth depends on its ability to anticipate technological and/or regulatory developments, and to adapt to profound changes and disruptions in the automotive market.\n\nThe automotive industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change.\n\nThe Group is currently in the process of adapting some of its products to meet the decarbonization objectives of the automotive market and to comply with current commitments and potential future requirements in terms of climate impact mitigation (no more registrations of new combustion-engine vehicles from 2035).\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a major impact on the Group.\n\nThe unanticipated acceleration of a technology on the market, or difficulties in the internal development of a new technology, would prevent the Group from seizing opportunities linked to technological breakthroughs, and could impact the Group's competitive positioning, growth and profitability.\n\nThere could be a material adverse impact on the Group's business, operating results and financial position if it is unable to offer its customers products that allow them to participate in the electrification of vehicles, while ensuring that its products remain competitive and affordable to customers.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\n<span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>In order to prevent the occurrence or limit the impact of such risks, the Group implements the following measures in particular: technology monitoring to regularly keep up-to-date on the latest technologies and their marketing;\n\n- identifying different product developments and trends, particularly in electric vehicles, and the opportunities that the Group may have with them;\n- investing in research and innovation.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *1.7.2.2. Financial and Market Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.1. Interest rate risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's activities could be affected by changes in interest rates. In the normal course of its business, the Group raises funds on the markets and also makes use of bank loans.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThe Group's net income may be influenced by changes in interest rates, insofar as these have a direct impact on the cost of debt.\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThe Group has little exposure to interest rate risk as virtually all its debt is at fixed rates.\n\nA one-point change in benchmark indexes would have an impact of less than €350 thousand on the amount of financial interest paid.\n\n<span id=\"page-14-0\"></span>Therefore, no interest rate hedges have been set up.\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.2. Foreign exchange risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nAs it operates in an international context, the Group may be subject to \"operational currency risk,\" due to the location of some of its production sites and to the purchase or sale of materials and components, or the sale of production from these sites, in currencies other than the functional currencies of entities carrying out transnational operations.\n\nIn addition, the financing requirements of foreign subsidiaries outside the euro area, covered by intra-Group loans, expose certain Group entities to \"financial exchange risk\" (risk arising from changes in the value of financial debts or receivables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the borrowing or lending entity).\n\nLastly, the Group is subject to translation risk arising from the contribution of subsidiaries whose operating currency is not the euro to the Group's consolidated income. The sales, income and cash of these subsidiaries, when translated into euro, are sensitive to variations in the exchange rate of their reporting currency against the euro.\n\nThe main currencies used are the euro (39.9% of business) and the US dollar (30.2% of business).\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nIn order to minimize the impact of exchange rates, the Group makes purchases in the operating currencies of each entity whenever possible, and stipulates an exchange rate pass-through in its contracts with customers. Where this is not the case, exchange rate impacts are the subject of commercial discussions, which generally result in the majority of the differences being passed on to its sales prices.\n\nTherefore, no currency hedges have been set up.\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.3. Liquidity risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nAt all times, the Group must have sufficient financial resources to finance its day-to-day business and the investments required for its development, as well as to deal with any exceptional events.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk arises mainly from its obligations to repay its existing debt, finance its future needs and comply with its financial ratios.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nIn order to manage its liquidity risk, the Group relies on the funds at its disposal. It can also tap into the capital markets through, on the one hand, long-term resources to secure all its net debt over a long period (medium-term credit lines) and, on the other hand, short-term financial instruments (account discounts, authorized overdrafts).\n\nThe share of medium-term loans granted to the Group, subject to compliance with financial covenants since 2014, accounts for almost all medium-term debt. Ratios are calculated mainly on the basis of the annual consolidated annual accounts.\n\nOver the past 15 years, these covenants have always been respected. In addition, AKWEL's cash position is monitored on a daily basis, and that of its subsidiaries is monitored on a monthly basis.\n\nAs current assets far exceed current liabilities, no information is provided on maturities of less than one year.\n\nThe Group believes that it is in a position to meet its future maturities.\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.4. Risks related to the prices of raw materials and components*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's business requires the purchase of significant quantities of raw materials, which are highly vulnerable to financial, geopolitical and climatic risks. Inflation, shortages, and procurement management, which have been priorities since 2020, seem to be showing signs of easing, but the situation remains fragile due to recent geopolitical events (Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Red Sea crisis, Ukraine). The main raw materials used by the Group are plastics, rubber, elastomers and steel, plus electronic components subject to long lead times.\n\nThe components that the Group purchases are also largely subject to the same risks as those observed for raw materials.\n\n2023 also saw significant increases in transport costs, as a result of difficulties linked to the geopolitical context. In addition, CSR and sustainability issues have become more and more prevalent through regulations, which generate additional costs for purchasing as a whole.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nAs price fluctuations are volatile, uncertain and unpredictable, they cannot always be passed on in full to the customer. In addition, the Group bears the majority of any additional costs arising from circumstantial operational difficulties and/or from occasional supplier issues, as well as costs relating to long-term purchases.\n\nAs Group purchases account for over 50% of the Group's turnover, there is a considerable risk of a decline in the Group's operating margin if these additional costs are not taken into account by our customers.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nMost of the contracts signed with our customers do not provide for a mechanism that passes on all variations in our purchasing costs. Nevertheless, occasional negotiations with our customers allow us to minimize the impact on our operating margin, albeit with an average delay of six months and a negative impact on our WCR.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *1.7.2.2.5. Customer risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nGiven the economic context of the automotive sector, the Group cannot rule out the possibility that several of its customers may be unable to honor certain contracts, or find themselves in a difficult financial situation.\n\nPotential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nEvery month, the Finance Department publishes a statement of receivables outstanding and overdue by customer, as well as a summary statement of disputes by entity. Our finance and sales teams' high level of awareness of these issues has resulted in very few bad debts (see *[13](#page-197-0)*).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, late payments represented €5.7 million, or 0.5%, of consolidated turnover for the year.\n\n#### *1.7.2.3. Environmental Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.3.1. Environmental impact of sites and climate change*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's sector of activity is not a major source of harm against the natural environment, does not require significant use of the natural resources near the Group's operations, and has no significant impact on environmental quality.\n\nThe Group's business, in the various countries in which it is conducted, is subject to diverse and evolving environmental regulations requiring it to comply with increasingly strict environmental protection standards concerning emissions into the air and water, the use of hazardous substances and waste disposal.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nAs part of this approach, the Group has implemented an environmental policy based on the ISO 14001 standard. Plant general managers are responsible for managing and monitoring environmental risks, in coordination with the Manufacturing Performance VP.\n\n#### *1.7.2.4. Legal Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.4.1. Risks related to non-conformity of products sold*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is responsible for the safety and quality of the products it markets.\n\nDespite the internal procedures implemented to identify defective products, the Group cannot rule out all cases of manufacturing defects (non-compliance with specifications or the legitimate expectations of its customers), or even serious defects.\n\nIn such cases, the Group could be exposed to the risk of warranty or liability claims from its customers with regard to the products sold.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to the risk of liability claims in the event of damage caused by defects in the products and services sold.\n\nThis risk tends to be higher both in terms of frequency and cost, particularly with the volume effect linked to the pooling of products (platforms, partnerships between customers).\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a moderate impact on the Group.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more of these risks, and in particular any significant increase in product returns, could adversely affect the Group's business, results, financial position, development, prospects and image.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nTo protect itself against this risk, the Group has taken out a third-party liability insurance policy covering the financial consequences of such claims. However, the Group's liability toward its customers is usually unlimited, whereas insurance coverage is systematically capped. There is therefore a theoretical residual risk.\n\nIn addition, a reasonable provision has been made for current risks.\n\n#### *1.7.2.4.2. Intellectual property risks (patents and trademarks)*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group holds numerous patents and trademarks.\n\nInfringement, whether intentional or unintentional, is a risk to which the Group is exposed in terms of intellectual property.\n\nIt may entail:\n\n- third parties counterfeiting industrial products patented by the Group;\n- unintentional acts on the part of the Group, given the length of time it takes third parties to publish patent applications.\n\nFinally, the Group also faces the risk of its trademarks being infringed.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nWherever possible, and whenever the technological stakes so justify, the Group's industrial know-how and innovations are patented in order to protect industrial property.\n\nThe geographical scope and duration of protection are in line with industry practice and adapted to the needs of the operating entities; they are systematically and regularly reviewed.\n\nWhere the risk of infringement exists, this approach is an effective legal weapon in the fight against it.\n\nThe Group steadfastly defends its rights against infringement, and these measures serve as a basis for initiating legal proceedings or taking action itself to stop and punish infringements of the Group's intellectual property rights.\n\nThe Innovation Department is responsible for managing the risk of unintentional active infringement.\n\nIn the event of active infringement, current developments or even products recently launched on the market could also be affected. The Group would be forced to increase the research and development costs for the project, or to negotiate rights of use for the patented component.\n\n#### *1.7.2.4.3. Business ethics and compliance*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is particularly attentive to the values of business ethics and compliance. Owing to its international presence, the Group may be impacted by legislation with a possible extraterritorial impact and extensive criminal risk.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nIf the Group were to be questioned on these issues, it could have a significant impact on its reputation — both on the financial markets and as an employer brand — and on its business and its financial position.\n\nThis risk could have a moderate impact on the Group.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nWith the Ethics Charter and the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct as its basis, the Group—via its General Management—is committed to promoting its values and ethical behavior, particularly with regard to the risks of corruption.\n\nThe Group's ethical commitments are therefore formalized and detailed in the Ethics Charter, which sets out the essential rules of conduct and ethics that apply to all employees and partners.\n\nTranslated into the Group's various languages, this Ethics Charter is given to each new employee and can be viewed on the Intranet.\n\nAll Group employees and managers are required to comply with the Ethics Charter, and to ensure that it is shared and respected by their colleagues.\n\nThe Group has a whistleblowing procedure, which was updated during the year following the entry into force of the Waserman Act of March 21, 2022.\n\n#### **1.8. Insurance and Risk Coverage**\n\nThe Group has taken out insurance policies with reputable, solvent insurance companies to cover the risks arising in the normal course of its business, at levels the Group deems appropriate in view of its size and the risks involved. All companies of which the Group has over 50% ownership, or for which the Group is responsible for insurance, are covered by these insurance policies.\n\nWhere necessary, these insurance policies are backed by local policies in all the countries in which they operate.\n\nAll Group insurance policies are negotiated and coordinated by the Group's Legal VP, who is responsible for identifying the Group's insurable risks, assessing their potential consequences for the Group, and designing and structuring appropriate insurance policies with the help of leading insurance brokers within international networks.\n\nThe Group's insurance policies are designed to cover the main risks that could affect its business, results or assets, providing the following coverage:\n\n- property damage and business interruption insurance;\n- operations and product liability insurance, with the exception of new claims concerning SCR tanks;\n- directors' and officers' liability insurance;\n- insurance covering specific risks (vehicle fleet, *auto-mission* cover [coverage of employees' personal vehicles when used for work], transport of goods, employee travel).\n\nThe Group's insurance policies contain exclusions, ceilings and deductibles that could expose it to adverse consequences should significant events occur or legal action be brought against it.\n\nIn addition, the Group may be required to indemnify third parties for damages not covered by its insurance policies, or it may incur significant expenses that may not be covered or be insufficiently covered, under its policies.\n\nSince January 1, 2023, the loss ratio and tougher market conditions have led to a sharp increase in premiums and in the deductibles applicable in the event of a recall.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>**1.9. Research and Development Activity**\n\nIn 2023, the Group continued to devote significant resources to Research and Development. Research and Development costs amounted to €62.6 million, or 5.9% of consolidated turnover, compared to €58.5 million in 2022.\n\nThese Research and Development costs have been recognized as an expense, as they do not meet all the criteria required by accounting standards for capitalization.\n\nThe Group benefited from a research tax credit of €0.9 million (€1.1 million in 2022).\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main areas of focus of our Research and Development activities are aimed at providing solutions to environmental issues, in particular:\n\n- the prevention and treatment of pollutant emissions;\n- reducing CO<sup>2</sup> emissions (by designing lighter parts, for example);\n- solutions compatible with biofuels or that meet the requirements of hybrid or electric vehicles;\n- eco-design and product recycling.\n\n# **2. Presentation of the Corporate Annual Accounts**\n\nThe corporate annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles applicable in France.\n\n#### **2.1. Group Position and Activity during the Year — Balance Sheet and income statement**\n\nTurnover amounted to €362.2 million, up 12% compared to the previous year. This increase in turnover is partly due to the growth in business (an approximately 12.5% increase in automotive production in Europe), but is also due to price increases for materials and energy purchases being passed on to sales prices.\n\nValue-added amounted to €92.3 million, up 24.4% compared to the previous year. It stood at 25.5% versus 22.9%. In 2022, value-added was negatively impacted by purchase price increases that could not be passed on to sales prices.\n\nTaxes amounted to €4.2 million, up 14.6% compared to the previous financial year, mainly due to an increase in nonrecoverable withholding taxes.\n\nPersonnel costs amounted to €58.4 million, down 3.3%. They accounted for 16.1% of turnover, compared to 18.7% in 2022, due to the adaptation of resources to business volumes.\n\nEBITDA amounted to €29.7 million, compared to €10.1 million the previous financial year. This level is a direct reflection of the costs and events described above. Depreciation and amortization amounted to €9.4 million, compared to €10.5 million in 2022. This trend is logical, given the reduction in investment levels over the past few financial years.\n\nNet allocations to (reversals of) provisions amounted to €(8.5) million, compared to €(0.6) million in 2022, impacted in particular by the announced closure of the Gournay site.\n\nIn view of the above, the operating result amounted to €11.5 million, compared to €(1.5) million in 2022.\n\nFinancial income (loss) stood at €(12.7) million, compared to €(8.0) million in 2022. The Company's financial expenses increased due to the rise in interest rates in 2023.\n\nExceptional items amounted to €0.6 million, thanks to net reversals of special depreciation allowances and regulated provisions.\n\nThe Company posted an income tax income of €0.5 million for the financial year, compared to €0.3 million the previous year. A research tax credit of €0.9 million was recognized (€1.1 million in 2022).\n\nTaking into account the above items, the Company's net income (loss) amounted to €(0.09) million.\n\n#### **2.2. Analysis of the Company's Financial Position, Particularly Its Debt Position**\n\nTotal assets stood at €454.1 million, compared to €446.0 million in 2022.\n\nAcquisitions of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (net of changes in assets under construction) amounted to €7.8 million, compared to €6.8 million the previous financial year. This trend reflects the resumption of capital expenditure in the current financial year.\n\nAcquisitions of financial assets amounted to €26.2 million, compared to €37.8 million the previous financial year, as the financial needs of the Company's subsidiaries increased.\n\nIn view of the above, the Company's net debt stood at €174.4 million, compared to €173.7 million in 2022. The sharp decrease in outstanding loans over the year should be noted, falling from €40.6 million to €34.5 million in 2023. This level of debt still seems very reasonable in relation to the Group's size, assets and profitability, especially as €172.0 million, or 99%, is intra-group financing (compared to €173.7 million in 2022).\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nShareholders' equity before the allocation of income amounted to €138.3 million, compared to €147.0 million the previous financial year. Shareholders' equity accounts for 30.5% of the balance sheet total. The objective remains to eventually exceed 50%.\n\n#### **2.3.

Income and Allocation**\n\nThe Ordinary General Meeting will be asked to approve the transactions reflected in the income statement and balance sheet submitted to it, and then to approve the allocation of the €(93,890.36) loss for the year.\n\nThis loss would be charged to retained earnings, which would be reduced from €79,778,839.63 to €79,684,949.27.\n\nIt is also proposed that a dividend of €8,022,312 be distributed among the shareholders, representing a gross dividend per share of €0.30.\n\nThis amount will be deducted in full from retained earnings, which will amount to €71,662,637.27 after such allocation.\n\nIt should be noted that this dividend is subject (unless the shareholder expressly requests otherwise, and provided it meets the criteria imposed by law) to the compulsory flat-rate withholding tax of 12.8%, imposed by Article 117 *quater*, as amended, of the French General Tax Code. The dividend is also subject to social security deductions at the rate of 17.2%.\n\nDividends are taxed either under the 30% flat-rate withholding tax system, which has already been deducted as indicated above, or, at the shareholder's option, under the income tax system after application, for natural persons domiciled in France for tax purposes, of the deduction provided for in Article 158, 3-2° of the French General Tax Code.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 243 *bis* of the French General Tax Code, we hereby inform you that the dividends distributed over the previous three financial years were as follows:\n\n| Financial Year Ended | Dividend per Share (in €) | Income Eligible or Ineligible for Tax Deduction |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2020    | 0.45                      | 40% deduction when applicable                   |\n| December 31, 2021    | 0.45                      | 40% deduction when applicable                   |\n| December 31, 2022    | 0.30                      | 40% deduction when applicable                   |\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 223 *quater* of the French General Tax Code, we ask you to approve the expenses and charges referred to in Article 39.4 of said Code, which amounted to €40,618 and resulted in a tax charge of €10,155 (at the rate of 25%).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.7.

Description of the Share Buyback Program**\n\nThis section describes the information that must be included in the description of the share buyback program pursuant to Article 241-2 of the General Regulations of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.\n\nAs the authorization granted by the Combined General Meeting of May 25, 2023 has been partially used, it is proposed that the Combined General Meeting of May 23, 2024 authorize a new Company share buyback program, the terms of which would be as follows:\n\n- securities concerned: AKWEL ordinary shares listed on Euronext Paris, compartment B, ISIN FR0000053027;\n- maximum purchase price: €50 per share;\n- the maximum amount of the transaction is therefore set at €123,863,000;\n- maximum share authorized for repurchase: 10% of the share capital, it being specified that this limit is assessed at the date of the buybacks in order to take into account any capital increases or reductions that may take place throughout the duration of the program.\n\nThe number of shares used to calculate this limit corresponds to the number of shares purchased.\n\nmaximum duration: 18 months from the date of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThese acquisitions may be made with a view to:\n\n- ensuring a liquid market for the Company's securities through an investment services provider, acting independently under a liquidity contract that complies with regulations;\n- retaining the shares repurchased and subsequently reissuing them in exchange for or as payment in connection with merger, demerger, provision or external growth operations;\n- potentially canceling some or all of the shares repurchased, under the conditions provided for by law;\n- implementing any market practice that may be permitted by regulations, and more generally carrying out any transaction that complies with the regulations in force, in which case the Company will inform its shareholders by means of a press release.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs the objective of retaining shares for subsequent reissue in connection with external growth transactions no longer qualifies as an accepted market practice under the new European regulations, it is not included in the draft resolution.\n\nDividends on shares will be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThese share purchases may be carried out by any means, including the acquisition of blocks of securities, and at the times deemed appropriate by the Executive Board.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to use options or derivatives in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\n#### **2.18.

Internal Control and Risk Management Procedures**\n\nIn accordance with Article 117 of Law 2003-706 of August 1, 2003 supplementing Article L. 225-68 of the French Commercial Code, this section of the report is descriptive and does not include an assessment.\n\n#### **3.1. Reminder of the Group's Objectives in Terms of Internal Control Procedures**\n\nThe Group's internal control procedures and organization are designed to:\n\n- ensure that management actions, the performance of operations and the behavior of employees are consistent with the guidelines set for the activities of the business by the management bodies, by applicable laws and regulations, and by the internal values, standards and rules of the business;\n- verify that the accounting, financial and management information provided to the Group's management bodies accurately reflects the activity and situation of the business.\n\nOne of the objectives of the Group's internal control system is to prevent and control risks arising from the Group's activities, as well as risks of error or fraud, particularly in the accounting and financial fields. Like any control system, however, it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that these risks have been totally eliminated.\n\nThe control and management of the risks associated with the Group's activities are based on the following principles:\n\n- a decentralized operational organization based on plants grouped by industrial region and on product lines in order to promote industrial performance, responsiveness and customer proximity;\n- an annual budget procedure and monthly reporting procedure that are essential for the Group in managing its operations;\n- widespread and frequent risk-awareness training for all personnel;\n- strong cross-functional departments responsible for enforcing Group policies within their scope, and monitoring their effective application;\n- plants specialized by production technology, to reinforce and accelerate experience curves;\n- formal delegation by the President of the Executive Board of the control and management of certain risks to the Directors most concerned;\n- separation of functions (between operational and support functions, between those who incur expenses and those who record and settle them, between those who do and those who control, etc.);\n- setting targets in line with global or internal best practices, and regularly measuring the gap between performance and these targets;\n- the involvement of all hierarchical levels and all sites in improving performance and controlling activities.\n\nIn addition, Group employees are made aware of their ethical obligations through the welcome booklet, the Ethics Charter, the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, the Stock Market Code of Ethics, and the Group IT Charter.\n\nIn addition, each site has its own rules of procedure, which are widely distributed to all employees.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **3.2. Analysis of the Internal Control Environment**\n\n#### **3.2.1. Summary Description of the General Organization of Internal Control Procedures**\n\nThe President of the Executive Board delegates some of his powers to the various Directors.\n\nProcedures are established by the Group. The Group distinguishes between two categories of procedures: those relating to a function (e.g. financial procedures) and those relating to a process (delivery, handling of nonconformities, etc.). There are 11 processes that have been identified within the Group (five customer-oriented processes and six support or management processes). They cover all the Group's activities (from promoting the Group to new customers to improving the performance of our suppliers). There are 33 mandatory indicators (21 performance indicators and 12 efficiency indicators) that cover these 11 processes, allowing us to verify that these operating procedures have been properly implemented and are performing well.\n\nThese procedures are available on an Intranet-type network, allowing them to be shared immediately to all those concerned.\n\nInternal Group memos may supplement, detail or reiterate these procedures.\n\nThe cross-functional departments manage the organizational processes and ensure that they are properly implemented. At least once a year, they are required to report to the Executive Board on the results achieved within their scope.\n\nThe Quality, Safety, Environment and Energy Department (QSE²) ensures that these procedures are properly applied, by monitoring periodic reporting and carrying out internal audits.\n\nThe Finance Department ensures that accounting and financial standards are properly applied.\n\nThe Internal Audit function ensures compliance with directives, methodologies and any other instructions issued by operational or cross-functional departments. It reports directly to the Legal Department.\n\nIn addition, each Group site has its own health, safety and working conditions committee. Each committee meets regularly to assess, propose and approve all measures relating to health, safety, working conditions and risk prevention.\n\nEach year, the Executive Board devotes at least two half-days to each cross-functional department and industrial region:\n\n- one to approve strategic options (Products, Markets, Customers, Action Plans) within the framework of Medium-Term Plans;\n- one to approve short-term financial options within the framework of budgets and year-end forecasts.\n\nFor all product lines, the Management Board devotes one day each year to reviewing and approving Research and Innovation activities (Product and/or Process).\n\nIn addition, since 2008, a specific half-day meeting has been held for each region. This meeting is dedicated to reviewing the main productivity actions implemented and those planned over the next 12 months.\n\n#### **3.2.2. Summary Description of Accounting and Financial Information Processing**\n\nAccounting and financial information processing is handled internally by the Finance Department.\n\nAccounting teams are either located at production sites or grouped together in Shared Services Centers (SSCs). The accounting teams, which are managed by the Director of Accounting & Tax, carry out three main activities:\n\n- customer relations (invoicing, collection, reminders, customer disputes)\n- supplier matters\n- general accounting and cash management.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe software used is an ERP (SAP). The accounting module (FI) benefits directly from these decisions. No significant specific developments have been carried out on this ERP.\n\nFinance Controllers are present at each of the Group's main sites. There is complete separation between the finance control and accounting teams, even though information is exchanged on an ongoing basis.\n\nReference manuals are used to prepare:\n\n- the annual accounts (general chart of accounts);\n- the consolidated financial statements;\n- the monthly internal financial reports.\n\nThe financial data provided are regularly verified by Group personnel.\n\nIn addition, our Statutory Auditors carry out an annual audit of the annual accounts as part of its legal audit obligation.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4. Non-Financial Performance Statement**\n\nIn accordance with Articles L. 225-102-5 and R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, the Company is required to produce a Non-Financial Performance Statement (NFPS) for the Group. The Non-Financial Performance Statement details the challenges, implemented approaches and indicators that the Group has decided to follow in order to monitor and control how its positive and negative impacts unfold. This statement is subject to mandatory verification by an independent third-party organization.\n\n#### **4.1. The Group's Business Model**\n\nImage /page/32/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram outlining Akwel's strategic axes, ecosystem, and value creation approach. The diagram is divided into three main sections: Ecosystem, 5 Strategic Axes, and Value Creation.

Our History**\n\n#### **4.2.10. The Group's Role in the Mobility of the Future**\n\nIn an automotive market in the midst of a complete revolution, with the automaker ecosystem undergoing profound transformation and new types of vehicles emerging, the Group is doing its utmost to adapt its strategy and continue offering its customers the innovative solutions that will help them stand out in this shifting environment.\n\nVisit our virtual and experiential museum [https://www.akwel.com/en](http://www.akwel.com/)\n\nThe automotive market is currently facing major disruptions in the medium-term. The development of totally redesigned vehicles, combining different forms of engine power, a variety of fuel and battery ranges, and diverse configurations and uses, are at the forefront of these challenges.\n\nThe globalization of customers and projects, the localization of production, the inflow of new stakeholders, and increasing demand for environmental protection and risk management complete this scenario. In this context, some products will evolve, while others will disappear, to be replaced by new products and solutions. On the other hand, the need for high-performance parts manufacturers who are able to combine quality, competitiveness, globalized projects and localized production will only increase for automakers.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4.2.11. Our Know-How and Expertise Rewarded**\n\nEvery year, our customers reward the know-how and expertise of our Akwelis\\* for the quality of our parts and our continuous improvement system. We are also recognized as a supplier of excellence.\n\nOur policies and action plans are fueled by our culture of continuous improvement. They are embodied in our AKWEL Management System, which integrates quality, personal safety, information security, the environment and energy. Developed and rolled out within the Group, the AKWEL Management System brings together our best practices and tools in a single system that applies to all our teams in their day-to-day actions. Nurtured by the Group's values, it ensures that we achieve the standard level of performance and comply with the legal requirements, standards and regulations in force at our customers' sites and with local authorities. It is regularly audited, both internally and externally, in order to verify its implementation and improve it.\n\nImage /page/40/Picture/4 description: The image shows three different scenes.

Scopes 1 and 2 are consolidated, and the reference year for the Group is 2021.\n\nSince 2021, our consolidation tool has also allowed us to track Scope 3, concerning upstream activities related to the purchase of goods and services. We mainly track our consumption of plastics (process and packaging), rubber and metal. Although our current methodology is not based on specific emissions factors, our assessments show that Scope 3 is the largest contributor in terms of tCO2e for the Group. The calculations will be refined in future studies with the contribution of our suppliers, and the scope of indirect emissions categories will be expanded.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4.3.5. Our \"AKWEL being\" Commitment**\n\nReady to take on the challenge of sustainable development and the energy transition, AKWEL is a socially responsible company (in line with CSR requirements) that is committed to a secure future.

Waste recycling and recovery increased from 83.9% in 2021 to 85.7% in 2023.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n| OBJECTIVES                   | ACTIONS                                                                                                                  | KPI                             | QUANTIFIED<br>TARGETS FOR<br>2028                     | SDG                   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Reduce CO2<br>emissions      | Formalize the supply of green electricity<br>by country and plant                                                        | % of green<br>electricity/total | 70%<br>(consolidated for<br>the Group)                | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n|                              | Install solar panels to generate electricity<br>at plants                                                                | % of green<br>electricity/total | 5% of Group<br>consumption                            | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n|                              | Reduce electricity consumption per gross<br>production margin**                                                          | KWH of<br>electricity/GPM2      | See Group<br>energy intensity<br>and CO2<br>emissions | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n|                              | Reduce natural gas consumption per<br>gross production margin**                                                          | KWH of gas/GPM2                 |                                                       | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n|                              | Develop an electric alternative to gas<br>boilers for rubber-processing plants*                                          | KWH of gas/GPM2                 | -50% boilers1                                         | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n|                              | Eliminate processes that consume<br>industrial fuel                                                                      | KWH of fuel/GPM2                | 01                                                    | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n|                              | Reduce CO2 emissions through the<br>electricity and natural gas energy mix**                                             | Metric tons of<br>CO2/GPM2      | -40%1                                                 | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n| Reduce water<br>consumption  | Reduce water consumption by upgrading<br>cooling circuits in rubber-processing<br>plants                                 | m3/GPM2                         | -20%1                                                 | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n| Reduce waste<br>production   | Reduce waste production (product<br>standardization and reduction in the number<br>of production startups and scraps)*** | Metric tons/GPM2                | -15%1                                                 | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n| Recycle and<br>recover waste | Increase the recycling and recovery rate<br>for non-metal waste: plastic and rubber                                      | % of production<br>waste        | 95%1                                                  | Image: SDG 13, SDG 12 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Compared to 2021\n\n<sup>2</sup>Gross production margin\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Implementation times depend on countries' ability to supply green electricity from nuclear, solar and wind power and others. We specifically monitor green energy strategies for the following countries: Czech Republic, Türkiye, Morocco, Tunisia, India, China, Portugal, Romania, USA, Thailand.\n\n<sup>\\*\\*</sup>The reduction in electricity consumption per €K of gross production margin could be impacted by reduced use of natural gas for certain processes, in favor of processes using electricity.\n\n<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup>The development of an electric alternative to gas boilers should lead to an improvement in the plant's emission factor. The development of products for electric vehicle cooling hoses (using plastics instead of rubber) will help reduce natural gas consumption, as the forming processes use electric furnaces.\n\n<sup>\\*\\*\\*\\*</sup>Standardization involves reducing the number of rubber hose structures. Reducing the number of startups has an impact on the production of startup scraps => economic production campaign. The reduction of production scraps is managed by plant action plans in the series phase (existing products) and in performance validation during production startup, from industrialization to ramp-up.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources used in AKWEL processes are essentially electricity, natural gas and water.\n\nWe take action with regard to two factors:\n\n- intrinsic equipment consumption;\n- activity-related consumption (in the sense of production volume).\n\n#### **Intrinsic Equipment Consumption**\n\nThe Group has defined equipment standards applicable to all plants. The fleet of plastic injection presses has been converted from hydraulic presses to electric or hybrid presses. All new investments (new projects or equipment renewal) are carried out based on AKWEL standards.\n\nAutoclaves (the equipment needed to vulcanize the rubber used in fluid transfer) come in three standard sizes to suit plant activity levels.\n\n#### **Activity-Related Consumption**\n\nTakt time can be taken into account as early as the product design and industrialization phase, allowing tooling to be sized as needed, with single-cavity tooling placed on a small press and continuous production (reduced production changeovers and energy consumption at production startup).\n\nBased on a philosophy of covering finished goods inventories (rather than just-in-time production), the Manufacturing Performance Department has introduced operating procedures and methods designed to make plant production more efficient. Finished goods inventories cushion fluctuations in customer demand and manufacturing contingencies.\n\nThe associated indicators relate resource consumption to gross production margin.\n\n**Between 2018 and 2023, electricity, gas and water consumption fell by -16%, -24% and -22% respectively, while waste production decreased by -19%.**\n\n#### *4.3.5.1.1. On-Site Waste Collection*\n\nAll sites have established contracts with waste collection providers, which include rules for sorting and recovery. Monthly monitoring and half-yearly consolidation are in place to track the quantities of waste generated and the proportion recycled and recovered.\n\n#### *4.3.5.1.2. Environmental Information*\n\nWe offer our customers innovative solutions and concepts designed to meet the challenges of environmental protection (lightweighting, decontamination) and energy efficiency (localized production, recycling).\n\nTo protect biodiversity and ecosystems, reducing our environmental impact and saving natural resources are an integral part of our activities. The various solutions and materials possible during development (use of sustainable resources, product recycling) are identified right from the product design phase.\n\nBy reducing transport and logistics operations that pollute and have an impact on climate change, our localized production strategy helps reducing the overall environmental and energy footprint of our products.\n\nEach of our facilities aims to act as a responsible manufacturer by reducing energy consumption, waste and scraps. Environmental and energy policies and objectives are adapted and defined locally, taking into account the specific features of each site.\n\nAll the Group's production sites are ISO 14001 certified. The Group sets quantified targets every year. These are defined for and adapted to each site. They are presented and approved during the QSE<sup>2</sup> Management Review of the entity concerned.\n\nThe information provided below covers all the Group's production sites.\n\nIn September 2022, the President of the Executive Board decided to expand the Group's monthly safety management committee to include environmental and energy issues.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Resource Consumption**\n\n| Consumption                       | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Water (m3<br>)                    | 720,482 | 782,102 |\n| Plastic materials (metric tons) * | 14,735  | 13,756  |\n| Metal materials (metric tons) *   | 21,960  | 17,477  |\n| Rubber materials (metric tons) *  | 18,534  | 22,208  |\n| Electricity (MWh)                 | 98,547  | 96,554  |\n| Gas (MWh)                         | 131,164 | 137,521 |\n| Fuel (MWh)                        | 2,842   | 3,103   |\n\n(\\*) Metric tons purchased in 2023 based on open orders.\n\n#### **Waste**\n\n| Waste                                        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Non-hazardous industrial waste (metric tons) | 21,237 | 15,767 |\n| Hazardous industrial waste (metric tons)     | 1,684  | 1,402  |\n| Waste recycling and recovery rate            | 85.7%  | 79%    |\n\nIn 2023, we observed an increase in the overall quantity of waste generated at our plants, in line with the growth in our business. This increase concerned plastic and metal, while our rubber consumption fell, which allowed us to improve our share of recycled or recovered waste.\n\nSince 2018, we have continued to reduce waste generation. The circular economy is part of the Group's strategy and will be one of the levers for improving the rate of recycled/recovered waste.\n\n#### **Climate Change: Greenhouse Gas Emissions — Adapting to the Consequences of Climate Change**\n\nFollowing the implementation of a tool to consolidate our carbon accounting in 2021 (using the GHG Protocol method), the Group was able to consolidate its accounting covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 under the Protocol. As the tool was optimized throughout 2021, it allowed us to obtain a relatively complete account for 2023 for the Group as a whole. This was comparable to 2021, with the exception of two administrative and sales offices, whose consumption is negligible at the Group level.\n\n| Carbon Accounting (in Metric Tons of CO2e) | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1: direct emissions                  | 28,258 | 28,743 |\n| Scope 2: indirect emissions                | 28,623 | 29,463 |\n| TOTAL                                      | 56,881 | 58,206 |\n\nTo best address the challenges associated with climate change, the Group uses 2021 data to bolster its environmental strategy.\n\nScope 1 emissions have decreased thanks to lower natural gas consumption. Scope 2 emissions have fallen mainly thanks to changes in country emission factors, in line with the Group's energy production mix. In the course of 2022, energy-saving action plans have been initiated at each of our sites.\n\nThe Group has an ISO 50001-certified energy management approach at six French sites (Beaurepaire, Champfromier, Monteux, Nesle, Romans and Vieux-Thann), with the aim of optimizing energy performance and reducing GHG emissions.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nSince January 2022, we have been committed to developing the use of green energy, particularly for electricity.\n\nIn 2023, Scope 3 for 2022 was consolidated for the France scope using the spend-based method. Although this method has a high error rate, it has allowed us to confirm that this scope represents the majority of the Group's emissions, accounting for 90% of total emissions.\n\nThe emission factor taken into account by each plant is based on the energy source used. For electricity, this factor depends on the method of production (nuclear, wind, solar, hydro, coal, etc.).\n\nIn 2023, our electricity supply contracts changed to use green sources. They are 100% green at our plants in Mexico and China, and at our new facility in Bulgaria. We are continuing this formalization process for other countries. Some countries (Sweden and France) already have low emission factors.\n\nIn addition, we are working on the installation of solar panels on the canopies of our plant parking lots, an initiative that could generate 10– 15% of our electricity consumption.\n\nIn 2023, some sites (Juarez and Ixtac in Mexico) began installing solar panels in their parking lots.\n\nNatural gas is the Group's other major energy source. Our switch from rubber products to thermoplastics has allowed us to use more green electricity, to the detriment of natural gas, whose emission factor does not change by its very nature.\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/8 description: This aerial shot captures a large, light-colored industrial building with a metallic roof, adjacent to a parking area covered with solar panels. The solar panels are arranged in multiple rows, providing shade for the parked vehicles below. To the right of the parking area, there are stacks of dark-colored pipes or cylindrical objects, possibly for industrial use. The surrounding ground is mostly dirt and gravel, with some sparse vegetation visible. The overall scene suggests a combination of industrial activity and renewable energy use.\n\n*Juarez site (Mexico)*\n\n#### **Energy-Saving Measures**\n\nAt the end of 2022, it was decided to standardize the continuous improvement plan for energy savings at all sites:\n\n- appointment of an energy specialist at all sites;\n- implementation of regular energy rounds and handling of discrepancies;\n- monitoring and analysis of energy consumption;\n- four posters on energy-saving best practices were distributed to raise awareness among Akwelis<sup>\\*</sup>;\n- nine priorities have been defined to structure the continuous improvement plan:\n\t- lighting,\n\t- heating and air conditioning,\n\t- processes,\n\t- organization,\n\t- behavior,\n\t- controls,\n\t- communication,\n\t- green energy,\n\t- fossil energy.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup>AKWEL employees\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Biodiversity Protection: Measures Taken to Preserve or Restore Biodiversity**\n\nNone of the Group's sites is located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. Their sites' activities have a limited impact on the surrounding natural environments. These environments are assessed through risk analyses carried out by each entity.\n\nThe Group collects and/or treats all waste that may have an impact on biodiversity.\n\n#### **Noise and Odor Pollution**\n\nIn accordance with applicable local regulations, our sites regularly measure noise emissions outside their plants. These emissions are assessed as part of each entity's risk analysis.\n\nOdor pollution is not considered significant in the Group's business, as the manufacturing activities of the Group companies concerned do not generally generate odors. The Group is not aware of any complaints on this subject.\n\n#### **Organization in Place to Deal with Pollution Accidents with Environmental Consequences**\n\nBased on risk analyses carried out at each site, the associated emergency situations have been identified. In most cases, these involve the risk of spills, fire or explosion. For each emergency situation, the steps to be taken to react and the prevention methods are identified, listed and formalized in the security plan or another document. They are tested periodically, as far as possible, on all personnel.\n\nIn addition, the QSE<sup>2</sup> Operational Control procedure has reinforced the following obligations:\n\n- identifying risk management approaches in the security plan for those risks that could halt the customer's delivery (including fire, serious pollution of the natural environment, flooding, etc.);\n- prohibiting smoking;\n- using a prevention plan for dangerous work and a fire permit;\n- having retention tanks under all storage facilities for liquid pollutants;\n- having spill kits in the event of pollutant spills at various points in the plant, and resins on the ground in most production areas;\n- having fire-fighting teams;\n- verifying the implementation of these \"instructions\" by carrying out LPAs.\n\nIn 2022, the French sites (Champfromier, Vieux-Thann, Romans, Beaurepaire, Gournay, Monteux, Villieux, Condé, Vannes) underwent an audit on the management of industrial plastic granules and obtained their certificate of conformity, published on the Group's website. By the end of 2022, all the instructions and protective measures that made it possible to obtain these certificates were rolled out at all AKWEL sites that use industrial plastic granules.\n\n#### **Expenses Incurred to Prevent the Environmental Consequences of the Group's Activities**\n\n| (in thousands of euro)                      | 2023   | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Investments to prevent environmental impact | 14,100 | 4,245 |\n\nAs of 2019, various investments have been made to establish wastewater treatment centers in order to clean wastewater before discharging it into local networks. Replacing or purchasing equipment offers more energy efficiency, but also entails various waste management costs (treatment, storage).\n\nAt the same time, production sites have also incurred expenses to better optimize their energy consumption, either by carrying out studies to classify their energy performance and identify areas for improvement, or by financing installations following these studies (installation of new LED lighting, installation of new leakage containment equipment, purchase of waste recycling and sorting equipment).\n\nIn 2023, €14,100 thousand was invested, including €8,400 thousand in electric injection presses and €5,600 thousand in extrusion lines for electric vehicle cooling hoses.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Environmental and Energy Assessment and Certification Procedures**\n\nThe Group has an integrated management system covering Quality, Safety, Environment, Energy and Information Security.\n\nThe QSE<sup>2</sup> Department conducts internal audits of the management system at all Group entities (product lines, production sites and cross-functional departments).\n\nThird-party audits of the management system are carried out by an independent certification body, Bureau Veritas, with:\n\n- IATF 16949 and ISO 9001: certification of all our production sites and product lines, with the exception of the Bressolles site, which is certified to ISO 9001 only;\n- ISO 14001: Certification of all our production sites and product lines, with the exception of the Bressolles site;\n- ISO 50001: six French sites (Beaurepaire, Champfromier, Nesle, Monteux, Romans, Vieux-Thann);\n- ISO 27001: in 2024, certification of the Head Office and TISAX assessment for six international sites.\n\n#### **Training and Informing Employees about the Environment**\n\nAs part of the management system, raising awareness of environmental and energy consumption issues among all on-site personnel is an integral part of the Group's practices and operating methods.\n\n#### *4.3.5.1.3. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Remuneration Committee*\n\nAt its meeting on February 10, 2022, the Group's Supervisory Board decided to expand the scope of responsibility of the Remuneration Committee to include issues of Corporate, Environmental and Social Responsibility, and to change its name to reflect these new responsibilities. The first meeting of the CSR and Remuneration Committee was held on March 25, 2022.\n\nThe composition, performance and duties of the CSR and Remuneration Committee are presented in Section *2.3.1.2. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Remuneration Committee*, of the 2023 Annual Report.\n\nA Group management committee for health, the safety of people and tools, the environment and energy meets every month under the chairmanship of the President of the Executive Board and the guidance of the QSE<sup>2</sup> VP.\n\nA Group Human Resources Management committee meets every month under the chairmanship of the President of the Executive Board and the guidance of the HR VP.\n\nThese committees assess performance and progress, and take any necessary decisions. Minutes are also drawn up at these meetings.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>*4.3.5.2. \"AKWEL being\" Eco-Innovative*\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/2 description: This image shows a man with short brown hair and blue eyes.

The Eco-Design Approach*\n\nAn eco-design approach has been in place since 2018 and applies to all products designed or modified by the Group. This eco-design approach is part of a sustainable development approach, allowing the environmental impacts of parts designed by the Group to be taken into account throughout the life cycle of these products.\n\n- increase product lifespan;\n- minimize the impact of raw materials;\n- reduce energy consumption;\n- integrate manufacturing constraints;\n- reduce the impact of transport;\n- take action on use;\n- consider the product's end-of-life right from the design stage.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/55/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of an eco-conception approach. The diagram is a cycle with seven stages, each represented by a square with a number and an icon.

Bolster the safety of people and tools*\n\n<span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>In September 2021, the Group established the Group Safety Management Committee. It is chaired by the President of the Executive Board and led by the QSE<sup>2</sup> VP, who proposed the permanent members. This Committee may also call on occasional participants, depending on topics and needs.\n\nIn September 2022, the President of the Executive Board decided to include the issues of environment and energy in this Committee.\n\nIts aim is to oversee the safety of people and property, as well as environmental and energy issues, across the entire Group organization, rather than focusing solely on individual departments or processes. The Committee decides on the working groups to be established in order for the Group to make headway, and if necessary approves the conclusions, actions and decisions proposed. Depending on the topic, cross-functional, multi-disciplinary or departmental working groups deal with the issues at hand. The Committee meets once a month and follows a standard agenda (presentation of results; analysis of significant events; monitoring of escalations; progress of working groups; approvals; decisions; COVID-19 updates; environment and energy).\n\nAll subjects (personal safety, IT security, tool safety, building security, environment, energy, etc.) are now integrated into this Committee.\n\nIn 2022, the following topics were discussed and the corresponding standards were gradually rolled out in 2023 and will continue into 2024:\n\n- development of a STOP WORK approach: all Group employees are responsible for stopping any situation deemed to be dangerous;\n- bolstering of the culture of safety: development of a welcome and awareness program for new hires and visitors, implementation of appropriate standard support;\n- identification of high-risk activities and definition of mandatory behavior and actions for all golden rules;\n- machine and manual control safety, interference with moving parts and/or powered parts: cross-disciplinary best practices meeting the most demanding standards, rollout;\n- structuring to comply with CDP and EcoVadis;\n- visual management and wearing of protective equipment.\n\nThe Group uses a standard digital safety register for all its entities. This register now allows for a dynamic scorecard to be updated every week, noting any accidents with lost time, accidents without lost time and incidents, and for priority actions to be determined.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group obtained ISO 45001 certification for three sites in 2022: Orizaba (Mexico), Ixtac (Mexico) and Juarez (Mexico). This was a Group-wide approach, which is currently being expanded to all sites, based on our integrated management system. The certification process for the Ningbo site (China) began in 2023, with completion scheduled for early 2024. We plan to continue this process.\n\nIn addition, the IT department has established a structured organization and resources to strengthen its focus on cybersecurity and reduce risk. Monitoring and performance indicators have been implemented along with the appropriate actions. The Group is pursuing its ISO 27001 certification, which is expected to be obtained in early 2024.\n\nPlant safety: The Group is continuing its program to install sprinklers in plants not previously equipped with this fire protection system.\n\nWork is nearing completion on the Rayong (Thailand) and Champfromier (France) plants. The project for the Juarez (Mexico) plant has begun, while the project for the Orizaba (Mexico) plant has been postponed until 2024.\n\n#### **Safety and Working Conditions**\n\nHealth and safety is our priority and forms the foundation of all our processes; it is at the heart of everything we do, every single day. Everyone involved with the Group (employees, service providers, suppliers, etc.) must work in a safe and healthy environment. Our Occupational Health and Safety policy and its related objectives are adjusted depending on the location, taking into account the specific features of each site. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement in health and safety, we aim to achieve a lost-time accident frequency rate of less than 2.9 and a severity rate of 0.15 by 2028. Our ambition is to continue our trajectory toward a frequency rate of less than 1 and 0 accidents. In 2023, we had 55 lost-time accidents.\n\n| Work-Related Accidents, Including Frequency and Severity | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Frequency rate                                           | 2.55 | 4.09 |\n| Severity rate                                            | 0.12 | 0.14 |\n\nThe formula used for the frequency rate is the number of lost-time accidents divided by the number of hours worked and multiplied by 1,000,000. The severity rate corresponds to the number of days lost divided by the number of hours worked and multiplied by 1,000.\n\n#### *4.3.5.4.2. Bolster IT security*\n\nInformation security is also one of the Group's top concerns.\n\nInitiated in 2021, structural projects have been implemented to secure our IT facilities: data protection (firewall), a new cyber-defense service, a new database linking users and IT resources, and the overhaul of business continuity plans.\n\nIn 2022, the IT department established a structured organization and resources to strengthen its focus on cybersecurity and reduce risk. Monitoring and performance indicators have been implemented along with the appropriate actions.\n\nLaunched in 2023, the ISO 27001 certification project defines and implements the information management system integrated into our global management system. Information system access management and traceability projects are currently being rolled out. We have launched new projects to supplement our security coverage, with an information system monitoring tool that collects and analyzes events in order to detect suspicious activity, a tool to secure our mobile fleet, and the planning of penetration tests on our information system by a third-party company.\n\nWe have created a dedicated IT security team and recruited cybersecurity administrators.\n\nTo meet the expectations of our customers, we have further developed our rollout strategy. The ISO 27001 standard will be certified at the Head Office level, and the TISAX label will be rolled out at the site level.\n\nThe awareness-raising and communication plan that has been defined is currently being implemented.\n\nBy 2024, our Head Office will be ISO 27001 certified, and we will have six TISAX-certified sites: Ixtac and Orizaba (Mexico), Ningbo (China), Stara Zagora (Bulgaria), Rudnik (Czech Republic) and Timisoara (Romania). Eventually, all our sites will be certified.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>*4.3.5.5. \"AKWEL being\" Socially engaged*\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/2 description: The image shows a circular diagram with four stylized human figures arranged in a circle.

Corporate Information*\n\nOur employees are key to AKWEL's success. Tailoring the workforce and employee autonomy development (skills and engagement) to the Group's values and vision is essential.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n*4.3.5.5.2.1. Workforce and Skills Management*\n\nIn 2023, the Group's workforce and skills management policy addressed two of AKWEL's major challenges:\n\n- adapting our workforce to ensure the economic balance of our activities;\n- developing our technical skills and support in order to improve the quality and performance of our products and services and maintain our development and innovation capacities.\n\nThe figures in the tables below are correct as at December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **Workforce**\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Group had 9,632 employees (on permanent and fixed-term contracts), representing an increase of 2.41% compared to 2022.\n\n| Workforce | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| Total     | 9,632 | 9,405 |\n\n#### **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Employees**\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, permanent staff represented 88.92% of total FTEs and non-permanent staff represented 11.08%.\n\n| FTE Employees                               | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Permanent (permanent contracts)             | 8,868 | 8,528 |\n| Non-permanent (fixed-term contracts, temps) | 1,105 | 1,135 |\n| Total                                       | 9,973 | 9,663 |\n\n#### **Breakdown of Workforce by Category**\n\n| Breakdown of Workforce by Category | 2023  | 2022  |\n|------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Executives                         | 521   | 512   |\n| Employees and technicians          | 3,489 | 3,397 |\n| Workers                            | 5,622 | 5,496 |\n| Total                              | 9,632 | 9,405 |\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Departures**\n\nIn 2023, the Group recorded 3,992 departures, made up of voluntary departures and departures for other reasons (3,066), as well as lay-offs and terminations (829). Voluntary departures from the Direct Labor force (2,648) accounted for 66.33% of departures, mainly in Mexico where the job market remains highly competitive.\n\n| Departures                              | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Lay-offs and terminations               | 829   | 920   |\n| Retirement                              | 97    | 64    |\n| Voluntary departures and other reasons* | 3,066 | 3,336 |\n| Total                                   | 3,992 | 4,320 |\n\n\\*\"Voluntary departures and other reasons\" include resignations, the end of fixed-term contracts, trial periods and deaths.\n\n| Permanent FTE Staff Departures | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Permanent staff                | 3,572  | 3,870  |\n| Total FTEs                     | 9,973  | 9,663  |\n| Departure rate in %            | 35.82% | 40.05% |\n\n#### **Recruitment**\n\nIn 2023, the Group recruited 4,219 new staff, mainly at sites in North America and Asia, and at other sites exposed to high-growth markets. AKWEL is committed to inclusion and diversity, creating a working environment where everyone — no matter their origin, identity or abilities — feels respected, valued and heard.\n\n| Recruitment | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------|-------|-------|\n| Total       | 4,219 | 4,064 |\n\n#### **Training**\n\nIn addition to maintaining our workforce of employees and technicians, we have made, and will continue to make, special efforts in the area of training. Training within the Group is a lever for developing the performance and professionalism of our teams. It allows us to keep pace with changes in our businesses and to adapt to new technological developments.\n\n| Training                                                                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Amounts dedicated to training (as a percentage of payroll)                   | 1.02%   | 0.85%   |\n| Workforce training rate (workforce trained/total workforce)                  | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Workforce trained                                                            | 7,049   | 6,814   |\n| Percentage                                                                   | 73.18%  | 72.45%  |\n| Average number of training hours per employee (no. of hours/total workforce) | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Training hours                                                               | 138,382 | 121,462 |\n| Average number of training hours per employee                                | 14.37   | 12.91   |\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.5.5.2.2. Employee Involvement*\n\nEmployee involvement and commitment are essential to AKWEL's success. We are developing a program called \"AKWEL being at Work,\" which focuses on four essential themes to help employees become more involved in their missions and to provide them with a better quality of life at work and everyday well-being.\n\n#### **Communication**\n\nCommunication and dialogue are essential to sharing the Group's values, corporate vision, strategy, expectations and objectives.\n\nTrust and mutual respect are the glue that holds our organization together. We are committed to ensuring compliance with legal requirements, ethical standards and regulations, and anti-corruption measures.\n\nIn 2023, we encouraged assimilation of the Group's identity by highlighting a key AKWEL message through teamwork at each site. Teams illustrated AKWEL's \"Stop Work\" safety policy by working together to encourage initiative, creativity and teamwork. Some 23 challenges led to video or photographic productions, which helped Akwelis to fully grasp the company's safety policy by simulating situations where they needed to protect themselves or their colleagues from risky situations. Five sites were nominated and the winner was the Orizaba site. The trophy was presented to the on-site team by the President of the Executive Board.\n\nWe continued to roll out AKWEL's employer brand to Group employees. We also highlighted AKWEL's employer promise on our website.\n\nAKWEL's employer promise provides a clear vision of the Group's commitment to its Akwelis<sup>\\*</sup> and future candidates:\n\n- working at AKWEL means sharing in the adventure of an independent, family-owned Group whose history is rooted in a long-term approach (ENGAGE+);\n- working at AKWEL involves collaboration based on reciprocal commitments, where everyone is offered the same opportunity to succeed within the Group (RESPECT+);\n- working at AKWEL gives you the possibility to develop new areas of expertise. It is also about displaying pragmatism in order to come up with the perfect solution for each problem, in a spirit of creativity and agility (ACTION+);\n- working at AKWEL means having the chance to learn from your peers and gain unique skills based on a clear overview of your role, as well as professional interpersonal skills (SHARE+);\n- working at AKWEL means growing both individually and collectively while cultivating the capacity to excel (GROW+).\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/14 description: The image is a collage of five different people working in a factory setting.

On the right side of the image, there is text that says \"COMMITMENT + RESPECT + ACTION + SHARING + GROWING + AKWEL\".\n\n\\*AKWEL employees\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 This promise is expressed through key messages and visuals (the people in the photos are real Group employees) that will gradually be incorporated into AKWEL's internal procedures and work tools, as well as its external communication media.\n\nThis dialogue is either direct between employees and management, or takes place via employee representative bodies.\n\nSeveral means of communication are used at AKWEL for direct dialogue:\n\n- a meeting between each employee and their direct manager, at the time of hiring and at least once a year thereafter;\n- quarterly information meetings;\n- a quarterly in-house newsletter, translated into the Group's main languages (English, Bulgarian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Swedish, Turkish, Czech, Chinese, Hindi and Thai);\n- an internal Intranet-style information system for sharing management system procedures, among other things.\n\nIn terms of dialogue with employee representative bodies, in addition to strict compliance with legislation, the Group ensures that such dialogues run smoothly, whether through the Social and Economic Committees (or equivalents at sites outside France) at sites with such bodies, or through the Central Social and Economic Committee.\n\nTo take account of the Group's international dimension and promote social dialogue on transnational issues, an AKWEL European Works Council (EWC) was established in October 2019.\n\nThe EWC covers all Group employees in seven countries: Czech Republic, France, Germany, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe EWC is informed of and consulted on the Group's strategic decisions. The employee delegation consists of 14 members (staff or union representatives).\n\nIt covers a range of topics within the European scope, such as the employment situation and likely employment trends, organizational developments, the introduction of new production processes, production transfers, mergers, investments and so on.\n\n| Review of Collective Agreements, Particularly in the Field of Health and<br>Safety at Work | 2023 | 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of agreements reached during the year                                               | 25   | 27   |\n| of which occupational health and safety agreements                                         | 3    | 1    |\n\nNegotiations at all Group sites led to the signing of 25 collective agreements.\n\n#### **Collective Agreements**\n\n| Collective Agreements                             | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of sites covered by a collective agreement | 25   | N/A  |\n\n#### **HSE Committees**\n\n| HSE Committees                        | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of sites with an HSE committee | 31   | N/A  |\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Percentage of Workforce with an Annual Performance Review**\n\nIn 2023, 8,643 employees had an annual performance review.\n\n| Annual Performance Review                     | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Number of annual performance reviews          | 8,643 | 8,569 |\n| Percentage of workforce with an annual review | 93%   | 92%   |\n\n#### **Remuneration**\n\nRemuneration is made up of several components: salary (fixed remuneration); bonuses (variable remuneration); benefits (health insurance, life insurance, pension, etc.); benefits in kind (company car).\n\nIn 2023, across the entire Group, 3.24% of employees were paid the minimum wage, while 96.76% were paid more.\n\nEach component of this remuneration is governed by rules that take into account local legislation, labor market conditions in each region, the position held or level of responsibility exercised, and the employee's performance. The aim is to attract, retain and motivate Akwelis, while guaranteeing competitiveness in the local market.\n\nFor example, variable remuneration, based on the Group's strategic objectives, represents a larger proportion of remuneration the higher the level of responsibility.\n\n#### **Absenteeism**\n\nFor all Group sites, the rate of absenteeism in 2023 was 4.33%, excluding maternity-related absences.\n\n| Absenteeism                                   | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Total rate of absenteeism                     | 4.87% | 5.01% |\n| Rate of absenteeism excluding maternity leave | 4.33% | 4.40% |\n\n#### **Number of Employees Working in Shifts**\n\n7,252 employees work in shifts, particularly in production (2 x 8, 3 x 8).\n\n| Number of Employees Working in Shifts | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Total                                 | 7,252 | 7,048 |\n\n#### **Weekly Working Hours**\n\nWorking hours are adapted to best meet our customers' needs within the framework of legal working hours, which vary from one legislation to another and range from 35 hours to 48 hours per week.\n\nIn some plants, night shifts are also organized to meet our customers' needs.\n\n|                      | 2023           | 2022           |\n|----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Weekly Working Hours | 35 to 48 hours | 35 to 48 hours |\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Professional Development**\n\nThe Group's professional development policy has two objectives:\n\n- to give priority to the best-performing employees, with opportunities for training that leads to qualifications, internal promotion and individual raises, giving them the chance to grow within the business;\n- to promote diversity.

To promote this corporate culture and share these rules with everyone, several documents have been drawn up and are available at [http://www.akwel-automotive.com:](http://www.akwel-automotive.com/)\n\n- an Ethics Charter that serves as a guideline for everyone in the company. It defines the rules that govern our operations and our relations with all our stakeholders, wherever they may be in the world;\n- a Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, the aim of which is to implement measures to ensure that all our employees, managers and corporate officers, wherever they may be located, can prevent AKWEL from becoming involved in any corrupt or influence-peddling practices and, if necessary, can report any such practices;\n- a stock market code of ethics designed to remind all insiders (corporate officers, employees or third-party service providers acting on behalf of AKWEL) of the regulations applicable to the possession, disclosure and use of insider information to which they may have access by virtue of their roles, mandates or assignments;\n- a Whistleblowing Procedure that details the terms and conditions of the whistleblowing system.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.5.7.1. Information on the Fight against Corruption*\n\nThe Group rejects all forms of corruption.\n\nPursuant to French Law 2016-1691 on transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life, known as \"Sapin II,\" the Group has implemented tools to detect and prevent acts of corruption or influence peddling:\n\n- risk mapping;\n- a Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling;\n- internal and external accounting control procedures;\n- a training system;\n- a whistleblowing system;\n- procedures for assessing the situation of customers, suppliers and intermediaries;\n- disciplinary sanctions for breaches of the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling.\n\nThe Group has conducted a corruption risk mapping exercise, allowing it to identify all the risks to which it is exposed and to prioritize them in terms of impact and occurrence.\n\nIn 2019, the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling was revised to strengthen the anti-corruption framework in response to the Sapin II law. The aim of this code is to implement measures to ensure that all Group employees, wherever they may be located, can recognize and prevent the Group from becoming involved in any corrupt or peddling practices and, if necessary, can report any such practices.\n\nDuring the year, the internal whistleblowing system was further adapted to meet the requirements of:\n\n- French Law No. 2022-401 of March 21, 2022 aimed at improving the protection of whistleblowers;\n- French Decree [No. 2022-1284 of October 3, 2022](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/pdf?id=q48CGV-CdqrWoIbE71wPQfxnFFJbCxjZfqxFzwqAFRg=) on procedures for collecting and processing whistleblower reports and establishing the list of external authorities established by French law No. 2022-401 of March 21, 2022 aimed at improving the protection of whistleblowers.\n\nThe purpose of the internal whistleblowing system is to receive reports from Group employees concerning conduct or situations that violate the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling. The Group has reinforced this system by expanding the topics covered to all the commitments of the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, and by opening it up to external stakeholders.\n\nThe whistleblowing system is set out in the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, and the procedures for reporting cases under this system are detailed in a specific procedure (AKWEL Group Whistleblowing Procedure) translated into the Group's main languages and also accessible on the Group's Intranet and website.\n\nThis procedure details the whistleblowing procedures implemented by the Group as part of its ethical approach.\n\nThis whistleblowing system has been presented to employee representative bodies.\n\nIn 2023, five whistleblowing reports were made. Most of them came from Mexico (two cases) and Türkiye (one case). The other two reports came from Tunisia and Spain.\n\nAll reports were considered as whistleblowing and were investigated in depth.\n\nThe majority of these reports concerned cases of fraud (three reports), while the remainder related to labor relations (one report) and violations of the Ethics Charter (one report).\n\nOf the five reports, three proved not to be established violations. One of the reports resulted in disciplinary action, with the dismissal of the person involved. One of the reports is still under investigation.\n\nNone of the reports had a significant impact on the Group.\n\nThese aspects are presented to the Audit Committee and the CSR Committee, depending on the nature of the reports.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 The Group has established a reinforced process for selecting and monitoring its suppliers in terms of both financial sustainability and social, environmental and ethical aspects. In particular, these processes cover:\n\n- the inclusion of a new supplier in the pool via a questionnaire;\n- supplier adherence to the Group's Ethics Charter;\n- the CSR assessment of suppliers and subcontractors via the EcoVadis platform;\n- regular review of suppliers.\n\nTo communicate its values, the Group has also drawn up an Ethics Charter for its employees and stakeholders (customers, suppliers, etc.).\n\nIt sets out the Group's principles, particularly in terms of compliance with legislation and respect for fair competition, prohibits conflicts of interest and insider trading, and reaffirms environmental protection, health and safety in the workplace, fair accounting and financial reporting, and the fight against all forms of discrimination and harassment.\n\nIn addition, commercial relations that do not respect these values may be terminated. To this end, contractual clauses have been included in the Group's contracts, purchase orders and general terms and conditions.\n\n#### *4.3.5.7.2. Tax Policy*\n\nThe Group's tax policy is transparent and fully in line with its corporate responsibility strategy. The Group therefore practices responsible corporate citizenship, not only complying with legislation, but above all making a fair contribution to the countries in which it operates.\n\nTo this end, the Group's tax policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- compliance with the international tax standards set out by the OECD (\"Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations\"), so that intra-Group transactions comply with the arm's length principle;\n- not attempting to evade the payment of taxes, particularly through complex and opaque structures.\n\n#### *4.3.5.7.3. Vigilance Plan*\n\nThe Group is no longer legally obligated to draw up, publish and effectively implement a vigilance plan, as it employs fewer than 10,000 people within the Group and its direct or indirect subsidiaries headquartered in France or abroad.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n**AKWEL** ANNUAL REPORT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ 2023 1\n\nImage /page/85/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"PRIORITY 4\" in large, bold, dark blue font against a white background.

In this way, we can achieve the highest levels of operational and sustainable performance, and satisfy our customers at the same time.\n\nThe health and safety of Akwelis<sup>\\*</sup>, our stakeholders and our partners is the top priority within the Group, and we expect our suppliers to ensure that sustainability, environmental, health and safety requirements are reflected and implemented throughout their supply chain.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup>AKWEL employees\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Carbon neutrality and corporate social responsibility are also part of AKWEL's objectives and values. We firmly believe that our suppliers can help us to act with integrity, in an ethical, environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.\n\nCybersecurity is also one of our key concerns, and we want our suppliers to strengthen their security policies to protect their entire supply chain, notably by obtaining ISO 27001 certification and TISAX certification.\n\nAs part of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), in force since January 1, 2024, we also want our suppliers to meet our decarbonization and Corporate Social Responsibility objectives. Our suppliers must measure their CO2 emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) from 2024 onward, and must share their results via the platform of our CSR partner, EcoVadis, with an expected minimum score of 50.\n\nBy the end of 2023, 44% of our suppliers had been assessed by EcoVadis. This criterion is taken into account in measuring supplier performance, and thus guides our choices for future projects.\n\nIn 2023, we included all our direct and indirect suppliers in our supplier risk classification. With this new rating, we have identified 26% of our suppliers as having a high level of risk. We believe that these suppliers' participation in the EcoVadis program and our monitoring of their sustainable performance will help us improve these results.\n\nAt the same time, as part of our Group environmental policy, we measure the number of direct suppliers with ISO 14001 certification, as well as the amount of local purchases made by region and country. This will help us to protect our purchases in the long-term.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **AKWEL** ANNUAL REPORT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ 2023 1\n\n#### *4.3.5.9.

We remind you that these shares do not carry voting rights, and their dividends are allocated to retained earnings.\n\nIn the 23<sup>rd</sup> resolution, you are asked to authorize, for a maximum period of 18 months, the acquisition of a number of Group shares (including under a liquidity contract), up to a limit of 10% of the number of shares making up the Group's share capital, adjusted where necessary to take into account any capital increases or reductions that may take place during the term of the program, under the following conditions:\n\nThe maximum purchase price would be set at €50 and the maximum number of shares that could be acquired would be limited to 10% of the number of shares comprising the share capital as at December 31, 2023, i.e. 2,477,250 shares, for a total maximum amount of €123,863,000, as calculated on the basis of the share capital as of April 4, 2024 and the 196,844 treasury shares held at the same date.\n\nThese transactions would be carried out in accordance with Article L. 225-209 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis authorization would be granted for the purpose of:\n\n- ensuring a liquid market for the Company's securities through an investment services provider, acting independently under a liquidity contract that complies with regulations;\n- retaining the shares repurchased and subsequently reissuing them in exchange for or as payment in connection with merger, demerger, provision or external growth operations;\n- potentially canceling some or all of the shares repurchased, under the conditions provided for by law;\n- implementing any market practice that may be permitted by regulations.\n\nThe resolution stipulates that the authorization would apply at any time, including during a takeover bid.\n\nThis new authorization would cancel the authorization granted by the Combined General Meeting on May 25, 2023, subject to its approval.\n\n# **2. Extraordinary Business**\n\n#### **2.1. Authorization for the Executive Board to Cancel Group Treasury Shares Purchased under the Terms of Article L. 22-10-62 of the French Commercial Code (24th Resolution)**\n\nThe 24<sup>th</sup> resolution submitted for shareholder approval concerns the authorization to be given to the Executive Board for a period of 24 months in order to reduce the share capital by canceling treasury shares acquired by the Company itself, up to a limit of 10% of the Group's share capital calculated as of the date of the cancellation decision, minus any shares canceled during the previous 24 months.\n\n# **3. Ordinary Business**\n\n### **3.1. Powers to Carry Out Formalities (25th Resolution)**\n\nThe 25th resolution is a standard resolution to authorize any bearer of a copy or extract of the minutes of the General Meeting to carry out, where appropriate, any formalities required by law to enforce the decisions made at this Meeting.\n\nYou will find the agenda on *page [239](#page-238-0)* and the text of the resolutions we propose for your approval on *page [241.](#page-240-0)*\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-109-0\"></span>1 **SUPERVISORY BOARD'S REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING ITS OBSERVATIONS ON THE MANAGEMENT REPORT AND ANNUAL ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR**\n\nIn accordance with the final paragraph of Article L. 225-68 of the French Commercial Code, the Supervisory Board's corporate governance report includes the information specified in Articles L. 22-10-9 to L. 22-10-11 and Article L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code:\n\n- specific terms and conditions for shareholder participation in the General Meeting;\n- the composition of the Company's Supervisory Board and Executive Board, and a list of all the mandates and positions held by each of them in companies other than the Company;\n- the conditions governing the preparation and organization of the Supervisory Board's work during the year ended December 31, 2023;\n- the delegations of authority for capital increases and other authorizations granted to the Executive Board and valid for the 2023 financial year;\n- agreements entered into between an officer or shareholder holding more than 10% of the Company's voting rights and a subsidiary (excluding standard agreements);\n- remuneration of members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board;\n- factors that could have an impact in the event of a public offer.\n\nThis report also contains the Supervisory Board's observations on the management report prepared by the Company's Executive Board, and on the annual accounts for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThis report, which is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board, has been prepared on the basis of contributions from several departments, notably the Group's Finance and Legal Departments.\n\nInformation on corporate governance is based on various internal documents (bylaws, minutes of the Supervisory Board and its committees, etc.).\n\nThis report has been submitted to the Statutory Auditors for review at the Audit Committee meeting on March 26, 2024, and for approval by the Supervisory Board on April 4, 2024.\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, since the Supervisory Board meeting of June 26, 2015, our Company has referred to the Corporate Governance Code for small and mid-cap companies published by Middlenext, revised in September 2021. The Middlenext Code is available at [www.middlenext.com.](http://www.middlenext.com/)\n\nThe Supervisory Board felt that the Middlenext Corporate Governance Code was well suited to the Company, given its size and capital structure.\n\nPursuant to the \"comply or explain\" rule set out in Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code and the Middlenext Code, the Company specifies that it applied all the recommendations of the Middlenext Code during the 2023 financial year.\n\n# **1. Specific Terms and Conditions Governing Shareholder Participation in General Meetings**\n\nArticles 12 and 20 of the Company's bylaws set out the terms and conditions governing shareholder participation in General Meetings and the exercise of voting rights.\n\nThe right to attend meetings or to be represented at them is subject to registration of the shares in the name of the shareholder or of the intermediary registered on their behalf, by midnight Paris time on the second business day preceding the meeting, either in the registered share accounts held by the Company or in the bearer share accounts held by an intermediary referred to in Article L. 211-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nThe Company's shareholders' meetings are convened, held and deliberate under the conditions established by law. Meetings are held either at the head office or at another location specified in the notice of meeting.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2. Governance**\n\nThe Combined General Meeting on May 26, 1998 approved the adoption of a dual management structure with a Supervisory Board and an Executive Board. This organization separates the management and executive roles performed by the Executive Board from the supervisory functions performed by the Supervisory Board, which represents the shareholders.\n\nThe Company has opted for this form of organization, considering that it ensures a better balance of power for the benefit of all stakeholders.\n\nIn the case of French limited companies with an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board, executive officers include the President and members of the Executive Board.\n\n#### **2.1. The Supervisory Board**\n\n#### **2.1.1. Composition of the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn accordance with the Company's bylaws, the Supervisory Board is composed of a minimum of three members and a maximum of 18 members, appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board, the number of which may not be less than the legal minimum nor more than the legal maximum, are appointed for a term of three years, expiring at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders called to approve the annual accounts for the previous year and held in the year in which the term of office expires.\n\nAt the date this report was drawn up, the Company's Supervisory Board was composed of seven (7) members, including one (1) legal entity and six (6) natural persons (including the member representing employees).\n\nOne member of the Supervisory Board (Guillaume Wesolowski) was appointed by the Company's Central Works Council to represent employees.\n\n#### *2.1.1.1. Changes in 2023*\n\nThe following changes occurred during the year:\n\n| Effective Date | Change                                              |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 05/25/2023     | Renewal of the term of office of Anne Vignat Ducret |\n\n### <span id=\"page-110-0\"></span>*2.1.1.2.

The notion of independence is defined in section *2[.1.1.3](#page-111-0)* of this report.\n\n(2) Member representing employees appointed as member of the Supervisory Board representing employees, by decision of the Central Works Council on March 3, 2022 with effect from May 25, 2022.\n\nThe average age of the Board members is 59, and 42% are under 50.\n\nThe expertise and experience of the members of the Supervisory Board stems from the various paid mandates, roles and management positions they have previously held.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-111-0\"></span>*2.1.1.3. Review of Board Member Independence*\n\nThe Company is majority-owned by a group of family shareholders.\n\nAs stipulated in the Middlenext Code, five criteria are used to presume the independence of Supervisory Board members, which is characterized by the absence of any significant financial, contractual, family or close relationship likely to affect the independence of their judgment:\n\n- not having been an employee or executive officer of the Company or a Group company in the past five years;\n- not having had a significant business relationship with the Company or a Group company (customer, supplier, competitor, service provider, creditor, banker, etc.) in the past two years;\n- not being a core shareholder of the Group or hold a significant percentage of voting rights;\n- not having any close family ties with a corporate officer or a core shareholder;\n- not having been a Group statutory auditor in the past six years.\n\nThe Board is required to verify each year—as well as at the time of their appointment—the situation of these members with regard to the independence criteria listed above.\n\nOn the basis of the independence criteria defined above, the Supervisory Board, at its meeting on April 4, 2024, at which the annual review of Board member independence was on the agenda, noted that two members, Ms. Anne Vignat Ducret and Mr. Nicolas Job, meet these criteria and can therefore be considered independent members, having no significant relationship with the Company or its management, or with a consolidated Group company, which could affect their freedom of judgment.\n\nMr. Guillaume Wesolowski, Supervisory Board member representing employees, does not qualify as an independent member.\n\nThe other members of the Supervisory Board (Ms. Geneviève Coutier, Ms. Emilie Coutier, Mr. André Coutier and Mr. Christophe Coutier), permanent representatives of the COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT Group, have close family ties with the Company's management.\n\n#### *2.1.1.4. Balanced Representation of Men and Women on the Supervisory Board — Diversity on the Supervisory Board*\n\nWith regard to the representation of men and women on the Board, it should be noted that, at the time this report was drafted, the Board had three female members.\n\nAccordingly, the Group complies with the legal provisions concerning the \"balanced representation of men and women on boards of directors and supervisory boards, and gender equality in the workplace\" as set out in Article L.225-69-1 of the French Commercial Code, which stipulate that the Supervisory Board must consist of at least 40% female members and, given the size of the Board, that there may not be a difference of more than two between the number of members of each gender.\n\nThe mandate of the Board member representing employees is not taken into account when calculating gender equality on the Board.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 1 **2.1.2. Conditions Governing the Preparation and Organization of the Supervisory Board's Work**\n\n#### *2.1.2.1. Duties and Powers of the Supervisory Board*\n\nThe Supervisory Board is the supervisory body of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are managed by the Executive Board. It ensures that the strategy applied by the Executive Board is consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board.\n\nIt gives the Executive Board prior authorization to carry out any operations that it is unable to complete without the Board's approval.\n\nIt appoints the members of the Executive Board, designates its President and, where applicable, the Managing Directors, and sets their remuneration.\n\nWithout prejudice to the powers conferred by law to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board may dismiss members of the Executive Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board sets the remuneration of Executive Board members and/or any other benefits of a similar nature.\n\nIt determines the terms and conditions for collecting the remuneration allocated to Supervisory Board members and for distributing it among them. It also sets the remuneration of the President and, where applicable, the Vice-President, and the resources allocated to them for the performance of their duties.\n\nAt any time of the year, the Supervisory Board may carry out any checks and controls it deems appropriate, and may request any documents it deems useful for the performance of its duties.\n\n#### *2.1.2.2. Notice of Meetings of Supervisory Board Members and Statutory Auditors*\n\nThe Group draws up a provisional schedule of Supervisory Board meetings in year N for year N+1.\n\nIn addition, the Group sends notices of meetings to the members of the Supervisory Board and to the delegate of the Social and Economic Committee around seven (7) days before a meeting is due to take place, by email, and by letter with acknowledgment of receipt for the Joint Statutory Auditors when this is required. All documents, technical files and information required by all Supervisory Board members are sent to them at the same time as the notice of meeting.\n\nIn addition, Supervisory Board members are notified of the confidentiality of documents communicated to them, whether within the documents themselves, or within emails or other correspondence accompanying them (Recommendation 1 of the Middlenext Code).\n\nThe Social and Economic Committee delegate receives the same information as Board members, within the same time frame.\n\nThe Joint Statutory Auditors are invited to attend Supervisory Board meetings called to review the half-yearly and annual accounts.\n\n#### *2.1.2.3. Supervisory Board Meetings and Attendance Rates*\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets as often as required in the interests of the Group, and at least once a quarter.\n\nExecutive Board members are invited to attend all Supervisory Board meetings. During the 2023 financial year, all members of the Executive Board attended and participated in the various Supervisory Board meetings, speaking in their areas of expertise.\n\nAn attendance log is signed by all Supervisory Board members present.\n\nThe Supervisory Board met six times during the financial year: on February 9, 2023, April 5, 2023, May 4, 2023, August 24, 2023, September 21, 2023 and November 9, 2023. This frequency enabled in-depth examinations and discussions of matters falling within its remit.\n\nThe effective attendance rate of members at Supervisory Board meetings is calculated on the basis of the number of members present divided by the total membership. This rate for the year was 100%.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below shows the attendance rate for each Supervisory Board meeting held in 2023:\n\n| Date of Meeting | Attendance Rate (Members Present) |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 02/09/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 04/05/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 05/04/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 08/24/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 09/21/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 11/09/2023      | 100%                              |\n\nThe President of the Supervisory Board chaired all meetings in 2023.\n\nSupervisory Board meetings are held either at the head office or at any other location indicated in the notice of meeting.\n\nIn accordance with Article 16 of the bylaws and Article 5 of the rules of procedure, Supervisory Board members who take part in Board meetings by videoconference or other means of telecommunication that allow them to be identified and guarantee their effective participation are deemed to be present for the purposes of calculating the quorum and majority. However, this provision does not apply to the verification and auditing of the corporate annual accounts and consolidated annual accounts.\n\nHowever, members are encouraged to attend meetings in person. If a member is unable to attend in person, they may participate by videoconference or, failing that, by telephone.\n\nAt each ordinary meeting, the Executive Board presents a report on the business and results of the Group and its main subsidiaries for the previous quarter. A detailed income statement with comments is presented by the Executive Board at each half-yearly or annual closing.\n\nWithin three months of the end of each financial year, the corporate and consolidated annual accounts approved by the Executive Board are submitted to the Supervisory Board for verification.\n\nThe Supervisory Board then submits its observations on the Executive Board's report, and on the annual accounts for the year, to the General Meeting, which are included in this corporate governance report.\n\nWith regard to the preparation of the half-yearly annual accounts, only the consolidated annual accounts are prepared and submitted to the Supervisory Board within three months of the half-year-end.\n\nThe Supervisory Board asks the Executive Board and management to provide any information or analysis it deems appropriate, or to make a presentation on any specific topic.\n\nMinutes are drawn up at the end of each Board meeting. These are formally approved at the next Supervisory Board meeting.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-113-0\"></span>*2.1.2.4. Topics Discussed at Board Meetings in 2023*\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board's main deliberations concerned:\n\n- the verification and control of the half-yearly and annual consolidated and corporate accounts, and the review of related financial communications;\n- presentation of the budget for the 2023 financial year;\n- the quarterly financial position as of March 31 and September 30, 2023;\n- review of the Executive Board's quarterly activity reports,\n- renewal of the share buyback agreement;\n- annual review of regulated agreements;\n- renewal of the annual authorization given to the Executive Board to grant sureties, endorsements and guarantees;\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n- review of Board member independence;\n- assessment of the Supervisory Board's performance;\n- the distribution of remuneration allocated to Supervisory Board members;\n- deliberations on professional and salary matters, in particular equal pay for equal work;\n- setting the remuneration policy for Executive Board members for the 2023 financial year;\n- the main elements of the Company's policy on sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility;\n- preparation for the General Meeting of Shareholders of May 25, 2023, and review of the reports submitted to the General Meeting.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was also informed or consulted by the Executive Board on a number of subjects, although its prior authorization was not required.\n\n#### *2.1.2.5. Independence and Duty of Expression*\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board must ensure that they retain their independence of judgment, decision and action. They undertake not to allow themselves to be influenced by factors other than the Company's corporate interests, which they are required to pursue.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board is required to inform the Supervisory Board of any matters of which they become aware and which they consider likely to affect the Company's interests\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board is expected to share their questions and opinions in order to ensure that the Group's corporate interests are safeguarded, and is expected to strive to guide the other members of the Supervisory Board toward decisions that allow such corporate interests to be maintained on an ongoing basis. In the event of a disagreement between members during a Supervisory Board meeting, the dissenting member may request that their position be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.\n\n#### *2.1.2.6. Independence and Conflicts of Interest*\n\nEach member must endeavor to avoid any conflict between their own interests and the Company's corporate interests. They must inform the Supervisory Board as soon as they become aware of any potential conflict of interest, and consequently refrain from taking part in discussions or voting on any resolution relating thereto.\n\nThe Supervisory Board carries out an annual review of conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts, of which it has been informed.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, as at the date of preparation of this report there are no conflicts of interest between the duties of each Board member to the Group and their private interests or other duties.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has familiarized itself with the rules applicable to the prevention of insider misconduct, and in particular with the periods during which trading in securities is prohibited.\n\n#### *2.1.2.7. Loyalty and Good Faith*\n\nAll Supervisory Board members shall refrain from any behavior likely to go against the Company's corporate interests in any way whatsoever, and shall act in good faith in all circumstances.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board undertakes to apply all the decisions adopted by the Supervisory Board that comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n#### *2.1.2.8. Confidentiality*\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-92 of the French Commercial Code, all members and participants of the Supervisory Board are bound by professional confidentiality with regard to the discussions and deliberations of the Supervisory Board and its Committees, and with regard to any information of which they may become aware in the course of their duties.\n\nAll Supervisory Board members and participants undertake to never disclose such information outside the Supervisory Board.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *2.1.2.9. Insider Trading Policy*\n\nAll Supervisory Board members and meeting participants must comply with the Company's insider trading policy.\n\n#### *2.1.2.10.Diligence*\n\nIn accepting their mandate, each member of the Supervisory Board undertakes to devote the necessary time, care and attention to their duties, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.

Remuneration Policy for Corporate Officers**\n\nThe Company's remuneration policy for corporate officers (hereinafter the \"Remuneration Policy\") has been drawn up pursuant to Article L. 22-10-26-I of the French Commercial Code and the recommendations of the Middlenext Corporate Governance Code. It also takes into account the Company's specific characteristics.\n\nIt is in line with the policy approved by the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders on May 28, 2020, and has not been modified since.\n\nIt will apply, where applicable, to any additional corporate officers appointed during the 2024 financial year, until the next General Meeting of Shareholders called to approve the remuneration policy for corporate officers.\n\n#### **3.1.1. General Principles**\n\nThe Remuneration Policy, as detailed below, and in particular the performance criteria, is aligned with the Company's corporate interest, contributes to the Company's business strategy and long-term viability, and takes into consideration the remuneration and employment conditions of the Company's employees.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy is designed to be competitive with the remuneration policies adopted by other companies of comparable size and in the same sector, in order to attract, reward and retain talent recognized as particularly competent in the Group's areas of activity.\n\nThe principles of the Remuneration Policy also take into account the following objectives:\n\n- remuneration must be considered in its entirety: all components of remuneration and the balance between them must be taken into account;\n- a balance between fixed and variable remuneration;\n- when setting variable remuneration, it must take into account a combination of individual performance, the Company's general economic situation and the Group's results. The assessment of individual performance is based on quantitative (financial) and qualitative (non-financial) criteria.\n\n#### *3.1.1.1. Remuneration Paid to Members of the Executive Board*\n\nRemuneration paid to members of the Executive Board consists of the following components:\n\n- fixed annual remuneration;\n- variable annual remuneration;\n- multi-year variable remuneration;\n- benefits in kind.\n\nExecutive Board members are entitled to the reimbursement of expenses incurred in the performance of their duties, in particular travel and accommodation expenses.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *3.1.1.1.1. Fixed Annual Remuneration*\n\nFixed remuneration is designed to attract talent from within the Company's ranks or, where appropriate, from outside, to the highest management positions. It must also contribute to their commitment and loyalty.\n\nIt is determined in consideration of their experience, skills and the responsibilities assumed by each of them.\n\nFixed remuneration is paid in 12 monthly installments.\n\nChanges in fixed remuneration are reviewed annually but — except in exceptional circumstances — fixed remuneration is only revised at relatively long intervals.\n\nThe criteria taken into account when deciding on an increase are changes in the scope and level of responsibility, the incumbent's performance and development in the position held, market positioning for equivalent roles in multinational companies of a comparable size, and the economic and social context of the Group and the Group to which it belongs.\n\n#### *3.1.1.1.2. Variable Annual Remuneration*\n\n<span id=\"page-124-0\"></span>Variable annual remuneration is intended to reflect the personal contribution of Executive Board members to the Group's development.\n\nIts payment is conditional on the achievement of specific and demanding performance targets for each financial year, thus helping to maintain a link between the Group's performance and the remuneration of Executive Board members in a short-term perspective.\n\nVariable annual remuneration is balanced in relation to fixed annual remuneration, and may therefore give rise to each member of the Executive Board receiving variable annual remuneration equal to 60% of their fixed remuneration (hereinafter referred to as the Variable Remuneration Cap).\n\nThe targets that determine the granting of variable annual remuneration to Executive Board members are based, in equal proportions, on return on capital employed and customer satisfaction, with these two criteria being assessed over the two half-years of the financial year.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Supervisory Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, sets the performance targets for the current year, assigning a weighting coefficient reflecting its priorities, as well as the associated points grid for each of the indicators selected.\n\nThe amount of variable remuneration ranges from 0 to a cap of 60% of the Executive Board member's fixed remuneration, depending on the number of points obtained for each indicator.\n\nThe amount of variable annual remuneration is equal to the sum of the various bonuses determined in this way.\n\nVariable remuneration is paid in June of the year of allocation, subject to approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with the conditions set out in Article L. 22-10-34-II paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe payment of variable remuneration is not coupled with a reimbursement system.\n\nThe performance targets and indicators adopted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting on April 4, 2024 for the current year are as follows:\n\nIndicator linked to the return on capital employed\n\nReturn is defined as the ratio of operating income to capital employed.

Multi-Year Variable Remuneration*\n\n<span id=\"page-126-1\"></span>The purpose of multi-year variable remuneration is to reflect the personal contribution of the Executive Board member from a medium- and/or long-term perspective, assessed over several consecutive financial years.\n\nMulti-year variable remuneration is balanced in relation to fixed annual remuneration, and capped at 10% of the cumulative amount of fixed annual remuneration paid to each member of the Executive Board over a reference period, which may not be less than two financial years (hereinafter the \"Reference Period\").\n\nThe target on which the granting of multi-year variable remuneration is based is the Group's turnover outlook, or any other performance indicator (alternative or otherwise), as determined by the Supervisory Board.\n\nMulti-year variable remuneration is paid in the year following the end of the Reference Period.\n\nMulti-year variable remuneration is paid in June of the year of allocation, subject to approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders under the conditions set out in Article L. 22-10-34-II of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe payment of multi-year variable remuneration is not coupled with a reimbursement system.\n\nAt its meeting on April 5, 2023, the Supervisory Board, acting on a proposal from the CSR and Remuneration Committee, made its payment conditional on criteria related to social and environmental responsibility (CSR) and selected the following criteria:\n\n- Reference Period: January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025\n- qualitative criteria: EcoVadis Silver Medal awarded to the Company following the assessment of its Corporate Social Responsibility management system (Environment, Social & Human Rights, Ethics and Responsible Purchasing) by EcoVadis, based on data submitted in 2025.\n\n#### *3.1.1.1.4.

Remuneration Paid to Members of the Supervisory Board*\n\n#### *3.1.1.2.1. Annual Remuneration Package Allocated to Supervisory Board Members for Their Work, and Rules for Allocation*\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 225-83 of the French Commercial Code, Supervisory Board members are entitled to a fixed annual remuneration decided by the General Meeting of Shareholders in recognition of their work and participation in the work of the Board and its committees.\n\nThis cap applies to remuneration paid to Supervisory Board members for a calendar year, irrespective of the date of payment.\n\nThe rules governing the allocation of remuneration to Supervisory Board members were amended in 2022.\n\nAt its meeting on April 7, 2022, the Supervisory Board, acting on a proposal from the CSR and Remuneration Committee, reviewed the rules governing the allocation of remuneration to Supervisory Board members in order to comply with the recommendations of the Middlenext Code in this area, by introducing a minimum fixed remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration allocated to each member of the Supervisory Board would comprise a fixed portion, in recognition of each member's attendance at and contribution to Board and committee meetings, and a predominantly variable portion, based on actual attendance at meetings.\n\nThe terms and conditions governing the allocation of this remuneration among Supervisory Board members are decided by the Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the Supervisory Board reviews the allocation of remuneration to Supervisory Board members remuneration and the individual amount allocated to each member for the year, on the basis of verifications on their actual attendance at Supervisory Board meeting; absence from a Supervisory Board meeting is accepted and will have no impact on the payment of the overall cap.\n\nFor terms of office ending or taking effect during the year, the remuneration payable is calculated *pro rata temporis*.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nSupervisory Board members are entitled to the reimbursement of expenses incurred in the performance of their duties (in particular any travel and accommodation expenses incurred in connection with Board and Committee meetings).\n\n#### *3.1.1.2.2. Remuneration of the President and Vice-President of the Supervisory Board*\n\nPursuant to Article L. 225-81 paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code, the President and Vice-President of the Supervisory Board will receive a fixed remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board will determine the amount of this remuneration, taking into account, in particular, market conditions, the specific developments of the Company, changes in the remuneration of Group employees and the remuneration practices of comparable companies.\n\nThe President and Vice-President of the Supervisory Board's annual fixed remuneration will only be revised at relatively long intervals, except in exceptional circumstances.\n\n#### *3.1.1.3. Other Remuneration of Corporate Officers*\n\n#### *3.1.1.3.1. Extraordinary Remuneration*\n\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted the following principle:\n\n- the members of the Executive Board may receive extraordinary remuneration in exceptional circumstances, which must be explicitly communicated and substantiated. Such remuneration can only be paid subject to the approval of the shareholders pursuant to Article L. 22-10-26-I of the French Commercial Code;\n- members of the Supervisory Board may receive extraordinary remuneration in cash for specific assignments entrusted to certain members or due to the unique nature of their profile or role; such remuneration is subject to the approval procedure for related-party transactions.\n\n#### *3.1.1.3.2. Share Subscription or Purchase Option Plans*\n\nThe corporate officers do not receive allocations of options to subscribe or purchase shares.\n\n#### *3.1.1.3.3. Performance Shares*\n\nThe corporate officers do not receive allocations of performance shares or bonus shares.\n\n#### *3.1.1.3.4. Post-Employment Benefits*\n\nRemuneration or benefits payable or likely to become payable upon termination or change of duties.\n\nCorporate officers do not receive any contractual compensation for the termination of their mandate.\n\n*End-of-Career Benefits.* Corporate officers do not receive end-of-career benefits in the event of retirement. Employment contracts of corporate officers who had such a contract before their appointment are suspended for the duration of their corporate mandate. Moreover, on the same basis and under the same conditions as Group employees, members of the Management Board who have an employment contract may receive a statutory endof-career bonus.\n\n*Corporate Benefits.* Corporate officers benefit, on the same basis as all executives, from the collective welfare, health and retirement plans in force within the Group.\n\n*Non-Compete Agreement.* The corporate officers do not benefit from any commitment made by the Company corresponding to indemnities under a non-compete clause.\n\n#### **3.1.2. Decision-Making Process for Drafting, Revising and Implementing the Remuneration Policy**\n\nTo ensure that the remuneration of corporate officers aligns with the interests of shareholders and the Group's performance, the Supervisory Board and the CSR and Remuneration Committee play a crucial role in drafting, revising and implementing the Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe same applies to shareholders who vote on the Remuneration Policy and the components paid out through a binding vote annually at the General Meeting.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 At the beginning of the year, the Remuneration Policy is subject to review by the CSR and Remuneration Committee, which proposes that the Supervisory Committee keep it unchanged or amend it according to market conditions, changes in the Company itself, changes in employee remuneration at the Company and the remuneration paid by comparable companies, or in the event of a significant change in the scope of responsibility of the members of the Executive Board.\n\nAt the proposal of the CSR and Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory Committee stipulates the remuneration of the Group's corporate officers.\n\nSpecifically, it determines their fixed and their variable annual remuneration (ceiling, thresholds, terms and criteria for allocation) for the financial year ending on December 31 of the previous year, taking into account the changes in the environment and competitive context. It sets the economic and non-economic criteria on which the variable remuneration for the coming year will be based.\n\nThe CSR and Remuneration Committee develops the decisions to be submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders concerning these matters.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted the principle that it shall not deviate from the application of the Remuneration Policy.\n\n### **3.1.3. Process of Evaluating the Performance of Executive Board Members**\n\nFollowing the close of the financial year, the Remuneration Committee assesses to what extent achievement of these annual or multi-year objectives have been achieved. Then, based on this review, the Supervisory Board decides to allocate all or part of the variable annual remuneration and, if applicable, the multi-year variable remuneration to the members of the Executive Board.\n\nAs such, variable remuneration allocated for a financial year is settled and paid during the following financial year, after approval by the General Meeting, in accordance with Article L. 22-10-34. II paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-128-0\"></span>**3.2.

Part-time employees were excluded from the calculation.\n\nTotal remuneration includes:\n\n- for Group employees: the base salary, arrears, bonuses (quality bonus, performance bonus, other bonuses [exceptional bonus, birth, patent, purchasing power compensation]), sums received under profitsharing schemes and benefits in kind;\n- for members of the Executive Board: (i) their fixed remuneration

Factors That Could Have an Impact in the Event of a Public Offer**\n\nPlease take note of the following points pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code:\n\nThe capital structure as well as the known direct stakes in the Group's capital are described above and below.\n\nThere is concerted action within the meaning of Article 233-10 of the French Commercial Code between COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT (a family holding company controlled by André, Roger, the successors of Joseph Coutier and their family) and André, Roger and the successors of Joseph Coutier, which represent 69.70% of the capital and 82.08% of the voting rights.\n\nIn addition, please keep in mind that COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT and André and Roger Coutier signed an agreement on May 24, 1994 in which they decided to coordinate to implement a common shareholder policy for the Group. This agreement has been subject to regulatory declarations to the supervisory authorities, who have ensured its disclosure (SBF Notice No. 94-2365 of July 29, 1994). The duration of this shareholder agreement is five years, automatically renewable for successive five-year periods unless one of the parties terminates its commitment before the expiration of the period. In such case, the remaining members in the agreement would still be bound by the resulting obligations.\n\n#### Double voting rights exist.\n\nArticle 10 paragraph III of the Group's bylaws imposes an obligation of disclosure on any person who acquires or disposes of a percentage of capital or voting rights equal to or greater than 1%, or any multiple thereof, up to a threshold of 50%.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 In case of non-compliance with this disclosure obligation, the shares exceeding the portion that should have been declared are deprived of voting rights at shareholder meetings if, at a meeting, the failure to declare is noted and if one or more shareholders jointly holding 5% of the capital or voting rights make such request at that meeting. In this case, the shares deprived of voting rights regain this right only after a period of two years following the date on which such notice is properly served.\n\nThe Group's bylaws do not contain any other specific provisions, particularly regarding the rules for appointing and revoking members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, as well as the rules governing the management of powers within these bodies.\n\nAny amendment to the Group's bylaws must carried out in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions.\n\n# **5. Additional Information**\n\n#### **5.1. Family Links between the Corporate Officers**\n\nThe Company is majority-owned by a group of family shareholders. As a result, there is a family link between various members of the Executive Board and/or some members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAndré Coutier and Geneviève Coutier are married and are the parents of Benoit Coutier and Mathieu Coutier.\n\nEmilie Coutier, Nicolas Coutier and Christophe Coutier are cousins of Benoit Coutier and Mathieu Coutier.\n\nEmilie Coutier, Nicolas Coutier and Christophe Coutier are siblings.\n\nTo the best of the Group's knowledge, there are no other close family relationships among the corporate officers.\n\n#### **5.2. Lack of Fraud Convictions against Members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board has been subject to a fraud conviction in the past five years.\n\n#### **5.3. Bankruptcy, Court-Ordered Receivership or Liquidation with Which Members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board Have Been Associated**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, none of the members of the Management Board or the Supervisory Board has been involved in a bankruptcy, court-ordered receivership or liquidation in the past five years as a member of a management, executive or supervisory body.\n\n#### **5.4. Official Public Indictment and/or Sanction Imposed against Members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board has been subject to any official public indictment or sanction imposed by the statutory or regulatory authorities (including designated professional bodies) in the last five years.\n\n#### **5.5. Ban on Acting As a Corporate Officer or Intervening in the Management or Conduct of Affairs of an Issuer**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board has been prohibited by a court from acting as a member of a management body, including executive or supervisory roles, or from intervening in the management or conduct of affairs of an issuer in the last five years.\n\n# **5.6. Conflicts of Interest at the Level of Executive and Supervisory Bodies**\n\nAs at the date of this report, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no conflicts of interest have been identified between the duties of each member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board toward the Group in their capacity as corporate officers and their private interests or other duties.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **5.7. Restrictions on Asset Transfers**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no restriction has been accepted by a member of the Supervisory Board concerning the transfer, for a given period, of their holding in the Group's share capital.\n\n#### **5.8. Agreements Entered Into between a Director or a Significant Shareholder and a Subsidiary**\n\nThroughout the financial year, the agreements entered into within the scope of Article L.225-37-4 (2) of the French Commercial Code are as follows:\n\n- lease agreement between COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT and AKWEL GERMANY SERVICES GMBH;\n- lease agreement between COUTIER DEVELOPMENT and AKWEL CADILLAC USA, INC.\n\n# **6. Observations by the Supervisory Board on the Management Report Prepared by the Executive Board and on the Annual Accounts for the 2023 Financial Year**\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nSummoned to the Combined General Meeting in accordance with the law and the bylaws, notably to present the financial statements of the past financial year for your consideration and approval, you have recently reviewed the reports of the Executive Board and of the Statutory Auditors on the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-20 of the French Commercial Code, we would like to draw your attention to our observations regarding the Executive Board's management report and the annual accounts for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nFurthermore, we wish to inform you of the topics discussed by the Supervisory Board, as presented in Section *[2.1.2.4](#page-113-0)* of the annual report.\n\nFirstly, good relations were maintained throughout the financial year with the Executive Board, which regularly provided reports on its activities and all necessary information, enabling the Supervisory Board to fulfill its ongoing monitoring endeavor with due diligence.\n\nWe would like to inform you that the statutory and consolidated annual accounts for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, along with the management report, have been submitted to the Supervisory Board within the deadlines stipulated by the legal and regulatory provisions.\n\nThus, during the meeting of the Supervisory Board on April 4, 2024, the Executive Board presented to us the statutory annual accounts for the 2023 financial year, the consolidated financial statements and the management report prepared on the accounts and operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Executive Board's report to the General Meeting does not elicit any specific comments from the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe accounts for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, highlight the following main items:\n\n| (in thousands of euro)   | Consolidated Accounts | Corporate Accounts |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Balance Sheet Total      | 882,942               | 454,128            |\n| Revenue                  | 1,066,373             | 362,168            |\n| Profit/Loss for the Year | 35,469                | (94)               |\n\nOver the year, the activity was notably marked by:\n\n- the 5.7% growth of the global automotive market, which allowed the Group to increase its revenue and to return to profitability. The Group's entities were also able to pass on some of the cost increases to their sales prices; and\n- a slightly lower net cash position compared to 2022 but still at a high level (€105 million).\n\nThe Supervisory Board studied the proposals for resolutions that were submitted to the General Meeting and invites you to approve them in order to provide the Executive Board the necessary means to implement its strategy.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board does not have any particular observation to make concerning the accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, as they were presented to you after being examined by the Audit Committee and certified by the Statutory Auditors.

Accounting Rules and Methods**\n\nThe Group's consolidated accounts were approved by the Executive Board on April 3, 2024.\n\n#### **1.1. Key Events of the Past Financial Year**\n\nDuring the past financial year, significant operations and events in terms of scope or organization were as follows:\n\n- Decision to close the Gournay site\n- Increase in turnover due to growth in the automotive production market and the impact of increases in raw material costs and other costs on sales prices\n- Increase in personnel costs due to wage inflation\n\n#### **1.2. Compliance Statement**\n\nIn accordance with European Regulations 1606/2002 and 1725/2003, the consolidated financial statements of the AKWEL Group are prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards applicable within the European Union as at December 31, 2023. International accounting standards include IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), IAS (International Accounting Standards), and amendments by the SIC and the IFRIC (Standards Interpretations Committee and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee) and their interpretations, which are available on the following website: [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/fr/index.htm)\n\nThe consolidated accounts are presented in euro and rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n#### **1.3. New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Applicable in 2023**\n\nThe consolidated accounts are prepared in accordance with the accounting and valuation rules defined by the IFRS framework (standards, amendments and interpretations) adopted by the European Commission as at December 31, 2023. This framework is available on the European Commission's website.\n\nThe new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Commission, applicable from January 1, 2023, are presented below:\n\n- amendments to IAS 1, Disclosure of Accounting Policies; and update of a practical application guide on materiality (IFRS Practice Statement 2: Making Materiality Judgements), adopted by the European Union (EU) in March 2022;\n- amendments to IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, adopted by the EU in March 2022;\n- amendments to IAS 12, Deferred taxes related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction, adopted by the EU in August 2022;\n- amendments to IAS 12 Pillar 2, adopted by the EU in November 2023 and immediately applicable in 2023 (a). IFRS 17 and amendments – \"Insurance Contracts\" and amendments to standard 17.\n\nThese amendments had no impact on the Group's accounts as at December 31, 2023.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 The Group applied the IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" amendment concerning the application of European Directive Pillar 2, which enables it to exclude potential effects of the Directive on the calculation of deferred taxes. The impact on the Group's consolidated accounts is currently being assessed. Based on the information available to date, the Group does not anticipate a significant impact from the implementation of Pillar 2, starting from the 2024 financial year, on the current tax expenses related to the top-up tax payable under Pillar 2.\n\nOther new standards, amendments and interpretations applicable from January 1, 2023 are either not applicable or have not had a significant impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe Group has chosen not to implement in advance the standards, amendments and interpretations adopted or in the process of being adopted by the European Union, but whose early application would have been possible as interpretations of existing texts, and which will come into force after December 31, 2023, notably:\n\nFor periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024:\n\n- the IFRS 16 amendment \"Lease Liability in a sale and Leaseback Transaction,\" published by the EU in November 2023;\n- the IAS 1 amendment \"Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\" and \"Non-current Liabilities with Covenants,\" adopted by the EU in December 2023;\n- the IFRS 7 amendment \"Financial Instruments: Supplier Finance Arrangements,\" adopted by the IASB in May 2023 and currently being adopted by the EU;\n- the amendment of standard and interpretation IFRS 14 \"Regulatory Deferral Accounts.\"\n\nFor periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025:\n\n The IAS 21 amendment \"Lack of Exchangeability,\" adopted by the IASB in August 2023 and currently being adopted by the EU.\n\nThe Group does not expect these amendments to have a significant impact on its financial statements.\n\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe financial statements reflect the assumptions and estimates made by the Group's Management. Presenting financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in order to evaluate certain assets, liabilities, income, expenses and commitments. The final data may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Goodwill, impairment tests, deferred tax assets, provisions recorded in the balance sheet liabilities and lease contract durations are the main elements of the consolidated financial statements affected by the use of assumptions and estimates.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Group did not observe a significant change in the level of uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, especially considering the uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, with the exception of the very high volatility of the discount rate used to calculate employee commitments (see note *[1.6.9](#page-181-0) [Pension Obligations](#page-181-0)*) and those related to translation adjustments.\n\n#### **1.3.1. The Impacts of Hyperinflation in Türkiye and Argentina on the Group**\n\n#### <span id=\"page-173-1\"></span><span id=\"page-173-0\"></span>*1.3.1.1. The Euro as the Functional Currency for Turkish Subsidiaries*\n\nIn 2022, due to the high inflation rate in Türkiye (64% for the year) and the continuous depreciation of the Turkish lira since 2020, Türkiye was included in the list of hyperinflationary economies. This led the Group to apply IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\" The impact of applying this standard resulted in recognizing a loss on monetary position of €14.3 million in the consolidated income statement at December 31, 2022.\n\nIn 2023, after thorough analysis, it was determined that the functional currency for both Turkish subsidiaries was the euro. As a result, the Group now applies IAS 21 \"The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.\"\n\nThe chosen effective date is January 1, 2022, closest to the date when Türkiye was declared to be in hyperinflation (April 2022). As a result, the Group had to revise its 2022 accounts.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe consolidated financial statements (Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement) present, in a dedicated column, the restated figures for the 2022 financial year. Where appropriate, the notes disclose the impact accordingly.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 8, significant adjustments resulting from error corrections must be recognized retrospectively, i.e. by correcting the recognition, measurement and disclosures (IAS 8.5 and 8.42).\n\nThe corrections made in the 2022 financial year have the following impacts:\n\n| (in thousands of euro)

flows or on the valuation of the CGUs (no amendment to the conclusions of the impairment tests conducted as at December 31, 2022).\n\n#### *1.3.1.2. Impacts of Hyperinflation in Argentina*\n\nConsidering the non-significant nature of the subsidiary, the Group does not apply IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\"\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.4. Scope of Consolidation**\n\nSignificant companies in which the Group has direct or indirect exclusive control are fully consolidated. The exclusive control is assessed according to the criteria defined by IFRS 10 (direct or indirect power to direct the financial and operational policies of the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns and the ability to use its power to influence returns). This control is generally presumed to exist in companies where the Group directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the voting rights of the controlled entity. To assess this control, potential immediately exercisable voting rights are taken into account, including those held by another entity.\n\nSignificant associated companies in which the Group directly or indirectly exerts notable influence are accounted for using the equity method. Notable influence refers to having the power to shape the financial and operational policies of a company without, however, exercising control over its policies. It is presumed to exist when the Group directly or indirectly holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Equity accounting involves substituting the carrying amount of the securities held with the share they represent in the associated Group's equity, including the results of the financial year.\n\nThe analysis of partnerships conducted according to the criteria defined by IFRS 11 revealed only joint ventures and no joint activities. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe list of companies included in the consolidation scope as of December 31, 2023, is provided in *note [2](#page-187-0)*.\n\nAll significant transactions between the consolidated companies are eliminated, as well as unrealized internal profits included in the fixed assets and inventories of the consolidated entities.\n\n#### **1.4.1. Business Combinations**\n\nSince 2010, the Group has been applying the revised standards IFRS 3 \"Business Combinations\" and IAS 27 \"Consolidate and Separate Financial Statements.\" In accordance with this method, the Group recognizes the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at their fair value, as of the date of acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition cost corresponds to the fair value, at the date of the exchange, of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and/or equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquired entity.\n\nExpenses related to a business combination are not part of the fair value exchanged. They are recognized as expenses and are not included in the acquisition cost of the securities.\n\nThe Group assesses minority interests in a takeover either at their fair value (full goodwill method) or based on their share of the acquired Group's net assets (partial goodwill method). The option is chosen for each acquisition.\n\nThe impact of changes in the consolidation scope without amending the control is recognized directly in consolidated reserves.\n\nWhen the business combination agreement provides for a price adjustment dependent on future events, the Group includes the amount of this adjustment in the business combination cost at the acquisition date if this adjustment is likely and can be reliably measured. Any subsequent variation is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group has a 12-month period from the acquisition date to complete the accounting for the considered business combination (excluding variations in price adjustments — see above). Any change to the acquisition price made outside the allocation period results in no change to the acquisition cost or goodwill. This 12-month period does not apply to price adjustment clauses, the variations of which are recognized in profit or loss post-acquisition.\n\n#### **1.5. Conversion of the Financial Statements and Foreign-Currency Transactions**\n\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency that is significant to the operations of the respective subsidiary. This is most often the local currency.\n\nThe Group applies the closing-rate method to convert subsidiary financial statements:\n\n- all balance-sheet items of foreign subsidiaries are converted at the closing rate, except for equity;\n- income statement items of foreign subsidiaries, denominated in the local currency, are converted at the average rate for the period;\n- Group share of equity is converted at the historical rate, except for the current year's profit, which is converted at the average rate;\n- translation adjustments are recognized in other comprehensive income;\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\ngoodwill arising from foreign subsidiaries is recorded in the subsidiary's currency.\n\nExchange differences resulting from currency transactions during the period are included in the income statement under current operating income.\n\nThe accounting principles adopted for the conversion of subsidiaries located in hyperinflationary economies are presented in note *[1.3.1](#page-173-1)*. Except for Turkish subsidiaries from 2022 onward, the Group has no other significant subsidiaries in hyperinflationary countries.\n\nThe Group has not implemented any currency risk hedging instruments for the periods presented.\n\nIn the event of the disposal of foreign subsidiaries that prepare their accounts in a currency other than the euro, the cumulative translation adjustments are recycled into profit or loss to be included in the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nExchange differences related to a monetary item that is essentially part of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary are recognized directly in consolidated equity under the \"Translation adjustment\" item, provided the criteria defined by the standard are met.\n\n#### **1.6. Accounting Principles and Methods**\n\nThe accounts of the Group's companies, prepared according to the accounting rules in force in their country of operation, are adjusted before being consolidated when there are discrepancies in accounting principles compared to those adopted by the Group.\n\n#### **1.6.1. Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost and primarily include the following:\n\n- patents (amortized on a straight-line basis over their protection period);\n- software (amortized on a straight-line basis over a period ranging from one to three years).\n\nResearch expenses are recognized as charges in the financial year in which they are incurred. Development costs are recognized as intangible assets when the conditions related to technical feasibility, market potential, the ability to reliably measure attributable costs, and the generation of future economic benefits are met. Development costs are reviewed on an annual basis in order to determine whether the accounting criteria of an intangible asset have been fulfilled.\n\nIn 2023, as in 2022, no development cost has been capitalized as the capitalization criteria were not met. Indeed, in order to capitalize development costs incurred as part of a new product project or a significant change in an existing product, six criteria must be met.\n\nOne of these criteria requires that the existence of a market for the output of the project be demonstrated. The market is considered proven when the Group has received manufacturer homologation and the volumes proposed by the manufacturers generate sufficient profitability. However, the corresponding development costs are incurred at a stage of the project prior to manufacturer homologation. The amount of Research and Development expenses recognized as expenses during the 2023 financial year amounts to €62.6 million (€58.5 million in 2022).\n\n#### **1.6.2. Goodwill**\n\nThe positive difference between the acquisition cost of the securities and the fair value of the subsidiary's assets and liabilities at that date constitutes goodwill, which is recorded as an intangible asset under \"Goodwill\" in the consolidated balance sheet. Unallocated business goodwill is also deemed goodwill.\n\nThe acquisition price includes the impact of any adjustments to the acquisition price, such as price supplements. Price supplements are calculated by applying the criteria stipulated in the purchase agreement (turnover, income, etc.) to the most likely forecasts. They are estimated again upon each closure, and any changes are allocated to profit or loss (including within a year following the acquisition date). They are updated whenever there is a significant impact. Where appropriate, the impact of the \"unwinding\" of the debt recorded in the liabilities is recognized in the \"Cost of net financial indebtedness\" category. Acquisition costs are recognized directly as expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the exception provided by IFRS 1, the value of positive goodwill determined according to French GAAP was not adjusted to IFRS standards during the transition to IFRS in 2005.\n\nWhen goodwill is negative, it is immediately recognized in profit or loss.\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is not amortized. It is, however, subject to impairment tests (see *note [7](#page-191-0)*).\n\n#### **Impairment Tests on Non-Financial, Non-Current Assets**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, impairment tests are conducted at least once a year for non-amortized assets (mainly goodwill), and for other tangible and intangible assets if there are indications of impairment.\n\nIn practice, non-financial, non-current assets mainly consist of goodwill and land.\n\nFor the impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill is allocated among the cash-generating units (CGUs), which are homogeneous groups that generate independent cash flows.\n\nRegarding goodwill, the CGUs correspond to the countries of operation (France, Spain, Türkiye, China, United States, Sweden, etc.). There have been no CGU changes over the financial years presented.\n\nThe carrying amount of the assets grouped in this manner is compared to the higher of their value in use and their net market value minus sales costs. In practice, only the value in use is applied.\n\nThe value in use of goodwill is determined based on the discounted future cash flows of the CGUs using the following economic assumptions:\n\n- the cash flows used are derived from the 2024 budgets and are extended over a total explicit period of five years;\n- beyond this period, the terminal value is calculated by capitalizing the last cash flow of the explicit period indefinitely at a perpetual growth rate of 1.5% (1.5% in 2022);\n- the discount rate corresponds to a weighted average cost of capital after tax. Using this method results in recoverable amounts that are identical to those obtained using a pre-tax rate on pre-tax cash flows.\n\nThe discount rate used as at December 31, 2023 to discount future cash flows is 10.3%, compared to 9.0% as at December 31, 2022.\n\nIn the absence of identified country risks, identical industry sectors, a similar customer base and homogeneous operations, the Group has not customized the discount rate or the perpetual growth rate for each CGU.\n\nWhen the tests indicate an impairment, it is first charged against goodwill, and then against the other assets of the CGU, up to their recoverable amount. Impairments are recognized in either current or non-current operating income, depending on the cause of the impairment. Impairments on goodwill are irreversible until the related cash-generating units are disposed of, except in the case of equity associates.\n\n#### **1.6.3. Property, plant and equipment**\n\n<span id=\"page-177-0\"></span>Fixed assets are measured at their acquisition cost or at their fair value in the case of business combinations. The Group has opted for the revaluation of land as presented below in *note [9](#page-193-0)*.\n\nThe analysis conducted according to IAS 23 did not result in the capitalization of borrowing costs.\n\nFor consistency, depreciation is adjusted on a straight-line basis over the assets' useful life.\n\nThe generally adopted depreciation periods are as follows:\n\n- buildings: 25 to 40 years;\n- building fixtures: 5 to 10 years;\n- technical installations: 5 to 10 years;\n- industrial equipment and tools: 5 to 10 years;\n- general installations: 10 years;\n- furniture and office equipment: 5 to 10 years.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, the Group would conduct impairment tests, using a methodology similar to that applied to goodwill, if any indicators of impairment were identified.\n\nThe Group's assets are not subject to expenditures under major multi-year maintenance or overhaul programs. The expenses incurred serve solely to verify the proper functioning of the installations and to perform maintenance without extending their useful life beyond the initially planned period.\n\nThe Group's property, plant and equipment do not have significant residual values.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe analysis conducted did not identify any lease-related assets that would need to be tested independently of a cash generating unit (CGU).\n\n#### **Accounting Principles Related to the Adjustments of Lease Contracts**\n\nIFRS 16 no longer distinguishes, from the lessee's perspective, between finance leases and operating leases.\n\nLease contracts, or contracts that contain a lease, are agreements that grant the right to control the use of an identified asset for a specified period in exchange for consideration.\n\nLease contracts meeting this definition are accounted for according to the guidelines below, except in cases of exemptions stipulated by the standard (such as contracts with terms under 12 months or low-value underlying assets) and for contracts not adjusted due to their negligible impact. In practice, the analysis has resulted in adjustments being made solely for real estate lease contracts.\n\nFor contracts not treated as lease contracts, rental payments are recognized as expenses evenly over the contract term.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor contracts falling under the purview of IFRS 16, the accounting treatment is as follows:\n\n- at the contract start date, the Group recognizes an asset for the right of use and a financial liability for the lease obligation;\n- the lease obligation is assessed at the discounted value of the unpaid lease payments over the contract term. The discounted value is calculated using the explicit interest rate for finance leases and the incremental borrowing rate for other cases. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated for each country according to the contract term and the repayment profile (duration rate);\n- the lease term is the non-cancellable period that corresponds to the enforceable period. In accordance with the IFRS IC interpretation of November 2019, the Group considers the date until which the lessee is reasonably certain to continue the lease beyond the contractual term;\n- there are no early termination clauses in the various leases, and there are no clauses that would lead lessors to pay the Group a more than insignificant penalty if the lease is not renewed at the end of the noncancellable period.\n\nIn practice:\n\n- the durations used for lease contracts in France correspond to the enforceable period of nine years (\"3/6/9\" commercial leases): a non-cancellable period of three years and certainty of exercising renewal options after three and six years. In cases where there is no specified duration in the contract, assets related to the right of use will be amortized over ten years, which corresponds to the average economic useful life of the assets concerned.\n- there are no early termination clauses in the various leases, and there are no clauses that would lead lessors to pay the Group a more than insignificant penalty if the lease is not renewed at the end of the noncancellable period.\n\nLease payments include fixed payments, variable payments dependent on an index or rate, and the exercise prices of purchase options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. In practice, most lease payments are fixed and there are no purchase options.\n\nAssets related to usage rights are measured using the cost model as follows: the cost is reduced by the accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted to reflect any revaluations of the lease liability.\n\nAssets related to usage rights are amortized over the economic useful life for leases with a purchase option, and over the lease term used to determine the lease liability for other leases.\n\n#### **Impact on Cash Flows**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 7, only the repayments of debt related to lease liabilities are reported in the cash flow statement — under financing activities. The flows related to the increase in assets and liabilities from lease contracts are offset.\n\n<span id=\"page-179-0\"></span>The interest paid on lease liabilities is presented under \"Changes in debt,\" similar to other interest payments.\n\n#### **1.6.4. Non-current financial assets**\n\n**Financial assets valued at amortized cost:**\n\nThis item primarily includes deposits and guarantees paid by the Group's companies.\n\n#### **Assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income:**\n\nThe Group measures non-consolidated equity securities at their fair value through other comprehensive income, which is not recyclable to profit or loss (see *1*[.9\\)](#page-185-0). In exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of reliable and recent information), the historical cost is deemed to be an acceptable benchmark of the fair value.\n\n#### **Assets measured at fair value through profit and loss:**\n\nNo non-current financial assets are included in this category.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.6.5. Inventory**\n\nInventory is valued at the purchase price for raw materials and at the factory cost price for finished goods and work in progress. Factory cost price excludes overheads that do not contribute to production and financial expenses. All of these costs are calculated using the first in, first out method and, given the inventory turnover, are close to the latest cost prices.\n\nA provision for impairment is recognized when the net value of the inventory exceeds its net realizable value and/or when indicators of value loss are identified (turnover, obsolescence, etc.).\n\nTools are valued at full cost up to the billable price to customers.\n\n#### **1.6.6. Accounts Receivable , Other Asset and Liabilities Related to Customer Contracts**\n\n#### **Accounts Receivable:**\n\nAccounts receivable are initially recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received. The fair value of accounts receivable is considered to be their nominal value, given the usual payment terms of three months or less. Accounts receivable are adjusted at the balance sheet date for bills sent for collection that are not yet due, as well as for bills subject to discounting. Trade receivables that have not yet matured and are sold under a factoring agreement, but do not meet the derecognition criteria of IAS 39, remain under the \"Trade and similar receivables\" item; otherwise, they are recorded as cash.\n\nA provision is recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 based on expected credit losses, taking into account any collateral. It should be noted that, overall, the customer risk is considered to be low.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach for impairment of receivables. The Group distinguishes doubtful receivables (customers with a high risk of default) from other accounts receivable.\n\nDoubtful receivables are adjusted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nNon-doubtful accounts receivable are adjusted based on a provisioning matrix, which considers both the probability of default and the probability of loss given default.\n\nThe probabilities are based on a risk analysis considering quantitative and qualitative criteria such as the financial situation of the customer, the age of the receivable and the existence of any disputes.\n\n#### **Other assets related to customer contracts:**\n\nThere are no assets related to the costs of obtaining or executing contracts.\n\n#### **Netting agreements:**\n\nNone.\n\n#### **Contracts with a significant financing component:**\n\nNone.\n\n**Liabilities related to customer contracts:**\n\nLiabilities related to customer contracts include:\n\n- debts owed to customers for consideration to be paid to customers;\n- <span id=\"page-180-0\"></span>deferred income, of little significance, aimed at allocating revenue over the financial year.\n\n#### **1.6.7. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash at bank and in hand essentially comprises overdraft bank accounts.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are marketable securities that meet the criteria of IAS 7 for classification as \"cash and cash equivalents\": short-term investments, highly liquid and easily convertible into a known amount of cash, and subject to negligible risk of value fluctuations.\n\nThey are initially recorded at acquisition cost and subsequently measured at fair value, which corresponds to the market value at the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are recorded under financial income.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.6.8. Payable and Deferred Taxes**\n\n#### **Taxes Payable**\n\nTax receivables and payables include assets and liabilities related to tax uncertainties and risks, in accordance with IFRIC 23. In practice, no amount has been reported in the financial years presented regarding tax uncertainties.\n\n#### **Deferred taxes**\n\nDeferred taxes reflect the timing differences between expenses and revenues recognized for financial reporting purposes in the consolidated financial statements and those recognized for corporate income tax purposes.\n\nThese deferred taxes, determined using the variable-rate method, mainly result from:\n\n- provisions not deductible on a temporary basis;\n- consolidation adjustments (amortization method, lease contracts, severance pay, etc.).\n- elimination of internal profit included in inventories.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted or substantially enacted tax rate at year-end. In practice, no significant changes in tax rates are expected. Deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards are recognized only to the extent that they can be offset against future taxable differences when there is a reasonable likelihood of realization or recovery through offsetting against future results, or when there are opportunities for tax optimization initiated by AKWEL. The time horizon for estimating future profits is a maximum of five years, with a periodic review of the assumptions and forecasts used. Furthermore, any regulations governing the capping of the use of deficits are considered, where relevant.\n\nApplying the above principles has led to the non-recognition, at Group level, of deferred tax assets related to tax losses incurred by certain subsidiaries at year-end due to uncertainties regarding their future use and the absence of a precise schedule for using tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset when they relate to the same tax entity.\n\n<span id=\"page-181-0\"></span>In accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are not discounted.\n\n#### **1.6.9. Pension Obligations**\n\nFor defined contribution plans, the Group's payments are recognized as expenses in the period to which they relate.\n\nFor defined benefit plans concerning post-employment benefits, the costs of benefits are estimated using the projected unit credit method with end-of-career salary.\n\nThe amounts of rights acquired by employees under various applicable collective agreements are assessed based on actuarial assumptions (changes in salary, retirement age, mortality, staff turnover), then discounted to their present value based on a discount rate. The corresponding provision for these acquired rights is fully recognized in provisions for retirement and other benefits.\n\nIn the absence of collective agreements providing for ceilings and/or acquisition tiers of rights, the obligations are recognized taking into account employees' length of service.\n\nThe discount rate was determined taking into account the yield on private bonds with no risk and a maturity close to that of the commitments.\n\nThe amounts were calculated based on a discount rate of 3.22% (compared to 3.84% at year-end 2022), a salary increase of 2.5% (compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022) for both executives and non-executives, a retirement age of 67 and average assumptions regarding staff turnover. These assumptions apply to the French entities, which represent the most significant portion of the recognized pension obligations.\n\nActive and former members of the governing and management bodies does not receive any specific benefit in terms of pension.\n\nThe cost of services rendered and the financial cost are reported in consolidated profit or loss. The impact of changes in system is also immediately recognized in consolidated profit or loss. There have been no changes in system over the financial years presented.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Actuarial gains and losses (related to changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not recyclable to profit or loss.\n\nNo changes or amendments to the plan have occurred during the periods presented, except for the pension reform in France, which was adopted in April 2023 and came into force on September 1, 2023. The impact of this reform is insignificant.\n\nFinally, the Group has not opted to outsource funding of the obligation to a fund.\n\n### **1.6.10. Share-Based Payments**\n\nWhere applicable, pursuant IFRS 2, the stock subscription or purchase options granted to employees that are settled in shares are measured at their fair value. This fair value is recognized in the income statement over the vesting period of the exercise rights by the employees, taking into account a probability of rights vesting, reevaluated at each year-end. The cumulative benefit amount is fixed at the vesting date, based on the rights actually vested. It is then reclassified to reserves when the rights are exercised or forfeited.\n\n# **1.6.11. Provisions (Excluding Tax Uncertainties)**\n\nIn general, management has reviewed every known dispute involving the Group as at the balance sheet date. Where appropriate, after consulting with external advisors, provisions deemed necessary have been made to hedge the estimated risks.\n\nContingent assets are disclosed in the notes when their realization is likely and their amount is significant. Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the notes when their amount is significant.\n\n#### **1.6.12. Loans and Financial Debt**\n\nLoans and financial debt are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThe accounting rules for lease liabilities under IFRS 16 are presented in note *[1.6.3](#page-177-0)* on accounting principles related to the adjustments of lease contracts.\n\n#### **1.6.13. Derivatives**\n\n#### *1.6.13.1.Currency Risk*\n\nThe Group and its subsidiaries primarily conduct purchase and sales transactions in the same currencies, thereby naturally hedging against exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, the Group does not currently use financial instruments to hedge its commercial flows.\n\n#### *1.6.13.2.Interest-Rate Risk*\n\nHistorically, the Group's companies have not held any hedging contracts to secure a maximum fixed rate on a portion of the variable-rate financings in place.\n\n#### **1.6.14. Assets/Liabilities Held for Sale, Discontinued Operations**\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value minus costs to sell.\n\nWhen applicable, and in compliance with IFRS 5, the results of discontinued operations are presented on a separate line in the income statement. No assets or liabilities meet this definition for the periods presented.\n\n#### **1.6.15. Own Shares**\n\nMovements (acquisitions and disposals) of the parent company's shares, whether held by the Parent Company itself or by one of its consolidated subsidiaries, are recognized directly in equity.\n\nGains or losses on the disposal of these shares are directly allocated to equity, net of the corresponding tax.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-183-0\"></span>**1.7. Presentation of the Income Statement**\n\n#### **1.7.1. Revenue**\n\nIFRS 15 establishes the principles for recognizing revenue based on a five-step analysis:\n\n- identification of the contract;\n- identification of the various performance obligations, i.e. the list of goods or services the seller has committed to providing to the buyer;\n- determination of the overall contract price;\n- allocation of the overall price to each performance obligation;\n- recognition of revenue and the related costs when a performance obligation is met.\n\nSales of parts and tools are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, which corresponds to the date control is transferred, according to the specific terms of each contract or order.\n\nThe Group has selected the main transactions and contracts that represent its current and future activities. These transactions and contracts have been analyzed according to the five-step model required by the standard, particularly to identify areas of judgment. The conclusions of this analysis are outlined below.\n\nFor a particular automotive project, the three main commitments made by the Group to a manufacturer, generally identified during the preliminary analysis, are as follows:\n\n- product study, which includes determining the intrinsic technical specifications of the parts as well as those related to the associated production process;\n- provision of production tools, such as molds and other equipment used for manufacturing parts;\n- supply of parts.\n\nThe analysis concluded that these three phases are distinct performance obligations for which the Group recognizes revenue upon delivery/completion. In most cases, each performance obligation has a specific legal contract. Each contract is therefore independent, and after fulfilling the performance obligation, the manufacturer can opt out of the other contracts related to the same references without penalty, demonstrating the distinct nature of these performance obligations. When multiple performance obligations are combined in a single contract, the Group's policy is to set the price for each performance obligation independently. This approach mitigates the risk of loss if a contract is terminated after a specific service is completed.\n\nRevenue from tools is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is considered satisfied when the customer validates the conformity of the tool. Until this transfer is completed, production costs are capitalized up to the billable amount to the customer.\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Transaction prices are allocated to the performance obligations based on the contractual prices specific to each obligation as described above. Given the independence of the contracts and the risk of the manufacturer opting out of executing the other legal contracts, the Group negotiates with manufacturers for each contract based on standalone prices.\n\nAs for contributions received from clients on development costs and prototypes, they are now presented on the \"Turnover\" line as they result from a contract with a customer to obtain, in exchange for consideration, goods or services derived from the Group's regular activities. Moreover, the guarantees given are not optional.\n\n#### **Guarantees:**\n\nFurthermore, the Group considers that the contractual promise made to the manufacturer regarding the warranty of supplied parts does not meet the definition of a distinct performance obligation as it does not entail an \"additional service.\" Therefore, warranty costs will continue to be recognized in accordance with IAS 37 \"Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\"\n\n#### **Agent/Principal Distinction:**\n\nThe use of subcontracting is limited due to the degree of integration within the Group. When subcontracting occurs, the Group bundles subcontracted products into larger groups and therefore remains responsible for providing the goods or services as the principal.\n\nFor certain specific contracts, upon reviewing the relationship with the end customer, the Group considers itself to be acting as an agent rather than a principal.\n\n#### **Other points:**\n\n- customer contracts do not include a \"financing\" component;\n- revenue recognition rules do not rely on significant estimates.\n\n#### **1.7.2. Personnel expenses**\n\nPersonnel expenses include temporary staff costs and employee profit-sharing.\n\n#### **1.7.3. Territorial Economic Contribution**\n\n<span id=\"page-184-0\"></span>Both CVAE (contribution on the added value of enterprises) and CFE (business property tax) are classified as operational expenses.\n\n#### **1.7.4. Current operating income**\n\nThe Group primarily uses current operating income as a performance indicator.\n\nThe current operating income corresponds to the net income before taking into account:\n\n- various income and expenses, which mainly include significant restructuring costs;\n- gains and losses and changes in provisions covering exceptional events, either because they are abnormal in amount or impact, or because they occur rarely;\n- gains or losses on disposals or depreciation of assets;\n- non-current impairments of goodwill, where the event leading to the impairment is non-current;\n- of the financial income;\n- current and deferred taxes;\n- the net income of associated companies.\n\nThis presentation is in line with the recommendation of the French Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) No. 2013-03 dated November 7, 2013.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.8. Earnings per Share**\n\nEarnings per share is calculated based on the average number of shares in circulation during the financial year, using the net income attributable to the Group.\n\nDiluted earnings per share takes into account potential shares resulting from the exercise of rights attached to issued subscription warrants. As at December 31, 2023, there were no new shares that could potentially be created, as no subscription options were outstanding or exercised.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-185-0\"></span>**1.9. Financial Instruments — Financial Assets and Liabilities, Derivatives**\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented in several sections of the balance sheet (non-current financial assets, customers, other current assets, trade payables, other current debt, financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents). Financial instruments are allocated to categories that do not correspond to identified sections of the balance sheet, with the allocation determining the rules for recognition and measurement.\n\nPresentation of the three categories of financial assets: see *note [1.6.4.](#page-179-0)*\n\nThe main financial liabilities (mainly loans and trade payables) are evaluated at amortized cost.\n\nThe Group has not implemented hedging instruments meeting the definition of hedge as provided in IFRS 9.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, financial instruments are presented in three categories (see *note [22](#page-203-0)*), according to a hierarchy of methods for determining fair value:\n\n- Level 1: Fair value calculated by reference to unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities;\n- Level 2: Fair value calculated by reference to observable market data for the asset or liability concerned, either directly (adjusted Level 1 quoted prices), or indirectly through data derived from pricing techniques based on observable data such as prices of similar assets or liabilities or parameters quoted in an active market;\n- Level 3: Fair value calculated by reference to data relating to the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data (e.g. based on valuation techniques relying in whole or in part on unobservable data such as prices in an inactive market or valuation based on multiples for unquoted securities).\n\nThe application of this standard to calculate the fair value of financial instruments did not result in identifying adjustments due to non-performance risk (counterparty risk and own credit risk) compared to previous calculations.\n\n#### **1.10. Segment Information**\n\nThe Group has defined only one business segment, which is the design, production and delivery of components, parts or functions for the automotive industry.\n\nThe Group has identified five geographical regions to allocate resources to different sectors and to assess their performance:\n\n- France;\n- Europe and Africa;\n- North America;\n- South America;\n- Rest of the world.\n\nThese regions were determined based on their geographical proximity, their similar economic characteristics, and their contribution to the Group's revenue and income.\n\nThe breakdown of revenue and assets by geographical areas is provided in *note [3.1](#page-189-0)*.\n\nGeographical data tracked in the Group's management reports is limited to investments only.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 The Group's revenue depends directly on the level of automotive production worldwide, particularly in Europe, North America, Türkiye and China. This production can be affected by the general economic situation, government programs (notably vehicle purchase incentives), trade agreements, regulatory changes, and social issues (including strikes and work stoppages). In addition, the Group does 67% of its business directly with the three automakers (Stellantis, Ford and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi). The performance of these three manufacturers therefore has a considerable impact on the Group's revenue.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-186-0\"></span>**1.11. Cash Flow Statement**\n\nThe Group applies the indirect method of presenting cash flows, following a presentation similar to the model proposed by the French Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) in its recommendation 2013-03 of November 7, 2013.\n\nThe cash flows for the financial year are divided between cash flows generated by operating activities, investing activities and equity transactions.\n\nThe cash flow statement is prepared based on the following rules:\n\n- net cash corresponds to the net of debit and credit positions;\n- capital gains and losses are presented net of tax when the Group incurs a tax liability;\n- provisions for current assets are recorded in the changes in operating flow of working capital and are allocated to the corresponding asset items (inventory, accounts receivable, other current or non-current receivables).\n- property, plant and equipment acquisitions are presented net of changes in liabilities related thereto. Income from disposals is presented net of changes in receivables from fixed asset disposals;\n- increases in assets related to usage rights (IFRS 16) are offset against increases in lease liabilities;\n- repayments of lease-related debts are presented in financing cash flows;\n- the interest paid on lease liabilities is presented under \"Changes in debt,\" similar to other interest payments.\n\nThe impact of changes in consolidation scope is presented as a net amount in investment cash flows. It corresponds to the price actually paid/received during the financial year, adjusted for the acquired cash assets/liabilities.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.

Provisions Related to Technical and Commercial Risks**\n\nNotes 1.6.11 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Accounts\n\n#### Identified Risk\n\nAs the Group is present in several countries and is a supplier to numerous automotive manufacturers, it is exposed to risks inherent in its business, particularly regarding commercial and industrial considerations.\n\nWith this in mind, the Group may encounter uncertain, litigious or contentious situations, particularly in the context of technical risks and recall campaigns carried out by automobile manufacturers.\n\nThe estimation of risks is regularly reviewed by the Group's management. Incomplete identification and/or incorrect assessment of a risk could result in the Group overestimating or underestimating its provisions.\n\nAt the close of the 2023 financial year, other provisions for risks and charges amounted to €56.1 million and are primarily related to technical and commercial risks. We considered the evaluation of provisions related to technical and commercial risks to be a key audit matter due to the potential financial impact on the Group and management's judgment in estimating the risks and the amounts recognized.\n\n#### Responses Provided during Our Audit\n\nOur work predominantly included:\n\n- Obtaining external confirmations from attorneys to identify the litigations and contentious situations involving the Group;\n- Reviewing the Group's risk analysis, corresponding documentation and, where applicable, the written consultations of its external advisors;\n- Conducting interviews with the product line director responsible for technical risks;\n- Assessing the main risks identified and examining the soundness of the assumptions made by management in estimating the amount of provisions recognized, based on the information collected.\n\n# **Specific Checks**\n\nAdditionally, in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, we performed specific checks required by legal and regulatory texts regarding the information related to the Group provided in the Executive Board's management report.\n\nWe have no comments to make concerning their accuracy and their consistency with the consolidated accounts.\n\nWe hereby certify that the consolidated Non-Financial Performance Statement, as required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code, is included in the information related to the Group provided in the management report. It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L.823-10 of said code, the information contained in this statement has not been subject to verification by us for accuracy or consistency with the consolidated accounts and must be subject to a report by an independent third-party.\n\n# **Other Checks or Information Required by Legal and Regulatory Texts**\n\n#### **Presentation Format of the Consolidated Accounts Intended for Inclusion in the Annual Financial Report**\n\nIn accordance with the professional standard on the auditor's procedures relating to the annual and consolidated accounts set out in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), we also verified the compliance of this format as defined by the Delegated European Regulation No 2019/815 of December 17, 2018 in the presentation of the consolidated accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, prepared under the responsibility of the President of the Executive Board. With regard to consolidated accounts, our procedures include verifying the compliance of the tagging of these accounts with the format defined by the aforementioned regulation.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 We are unable to conclude on the compliance of the presentation of the consolidated accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report with ESEF. Indeed, we were unable to perform the necessary procedures to verify this compliance for the following reason: the ESEF-formatted accounts intended for inclusion in the financial report were not provided in time to allow for the organization of the verification work.\n\n#### **Appointment of Statutory Auditors**\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of AKWEL by the Ordinary General Meeting of February 23, 2004 for Mazars, and by the Ordinary General Meeting of June 24, 2005, for Orfis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Mazars was in the 20<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of engagement, and Orfis was in its 19<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of engagement.\n\n# **Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Accounts**\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing consolidated accounts that provide a true and fair picture in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. It is also tasked with implementing the internal control it deems necessary to ensure the consolidated accounts are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated accounts, management is obligated to assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and overseeing the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as internal audit—where applicable—in relation to the procedures involved in preparing and processing accounting and financial information.\n\nThe consolidated accounts have been approved by the Executive Board.\n\n# **Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors Relating to the Audit of the Consolidated Accounts**\n\n#### **Audit Objective and Approach**\n\nWe are tasked with preparing a report on the consolidated accounts. Our goal is to achieve reasonable assurance that the consolidated accounts, as a whole, are free from material misstatements. Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance, but there is no guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if it could reasonably be expected that they, individually or collectively, could impact the economic decisions made by users relying on these accounts.\n\nAs specified by Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our certification engagement does not involve guaranteeing the viability or quality of your company's management.\n\nIn the context of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- it identifies and assesses the risks of significant misstatements in the consolidated accounts whether due to fraud or error, defines and implements audit procedures to address these risks, and gathers sufficient and appropriate evidence to support its opinion. The risk of not detecting a significant misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than that of a significant misstatement resulting from an error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, deliberate omissions, misrepresentations or circumvention of internal controls;\n- it reviews the relevant internal control for the audit to define appropriate audit procedures in the circumstances, not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control;\n- it assesses the appropriateness of the accounting methods adopted and the reasonableness of management's accounting estimates, as well as the information concerning them provided in the consolidated accounts;\n- it evaluates the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the information collected, determines whether there is significant uncertainty regarding events or circumstances that could raise doubts about the company's ability to continue operating. This assessment is based on the information collected up to the date of its report; however, it should be kept in\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 mind that subsequent events or circumstances could challenge the going concern assumption. If it determines that there is significant uncertainty, it will draw the attention of readers to the information provided in the consolidated accounts regarding this uncertainty. In cases where such information is not provided or is irrelevant, it issues a qualified opinion or declines to certify;\n\n- it evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated accounts and assesses whether they accurately reflect the underlying transactions and events to provide a true and fair picture;\n- regarding the financial information of persons or entities included in the consolidation scope, it gathers sufficient and appropriate evidence to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. It is responsible for directing, overseeing and conducting the audit of the consolidated accounts, as well as for the opinion expressed on these accounts.\n\n#### **Report to the Audit Committee**\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report outlining the scope of our audit work and the executed work plan, as well as the conclusions resulting from our work. Additionally, we bring to its attention any significant weaknesses in internal control that we have identified regarding procedures related to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.\n\nIncluded in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of significant misstatements that we deem to have been the most important for the audit of the consolidated accounts for the period. These risks represent the key audit areas, which we are responsible for describing in this report.\n\nFurthermore, we provide the Audit Committee with the declaration required under Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 confirming our independence, in accordance with the applicable rules in France as defined primarily by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code and the code of ethics for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks to our independence and the safeguard measures implemented.\n\n*The Statutory Auditors*\n\nMazars In Annecy on April 29, 2024\n\nJérôme Neyret\n\nOrfis In Villeurbanne on April 29, 2024\n\nJérôme Neyret Jean-Louis Flèche\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-209-0\"></span>**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — AKWEL**\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-210-0\"></span>**BALANCE SHEET**\n\n*Financial Statements as at December 31, 2023 (in* \n\n*thousands of euro)*\n\n| ASSETS                                                   | Notes | Gross<br>Amounts | Amort./Depr<br>ec. or<br>Provisions | 12/31/23 Net<br>Amounts | 12/31/22<br>Net<br>Amounts |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Intangible Assets                                        | 3.1   | 16,957           | 14,941                              | 2,016                   | 2,133                      |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment                            | 3.1   |                  |                                     |                         |                            |\n| Land                                                     |       | 989              | 188                                 | 801                     | 806                        |\n| Buildings                                                |       | 29,018           | 18,806                              | 10,212                  | 9,245                      |\n| Technical installations, equipment and toc               |       | 174,505          | 150,062                             | 24,443                  | 27,212                     |\n| Other property, plant and equipment                      |       | 21,844           | 18,742                              | 3,102                   | 3,080                      |\n| Work in progress, advances and<br>prepayments            |       | 2,678            | -

Presentation of AKWEL and Key Events in the Financial Year**\n\nAKWEL's activities include designing, developing and producing tools and parts, which are mainly sold to French and international automobile and heavy-vehicle manufacturers. Its mission is to act as a designer, manufacturer and assembler of functional components. AKWEL, as the Group's parent company, also coordinates the industrial and financial activities of all the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nThe annual accounts are prepared in thousands of euro.\n\nFor the past financial year, significant operations or events concerning the scope or organization include:\n\n- an increase in turnover linked to the growth in global automobile production;\n- an increase in value-added and EBITDA, owing to a reduction in warranty return costs and the passing on of price increases (transport, energy, wage inflation) to our customers;\n- recognition of a provision allowance of up to €9.2 million for the closure of the Gournay site offset by a reversal of the provision for warranty return risks amounting to -€4.6 million;\n- significantly negative financial income impacted by write-downs of securities and current accounts (primarily related to one of the subsidiaries in Sweden).\n\n# **2. Accounting Principles and Valuation Methods**\n\n#### **2.1. Accounting Principles**\n\nThe accounts as at December 31, 2023 are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in France and take into account ANC Regulation 2023-05 of November 10, 2023 amending ANC Regulation No. 2014-03 related to the General Accounting Plan.\n\nThe general accounting conventions have been applied while adhering to the principle of prudence, in accordance with the following basic assumptions:\n\n- going concern;\n- consistency of accounting methods from one financial year to the next;\n- independence of financial years.\n\nFurthermore, the general rules for preparing and presenting annual accounts have been followed.\n\nThere have been no changes in accounting methods during the financial years presented.\n\n#### **2.2. Fixed Assets and Depreciation**\n\nFixed assets are valued at their acquisition or production cost.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.2.1. Intangible Assets**\n\nResearch and development expenses are recorded as expenses in the financial year during which they are incurred.\n\nGoodwill is recorded based on its transfer value. Goodwill listed on the balance sheet is subject to a depreciation provision when the inventory value is lower than the book value. The inventory value is determined based on criteria related to the observed profitability and future prospects of the relevant activity. After applying Regulation 2002-10 on January 1, 2005, AKWEL no longer amortizes goodwill listed as an asset on the balance sheet.\n\nMicrocomputer software is amortized over a period of 12 months. Other software or expenses incurred while setting up a new information system (SAP) are capitalized and amortized over a period of three years.\n\nPatents are amortized over their protection period.\n\nAKWEL performs impairment tests on its goodwill each year.\n\nThe useful life of goodwill is presumed to be indefinite.\n\nAKWEL depreciates the value of an asset when its current value (the higher of fair value and value in use) falls below its net carrying amount.\n\n#### **2.2.2. Tangible Assets**\n\nDepreciation of tangible assets is calculated over the useful life of the assets, using either the straight-line method or the declining-balance method.\n\nThe main depreciation periods selected can be summed up as follows:\n\n- buildings: 25 to 40 years;\n- building fixtures: 5 to 10 years;\n- technical installations: 5 to 10 years;\n- industrial equipment and tools: 5 to 10 years;\n- general installations: 10 years;\n- furniture and office equipment: 5 to 10 years.\n\nAdditional depreciations resulting from the application of tax provisions (declining-balance, extraordinary) are treated as accelerated depreciation, which is recognized under \"Regulated provisions.\"\n\n#### **2.2.3. Financial Assets**\n\nEquity investments and other equity interests are recorded on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost.\n\nEquity investments are subject to a provision for impairment when their value in use appears to be lower than their book value. The value in use of equity investments is assessed using several criteria, in particular including equity, multiples of EBITDA, and growth and profitability prospects.\n\n#### **2.3. Receivables Concerning Associated Companies**\n\nAs of January 2, 2002, the Group has established cash management agreements among all its subsidiaries. Such agreements stipulate that all matured and unpaid intra-group commercial receivables and debts are treated as cash advances. As the settlement of these advances is not scheduled, they are recognized under the headings \"Receivables concerning associated companies\" or \"Payables related to investments.\"\n\nThe receivables are measured at their nominal value and may be impaired, in connection with the analysis conducted on the equity investments, to reflect the risks of non-recovery to which they may give rise based on the information available at the closing date of the accounts.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.4. Inventory**\n\nInventory is valued at the purchase price for raw materials using the first in, first out method, and at the factory cost price for finished goods and work in progress. Cost price excludes overheads that do not contribute to production and financial expenses.\n\nProvisions are made as necessary for inventory at risk of obsolescence or for which the cost exceeds the realization value. Tools are valued at full cost (external costs) up to the billable price to customers.\n\n#### **2.5. Accounts receivable**\n\nReceivables and payables are valued at their nominal value. Provisions for doubtful receivables are determined based on the age of unrecovered receivables. A provision is also recorded whenever a real and serious dispute is identified, or when a customer becomes subject to legal proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, provisions for the impairment of accounts receivable are calculated based on the age of the outstanding invoices, following these guidelines:\n\n- provision equal to 25% of the amount excluding taxes of unrecovered receivables for receivables overdue by more than 150 days but less than 360 days;\n- provision equal to 100% of the amount excluding taxes of unrecovered receivables for receivables overdue by more than 360 days.\n\n#### **2.6. Provisions for Liabilities and for Expenses**\n\nIn general, management has reviewed every known dispute involving AKWEL as at the balance sheet date. Where appropriate, after consulting with external advisors, provisions deemed necessary have been made to hedge the estimated risks.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>**2.7. Pension Obligations**\n\nRights acquired by employees for end-of-career bonuses are not adjusted. However, they are valued and their amount at the end of the financial year is disclosed as financial commitments (see *5*[.1\\)](#page-223-0).\n\nThe amounts of rights acquired by employees under various applicable collective agreements are assessed based on assumptions (changes in salary, retirement age, mortality, staff turnover), then discounted to their present value based on a discount rate. The assumptions were made based on a discount rate of 3.22% (compared to 3.84% at year-end 2022), a salary increase of 2.5% (compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022) for both executives and nonexecutives, a retirement age of 67 and average assumptions regarding staff turnover. AKWEL has assessed the impact of Law No. 2010-1330 of November 9, 2010 concerning pension reform on the valuation of its employee commitments. After examining the characteristics of its employee population (age, date of entry into employment, career profile, etc.), AKWEL has maintained the assumption of a retirement age of 67. Long-service awards are not subject to provisions for liabilities and expenses because the corresponding commitments are not significant. The collective agreements applicable to AKWEL's establishments do not provide for this obligation, and AKWEL's practices in this area remain incidental.\n\n#### **2.8. Extraordinary Expenses and Income**\n\nExtraordinary income includes, in particular, income and expenses resulting from events or transactions clearly distinct from the company's ordinary activities and that, as such, are not expected to occur frequently or regularly. Extraordinary expenses and income include, in particular, allocations or reversals related to accelerated depreciation, proceeds from asset disposals, and income and expenses unrelated to ordinary activities.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.9. Foreign Currency Transactions**\n\nForeign currency expenses and income are recorded at their equivalent value on the transaction date. Foreign currency receivables and payables are valued at the exchange rate in effect at the closing date. The difference resulting from the revaluation of foreign currency payables and receivables at the closing rate is recognized in the balance sheet as translation adjustment. Unrealized exchange losses are treated as provisions for liabilities.\n\n#### **2.10. Tax Consolidation**\n\nAKWEL has entered into a tax consolidation agreement with its French subsidiaries with a direct or indirect holding of over 95%.\n\nThis agreement, which first came into effect on December 22, 2011, was signed as part of AKWEL's choice for the Group regime as defined in Articles 223 A et seqq. of the French General Tax Code. Each fiscally integrated company is placed in the situation it would have been in if it had been taxed separately. The additional tax savings or expense resulting from the difference between the tax owed by the consolidated subsidiaries and the tax resulting from the determination of the consolidated result is recorded by AKWEL.\n\nThe application of the tax consolidation regime resulted in a net tax savings of €193,147 in 2023 for the scope of consolidation.\n\n# **3.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are described in the \"Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the annual accounts\" section of this report.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nWe carried out our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules set forth in the French Commercial Code and the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of issuance of our report. We did not provide any services prohibited under Article 5 Paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n#### **Justification of Assessments — Key Audit Matters**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180 of the French Commercial Code concerning the justification of our assessments, we wish to bring to your attention the key audit matters related to the risks of material misstatement. The latter, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the annual accounts for the year, as well as the responses we provided to address these risks.\n\nThese assessments are made in the context of the audit of the annual accounts taken as a whole and in the formation of our opinion expressed above. We do not express an opinion on individual components of these annual accounts.\n\n#### **Valuation of Equity Investments and Receivables Concerning Associated Companies**\n\nNotes 2.2.3., 2.3 and 3.2 of the notes to the annual accounts\n\n#### Identified Risk\n\nEquity investments and receivables concerning associated companies are reported on AKWEL's balance sheet as at December 31, 2023, for a net amount of €233.2 million.\n\nEquity investments are recognized at their acquisition cost and are impaired when their estimated value in use at the end of the reporting period is lower than their carrying amount. The value in use of equity investments is assessed using several criteria, in particular including equity, multiples of EBITDA, and growth and profitability prospects. This assumption requires management to exercise judgment, particularly when based on forecast items.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties associated with forecast items used in these calculations, we have considered the evaluation of equity investments, and by extension, the receivables related to them, to be a key point of our audit.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Our Response\n\nWe have reviewed the controls implemented by the company to estimate the value in use of equity investments. Our work predominantly included:\n\n- comparing the proportional share of net assets used to determine the values in use of equity investments to data derived from the accounting records;\n- verifying, when values in use were determined based on forecast elements, that their estimation was based on an appropriate valuation method;\n- assessing the soundness of the main assumptions used in estimating values in use through discussions with Management;\n- checking the arithmetic accuracy of the value-in-use calculations performed by the Company;\n- assessing the recoverability of receivables related to the results of impairment tests for equity investments.\n\n#### **Evaluation of Provisions Related to Technical and Commercial Risks**\n\nNotes 2.6 and 3.10 of the notes to the annual accounts\n\n#### Identified Risk\n\nAs a first-tier supplier to numerous automotive manufacturers, the company is exposed to risks inherent in its business, particularly regarding commercial and industrial considerations.\n\nWith this in mind, the company may encounter uncertain, litigious or contentious situations, particularly in the context of technical risks and recall campaigns carried out by automobile manufacturers.\n\nThe estimation of risks is regularly reviewed by the company's management. Incomplete identification and/or incorrect assessment of a risk could result in the company overestimating or underestimating its provisions.\n\nAt the close of the 2023 financial year, provisions for disputes amounted to €32.2 million and are primarily related to technical and commercial risks. We considered the evaluation of provisions related to technical and commercial risks to be a key audit matter due to the potential financial impact on the company and management's judgment in estimating the risks and the amounts recognized.\n\n#### Responses Provided during Our Audit\n\nOur work predominantly included:\n\n- Obtaining external confirmations from attorneys to identify the litigations and contentious situations involving the company;\n- Reviewing the company's risk analysis, corresponding documentation and, where applicable, the written consultations of its external advisors;\n- Conducting interviews with the product line director responsible for technical risks;\n- Assessing the main risks identified and examining the soundness of the assumptions made by management in estimating the amount of provisions recognized, based on the information collected.\n\n#### **Specific Checks**\n\nWe have also conducted specific checks in accordance with the applicable professional standards in France, as required by legal and regulatory texts.\n\n#### **Information Provided in the Management Report and in Other Documents on the Financial Position and Annual Accounts Addressed to Shareholders**\n\nWe have no observations to make as to whether the information provided by the Executive Board in the management report and other financial documents sent to shareholders accurately matches the annual accounts.\n\nWe attest to the accuracy and consistency with the annual accounts of the information regarding payment terms mentioned in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n#### **Corporate Governance Report**\n\nWe certify the presence, in the Supervisory Board's corporate governance report, of the information required by Articles L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\nRegarding the information provided in accordance with the provisions of Article L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code concerning the remuneration and benefits paid or attributed to corporate officers, as well as commitments made in their favor, we have verified their consistency with the accounts or the data used to prepare these accounts and, where appropriate, with the information gathered by your company from the companies controlled by it that are included in the scope of consolidation. Based on this work, we confirm the accuracy and sincerity of this information.\n\nWith regard to the information on items that your company has considered could potentially be impacted in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange offer, provided in accordance with the provisions of Article L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code, we have verified their conformity with the documents from which they originate and that have been shared with us. Based on this work, we have no comments to make on this information.\n\n#### **Other Information**\n\nIn accordance with the law, we have ensured that various information regarding the identity of shareholders or voting rights holders and reciprocal interests has been communicated to you in the management report.\n\n#### **Other Checks or Information Required by Legal and Regulatory Texts**\n\n#### **Presentation Format of the Annual Accounts Intended for Inclusion in the Annual Financial Report**\n\nIn accordance with the professional standard on the auditor's procedures relating to the annual and consolidated accounts set out in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), we also verified the compliance of this format as defined by the Delegated European Regulation No 2019/815 of December 17, 2018 in the presentation of the annual accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, prepared under the responsibility of the President of the Executive Board.\n\nWe are unable to conclude on the compliance of the presentation of the annual accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report with ESEF. Indeed, we were unable to perform the necessary procedures to verify this compliance for the following reason: the ESEF-formatted accounts intended for inclusion in the financial report were not provided in time to allow for the organization of the verification work.\n\n#### **Appointment of Statutory Auditors**\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of AKWEL by the ordinary general meetings of February 23, 2004 for Mazars, and June 24, 2005, for Orfis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Mazars was in the 20th consecutive year of engagement, and Orfis was in its 19th year.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Annual Accounts**\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing annual accounts that provide a true and fair picture in accordance with French accounting rules and principles. It is also tasked with implementing the internal control it deems necessary to ensure the annual accounts are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts, management is obligated to assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and overseeing the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as internal audit—where applicable—in relation to the procedures involved in preparing and processing accounting and financial information.\n\nThe annual accounts have been approved by the Executive Board.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors Relating to the Audit of the Annual Accounts**\n\n#### **Audit Objective and Approach**\n\nWe are tasked with preparing a report on the annual accounts. Our goal is to achieve reasonable assurance that the annual accounts, as a whole, are free from material misstatements. Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance, but there is no guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if it could reasonably be expected that they, individually or collectively, could impact the economic decisions made by users relying on these accounts.\n\nAs specified by Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our certification engagement does not involve guaranteeing the viability or quality of your company's management.\n\nIn the context of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- it identifies and assesses the risks of significant misstatements in the annual accounts whether due to fraud or error, defines and implements audit procedures to address these risks, and gathers sufficient and appropriate evidence to support its opinion. The risk of not detecting a significant misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than that of a significant misstatement resulting from an error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, deliberate omissions, misrepresentations or circumvention of internal controls;\n- it reviews the relevant internal control for the audit to define appropriate audit procedures in the circumstances, not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control;\n- it assesses the appropriateness of the accounting methods adopted and the reasonableness of management's accounting estimates, as well as the information concerning them provided in the annual accounts;\n- it evaluates the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the information collected, determines whether there is significant uncertainty regarding events or circumstances that could raise doubts about the company's ability to continue operating. This assessment is based on the information collected up to the date of its report; however, it should be kept in mind that subsequent events or circumstances could challenge the going concern assumption. If it determines that there is significant uncertainty, it will draw the attention of readers to the information provided in the annual accounts regarding this uncertainty. In cases where such information is not provided or is irrelevant, it issues a qualified opinion or declines to certify;\n- it evaluates the overall presentation of the annual accounts and assesses whether they accurately reflect the underlying transactions and events to provide a true and fair picture.\n\n#### **Report to the Audit Committee**\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report outlining the scope of our audit work and the executed work plan, as well as the conclusions resulting from our work. Additionally, we bring to its attention any significant weaknesses in internal control that we have identified regarding procedures related to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.\n\nIncluded in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of significant misstatements that we deem to have been the most important for the audit of the annual accounts for the period. These risks represent the key audit areas, which we are responsible for describing in this report.\n\nFurthermore, we provide the Audit Committee with the declaration required under Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 confirming our independence, in accordance with the applicable rules in France as defined primarily by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code and the code of ethics for statutory auditors.

Twenty-Third Resolution**\n\n*(Authorization to be given to the Executive Board to implement a share buyback program pursuant to Articles L.22-10-62 et seqq. of the French Commercial Code.)*\n\nThe General Meeting, deliberating under the quorum and majority conditions required for ordinary general meetings, having reviewed the Executive Board's report, authorizes it to acquire shares of the Group, in compliance with the conditions and obligations set forth in Articles L.22-10-62 et seqq. of the French Commercial Code, as well as Articles 241-1 to 241-6 of the General Regulation of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.\n\nThe Company may acquire its own shares on the market or off-market, and sell all or part of the shares thus acquired, subject to the following limits:\n\n- The total number of shares held shall not exceed 10% of the total number of shares composing the share capital. It is specified that this limit shall apply to an amount of the Company's share capital adjusted, if necessary, to take into account operations affecting the share capital during the authorization period. The acquisitions made by the Company shall in no case allow it to directly or indirectly hold more than 10% of its share capital;\n- The number of shares used to calculate the 10% limit mentioned above corresponds to the number of shares purchased, net of shares resold during the authorization period;\n- The unit purchase price shall not exceed €50 (excluding acquisition costs). However, the Board of Directors may adjust the aforementioned maximum purchase price in the event of the incorporation of reserves, profits or share premiums, merger or contributions, or any other amounts whose capitalization would be permitted, resulting in either an increase in the share's par value, the creation and free allocation of shares and in the event of a split of the share's par value, or a consolidation of shares, or any other transactions affecting shareholder equity to take into account the impact of these transactions on the share value;\n- Shares may be acquired, sold or transferred by any means, on the market or over the counter, including by acquisition or sale of blocks, under conditions authorized by the market authorities. These transactions may be performed at any time in compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory provisions.\n\nAs a result, the maximum amount of funds allocated to the buyback program amounts to €123,863,000, calculated based on the share capital as at April 4, 2024 and the 196,844 treasury shares held on the same date.\n\nThe General Meeting decides that these redemptions may be made for the following purposes:\n\n- to ensure a liquid market for the Company's securities through an investment services provider, acting independently under a liquidity contract that complies with regulations;\n- to retain the shares repurchased and subsequently reissuing them in exchange for or as payment in connection with merger, demerger, provision or external growth operations;\n- to potentially cancel some or all of the shares repurchased, under the conditions provided for by law;\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 to implement any market practice that may be permitted by regulations, and more generally carrying out any transaction that complies with the regulations in force, in which case the Group will inform its shareholders by means of a press release.\n\nThe Executive Board is granted full authority, with powers to subdelegate, to:\n\n- Assess the appropriateness of implementing this delegation;\n- Determine the conditions and terms of acquisition and disposal, including the price of the shares purchased;\n- Carry out, by any means, the acquisition, sale or transfer of these shares, and place orders on the stock exchange;\n- Conclude any agreements, especially to maintain the registers of share purchases and sales, making all necessary declarations to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers and any other relevant body, and complying with all formalities;\n- Establish, where appropriate, the description of the communication plan related to the implementation of the buyback program and publish it in accordance with the provisions of Article 221-3 of the same regulation, prior to the implementation of a buyback program;\n- In general, do everything necessary to perform and implement this decision.\n\nThis authorization is granted for a period of 18 months from the date of this General Meeting, i.e. until November 23, 2025.\n\nThis authorization terminates, with immediate effect, for the unused portion and replaces the authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 25, 2023 in its 20th resolution of ordinary business to proceed with the purchase of its own shares by the Group.\n\n# **2. Extraordinary Business**\n\n#### **2.1.

        | 24  |\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>**MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD**\n\n#### Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nAfter celebrating the Group's 50th anniversary, we have entered a new decade by reaffirming our **values** (*Simplicity, Reliability, Collaboration and Performance*), pushing forward our **mission** (*AKWEL manufactures reliable, eco-friendly and competitive products to help its customers offer more environmentally friendly vehicles*) and adopting a **vision** (*AKWEL wants to be a trusted third party recognized by its customers and shareholders, thanks to the pride and autonomy of its teams*), in order to affirm our identity and share it with all our stakeholders.\n\nFor AKWEL in general, and for its teams in particular, 2023 has once again been a complicated year in terms of maintaining an acceptable financial situation in a highly inflationary environment and protecting our fundamentals: the security of our teams and tools, the satisfaction of our customers and the effort to bring about change that the market demands of us. I would therefore like to thank all those who have worked so hard throughout the year, who have committed themselves to the Group's present and future, and who have put their skills into action, as there have been some excellent achievements as a result. We have had to face problems that we have solved, but which have underscored our limitations and our need to improve time and time again, in an increasingly complex and unpredictable environment.\n\nIn a rapidly evolving, unstable and challenging automotive and truck market, new players are positioning themselves. The demand for us to stand out from our competitors continues to rise, with ever-increasing competition to renew sales. All this drives us to reinvent ourselves, to imagine new actions to be taken, to invest for the future, to incorporate new expertise, and to innovate.\n\nIn 2024, we will be introducing new key initiatives such as the AKWEL Academy to bolster the skills and commitment of our employees and managers. We will continue our efforts to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, particularly in relation to Scope 3, by working with our suppliers to achieve our targets. Our business will become ISO 27001 and Tisax certified to demonstrate the soundness of our IT and cybersecurity policy. We will increase our use of green electricity to replace fossil fuels and move closer to the end of fuel consumption. We will reduce our water consumption and integrate more green materials into our products. We will continue our remanufacturing and repair projects for our most complex products, so that they can be given a second life. And to keep pace with market trends and new product needs, we will continue to develop our industrial facilities and production resources by opening new plants and possibly restructuring.\n\nWe will continue our efforts to adapt in the face of new market demands in such a fast-changing environment, with the motto \"Between possible and impossible, there are only two letters' difference and a state of mind.\"\n\n> Mathieu Coutier President of the Executive Board\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>**ADMINISTRATION, MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION**\n\n| André Coutier                                              | President of the Supervisory Board      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Nicolas Job                                                | Vice-President of the Supervisory Board |\n| Geneviève Coutier                                          | Member                                  |\n| Émilie Coutier                                             | Member                                  |\n| COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT<br>represented by Christophe Coutier | Member                                  |\n| Guillaume Wesolowski (*)                                   | Member                                  |\n| Anne Vignat Ducret                                         | Member                                  |\n\n# **1.

Presentation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts**\n\n#### **Accounting Standards**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the AKWEL Group (hereinafter the \"Group\") were prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.\n\nDuring the year, the Group adopted the mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations over the reporting period. These texts had a limited impact on the Group's net income and financial position.\n\n### **1.1. Significant Events during the Reporting Period**\n\n### **1.1.1. Vigorous Growth in Europe**\n\nIn an automotive production market up by 5.7% in 2023, the Group posted turnover of €1,066.4 million, an increase of +7.7% as reported compared to the previous year. This is a return to a level close to that of 2019, the last year before the health crisis and the global market downturn. On a like-for-like basis with constant exchange rates, the increase in annual turnover was +9.6%. Growth was particularly noticeable in France and Europe, while North America's figures were slightly down. The most dynamic product lines were cooling, fuel and decontamination, thanks in particular to the successful repositioning on gas and hybrid vehicles. The Group's top three customers (Stellantis, Ford and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi) accounted for 73.1% of its business, compared to 65.9% in 2022 (on a like-for-like basis). Overall, the Group's top ten customers accounted for 88.2% of its turnover (87.9% in 2021). The Group's two largest markets in terms of sales were France and the United States.\n\n# **1.1.2. Highlights of Financial Year 2023**\n\nDuring the past financial year, significant operations and events in terms of scope or organization were as follows:\n\n- Decision to close the Gournay plant;\n- The gradual impact on our customers of price increases for raw materials and other costs.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.2. Analysis of the Consolidated Annual Accounts**\n\nThe consolidated key figures for financial year 2023 were as follows:\n\n| (in thousands of euro)   | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022<br>(restated)* |\n|--------------------------|------------|---------------------------|\n| Turnover excl. tax       | 1,066.4    | 989.5                     |\n| Current operating income | 61.0       | 37.2                      |\n| Operating income         | 49.3       | 36.3                      |\n| Net income, Group share  | 35.7       | 25.3                      |\n| Cash flow                | 84.7       | 46.9                      |\n\n(\\*) The 2022 annual accounts have been restated (*see consolidated annual accounts, not[e 1.3.1.1](#page-173-0)*).\n\nThe value-added ratio rose to 38.0% of turnover, compared to 36.1% in 2022. This improved performance is due to higher sales prices, which partially offset increases in material costs.\n\nPersonnel costs, including those for temporary staff and any employee profit-sharing, amounted to €298.4 million, up 9.7% compared to the previous financial year. This increase was mainly due to wage inflation.\n\nEBITDA amounted to €101.9 million, up 26.1% compared to the previous financial year. At 9.6% of turnover, EBITDA for 2023 was 1.4 points higher than that of 2022.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to €38.6 million, compared to €40.5 million in 2022.\n\nNet allocations to provisions amounted to €(2.3) million, compared to €(3.1) million in 2022.\n\nCurrent operating income stood at €61.0 million, up 64.1% compared to the previous financial year. At 5.7% of turnover, profitability for financial year 2023 saw a net increase on the previous year (3.8%).\n\nOther revenue and non-current expenses amounted to €(11.8) million, compared to €(0.9) million in 2022. The recognition of restructuring costs for €9.2 million, linked to the closure of the Gournay site, weighed heavily on financial year 2023.\n\nThe cost of net financial debt remained stable at €0.3 million.\n\nOther financial income and expenses represented an expense of €0.1 million, compared to an income of €2.1 million in 2022.\n\nThe income tax expense amounted to €13.0 million, the same as in 2022.\n\n#### **1.3. Analysis of the Group's Financial Position, Particularly Its Debt Position**\n\nNet income, Group share amounted to €35.5 million, compared to €25.3 million in 2022 (restated figure). Net profitability stood at 3.3%, up from 2.5% in 2022.\n\nNet cash, including lease obligations, amounted to €105.0 million, compared to €113.7 million in 2022. Gross cash amounted to €151.5 million, compared to €166.5 million in 2022.\n\n#### **1.4. Investment Policy**\n\nShareholders' equity stood at €610.3 million, compared to €593.3 million (restated) the previous financial year. This accounted for 69.1% of the balance sheet total (and over 83% excluding cash and cash equivalents).\n\nNon-financial investments amounted to €59.3 million, compared to €33.2 million the previous financial year.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>**1.5. Significant Events since the Financial Year-End and the Date of Preparation of the Management Report**\n\nNo significant events have occurred since the financial year-end and the date of preparation of the management report.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>**1.6. Foreseeable Trends and Future Prospects**\n\nFinancial year 2024 should continue along the same lines as 2023, with stable automotive production in the European and North American markets. The Group anticipates stable turnover and profitability compared to 2023.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-9-2\"></span>**1.7. Risk Factors**\n\nThe Group has reviewed the risks that could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial position, results, prospects or ability to achieve its objectives, and considers that there are no significant risks other than those presented.\n\nThe criticality of the risks presented has been assessed in terms of the likelihood of occurrence and the financial impact on the Group, taking into account the risk mitigation measures implemented by the Group (net risks).\n\nThe results are classified into four categories (major, high, moderate and low) and presented by theme in the remainder of this chapter.\n\nHowever, other risks may exist or arise of which the Group is unaware as at the date of this financial report, or the occurrence of which is not considered likely, as at such date, to have a material adverse impact on the Group, its business, financial position, results or prospects.\n\nThere are no risk factors specific to the Group; its main risks are inherent in a business that operates almost entirely in the automotive original equipment industry.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.7.1.

Details of the Group's Main Risks**\n\nThis section describes the main general risks facing the Group. The risk categories listed below are not presented in order of importance.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1. Operational Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.1. Risks related to dependence on the automotive industry and customers*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's turnover depends directly on the level of automotive production worldwide, particularly in Europe, North America, Türkiye and Asia. This production can be affected by the general economic situation, government programs (notably vehicle purchase incentives), trade agreements, regulatory changes, and social issues (including strikes and work stoppages).\n\nIn addition, the Group does 61% of its business directly with the two automakers Stellantis and Ford. The performance of these two manufacturers therefore has a considerable impact on the Group's revenue.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a major impact on the Group.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nA downturn in the automotive market, or a change in regulations, tariffs, taxes or other trade barriers or restrictions in the regions where the Group and its customers operate, could lead to a decline in the Group's results and/or the failure of some of its customers or suppliers, and affect its financial position.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThe Group operates in 20 countries. It also benefits from the diversification of its sales by region, customer, and vehicle make and model, which reduces its exposure to unfavorable trends in any one of its markets.\n\nThe Group is working to expand its customer portfolio.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.2. Supplier risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is dependent on its suppliers to manufacture the products it sells to its customers. Securing operations by managing supplier risks remains a major strategic challenge for the Group.\n\nAgainst the current backdrop of geopolitical, economic and regulatory tensions, operational risks (quality and logistics) are compounded by the risk of failure of suppliers weakened by successive crises and the global economic slowdown.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nAs the Group's production is partly dependent on its suppliers, this risk could have a negative impact on the Group's results, as it would be unable to deliver to customers products that meet their expectations in terms of quality and quantity.\n\nSuch a situation would have a negative short-term financial impact, with a drop in sales, as well as an unfavorable non-financial impact, with damage to the Group's reputation.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nFaced with the risks of shortages, supplier failures or supply chain disruptions, the Group has implemented a purchasing and supplier location strategy aimed at reducing the Group's dependence on a single supplier and/or country. As a result, the top direct supplier, the top five and the top ten respectively account for 4%, 18% and 28% of the Group's production purchases.\n\nThe integration of suppliers into the pool and the monitoring of supplier performance comply with current quality standards, in order to minimize the risks inherent in suppliers. Selection criteria include financial, quality, logistical, environmental, ethical, social, technical and logistical parameters, as well as dependence on the Group.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.3. Risk related to the development and launch of new products*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is subject to the risks inherent in the development and launch of new products. The Group may face issues related to project management, from design to industrialization, including the management of modifications after order intake.\n\nOwing to its international activities, the Group is also exposed to risks related to possible changes in legislation or regulations affecting its products in all or part of its markets, or in export control systems.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a high impact on the Group.\n\nFailure to deliver innovative solutions on time, or to meet changing standards, or to deliver products expected by customers on time, could damage the Group's reputation and affect its financial position.\n\nThe Group could also be subject to administrative and criminal sanctions, and customers and/or suppliers could temporarily or permanently suspend their activities.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nBefore acceptance, all new projects are subject to a standardized profitability analysis, with profitability and return on investment criteria set by the Executive Board. Once a project has been accepted, it is monitored from startup to series production, with milestones at which all financial and technical data are analyzed and corrected if necessary.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.4. Risks of cyber-attacks and information system failures*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe development, implementation and uninterrupted performance of the Group's hardware, network, website and other IT systems, including those that may be supplied by third parties, play an essential role in the Group's business, in particular purchasing and shipping management, production, customer order processing, plant performance monitoring, and new product design and development.\n\nThe Group is also dependent on its IT systems in the financial and administrative fields (invoicing, reporting, consolidation operations).\n\nRisks to information systems may take the form of attacks on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data and transactions processed by information systems (system malfunction, data theft, destruction or loss of data integrity).\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a high impact on the Group.\n\nThere are many sources of the disruptions likely to affect the Group's business, many of which are beyond the Group's control; notably:\n\n- loss of power and failure of telecommunication systems;\n- software and hardware errors, failures, defects or interruptions;\n- computer viruses and similar disruptive problems;\n- fires, floods and other natural disasters;\n- network attacks or damage to computer systems, software and other systems that are carried out by hackers or cybercriminals;\n- the performance of third-party suppliers.\n\nAny disruption or significant slowdown in the Group's information systems may:\n\n- result in the loss or delayed transmission of information, including data relating to customer orders and deliveries;\n- have a material adverse impact on the Group's business (delays in product delivery to customers), financial position and operating results, as well as on its reputation and image.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThe Group has implemented a series of safeguards, processes and regular analyses to mitigate the impact of a potential key system outage and to optimize its resilience:\n\n- incident monitoring;\n- backup and restoration of all application environments;\n- preventive maintenance plan;\n- business continuity plan.\n\nTo guard against cyber-attacks, cyber threats and cyber espionage, information systems security has been reinforced by the implementation of a security policy (ISSP), technical protection (firewalls, antivirus) and risk prevention through employee awareness-raising and training.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nAll the rules governing the use of information systems are set out in the Group's Charter for the proper use of IT resources, and applied by all users of the Group's information systems and technological tools.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.5. Risks related to dependence on new models*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nSupply contracts with automakers take the form of open orders for all or part of a vehicle model's equipment requirements, with no guarantee of volume. They are awarded separately for each vehicle function, and are generally valid for the life of the model.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a low impact on the Group.\n\nThe Group's turnover, results and financial position could be affected by the commercial failure of a model and/or by the fact that the Group is not selected for a new generation of models. In addition, in certain cases the manufacturer may reserve the right to change supplier at its own discretion during the life of the model.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThese risks are widespread, as the Group offers a wide range of products, installed or used on a large number of vehicle types.\n\n#### *1.7.2.1.6. Risks related to changes in the technological environment*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's growth depends on its ability to anticipate technological and/or regulatory developments, and to adapt to profound changes and disruptions in the automotive market.\n\nThe automotive industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change.\n\nThe Group is currently in the process of adapting some of its products to meet the decarbonization objectives of the automotive market and to comply with current commitments and potential future requirements in terms of climate impact mitigation (no more registrations of new combustion-engine vehicles from 2035).\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a major impact on the Group.\n\nThe unanticipated acceleration of a technology on the market, or difficulties in the internal development of a new technology, would prevent the Group from seizing opportunities linked to technological breakthroughs, and could impact the Group's competitive positioning, growth and profitability.\n\nThere could be a material adverse impact on the Group's business, operating results and financial position if it is unable to offer its customers products that allow them to participate in the electrification of vehicles, while ensuring that its products remain competitive and affordable to customers.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\n<span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>In order to prevent the occurrence or limit the impact of such risks, the Group implements the following measures in particular: technology monitoring to regularly keep up-to-date on the latest technologies and their marketing;\n\n- identifying different product developments and trends, particularly in electric vehicles, and the opportunities that the Group may have with them;\n- investing in research and innovation.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *1.7.2.2. Financial and Market Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.1. Interest rate risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's activities could be affected by changes in interest rates. In the normal course of its business, the Group raises funds on the markets and also makes use of bank loans.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThe Group's net income may be influenced by changes in interest rates, insofar as these have a direct impact on the cost of debt.\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThe Group has little exposure to interest rate risk as virtually all its debt is at fixed rates.\n\nA one-point change in benchmark indexes would have an impact of less than €350 thousand on the amount of financial interest paid.\n\n<span id=\"page-14-0\"></span>Therefore, no interest rate hedges have been set up.\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.2. Foreign exchange risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nAs it operates in an international context, the Group may be subject to \"operational currency risk,\" due to the location of some of its production sites and to the purchase or sale of materials and components, or the sale of production from these sites, in currencies other than the functional currencies of entities carrying out transnational operations.\n\nIn addition, the financing requirements of foreign subsidiaries outside the euro area, covered by intra-Group loans, expose certain Group entities to \"financial exchange risk\" (risk arising from changes in the value of financial debts or receivables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the borrowing or lending entity).\n\nLastly, the Group is subject to translation risk arising from the contribution of subsidiaries whose operating currency is not the euro to the Group's consolidated income. The sales, income and cash of these subsidiaries, when translated into euro, are sensitive to variations in the exchange rate of their reporting currency against the euro.\n\nThe main currencies used are the euro (39.9% of business) and the US dollar (30.2% of business).\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nIn order to minimize the impact of exchange rates, the Group makes purchases in the operating currencies of each entity whenever possible, and stipulates an exchange rate pass-through in its contracts with customers. Where this is not the case, exchange rate impacts are the subject of commercial discussions, which generally result in the majority of the differences being passed on to its sales prices.\n\nTherefore, no currency hedges have been set up.\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.3. Liquidity risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nAt all times, the Group must have sufficient financial resources to finance its day-to-day business and the investments required for its development, as well as to deal with any exceptional events.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk arises mainly from its obligations to repay its existing debt, finance its future needs and comply with its financial ratios.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nIn order to manage its liquidity risk, the Group relies on the funds at its disposal. It can also tap into the capital markets through, on the one hand, long-term resources to secure all its net debt over a long period (medium-term credit lines) and, on the other hand, short-term financial instruments (account discounts, authorized overdrafts).\n\nThe share of medium-term loans granted to the Group, subject to compliance with financial covenants since 2014, accounts for almost all medium-term debt. Ratios are calculated mainly on the basis of the annual consolidated annual accounts.\n\nOver the past 15 years, these covenants have always been respected. In addition, AKWEL's cash position is monitored on a daily basis, and that of its subsidiaries is monitored on a monthly basis.\n\nAs current assets far exceed current liabilities, no information is provided on maturities of less than one year.\n\nThe Group believes that it is in a position to meet its future maturities.\n\n#### *1.7.2.2.4. Risks related to the prices of raw materials and components*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's business requires the purchase of significant quantities of raw materials, which are highly vulnerable to financial, geopolitical and climatic risks. Inflation, shortages, and procurement management, which have been priorities since 2020, seem to be showing signs of easing, but the situation remains fragile due to recent geopolitical events (Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Red Sea crisis, Ukraine). The main raw materials used by the Group are plastics, rubber, elastomers and steel, plus electronic components subject to long lead times.\n\nThe components that the Group purchases are also largely subject to the same risks as those observed for raw materials.\n\n2023 also saw significant increases in transport costs, as a result of difficulties linked to the geopolitical context. In addition, CSR and sustainability issues have become more and more prevalent through regulations, which generate additional costs for purchasing as a whole.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nAs price fluctuations are volatile, uncertain and unpredictable, they cannot always be passed on in full to the customer. In addition, the Group bears the majority of any additional costs arising from circumstantial operational difficulties and/or from occasional supplier issues, as well as costs relating to long-term purchases.\n\nAs Group purchases account for over 50% of the Group's turnover, there is a considerable risk of a decline in the Group's operating margin if these additional costs are not taken into account by our customers.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nMost of the contracts signed with our customers do not provide for a mechanism that passes on all variations in our purchasing costs. Nevertheless, occasional negotiations with our customers allow us to minimize the impact on our operating margin, albeit with an average delay of six months and a negative impact on our WCR.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *1.7.2.2.5. Customer risks*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nGiven the economic context of the automotive sector, the Group cannot rule out the possibility that several of its customers may be unable to honor certain contracts, or find themselves in a difficult financial situation.\n\nPotential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk has a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nEvery month, the Finance Department publishes a statement of receivables outstanding and overdue by customer, as well as a summary statement of disputes by entity. Our finance and sales teams' high level of awareness of these issues has resulted in very few bad debts (see *[13](#page-197-0)*).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, late payments represented €5.7 million, or 0.5%, of consolidated turnover for the year.\n\n#### *1.7.2.3. Environmental Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.3.1. Environmental impact of sites and climate change*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group's sector of activity is not a major source of harm against the natural environment, does not require significant use of the natural resources near the Group's operations, and has no significant impact on environmental quality.\n\nThe Group's business, in the various countries in which it is conducted, is subject to diverse and evolving environmental regulations requiring it to comply with increasingly strict environmental protection standards concerning emissions into the air and water, the use of hazardous substances and waste disposal.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nAs part of this approach, the Group has implemented an environmental policy based on the ISO 14001 standard. Plant general managers are responsible for managing and monitoring environmental risks, in coordination with the Manufacturing Performance VP.\n\n#### *1.7.2.4. Legal Risks*\n\n#### *1.7.2.4.1. Risks related to non-conformity of products sold*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is responsible for the safety and quality of the products it markets.\n\nDespite the internal procedures implemented to identify defective products, the Group cannot rule out all cases of manufacturing defects (non-compliance with specifications or the legitimate expectations of its customers), or even serious defects.\n\nIn such cases, the Group could be exposed to the risk of warranty or liability claims from its customers with regard to the products sold.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to the risk of liability claims in the event of damage caused by defects in the products and services sold.\n\nThis risk tends to be higher both in terms of frequency and cost, particularly with the volume effect linked to the pooling of products (platforms, partnerships between customers).\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a moderate impact on the Group.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more of these risks, and in particular any significant increase in product returns, could adversely affect the Group's business, results, financial position, development, prospects and image.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nTo protect itself against this risk, the Group has taken out a third-party liability insurance policy covering the financial consequences of such claims. However, the Group's liability toward its customers is usually unlimited, whereas insurance coverage is systematically capped. There is therefore a theoretical residual risk.\n\nIn addition, a reasonable provision has been made for current risks.\n\n#### *1.7.2.4.2. Intellectual property risks (patents and trademarks)*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group holds numerous patents and trademarks.\n\nInfringement, whether intentional or unintentional, is a risk to which the Group is exposed in terms of intellectual property.\n\nIt may entail:\n\n- third parties counterfeiting industrial products patented by the Group;\n- unintentional acts on the part of the Group, given the length of time it takes third parties to publish patent applications.\n\nFinally, the Group also faces the risk of its trademarks being infringed.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nThis risk could have a low impact on the Group.\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nWherever possible, and whenever the technological stakes so justify, the Group's industrial know-how and innovations are patented in order to protect industrial property.\n\nThe geographical scope and duration of protection are in line with industry practice and adapted to the needs of the operating entities; they are systematically and regularly reviewed.\n\nWhere the risk of infringement exists, this approach is an effective legal weapon in the fight against it.\n\nThe Group steadfastly defends its rights against infringement, and these measures serve as a basis for initiating legal proceedings or taking action itself to stop and punish infringements of the Group's intellectual property rights.\n\nThe Innovation Department is responsible for managing the risk of unintentional active infringement.\n\nIn the event of active infringement, current developments or even products recently launched on the market could also be affected. The Group would be forced to increase the research and development costs for the project, or to negotiate rights of use for the patented component.\n\n#### *1.7.2.4.3. Business ethics and compliance*\n\n#### Risk Identification and Description\n\nThe Group is particularly attentive to the values of business ethics and compliance. Owing to its international presence, the Group may be impacted by legislation with a possible extraterritorial impact and extensive criminal risk.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the Group\n\nIf the Group were to be questioned on these issues, it could have a significant impact on its reputation — both on the financial markets and as an employer brand — and on its business and its financial position.\n\nThis risk could have a moderate impact on the Group.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nWith the Ethics Charter and the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct as its basis, the Group—via its General Management—is committed to promoting its values and ethical behavior, particularly with regard to the risks of corruption.\n\nThe Group's ethical commitments are therefore formalized and detailed in the Ethics Charter, which sets out the essential rules of conduct and ethics that apply to all employees and partners.\n\nTranslated into the Group's various languages, this Ethics Charter is given to each new employee and can be viewed on the Intranet.\n\nAll Group employees and managers are required to comply with the Ethics Charter, and to ensure that it is shared and respected by their colleagues.\n\nThe Group has a whistleblowing procedure, which was updated during the year following the entry into force of the Waserman Act of March 21, 2022.\n\n#### **1.8. Insurance and Risk Coverage**\n\nThe Group has taken out insurance policies with reputable, solvent insurance companies to cover the risks arising in the normal course of its business, at levels the Group deems appropriate in view of its size and the risks involved. All companies of which the Group has over 50% ownership, or for which the Group is responsible for insurance, are covered by these insurance policies.\n\nWhere necessary, these insurance policies are backed by local policies in all the countries in which they operate.\n\nAll Group insurance policies are negotiated and coordinated by the Group's Legal VP, who is responsible for identifying the Group's insurable risks, assessing their potential consequences for the Group, and designing and structuring appropriate insurance policies with the help of leading insurance brokers within international networks.\n\nThe Group's insurance policies are designed to cover the main risks that could affect its business, results or assets, providing the following coverage:\n\n- property damage and business interruption insurance;\n- operations and product liability insurance, with the exception of new claims concerning SCR tanks;\n- directors' and officers' liability insurance;\n- insurance covering specific risks (vehicle fleet, *auto-mission* cover [coverage of employees' personal vehicles when used for work], transport of goods, employee travel).\n\nThe Group's insurance policies contain exclusions, ceilings and deductibles that could expose it to adverse consequences should significant events occur or legal action be brought against it.\n\nIn addition, the Group may be required to indemnify third parties for damages not covered by its insurance policies, or it may incur significant expenses that may not be covered or be insufficiently covered, under its policies.\n\nSince January 1, 2023, the loss ratio and tougher market conditions have led to a sharp increase in premiums and in the deductibles applicable in the event of a recall.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>**1.9. Research and Development Activity**\n\nIn 2023, the Group continued to devote significant resources to Research and Development. Research and Development costs amounted to €62.6 million, or 5.9% of consolidated turnover, compared to €58.5 million in 2022.\n\nThese Research and Development costs have been recognized as an expense, as they do not meet all the criteria required by accounting standards for capitalization.\n\nThe Group benefited from a research tax credit of €0.9 million (€1.1 million in 2022).\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe main areas of focus of our Research and Development activities are aimed at providing solutions to environmental issues, in particular:\n\n- the prevention and treatment of pollutant emissions;\n- reducing CO<sup>2</sup> emissions (by designing lighter parts, for example);\n- solutions compatible with biofuels or that meet the requirements of hybrid or electric vehicles;\n- eco-design and product recycling.\n\n# **2. Presentation of the Corporate Annual Accounts**\n\nThe corporate annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles applicable in France.\n\n#### **2.1. Group Position and Activity during the Year — Balance Sheet and income statement**\n\nTurnover amounted to €362.2 million, up 12% compared to the previous year. This increase in turnover is partly due to the growth in business (an approximately 12.5% increase in automotive production in Europe), but is also due to price increases for materials and energy purchases being passed on to sales prices.\n\nValue-added amounted to €92.3 million, up 24.4% compared to the previous year. It stood at 25.5% versus 22.9%. In 2022, value-added was negatively impacted by purchase price increases that could not be passed on to sales prices.\n\nTaxes amounted to €4.2 million, up 14.6% compared to the previous financial year, mainly due to an increase in nonrecoverable withholding taxes.\n\nPersonnel costs amounted to €58.4 million, down 3.3%. They accounted for 16.1% of turnover, compared to 18.7% in 2022, due to the adaptation of resources to business volumes.\n\nEBITDA amounted to €29.7 million, compared to €10.1 million the previous financial year. This level is a direct reflection of the costs and events described above. Depreciation and amortization amounted to €9.4 million, compared to €10.5 million in 2022. This trend is logical, given the reduction in investment levels over the past few financial years.\n\nNet allocations to (reversals of) provisions amounted to €(8.5) million, compared to €(0.6) million in 2022, impacted in particular by the announced closure of the Gournay site.\n\nIn view of the above, the operating result amounted to €11.5 million, compared to €(1.5) million in 2022.\n\nFinancial income (loss) stood at €(12.7) million, compared to €(8.0) million in 2022. The Company's financial expenses increased due to the rise in interest rates in 2023.\n\nExceptional items amounted to €0.6 million, thanks to net reversals of special depreciation allowances and regulated provisions.\n\nThe Company posted an income tax income of €0.5 million for the financial year, compared to €0.3 million the previous year. A research tax credit of €0.9 million was recognized (€1.1 million in 2022).\n\nTaking into account the above items, the Company's net income (loss) amounted to €(0.09) million.\n\n#### **2.2. Analysis of the Company's Financial Position, Particularly Its Debt Position**\n\nTotal assets stood at €454.1 million, compared to €446.0 million in 2022.\n\nAcquisitions of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (net of changes in assets under construction) amounted to €7.8 million, compared to €6.8 million the previous financial year. This trend reflects the resumption of capital expenditure in the current financial year.\n\nAcquisitions of financial assets amounted to €26.2 million, compared to €37.8 million the previous financial year, as the financial needs of the Company's subsidiaries increased.\n\nIn view of the above, the Company's net debt stood at €174.4 million, compared to €173.7 million in 2022. The sharp decrease in outstanding loans over the year should be noted, falling from €40.6 million to €34.5 million in 2023. This level of debt still seems very reasonable in relation to the Group's size, assets and profitability, especially as €172.0 million, or 99%, is intra-group financing (compared to €173.7 million in 2022).\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nShareholders' equity before the allocation of income amounted to €138.3 million, compared to €147.0 million the previous financial year. Shareholders' equity accounts for 30.5% of the balance sheet total. The objective remains to eventually exceed 50%.\n\n#### **2.3. Significant Events since the Financial Year-End and the Date of Preparation of the Management Report**\n\nPlease refer to the chapter of the Group management report referred to in Section *[1.5](#page-9-0)*.\n\n#### **2.4. Foreseeable Trends and Future Prospects**\n\nPlease refer to the chapter of the Group management report referred to in Section *[1.6](#page-9-1)*.\n\n#### **2.5. Research and Development Activity**\n\nPlease refer to the chapter of the Group management report referred to in Section *[1.9](#page-18-0)*.\n\n#### **2.6. Income and Allocation**\n\nThe Ordinary General Meeting will be asked to approve the transactions reflected in the income statement and balance sheet submitted to it, and then to approve the allocation of the €(93,890.36) loss for the year.\n\nThis loss would be charged to retained earnings, which would be reduced from €79,778,839.63 to €79,684,949.27.\n\nIt is also proposed that a dividend of €8,022,312 be distributed among the shareholders, representing a gross dividend per share of €0.30.\n\nThis amount will be deducted in full from retained earnings, which will amount to €71,662,637.27 after such allocation.\n\nIt should be noted that this dividend is subject (unless the shareholder expressly requests otherwise, and provided it meets the criteria imposed by law) to the compulsory flat-rate withholding tax of 12.8%, imposed by Article 117 *quater*, as amended, of the French General Tax Code. The dividend is also subject to social security deductions at the rate of 17.2%.\n\nDividends are taxed either under the 30% flat-rate withholding tax system, which has already been deducted as indicated above, or, at the shareholder's option, under the income tax system after application, for natural persons domiciled in France for tax purposes, of the deduction provided for in Article 158, 3-2° of the French General Tax Code.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 243 *bis* of the French General Tax Code, we hereby inform you that the dividends distributed over the previous three financial years were as follows:\n\n| Financial Year Ended | Dividend per Share (in €) | Income Eligible or Ineligible for Tax Deduction |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2020    | 0.45                      | 40% deduction when applicable                   |\n| December 31, 2021    | 0.45                      | 40% deduction when applicable                   |\n| December 31, 2022    | 0.30                      | 40% deduction when applicable                   |\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 223 *quater* of the French General Tax Code, we ask you to approve the expenses and charges referred to in Article 39.4 of said Code, which amounted to €40,618 and resulted in a tax charge of €10,155 (at the rate of 25%).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.7.

Description of the Share Buyback Program**\n\nThis section describes the information that must be included in the description of the share buyback program pursuant to Article 241-2 of the General Regulations of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.\n\nAs the authorization granted by the Combined General Meeting of May 25, 2023 has been partially used, it is proposed that the Combined General Meeting of May 23, 2024 authorize a new Company share buyback program, the terms of which would be as follows:\n\n- securities concerned: AKWEL ordinary shares listed on Euronext Paris, compartment B, ISIN FR0000053027;\n- maximum purchase price: €50 per share;\n- the maximum amount of the transaction is therefore set at €123,863,000;\n- maximum share authorized for repurchase: 10% of the share capital, it being specified that this limit is assessed at the date of the buybacks in order to take into account any capital increases or reductions that may take place throughout the duration of the program.\n\nThe number of shares used to calculate this limit corresponds to the number of shares purchased.\n\nmaximum duration: 18 months from the date of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThese acquisitions may be made with a view to:\n\n- ensuring a liquid market for the Company's securities through an investment services provider, acting independently under a liquidity contract that complies with regulations;\n- retaining the shares repurchased and subsequently reissuing them in exchange for or as payment in connection with merger, demerger, provision or external growth operations;\n- potentially canceling some or all of the shares repurchased, under the conditions provided for by law;\n- implementing any market practice that may be permitted by regulations, and more generally carrying out any transaction that complies with the regulations in force, in which case the Company will inform its shareholders by means of a press release.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs the objective of retaining shares for subsequent reissue in connection with external growth transactions no longer qualifies as an accepted market practice under the new European regulations, it is not included in the draft resolution.\n\nDividends on shares will be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThese share purchases may be carried out by any means, including the acquisition of blocks of securities, and at the times deemed appropriate by the Executive Board.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to use options or derivatives in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\n#### **2.18.

Major Contracts**\n\nOver the past three years and as at the date of this document, the Company has not entered into any major contracts, other than those entered into in the ordinary course of business, that would give rise to a significant obligation or commitment for the Group as a whole.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3. Internal Control and Risk Management Procedures**\n\nIn accordance with Article 117 of Law 2003-706 of August 1, 2003 supplementing Article L. 225-68 of the French Commercial Code, this section of the report is descriptive and does not include an assessment.\n\n#### **3.1. Reminder of the Group's Objectives in Terms of Internal Control Procedures**\n\nThe Group's internal control procedures and organization are designed to:\n\n- ensure that management actions, the performance of operations and the behavior of employees are consistent with the guidelines set for the activities of the business by the management bodies, by applicable laws and regulations, and by the internal values, standards and rules of the business;\n- verify that the accounting, financial and management information provided to the Group's management bodies accurately reflects the activity and situation of the business.\n\nOne of the objectives of the Group's internal control system is to prevent and control risks arising from the Group's activities, as well as risks of error or fraud, particularly in the accounting and financial fields. Like any control system, however, it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that these risks have been totally eliminated.\n\nThe control and management of the risks associated with the Group's activities are based on the following principles:\n\n- a decentralized operational organization based on plants grouped by industrial region and on product lines in order to promote industrial performance, responsiveness and customer proximity;\n- an annual budget procedure and monthly reporting procedure that are essential for the Group in managing its operations;\n- widespread and frequent risk-awareness training for all personnel;\n- strong cross-functional departments responsible for enforcing Group policies within their scope, and monitoring their effective application;\n- plants specialized by production technology, to reinforce and accelerate experience curves;\n- formal delegation by the President of the Executive Board of the control and management of certain risks to the Directors most concerned;\n- separation of functions (between operational and support functions, between those who incur expenses and those who record and settle them, between those who do and those who control, etc.);\n- setting targets in line with global or internal best practices, and regularly measuring the gap between performance and these targets;\n- the involvement of all hierarchical levels and all sites in improving performance and controlling activities.\n\nIn addition, Group employees are made aware of their ethical obligations through the welcome booklet, the Ethics Charter, the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, the Stock Market Code of Ethics, and the Group IT Charter.\n\nIn addition, each site has its own rules of procedure, which are widely distributed to all employees.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **3.2. Analysis of the Internal Control Environment**\n\n#### **3.2.1. Summary Description of the General Organization of Internal Control Procedures**\n\nThe President of the Executive Board delegates some of his powers to the various Directors.\n\nProcedures are established by the Group. The Group distinguishes between two categories of procedures: those relating to a function (e.g. financial procedures) and those relating to a process (delivery, handling of nonconformities, etc.). There are 11 processes that have been identified within the Group (five customer-oriented processes and six support or management processes). They cover all the Group's activities (from promoting the Group to new customers to improving the performance of our suppliers). There are 33 mandatory indicators (21 performance indicators and 12 efficiency indicators) that cover these 11 processes, allowing us to verify that these operating procedures have been properly implemented and are performing well.\n\nThese procedures are available on an Intranet-type network, allowing them to be shared immediately to all those concerned.\n\nInternal Group memos may supplement, detail or reiterate these procedures.\n\nThe cross-functional departments manage the organizational processes and ensure that they are properly implemented. At least once a year, they are required to report to the Executive Board on the results achieved within their scope.\n\nThe Quality, Safety, Environment and Energy Department (QSE²) ensures that these procedures are properly applied, by monitoring periodic reporting and carrying out internal audits.\n\nThe Finance Department ensures that accounting and financial standards are properly applied.\n\nThe Internal Audit function ensures compliance with directives, methodologies and any other instructions issued by operational or cross-functional departments. It reports directly to the Legal Department.\n\nIn addition, each Group site has its own health, safety and working conditions committee. Each committee meets regularly to assess, propose and approve all measures relating to health, safety, working conditions and risk prevention.\n\nEach year, the Executive Board devotes at least two half-days to each cross-functional department and industrial region:\n\n- one to approve strategic options (Products, Markets, Customers, Action Plans) within the framework of Medium-Term Plans;\n- one to approve short-term financial options within the framework of budgets and year-end forecasts.\n\nFor all product lines, the Management Board devotes one day each year to reviewing and approving Research and Innovation activities (Product and/or Process).\n\nIn addition, since 2008, a specific half-day meeting has been held for each region. This meeting is dedicated to reviewing the main productivity actions implemented and those planned over the next 12 months.\n\n#### **3.2.2. Summary Description of Accounting and Financial Information Processing**\n\nAccounting and financial information processing is handled internally by the Finance Department.\n\nAccounting teams are either located at production sites or grouped together in Shared Services Centers (SSCs). The accounting teams, which are managed by the Director of Accounting & Tax, carry out three main activities:\n\n- customer relations (invoicing, collection, reminders, customer disputes)\n- supplier matters\n- general accounting and cash management.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe software used is an ERP (SAP). The accounting module (FI) benefits directly from these decisions. No significant specific developments have been carried out on this ERP.\n\nFinance Controllers are present at each of the Group's main sites. There is complete separation between the finance control and accounting teams, even though information is exchanged on an ongoing basis.\n\nReference manuals are used to prepare:\n\n- the annual accounts (general chart of accounts);\n- the consolidated financial statements;\n- the monthly internal financial reports.\n\nThe financial data provided are regularly verified by Group personnel.\n\nIn addition, our Statutory Auditors carry out an annual audit of the annual accounts as part of its legal audit obligation.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4. Non-Financial Performance Statement**\n\nIn accordance with Articles L. 225-102-5 and R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, the Company is required to produce a Non-Financial Performance Statement (NFPS) for the Group. The Non-Financial Performance Statement details the challenges, implemented approaches and indicators that the Group has decided to follow in order to monitor and control how its positive and negative impacts unfold. This statement is subject to mandatory verification by an independent third-party organization.\n\n#### **4.1.

Priority No. 5 is activity, which includes confirming the price/product potential per vehicle, expanding Akwel's business to cover new propulsion types to adapt to market trends, and increasing turnover.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis strategy is based on the Group's ability to capitalize on its expertise and mastery of materials to develop new products, the growing use of mechatronics, a constantly evolving organization, an ever finer understanding of customer needs, and the ongoing training of its teams.\n\nThe Group conducts its business in a constantly changing environment, with a wide range of challenges and stakeholders (customers, competitors, suppliers, local authorities, investors, etc.). The risks and opportunities (past, present and future) linked to our environment are identified, classified and handled in such a way as to give us control over our future.\n\n#### **4.2.8. Governance that Guarantees Independence**\n\nOn a comparable scale, the Group is one of the few parts manufacturers to remain family-owned. 69.7% of the Group's capital is held by the Coutier family, whose second generation is now at the helm. To preserve its independence and ensure its organization reflects its values, the Company's legal structure is built around a small governing body, comprising a Supervisory Board, an Executive Board and an Executive Committee.\n\nImage /page/38/Figure/5 description: The image shows an organizational chart. At the top left, a red box states, \"A family-owned group (69.7% of share capital held by the Coutier family) and a long-term corporate project.\" The chart shows the following structure: At the top center is \"MANAGEMENT.\" Connected to it are \"BOARD OF SURVEILLANCE\" and \"AFTERMARKET OROC,\" which includes \"Aftermarket,\" \"Manufacturers,\" and \"Distribution (SEIM).\" Below \"BOARD OF SURVEILLANCE\" are \"EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,\" \"Directions TRANSVERSAL\" (including \"Innovation,\" \"Trade,\" \"Purchasing,\" \"Quality,\" \"Finance,\" \"IT,\" and \"RH...\"), \"Management BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\" (including \"Materials Development,\" \"Product Development,\" and \"Product lines: Cooling, Fuels, Regulation, Air intake, Oil, Washing, Pollution control, Mechanisms...\"), and \"Management MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE\" (including \"Plants: America, Europe, Asia\" and \"Tools\"). Red lines connect \"MANAGEMENT\" to the other elements.\n\nThe President of the Executive Board manages:\n\n- the Executive Committee, which assists the Executive Board by formulating opinions and recommendations, and encourages discussions and the cross-functional sharing of best practices between the Group's business divisions;\n- the Group's topic-specific management committees (Safety, Environment and Energy; Quality; Engagement; Competitiveness and Sales);\n- the manufacturing performance department, which groups plants by geographical area;\n- the Business Development department, which oversees the product lines of cooling, decontamination, air and oil intake, fuel and control, mechanisms and washing, as well as material and product development;\n- the cross-functional departments, which provide assistance and consistency, ensure coherent strategies and optimize resources;\n- the Aftermarket division, dedicated to the after-sales market.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/39/Picture/1 description: The image contains a collage of text and images related to AKWEL's 50th anniversary.

Data Analysis Methodology**\n\nCorporate, social and environmental indicators are collected from each Group entity in accordance with the procedure described in the AKWEL Management System.\n\nThis data is then checked for robustness/consistency during consolidation by Head Office teams.\n\nUnless specifically excluded, the scope covered by the non-financial report includes all fully consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe methodology used follows GHG Protocol guidelines. Scopes 1 and 2 are consolidated, and the reference year for the Group is 2021.\n\nSince 2021, our consolidation tool has also allowed us to track Scope 3, concerning upstream activities related to the purchase of goods and services. We mainly track our consumption of plastics (process and packaging), rubber and metal. Although our current methodology is not based on specific emissions factors, our assessments show that Scope 3 is the largest contributor in terms of tCO2e for the Group. The calculations will be refined in future studies with the contribution of our suppliers, and the scope of indirect emissions categories will be expanded.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4.3.5. Our \"AKWEL being\" Commitment**\n\nReady to take on the challenge of sustainable development and the energy transition, AKWEL is a socially responsible company (in line with CSR requirements) that is committed to a secure future. Its \"AKWEL being\" approach highlights the actions rolled out over many years and provides guidance in terms of energy reduction, safety (in particular the STOP WORK approach), eco-innovation, developing the autonomy of its employees so they may \"GROW+\" and offering the \"AKWEL being at Work\" program to help employees become more involved in their missions and to provide them with a better quality of life at work and everyday well-being.\n\nImage /page/45/Picture/3 description: The image is a collage with a central circular design.

We specifically monitor green energy strategies for the following countries: Czech Republic, Türkiye, Morocco, Tunisia, India, China, Portugal, Romania, USA, Thailand.\n\n<sup>\\*\\*</sup>The reduction in electricity consumption per €K of gross production margin could be impacted by reduced use of natural gas for certain processes, in favor of processes using electricity.\n\n<sup>\\*\\*\\*</sup>The development of an electric alternative to gas boilers should lead to an improvement in the plant's emission factor. The development of products for electric vehicle cooling hoses (using plastics instead of rubber) will help reduce natural gas consumption, as the forming processes use electric furnaces.\n\n<sup>\\*\\*\\*\\*</sup>Standardization involves reducing the number of rubber hose structures. Reducing the number of startups has an impact on the production of startup scraps => economic production campaign. The reduction of production scraps is managed by plant action plans in the series phase (existing products) and in performance validation during production startup, from industrialization to ramp-up.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources used in AKWEL processes are essentially electricity, natural gas and water.\n\nWe take action with regard to two factors:\n\n- intrinsic equipment consumption;\n- activity-related consumption (in the sense of production volume).\n\n#### **Intrinsic Equipment Consumption**\n\nThe Group has defined equipment standards applicable to all plants. The fleet of plastic injection presses has been converted from hydraulic presses to electric or hybrid presses. All new investments (new projects or equipment renewal) are carried out based on AKWEL standards.\n\nAutoclaves (the equipment needed to vulcanize the rubber used in fluid transfer) come in three standard sizes to suit plant activity levels.\n\n#### **Activity-Related Consumption**\n\nTakt time can be taken into account as early as the product design and industrialization phase, allowing tooling to be sized as needed, with single-cavity tooling placed on a small press and continuous production (reduced production changeovers and energy consumption at production startup).\n\nBased on a philosophy of covering finished goods inventories (rather than just-in-time production), the Manufacturing Performance Department has introduced operating procedures and methods designed to make plant production more efficient. Finished goods inventories cushion fluctuations in customer demand and manufacturing contingencies.\n\nThe associated indicators relate resource consumption to gross production margin.\n\n**Between 2018 and 2023, electricity, gas and water consumption fell by -16%, -24% and -22% respectively, while waste production decreased by -19%.**\n\n#### *4.3.5.1.1. On-Site Waste Collection*\n\nAll sites have established contracts with waste collection providers, which include rules for sorting and recovery. Monthly monitoring and half-yearly consolidation are in place to track the quantities of waste generated and the proportion recycled and recovered.\n\n#### *4.3.5.1.2. Environmental Information*\n\nWe offer our customers innovative solutions and concepts designed to meet the challenges of environmental protection (lightweighting, decontamination) and energy efficiency (localized production, recycling).\n\nTo protect biodiversity and ecosystems, reducing our environmental impact and saving natural resources are an integral part of our activities. The various solutions and materials possible during development (use of sustainable resources, product recycling) are identified right from the product design phase.\n\nBy reducing transport and logistics operations that pollute and have an impact on climate change, our localized production strategy helps reducing the overall environmental and energy footprint of our products.\n\nEach of our facilities aims to act as a responsible manufacturer by reducing energy consumption, waste and scraps. Environmental and energy policies and objectives are adapted and defined locally, taking into account the specific features of each site.\n\nAll the Group's production sites are ISO 14001 certified. The Group sets quantified targets every year. These are defined for and adapted to each site. They are presented and approved during the QSE<sup>2</sup> Management Review of the entity concerned.\n\nThe information provided below covers all the Group's production sites.\n\nIn September 2022, the President of the Executive Board decided to expand the Group's monthly safety management committee to include environmental and energy issues.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Resource Consumption**\n\n| Consumption                       | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Water (m3<br>)                    | 720,482 | 782,102 |\n| Plastic materials (metric tons) * | 14,735  | 13,756  |\n| Metal materials (metric tons) *   | 21,960  | 17,477  |\n| Rubber materials (metric tons) *  | 18,534  | 22,208  |\n| Electricity (MWh)                 | 98,547  | 96,554  |\n| Gas (MWh)                         | 131,164 | 137,521 |\n| Fuel (MWh)                        | 2,842   | 3,103   |\n\n(\\*) Metric tons purchased in 2023 based on open orders.\n\n#### **Waste**\n\n| Waste                                        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Non-hazardous industrial waste (metric tons) | 21,237 | 15,767 |\n| Hazardous industrial waste (metric tons)     | 1,684  | 1,402  |\n| Waste recycling and recovery rate            | 85.7%  | 79%    |\n\nIn 2023, we observed an increase in the overall quantity of waste generated at our plants, in line with the growth in our business. This increase concerned plastic and metal, while our rubber consumption fell, which allowed us to improve our share of recycled or recovered waste.\n\nSince 2018, we have continued to reduce waste generation. The circular economy is part of the Group's strategy and will be one of the levers for improving the rate of recycled/recovered waste.\n\n#### **Climate Change: Greenhouse Gas Emissions — Adapting to the Consequences of Climate Change**\n\nFollowing the implementation of a tool to consolidate our carbon accounting in 2021 (using the GHG Protocol method), the Group was able to consolidate its accounting covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 under the Protocol. As the tool was optimized throughout 2021, it allowed us to obtain a relatively complete account for 2023 for the Group as a whole. This was comparable to 2021, with the exception of two administrative and sales offices, whose consumption is negligible at the Group level.\n\n| Carbon Accounting (in Metric Tons of CO2e) | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1: direct emissions                  | 28,258 | 28,743 |\n| Scope 2: indirect emissions                | 28,623 | 29,463 |\n| TOTAL                                      | 56,881 | 58,206 |\n\nTo best address the challenges associated with climate change, the Group uses 2021 data to bolster its environmental strategy.\n\nScope 1 emissions have decreased thanks to lower natural gas consumption. Scope 2 emissions have fallen mainly thanks to changes in country emission factors, in line with the Group's energy production mix. In the course of 2022, energy-saving action plans have been initiated at each of our sites.\n\nThe Group has an ISO 50001-certified energy management approach at six French sites (Beaurepaire, Champfromier, Monteux, Nesle, Romans and Vieux-Thann), with the aim of optimizing energy performance and reducing GHG emissions.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nSince January 2022, we have been committed to developing the use of green energy, particularly for electricity.\n\nIn 2023, Scope 3 for 2022 was consolidated for the France scope using the spend-based method. Although this method has a high error rate, it has allowed us to confirm that this scope represents the majority of the Group's emissions, accounting for 90% of total emissions.\n\nThe emission factor taken into account by each plant is based on the energy source used. For electricity, this factor depends on the method of production (nuclear, wind, solar, hydro, coal, etc.).\n\nIn 2023, our electricity supply contracts changed to use green sources. They are 100% green at our plants in Mexico and China, and at our new facility in Bulgaria. We are continuing this formalization process for other countries. Some countries (Sweden and France) already have low emission factors.\n\nIn addition, we are working on the installation of solar panels on the canopies of our plant parking lots, an initiative that could generate 10– 15% of our electricity consumption.\n\nIn 2023, some sites (Juarez and Ixtac in Mexico) began installing solar panels in their parking lots.\n\nNatural gas is the Group's other major energy source. Our switch from rubber products to thermoplastics has allowed us to use more green electricity, to the detriment of natural gas, whose emission factor does not change by its very nature.\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/8 description: This aerial shot captures a large, light-colored industrial building with a metallic roof, adjacent to a parking area covered with solar panels. The solar panels are arranged in multiple rows, providing shade for the parked vehicles below. To the right of the parking area, there are stacks of dark-colored pipes or cylindrical objects, possibly for industrial use. The surrounding ground is mostly dirt and gravel, with some sparse vegetation visible. The overall scene suggests a combination of industrial activity and renewable energy use.\n\n*Juarez site (Mexico)*\n\n#### **Energy-Saving Measures**\n\nAt the end of 2022, it was decided to standardize the continuous improvement plan for energy savings at all sites:\n\n- appointment of an energy specialist at all sites;\n- implementation of regular energy rounds and handling of discrepancies;\n- monitoring and analysis of energy consumption;\n- four posters on energy-saving best practices were distributed to raise awareness among Akwelis<sup>\\*</sup>;\n- nine priorities have been defined to structure the continuous improvement plan:\n\t- lighting,\n\t- heating and air conditioning,\n\t- processes,\n\t- organization,\n\t- behavior,\n\t- controls,\n\t- communication,\n\t- green energy,\n\t- fossil energy.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup>AKWEL employees\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Biodiversity Protection: Measures Taken to Preserve or Restore Biodiversity**\n\nNone of the Group's sites is located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. Their sites' activities have a limited impact on the surrounding natural environments. These environments are assessed through risk analyses carried out by each entity.\n\nThe Group collects and/or treats all waste that may have an impact on biodiversity.\n\n#### **Noise and Odor Pollution**\n\nIn accordance with applicable local regulations, our sites regularly measure noise emissions outside their plants. These emissions are assessed as part of each entity's risk analysis.\n\nOdor pollution is not considered significant in the Group's business, as the manufacturing activities of the Group companies concerned do not generally generate odors. The Group is not aware of any complaints on this subject.\n\n#### **Organization in Place to Deal with Pollution Accidents with Environmental Consequences**\n\nBased on risk analyses carried out at each site, the associated emergency situations have been identified. In most cases, these involve the risk of spills, fire or explosion. For each emergency situation, the steps to be taken to react and the prevention methods are identified, listed and formalized in the security plan or another document. They are tested periodically, as far as possible, on all personnel.\n\nIn addition, the QSE<sup>2</sup> Operational Control procedure has reinforced the following obligations:\n\n- identifying risk management approaches in the security plan for those risks that could halt the customer's delivery (including fire, serious pollution of the natural environment, flooding, etc.);\n- prohibiting smoking;\n- using a prevention plan for dangerous work and a fire permit;\n- having retention tanks under all storage facilities for liquid pollutants;\n- having spill kits in the event of pollutant spills at various points in the plant, and resins on the ground in most production areas;\n- having fire-fighting teams;\n- verifying the implementation of these \"instructions\" by carrying out LPAs.\n\nIn 2022, the French sites (Champfromier, Vieux-Thann, Romans, Beaurepaire, Gournay, Monteux, Villieux, Condé, Vannes) underwent an audit on the management of industrial plastic granules and obtained their certificate of conformity, published on the Group's website. By the end of 2022, all the instructions and protective measures that made it possible to obtain these certificates were rolled out at all AKWEL sites that use industrial plastic granules.\n\n#### **Expenses Incurred to Prevent the Environmental Consequences of the Group's Activities**\n\n| (in thousands of euro)                      | 2023   | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|-------|\n| Investments to prevent environmental impact | 14,100 | 4,245 |\n\nAs of 2019, various investments have been made to establish wastewater treatment centers in order to clean wastewater before discharging it into local networks. Replacing or purchasing equipment offers more energy efficiency, but also entails various waste management costs (treatment, storage).\n\nAt the same time, production sites have also incurred expenses to better optimize their energy consumption, either by carrying out studies to classify their energy performance and identify areas for improvement, or by financing installations following these studies (installation of new LED lighting, installation of new leakage containment equipment, purchase of waste recycling and sorting equipment).\n\nIn 2023, €14,100 thousand was invested, including €8,400 thousand in electric injection presses and €5,600 thousand in extrusion lines for electric vehicle cooling hoses.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Environmental and Energy Assessment and Certification Procedures**\n\nThe Group has an integrated management system covering Quality, Safety, Environment, Energy and Information Security.\n\nThe QSE<sup>2</sup> Department conducts internal audits of the management system at all Group entities (product lines, production sites and cross-functional departments).\n\nThird-party audits of the management system are carried out by an independent certification body, Bureau Veritas, with:\n\n- IATF 16949 and ISO 9001: certification of all our production sites and product lines, with the exception of the Bressolles site, which is certified to ISO 9001 only;\n- ISO 14001: Certification of all our production sites and product lines, with the exception of the Bressolles site;\n- ISO 50001: six French sites (Beaurepaire, Champfromier, Nesle, Monteux, Romans, Vieux-Thann);\n- ISO 27001: in 2024, certification of the Head Office and TISAX assessment for six international sites.\n\n#### **Training and Informing Employees about the Environment**\n\nAs part of the management system, raising awareness of environmental and energy consumption issues among all on-site personnel is an integral part of the Group's practices and operating methods.\n\n#### *4.3.5.1.3. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Remuneration Committee*\n\nAt its meeting on February 10, 2022, the Group's Supervisory Board decided to expand the scope of responsibility of the Remuneration Committee to include issues of Corporate, Environmental and Social Responsibility, and to change its name to reflect these new responsibilities. The first meeting of the CSR and Remuneration Committee was held on March 25, 2022.\n\nThe composition, performance and duties of the CSR and Remuneration Committee are presented in Section *2.3.1.2. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Remuneration Committee*, of the 2023 Annual Report.\n\nA Group management committee for health, the safety of people and tools, the environment and energy meets every month under the chairmanship of the President of the Executive Board and the guidance of the QSE<sup>2</sup> VP.\n\nA Group Human Resources Management committee meets every month under the chairmanship of the President of the Executive Board and the guidance of the HR VP.\n\nThese committees assess performance and progress, and take any necessary decisions. Minutes are also drawn up at these meetings.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>*4.3.5.2. \"AKWEL being\" Eco-Innovative*\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/2 description: This image shows a man with short brown hair and blue eyes.

In the center of the cycle is a green leaf.\n\nWe keep a close eye on environmentally responsible materials, including bio-sourced materials, in order to better meet our customers' needs, and on the use of recycled materials in order to minimize the use of new resources.\n\n#### *4.3.5.2.2. The \"REMANufacturing\" Project: the Circular Economy*\n\nAKWEL has implemented a circular economy to limit the waste of resources and its environmental impact at every stage of a product's life cycle. This is based on a number of factors, including increasing product lifespan through reuse, repair and recycling. This circular economy is known as \"REMANufacturing.\"\n\nImage /page/55/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of a module remanufacturing process. The diagram consists of five steps, numbered 1 through 5. Step 1 shows a garage/repairer. An arrow points from the garage/repairer to step 2, which shows a module remanufacturing line.

Bolster the safety of people and tools*\n\n<span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>In September 2021, the Group established the Group Safety Management Committee. It is chaired by the President of the Executive Board and led by the QSE<sup>2</sup> VP, who proposed the permanent members. This Committee may also call on occasional participants, depending on topics and needs.\n\nIn September 2022, the President of the Executive Board decided to include the issues of environment and energy in this Committee.\n\nIts aim is to oversee the safety of people and property, as well as environmental and energy issues, across the entire Group organization, rather than focusing solely on individual departments or processes. The Committee decides on the working groups to be established in order for the Group to make headway, and if necessary approves the conclusions, actions and decisions proposed. Depending on the topic, cross-functional, multi-disciplinary or departmental working groups deal with the issues at hand. The Committee meets once a month and follows a standard agenda (presentation of results; analysis of significant events; monitoring of escalations; progress of working groups; approvals; decisions; COVID-19 updates; environment and energy).\n\nAll subjects (personal safety, IT security, tool safety, building security, environment, energy, etc.) are now integrated into this Committee.\n\nIn 2022, the following topics were discussed and the corresponding standards were gradually rolled out in 2023 and will continue into 2024:\n\n- development of a STOP WORK approach: all Group employees are responsible for stopping any situation deemed to be dangerous;\n- bolstering of the culture of safety: development of a welcome and awareness program for new hires and visitors, implementation of appropriate standard support;\n- identification of high-risk activities and definition of mandatory behavior and actions for all golden rules;\n- machine and manual control safety, interference with moving parts and/or powered parts: cross-disciplinary best practices meeting the most demanding standards, rollout;\n- structuring to comply with CDP and EcoVadis;\n- visual management and wearing of protective equipment.\n\nThe Group uses a standard digital safety register for all its entities. This register now allows for a dynamic scorecard to be updated every week, noting any accidents with lost time, accidents without lost time and incidents, and for priority actions to be determined.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group obtained ISO 45001 certification for three sites in 2022: Orizaba (Mexico), Ixtac (Mexico) and Juarez (Mexico). This was a Group-wide approach, which is currently being expanded to all sites, based on our integrated management system. The certification process for the Ningbo site (China) began in 2023, with completion scheduled for early 2024. We plan to continue this process.\n\nIn addition, the IT department has established a structured organization and resources to strengthen its focus on cybersecurity and reduce risk. Monitoring and performance indicators have been implemented along with the appropriate actions. The Group is pursuing its ISO 27001 certification, which is expected to be obtained in early 2024.\n\nPlant safety: The Group is continuing its program to install sprinklers in plants not previously equipped with this fire protection system.\n\nWork is nearing completion on the Rayong (Thailand) and Champfromier (France) plants. The project for the Juarez (Mexico) plant has begun, while the project for the Orizaba (Mexico) plant has been postponed until 2024.\n\n#### **Safety and Working Conditions**\n\nHealth and safety is our priority and forms the foundation of all our processes; it is at the heart of everything we do, every single day. Everyone involved with the Group (employees, service providers, suppliers, etc.) must work in a safe and healthy environment. Our Occupational Health and Safety policy and its related objectives are adjusted depending on the location, taking into account the specific features of each site. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement in health and safety, we aim to achieve a lost-time accident frequency rate of less than 2.9 and a severity rate of 0.15 by 2028. Our ambition is to continue our trajectory toward a frequency rate of less than 1 and 0 accidents. In 2023, we had 55 lost-time accidents.\n\n| Work-Related Accidents, Including Frequency and Severity | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Frequency rate                                           | 2.55 | 4.09 |\n| Severity rate                                            | 0.12 | 0.14 |\n\nThe formula used for the frequency rate is the number of lost-time accidents divided by the number of hours worked and multiplied by 1,000,000. The severity rate corresponds to the number of days lost divided by the number of hours worked and multiplied by 1,000.\n\n#### *4.3.5.4.2. Bolster IT security*\n\nInformation security is also one of the Group's top concerns.\n\nInitiated in 2021, structural projects have been implemented to secure our IT facilities: data protection (firewall), a new cyber-defense service, a new database linking users and IT resources, and the overhaul of business continuity plans.\n\nIn 2022, the IT department established a structured organization and resources to strengthen its focus on cybersecurity and reduce risk. Monitoring and performance indicators have been implemented along with the appropriate actions.\n\nLaunched in 2023, the ISO 27001 certification project defines and implements the information management system integrated into our global management system. Information system access management and traceability projects are currently being rolled out. We have launched new projects to supplement our security coverage, with an information system monitoring tool that collects and analyzes events in order to detect suspicious activity, a tool to secure our mobile fleet, and the planning of penetration tests on our information system by a third-party company.\n\nWe have created a dedicated IT security team and recruited cybersecurity administrators.\n\nTo meet the expectations of our customers, we have further developed our rollout strategy. The ISO 27001 standard will be certified at the Head Office level, and the TISAX label will be rolled out at the site level.\n\nThe awareness-raising and communication plan that has been defined is currently being implemented.\n\nBy 2024, our Head Office will be ISO 27001 certified, and we will have six TISAX-certified sites: Ixtac and Orizaba (Mexico), Ningbo (China), Stara Zagora (Bulgaria), Rudnik (Czech Republic) and Timisoara (Romania). Eventually, all our sites will be certified.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>*4.3.5.5. \"AKWEL being\" Socially engaged*\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/2 description: The image shows a circular diagram with four stylized human figures arranged in a circle.

Workforce and Skills Management*\n\nIn 2023, the Group's workforce and skills management policy addressed two of AKWEL's major challenges:\n\n- adapting our workforce to ensure the economic balance of our activities;\n- developing our technical skills and support in order to improve the quality and performance of our products and services and maintain our development and innovation capacities.\n\nThe figures in the tables below are correct as at December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **Workforce**\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Group had 9,632 employees (on permanent and fixed-term contracts), representing an increase of 2.41% compared to 2022.\n\n| Workforce | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| Total     | 9,632 | 9,405 |\n\n#### **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Employees**\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, permanent staff represented 88.92% of total FTEs and non-permanent staff represented 11.08%.\n\n| FTE Employees                               | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Permanent (permanent contracts)             | 8,868 | 8,528 |\n| Non-permanent (fixed-term contracts, temps) | 1,105 | 1,135 |\n| Total                                       | 9,973 | 9,663 |\n\n#### **Breakdown of Workforce by Category**\n\n| Breakdown of Workforce by Category | 2023  | 2022  |\n|------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Executives                         | 521   | 512   |\n| Employees and technicians          | 3,489 | 3,397 |\n| Workers                            | 5,622 | 5,496 |\n| Total                              | 9,632 | 9,405 |\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Departures**\n\nIn 2023, the Group recorded 3,992 departures, made up of voluntary departures and departures for other reasons (3,066), as well as lay-offs and terminations (829). Voluntary departures from the Direct Labor force (2,648) accounted for 66.33% of departures, mainly in Mexico where the job market remains highly competitive.\n\n| Departures                              | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Lay-offs and terminations               | 829   | 920   |\n| Retirement                              | 97    | 64    |\n| Voluntary departures and other reasons* | 3,066 | 3,336 |\n| Total                                   | 3,992 | 4,320 |\n\n\\*\"Voluntary departures and other reasons\" include resignations, the end of fixed-term contracts, trial periods and deaths.\n\n| Permanent FTE Staff Departures | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Permanent staff                | 3,572  | 3,870  |\n| Total FTEs                     | 9,973  | 9,663  |\n| Departure rate in %            | 35.82% | 40.05% |\n\n#### **Recruitment**\n\nIn 2023, the Group recruited 4,219 new staff, mainly at sites in North America and Asia, and at other sites exposed to high-growth markets. AKWEL is committed to inclusion and diversity, creating a working environment where everyone — no matter their origin, identity or abilities — feels respected, valued and heard.\n\n| Recruitment | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------|-------|-------|\n| Total       | 4,219 | 4,064 |\n\n#### **Training**\n\nIn addition to maintaining our workforce of employees and technicians, we have made, and will continue to make, special efforts in the area of training. Training within the Group is a lever for developing the performance and professionalism of our teams. It allows us to keep pace with changes in our businesses and to adapt to new technological developments.\n\n| Training                                                                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Amounts dedicated to training (as a percentage of payroll)                   | 1.02%   | 0.85%   |\n| Workforce training rate (workforce trained/total workforce)                  | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Workforce trained                                                            | 7,049   | 6,814   |\n| Percentage                                                                   | 73.18%  | 72.45%  |\n| Average number of training hours per employee (no. of hours/total workforce) | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Training hours                                                               | 138,382 | 121,462 |\n| Average number of training hours per employee                                | 14.37   | 12.91   |\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.5.5.2.2. Employee Involvement*\n\nEmployee involvement and commitment are essential to AKWEL's success. We are developing a program called \"AKWEL being at Work,\" which focuses on four essential themes to help employees become more involved in their missions and to provide them with a better quality of life at work and everyday well-being.\n\n#### **Communication**\n\nCommunication and dialogue are essential to sharing the Group's values, corporate vision, strategy, expectations and objectives.\n\nTrust and mutual respect are the glue that holds our organization together. We are committed to ensuring compliance with legal requirements, ethical standards and regulations, and anti-corruption measures.\n\nIn 2023, we encouraged assimilation of the Group's identity by highlighting a key AKWEL message through teamwork at each site. Teams illustrated AKWEL's \"Stop Work\" safety policy by working together to encourage initiative, creativity and teamwork. Some 23 challenges led to video or photographic productions, which helped Akwelis to fully grasp the company's safety policy by simulating situations where they needed to protect themselves or their colleagues from risky situations. Five sites were nominated and the winner was the Orizaba site. The trophy was presented to the on-site team by the President of the Executive Board.\n\nWe continued to roll out AKWEL's employer brand to Group employees. We also highlighted AKWEL's employer promise on our website.\n\nAKWEL's employer promise provides a clear vision of the Group's commitment to its Akwelis<sup>\\*</sup> and future candidates:\n\n- working at AKWEL means sharing in the adventure of an independent, family-owned Group whose history is rooted in a long-term approach (ENGAGE+);\n- working at AKWEL involves collaboration based on reciprocal commitments, where everyone is offered the same opportunity to succeed within the Group (RESPECT+);\n- working at AKWEL gives you the possibility to develop new areas of expertise. It is also about displaying pragmatism in order to come up with the perfect solution for each problem, in a spirit of creativity and agility (ACTION+);\n- working at AKWEL means having the chance to learn from your peers and gain unique skills based on a clear overview of your role, as well as professional interpersonal skills (SHARE+);\n- working at AKWEL means growing both individually and collectively while cultivating the capacity to excel (GROW+).\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/14 description: The image is a collage of five different people working in a factory setting.

The employee delegation consists of 14 members (staff or union representatives).\n\nIt covers a range of topics within the European scope, such as the employment situation and likely employment trends, organizational developments, the introduction of new production processes, production transfers, mergers, investments and so on.\n\n| Review of Collective Agreements, Particularly in the Field of Health and<br>Safety at Work | 2023 | 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of agreements reached during the year                                               | 25   | 27   |\n| of which occupational health and safety agreements                                         | 3    | 1    |\n\nNegotiations at all Group sites led to the signing of 25 collective agreements.\n\n#### **Collective Agreements**\n\n| Collective Agreements                             | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of sites covered by a collective agreement | 25   | N/A  |\n\n#### **HSE Committees**\n\n| HSE Committees                        | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of sites with an HSE committee | 31   | N/A  |\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Percentage of Workforce with an Annual Performance Review**\n\nIn 2023, 8,643 employees had an annual performance review.\n\n| Annual Performance Review                     | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Number of annual performance reviews          | 8,643 | 8,569 |\n| Percentage of workforce with an annual review | 93%   | 92%   |\n\n#### **Remuneration**\n\nRemuneration is made up of several components: salary (fixed remuneration); bonuses (variable remuneration); benefits (health insurance, life insurance, pension, etc.); benefits in kind (company car).\n\nIn 2023, across the entire Group, 3.24% of employees were paid the minimum wage, while 96.76% were paid more.\n\nEach component of this remuneration is governed by rules that take into account local legislation, labor market conditions in each region, the position held or level of responsibility exercised, and the employee's performance.

The Group firmly believes that diversity of gender, age, origin and skills enhances our own capabilities, particularly our ability to innovate and design innovative products. As the automotive market changes rapidly, we are strengthening our ability to adapt to new demands and technologies, and to develop the international potential of Akwelis.\n\n#### **Breakdown of Employees by Gender**\n\nThe Group employs 3,965 women (41.16% of the total workforce) and 5,667 men (58.84%).\n\n| Breakdown of Employees by Gender | 2023  | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Men                              | 5,667 | 5,398 |\n| Women                            | 3,965 | 4,007 |\n| Total                            | 9,632 | 9,405 |\n\n#### **Gender Equality Index**\n\nIn France, the Group achieved the gender equality index target, which aims to reduce the gender pay gap, with a score of 87/100.\n\n| Gender Equality Index | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|\n| Total out of 100      | 87   | 86   |\n\nThe indicators making up the index received the following scores:\n\n- pay gap indicator: 37/40;\n- individual raise rate gap indicator: 20/20;\n- promotion rate gap indicator: 15/15;\n- percentage of employees who received a raise during the year following their return from maternity leave: 15/15;\n- number of employees of the under-represented sex among the 10 highest earners: 0/10.\n\n#### **Breakdown of Employees by Age**\n\nEmployees in the under-30 age bracket accounted for 26.0% of the total workforce in 2023 and 26.1% of the total workforce in 2022.

To promote this corporate culture and share these rules with everyone, several documents have been drawn up and are available at [http://www.akwel-automotive.com:](http://www.akwel-automotive.com/)\n\n- an Ethics Charter that serves as a guideline for everyone in the company. It defines the rules that govern our operations and our relations with all our stakeholders, wherever they may be in the world;\n- a Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, the aim of which is to implement measures to ensure that all our employees, managers and corporate officers, wherever they may be located, can prevent AKWEL from becoming involved in any corrupt or influence-peddling practices and, if necessary, can report any such practices;\n- a stock market code of ethics designed to remind all insiders (corporate officers, employees or third-party service providers acting on behalf of AKWEL) of the regulations applicable to the possession, disclosure and use of insider information to which they may have access by virtue of their roles, mandates or assignments;\n- a Whistleblowing Procedure that details the terms and conditions of the whistleblowing system.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.5.7.1. Information on the Fight against Corruption*\n\nThe Group rejects all forms of corruption.\n\nPursuant to French Law 2016-1691 on transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life, known as \"Sapin II,\" the Group has implemented tools to detect and prevent acts of corruption or influence peddling:\n\n- risk mapping;\n- a Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling;\n- internal and external accounting control procedures;\n- a training system;\n- a whistleblowing system;\n- procedures for assessing the situation of customers, suppliers and intermediaries;\n- disciplinary sanctions for breaches of the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling.\n\nThe Group has conducted a corruption risk mapping exercise, allowing it to identify all the risks to which it is exposed and to prioritize them in terms of impact and occurrence.\n\nIn 2019, the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling was revised to strengthen the anti-corruption framework in response to the Sapin II law. The aim of this code is to implement measures to ensure that all Group employees, wherever they may be located, can recognize and prevent the Group from becoming involved in any corrupt or peddling practices and, if necessary, can report any such practices.\n\nDuring the year, the internal whistleblowing system was further adapted to meet the requirements of:\n\n- French Law No. 2022-401 of March 21, 2022 aimed at improving the protection of whistleblowers;\n- French Decree [No. 2022-1284 of October 3, 2022](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/pdf?id=q48CGV-CdqrWoIbE71wPQfxnFFJbCxjZfqxFzwqAFRg=) on procedures for collecting and processing whistleblower reports and establishing the list of external authorities established by French law No. 2022-401 of March 21, 2022 aimed at improving the protection of whistleblowers.\n\nThe purpose of the internal whistleblowing system is to receive reports from Group employees concerning conduct or situations that violate the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling. The Group has reinforced this system by expanding the topics covered to all the commitments of the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, and by opening it up to external stakeholders.\n\nThe whistleblowing system is set out in the Code Against Corruption and Influence Peddling, and the procedures for reporting cases under this system are detailed in a specific procedure (AKWEL Group Whistleblowing Procedure) translated into the Group's main languages and also accessible on the Group's Intranet and website.\n\nThis procedure details the whistleblowing procedures implemented by the Group as part of its ethical approach.\n\nThis whistleblowing system has been presented to employee representative bodies.\n\nIn 2023, five whistleblowing reports were made. Most of them came from Mexico (two cases) and Türkiye (one case). The other two reports came from Tunisia and Spain.\n\nAll reports were considered as whistleblowing and were investigated in depth.\n\nThe majority of these reports concerned cases of fraud (three reports), while the remainder related to labor relations (one report) and violations of the Ethics Charter (one report).\n\nOf the five reports, three proved not to be established violations. One of the reports resulted in disciplinary action, with the dismissal of the person involved. One of the reports is still under investigation.\n\nNone of the reports had a significant impact on the Group.\n\nThese aspects are presented to the Audit Committee and the CSR Committee, depending on the nature of the reports.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 The Group has established a reinforced process for selecting and monitoring its suppliers in terms of both financial sustainability and social, environmental and ethical aspects. In particular, these processes cover:\n\n- the inclusion of a new supplier in the pool via a questionnaire;\n- supplier adherence to the Group's Ethics Charter;\n- the CSR assessment of suppliers and subcontractors via the EcoVadis platform;\n- regular review of suppliers.\n\nTo communicate its values, the Group has also drawn up an Ethics Charter for its employees and stakeholders (customers, suppliers, etc.).\n\nIt sets out the Group's principles, particularly in terms of compliance with legislation and respect for fair competition, prohibits conflicts of interest and insider trading, and reaffirms environmental protection, health and safety in the workplace, fair accounting and financial reporting, and the fight against all forms of discrimination and harassment.\n\nIn addition, commercial relations that do not respect these values may be terminated. To this end, contractual clauses have been included in the Group's contracts, purchase orders and general terms and conditions.\n\n#### *4.3.5.7.2. Tax Policy*\n\nThe Group's tax policy is transparent and fully in line with its corporate responsibility strategy. The Group therefore practices responsible corporate citizenship, not only complying with legislation, but above all making a fair contribution to the countries in which it operates.\n\nTo this end, the Group's tax policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- compliance with the international tax standards set out by the OECD (\"Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations\"), so that intra-Group transactions comply with the arm's length principle;\n- not attempting to evade the payment of taxes, particularly through complex and opaque structures.\n\n#### *4.3.5.7.3. Vigilance Plan*\n\nThe Group is no longer legally obligated to draw up, publish and effectively implement a vigilance plan, as it employs fewer than 10,000 people within the Group and its direct or indirect subsidiaries headquartered in France or abroad.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n**AKWEL** ANNUAL REPORT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ 2023 1\n\nImage /page/85/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"PRIORITY 4\" in large, bold, dark blue font against a white background.

In this way, we can achieve the highest levels of operational and sustainable performance, and satisfy our customers at the same time.\n\nThe health and safety of Akwelis<sup>\\*</sup>, our stakeholders and our partners is the top priority within the Group, and we expect our suppliers to ensure that sustainability, environmental, health and safety requirements are reflected and implemented throughout their supply chain.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup>AKWEL employees\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Carbon neutrality and corporate social responsibility are also part of AKWEL's objectives and values. We firmly believe that our suppliers can help us to act with integrity, in an ethical, environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.\n\nCybersecurity is also one of our key concerns, and we want our suppliers to strengthen their security policies to protect their entire supply chain, notably by obtaining ISO 27001 certification and TISAX certification.\n\nAs part of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), in force since January 1, 2024, we also want our suppliers to meet our decarbonization and Corporate Social Responsibility objectives. Our suppliers must measure their CO2 emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) from 2024 onward, and must share their results via the platform of our CSR partner, EcoVadis, with an expected minimum score of 50.\n\nBy the end of 2023, 44% of our suppliers had been assessed by EcoVadis. This criterion is taken into account in measuring supplier performance, and thus guides our choices for future projects.\n\nIn 2023, we included all our direct and indirect suppliers in our supplier risk classification. With this new rating, we have identified 26% of our suppliers as having a high level of risk. We believe that these suppliers' participation in the EcoVadis program and our monitoring of their sustainable performance will help us improve these results.\n\nAt the same time, as part of our Group environmental policy, we measure the number of direct suppliers with ISO 14001 certification, as well as the amount of local purchases made by region and country. This will help us to protect our purchases in the long-term.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **AKWEL** ANNUAL REPORT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ 2023 1\n\n#### *4.3.5.9.

Presentation — Publication Obligation*\n\nIn order to promote transparency and a long-term vision in economic activities, and to redirect capital flows toward environmentally sustainable investments, the European Union (EU) action plan on financing for sustainable growth has led to the creation of a common classification system for corporate activities, allowing for the identification of economic activities considered to be sustainable.\n\nThis system is defined in European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the \"Taxonomy Regulation\") and aims to define the EU's environmental objectives and corresponding economic activities.\n\nSustainable economic activities, or aligned activities, are defined in Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nTo determine whether an activity can be considered sustainable, it must:\n\n- *(i) contribute substantially to one or more of the following six environmental objectives: (i) climate change mitigation; (ii) climate change adaptation; (iii) the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; (iv) the transition to a circular economy; (v) pollution prevention and control; and (vi) the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.*\n- *(ii) do no significant harm to any of the other five environmental objectives;*\n- *(iii) be carried out in compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the eight core ILO Conventions and the International Bill of Human Rights.*\n\nThe European Commission adopted:\n\n- on June 4, 2021, Delegated Regulation EU 2021/2139 (the \"Climate Regulation\"), which establishes the technical screening criteria relating to the first two environmental objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation) and identifies more than 80 economic activity sub-sectors representing 93% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union and requiring priority action (\"European taxonomy-eligible\" activities).\n- on June 27, 2023:\n\t- Supplementary Delegated Regulations establishing the technical screening criteria determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\t- Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485, which amends the Climate Regulation by adding a new activity to Notes I, entitled \"3.18. Manufacture of automotive and mobility components\" and establishing technical screening criteria relating to climate change mitigation and adaptation for this new economic activity.\n\nPursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Act relating to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation published on July 6, 2021, the Group must publish its sensitivity to the European Green Taxonomy and sustainability indicators such as:\n\n- the proportion of turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) associated with \"eligible\" activities, i.e. those classified in the European Taxonomy, and \"noneligible\" activities;\n- the proportion of its turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) associated with \"sustainable\" activities, i.e. activities that comply with the technical criteria associated with each of the \"eligible\" activities, do not harm other environmental objectives (DNSH) and respect minimum social safeguards.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor 2023, the Group must publish:\n\n- the proportion of \"taxonomy-eligible\" and \"taxonomy-non-eligible\" economic activities for its total turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx), with regard to all published environmental objectives;\n- the proportion of \"taxonomy-aligned\" and \"taxonomy-non-aligned\" economic activities for its total turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx), only with regard to the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives.\n\n#### *4.3.6.2. Methodology — Scope*\n\nThe various analyses were based on a cross-functional approach involving the Group's finance, legal and nonfinancial teams.\n\nThe scope of analysis covers the following points:\n\n- the turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenses considered cover all the Group's activities corresponding to the scope of companies under its control;\n- companies in which the Group and its companies exercise joint control or significant influence are excluded from the calculation of the ratios defined by the delegated act relating to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation published on July 6, 2021 (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178);\n\nFinancial data is taken from the consolidated annual accounts as at December 31, 2023, and turnover and capital expenditure can therefore be reconciled with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *4.3.6.3. Eligibility Analysis of Activities*\n\nThe eligibility analysis consists of identifying the Group's activities listed in the various Delegated Acts of the Taxonomy Regulation. These activities are referred to as \"eligible.\"\n\nThe analysis of Akwel's turnover under activity 3.3 \"Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\" in 2022 did not lead to the conclusion of eligibility, as recommended by the European Commission's \"Draft commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets,\" dated December 19, 2022.\n\nIn 2023, Akwel carried out a new eligibility analysis of its activities:\n\n#### **Result of Analysis on Climate Change Mitigation Objectives**\n\n| Number | Activity                                                                 | TURNOVER | CAPEX | OPEX |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|------|\n| 3.18   | Manufacture of automotive and mobility components                        | X        | X     | -    |\n| 6.5    | Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light<br>commercial vehicles | -        | X     | -    |\n| 7.2    | Renovation of existing buildings                                         | -        | X     | -    |\n| 7.3    | Installation, maintenance and repair of energy<br>efficiency equipment   | -        | X     | -    |\n| 7.7    | Acquisition and ownership of buildings                                   | -        | X     | -    |\n\n#### **Result of the Analysis on Transition to a Circular Economy Objectives**\n\n| Number | Activity                                  | TURNOVER | CAPEX | OPEX |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------|----------|-------|------|\n| 5.1    | Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing | X        | X     | -    |\n| 5.2    | Sale of spare parts                       | X        | -     | -    |\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.6.4. Activity Alignment Review*\n\nA review of the Group's activities with regard to the technical criteria identified the following elements:\n\n#### *4.3.6.4.1. Revenue*\n\n#### **Activity 3.18 — Manufacture of Automotive and Mobility Components**\n\nPart of the Group's activities consists of manufacturing products (the Flush Handle) to ensure and improve the environmental performance of electric vehicles.\n\n#### *4.3.6.4.2. CAPEX*\n\n#### **Activity 6.5 — Transport by Motorbikes, Passenger Cars, and Light Commercial Vehicles**\n\nThe Group has invested in greening its vehicle fleet, either by acquiring electric vehicles or leasing them.\n\n#### **Activity 7.2 — Renovation of Existing Buildings**\n\nRenovation work at the Group's head office was considered to be in line with the technical criteria.\n\n#### **Activity 7.3 — Installation, Maintenance and Repair of Energy Efficiency Equipment**\n\nCapital expenditure on LED relamping at the AKWEL Juarez site in Mexico has been accepted as aligned, as it meets the technical criteria.\n\n#### *4.3.6.4.3. OPEX*\n\nOperating expenses as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation are not material in relation to the total operating expenses shown in AKWEL's consolidated income statement.\n\nAnalyses led to the conclusion that the OPEX ratio was not material, as it was not relevant to the Group's activities (i.e. less than 10%).\n\nConsequently, the exemption criterion was applied and the OPEX KPI was not calculated.\n\n#### *4.3.6.5. Compliance with Do No Significant Harm*\n\nIn accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation, the Group has reviewed all the DNSH (Do No Significant Harm) criteria for eligible activities to in order to characterize the alignment of these activities.\n\n#### *4.3.6.6. Compliance with Minimum Social Safeguards*\n\nAccording to the Taxonomy Regulation, to be considered aligned with one of the environmental objectives, an activity must comply with minimum safeguards in four areas:\n\n**Human rights**: the Group is committed to respecting human rights, notably through its Ethics Charter. This Charter defines the way in which employees must interact with business partners, suppliers, communities and other stakeholders. It also sets out the Group's whistleblowing procedure.\n\n**Corruption**: the Group has implemented its procedures with regard to French Law 20166-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life, known as \"Sapin II.\" Actions have been implemented across all eight pillars.\n\n**Taxation**: the Group has not made any arrangements to artificially reduce its corporate tax burden or transfer its taxable income to low-tax countries;\n\n**Fair competition**: as detailed in its Ethics Charter, the Group is committed to ensuring that competition is fair and equitable. No Group action may prevent, restrict or distort competition.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *4.3.6.7. Publication*\n\n#### *4.3.6.7.1. Share of Turnover Aligned with the European Green Taxonomy*\n\nThe turnover considered is that generated by the equipment of all types of vehicles, regardless of engine or vehicle type.\n\n| 31/12/2023                                                                                                         |  | 2023  |                         |                       |                                            | Substantial contribution criteria           |                                               |                            |                                   |                                              |                                       | Criteria for the absence of significant harm<br>(\"DNSH criterion\") |                                          |                       |                              |                                         |                                |                                                                                             |                        |                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|-------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Economic activities                                                                                                |  | Codes | Sales figures<br>[en M] | Share of sales<br>(%) | Climate change mitigation<br>[Yes/No/N EL) | Adapting to climate change<br>[Yes;No;NE L) | Aquatic and marine resources<br>[Yes;No;NE L) | Pollution<br>[Yes;No;N EL) | Circular economy<br>[Yes No NE L) | Biodiversity and ecosystems<br>[Yes No NE L) | Climate change mitigation<br>[Yes/No) | Adapting to climate change<br>[Yes/No)                             | Aquatic and marine resources<br>[Yes/No) | Pollution<br>[Yes/No) | Circular economy<br>[Yes/No) | Biodiversity and ecosystems<br>[Yes/No) | Minimum warranties<br>[Yes/No) | Share of sales aligned with taxonomy (A.1) or eligible for taxonomy (A.2.), year N-1<br>(%) | Enabling activity<br>H | Transient activity<br>T |\n| A.

Certain details are sensitive to the methodological choices, assumptions and/or estimates used in its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Entity**\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for:\n\n- selecting or establishing appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- drawing up a Statement in compliance with legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies applied with regard to these risks as well as the results of these policies, including key performance indicators and, in addition, the information provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy);\n- implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary to enable the preparation of Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been drawn up by applying the entity's Reporting Criteria as mentioned above.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibility of the Independent Third Party**\n\nIt is our responsibility, on the basis of our work, to formulate a reasoned opinion expressing a conclusion of moderate assurance on:\n\n- compliance of the Statement with the provisions of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the fair presentation of the historical information (observed or extrapolated) provided pursuant to 3° of I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, namely the results of policies, including key performance indicators and actions relating to the main risks.\n\nAs it is our responsibility to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by the management, we are not authorized to be involved in the preparation of said Information, as this could compromise our independence.\n\nOur responsibility does not include expressing an opinion on:\n\n- the entity's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements (in particular with regard to the information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy), the vigilance plan and the fight against corruption and tax evasion plan);\n- the fair presentation of the details provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy);\n- the compliance of products and services with applicable regulations.\n\n#### **Applicable Regulations and Professional Standards**\n\nOur work described below was carried out in accordance with the provisions of Articles A. 225-1 et seqq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional standards of the French National Institute of Auditors (*Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes* — CNCC) relating to this work in lieu of an audit program, and ISAE 3000 (revised).\n\n#### **Independence and Quality Control**\n\nOur independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. In addition, we have implemented a quality control system that includes documented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, ethical rules and the professional standards of the CNCC.\n\n#### **Means and Resources**\n\nOur work involved the skills of three people and took place between March 8 and April 25, 2024, over a total period of 15 days.\n\nWe called on our sustainable development and corporate social responsibility specialists to assist us in carrying out our work. We conducted three interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement, representing in particular General Management, Administration and Finance, Risk Management, Compliance, Human Resources, Health and Safety, Environment and Purchasing.\n\n#### **Nature and Scope of Our Work**\n\nWe planned and performed our work under consideration of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe believe that the procedures we have performed in exercising our professional judgment have allowed us to provide a conclusion of moderate assurance:\n\n- we have familiarized ourselves with the activities of all the entities included in the scope of consolidation and with the description of the main risks;\n- we have assessed the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and comprehensibility, taking into account best practices in the sector, where appropriate;\n- we have verified that the Statement covers each category of information specified in III of Article L. 225- 102-1 concerning social and environmental issues, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion;\n- we have verified that the Statement includes the information required under II of Article R. 225-105 when relevant to the principal risks and includes, where appropriate, an explanation of the reasons for the absence of the information required under paragraph 2 of III of Article L. 225-102-1;\n- we have verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the main risks associated with the activity of all the entities included in the scope of consolidation, including, where relevant and proportionate, the risks created by its business relationships, products or services, as well as policies, actions and results, including key performance indicators relating to the main risks;\n- we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews in order to:\n\t- assess the process used to select and validate the main risks, as well as the consistency of the results, including the key performance indicators selected, in relation to the main risks and policies presented, and\n\t- corroborate the qualitative details (actions and results) we considered most important, as presented in Notes 1.

Ordinary Business**\n\n### **1.1. Approval of the Annual Accounts for the 2023 Financial Year (1st and 3rd Resolutions) and Full Discharge of the Members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board (2nd Resolution)**\n\nThe purpose of the 1st resolution is to approve the corporate annual accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, showing a loss of €93,890.36 and non-tax-deductible expenses and charges.\n\nThis resolution also approves the expenses and charges referred to in Article 39-4 of the French General Tax Code, amounting to €40,618, and the corresponding tax charge of €10,155.\n\nThe purpose of the 2<sup>nd</sup> resolution is to discharge the members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards for their management of the Group during the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe purpose of the 3<sup>rd</sup> resolution is to approve the consolidated annual accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, which show a net income, Group share, of €35,722 thousand.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **1.2.

Together with retained earnings of €79,778,839.63, this brings the total distributable amount available to €79,684,949.27.\n\nIt is proposed that a dividend of €8,022,312 be distributed among the shareholders, representing a gross dividend per share of €0.30.\n\nThis amount will be deducted in full from retained earnings. The balance of retained earnings will then amount to €71,662,637.27.\n\nWhen paid to individuals domiciled in France for tax purposes, this dividend is subject to a single flat-rate withholding tax of 12.8% on the gross dividend (Article 200 A of the French General Tax Code) or, at the taxpayer's express irrevocable option, to income tax according to the progressive scale after a 40% deduction (Article 200 A, 13, and 158 of the French General Tax Code). The dividend is also subject to social security deductions at the rate of 17.2%.\n\nIf this proposal is adopted, the coupon will be detached on June 3, 2024 and the dividend will be paid on June 5, 2024.\n\nUpon detachment of these dividends, the dividend corresponding to treasury shares held by the Group would be allocated to \"Retained earnings.\"\n\n#### **1.3.

The Middlenext Code is available at [www.middlenext.com.](http://www.middlenext.com/)\n\nThe Supervisory Board felt that the Middlenext Corporate Governance Code was well suited to the Company, given its size and capital structure.\n\nPursuant to the \"comply or explain\" rule set out in Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code and the Middlenext Code, the Company specifies that it applied all the recommendations of the Middlenext Code during the 2023 financial year.\n\n# **1.

Meetings are held either at the head office or at another location specified in the notice of meeting.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2. Governance**\n\nThe Combined General Meeting on May 26, 1998 approved the adoption of a dual management structure with a Supervisory Board and an Executive Board. This organization separates the management and executive roles performed by the Executive Board from the supervisory functions performed by the Supervisory Board, which represents the shareholders.\n\nThe Company has opted for this form of organization, considering that it ensures a better balance of power for the benefit of all stakeholders.\n\nIn the case of French limited companies with an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board, executive officers include the President and members of the Executive Board.\n\n#### **2.1. The Supervisory Board**\n\n#### **2.1.1.

Review of Board Member Independence*\n\nThe Company is majority-owned by a group of family shareholders.\n\nAs stipulated in the Middlenext Code, five criteria are used to presume the independence of Supervisory Board members, which is characterized by the absence of any significant financial, contractual, family or close relationship likely to affect the independence of their judgment:\n\n- not having been an employee or executive officer of the Company or a Group company in the past five years;\n- not having had a significant business relationship with the Company or a Group company (customer, supplier, competitor, service provider, creditor, banker, etc.) in the past two years;\n- not being a core shareholder of the Group or hold a significant percentage of voting rights;\n- not having any close family ties with a corporate officer or a core shareholder;\n- not having been a Group statutory auditor in the past six years.\n\nThe Board is required to verify each year—as well as at the time of their appointment—the situation of these members with regard to the independence criteria listed above.\n\nOn the basis of the independence criteria defined above, the Supervisory Board, at its meeting on April 4, 2024, at which the annual review of Board member independence was on the agenda, noted that two members, Ms. Anne Vignat Ducret and Mr. Nicolas Job, meet these criteria and can therefore be considered independent members, having no significant relationship with the Company or its management, or with a consolidated Group company, which could affect their freedom of judgment.\n\nMr. Guillaume Wesolowski, Supervisory Board member representing employees, does not qualify as an independent member.\n\nThe other members of the Supervisory Board (Ms. Geneviève Coutier, Ms. Emilie Coutier, Mr. André Coutier and Mr. Christophe Coutier), permanent representatives of the COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT Group, have close family ties with the Company's management.\n\n#### *2.1.1.4. Balanced Representation of Men and Women on the Supervisory Board — Diversity on the Supervisory Board*\n\nWith regard to the representation of men and women on the Board, it should be noted that, at the time this report was drafted, the Board had three female members.\n\nAccordingly, the Group complies with the legal provisions concerning the \"balanced representation of men and women on boards of directors and supervisory boards, and gender equality in the workplace\" as set out in Article L.225-69-1 of the French Commercial Code, which stipulate that the Supervisory Board must consist of at least 40% female members and, given the size of the Board, that there may not be a difference of more than two between the number of members of each gender.\n\nThe mandate of the Board member representing employees is not taken into account when calculating gender equality on the Board.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 1 **2.1.2. Conditions Governing the Preparation and Organization of the Supervisory Board's Work**\n\n#### *2.1.2.1. Duties and Powers of the Supervisory Board*\n\nThe Supervisory Board is the supervisory body of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are managed by the Executive Board. It ensures that the strategy applied by the Executive Board is consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board.\n\nIt gives the Executive Board prior authorization to carry out any operations that it is unable to complete without the Board's approval.\n\nIt appoints the members of the Executive Board, designates its President and, where applicable, the Managing Directors, and sets their remuneration.\n\nWithout prejudice to the powers conferred by law to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board may dismiss members of the Executive Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board sets the remuneration of Executive Board members and/or any other benefits of a similar nature.\n\nIt determines the terms and conditions for collecting the remuneration allocated to Supervisory Board members and for distributing it among them. It also sets the remuneration of the President and, where applicable, the Vice-President, and the resources allocated to them for the performance of their duties.\n\nAt any time of the year, the Supervisory Board may carry out any checks and controls it deems appropriate, and may request any documents it deems useful for the performance of its duties.\n\n#### *2.1.2.2. Notice of Meetings of Supervisory Board Members and Statutory Auditors*\n\nThe Group draws up a provisional schedule of Supervisory Board meetings in year N for year N+1.\n\nIn addition, the Group sends notices of meetings to the members of the Supervisory Board and to the delegate of the Social and Economic Committee around seven (7) days before a meeting is due to take place, by email, and by letter with acknowledgment of receipt for the Joint Statutory Auditors when this is required. All documents, technical files and information required by all Supervisory Board members are sent to them at the same time as the notice of meeting.\n\nIn addition, Supervisory Board members are notified of the confidentiality of documents communicated to them, whether within the documents themselves, or within emails or other correspondence accompanying them (Recommendation 1 of the Middlenext Code).\n\nThe Social and Economic Committee delegate receives the same information as Board members, within the same time frame.\n\nThe Joint Statutory Auditors are invited to attend Supervisory Board meetings called to review the half-yearly and annual accounts.\n\n#### *2.1.2.3. Supervisory Board Meetings and Attendance Rates*\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets as often as required in the interests of the Group, and at least once a quarter.\n\nExecutive Board members are invited to attend all Supervisory Board meetings. During the 2023 financial year, all members of the Executive Board attended and participated in the various Supervisory Board meetings, speaking in their areas of expertise.\n\nAn attendance log is signed by all Supervisory Board members present.\n\nThe Supervisory Board met six times during the financial year: on February 9, 2023, April 5, 2023, May 4, 2023, August 24, 2023, September 21, 2023 and November 9, 2023. This frequency enabled in-depth examinations and discussions of matters falling within its remit.\n\nThe effective attendance rate of members at Supervisory Board meetings is calculated on the basis of the number of members present divided by the total membership. This rate for the year was 100%.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below shows the attendance rate for each Supervisory Board meeting held in 2023:\n\n| Date of Meeting | Attendance Rate (Members Present) |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 02/09/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 04/05/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 05/04/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 08/24/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 09/21/2023      | 100%                              |\n| 11/09/2023      | 100%                              |\n\nThe President of the Supervisory Board chaired all meetings in 2023.\n\nSupervisory Board meetings are held either at the head office or at any other location indicated in the notice of meeting.\n\nIn accordance with Article 16 of the bylaws and Article 5 of the rules of procedure, Supervisory Board members who take part in Board meetings by videoconference or other means of telecommunication that allow them to be identified and guarantee their effective participation are deemed to be present for the purposes of calculating the quorum and majority. However, this provision does not apply to the verification and auditing of the corporate annual accounts and consolidated annual accounts.\n\nHowever, members are encouraged to attend meetings in person. If a member is unable to attend in person, they may participate by videoconference or, failing that, by telephone.\n\nAt each ordinary meeting, the Executive Board presents a report on the business and results of the Group and its main subsidiaries for the previous quarter. A detailed income statement with comments is presented by the Executive Board at each half-yearly or annual closing.\n\nWithin three months of the end of each financial year, the corporate and consolidated annual accounts approved by the Executive Board are submitted to the Supervisory Board for verification.\n\nThe Supervisory Board then submits its observations on the Executive Board's report, and on the annual accounts for the year, to the General Meeting, which are included in this corporate governance report.\n\nWith regard to the preparation of the half-yearly annual accounts, only the consolidated annual accounts are prepared and submitted to the Supervisory Board within three months of the half-year-end.\n\nThe Supervisory Board asks the Executive Board and management to provide any information or analysis it deems appropriate, or to make a presentation on any specific topic.\n\nMinutes are drawn up at the end of each Board meeting. These are formally approved at the next Supervisory Board meeting.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-113-0\"></span>*2.1.2.4.

Independence and Duty of Expression*\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board must ensure that they retain their independence of judgment, decision and action. They undertake not to allow themselves to be influenced by factors other than the Company's corporate interests, which they are required to pursue.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board is required to inform the Supervisory Board of any matters of which they become aware and which they consider likely to affect the Company's interests\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board is expected to share their questions and opinions in order to ensure that the Group's corporate interests are safeguarded, and is expected to strive to guide the other members of the Supervisory Board toward decisions that allow such corporate interests to be maintained on an ongoing basis. In the event of a disagreement between members during a Supervisory Board meeting, the dissenting member may request that their position be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.\n\n#### *2.1.2.6. Independence and Conflicts of Interest*\n\nEach member must endeavor to avoid any conflict between their own interests and the Company's corporate interests. They must inform the Supervisory Board as soon as they become aware of any potential conflict of interest, and consequently refrain from taking part in discussions or voting on any resolution relating thereto.\n\nThe Supervisory Board carries out an annual review of conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts, of which it has been informed.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, as at the date of preparation of this report there are no conflicts of interest between the duties of each Board member to the Group and their private interests or other duties.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has familiarized itself with the rules applicable to the prevention of insider misconduct, and in particular with the periods during which trading in securities is prohibited.\n\n#### *2.1.2.7. Loyalty and Good Faith*\n\nAll Supervisory Board members shall refrain from any behavior likely to go against the Company's corporate interests in any way whatsoever, and shall act in good faith in all circumstances.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board undertakes to apply all the decisions adopted by the Supervisory Board that comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n#### *2.1.2.8. Confidentiality*\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-92 of the French Commercial Code, all members and participants of the Supervisory Board are bound by professional confidentiality with regard to the discussions and deliberations of the Supervisory Board and its Committees, and with regard to any information of which they may become aware in the course of their duties.\n\nAll Supervisory Board members and participants undertake to never disclose such information outside the Supervisory Board.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *2.1.2.9.

Unless unavoidable circumstances prevent them from doing so, each Supervisory Board member must attend all meetings of the Supervisory Board and the Committees to which they belong, as well as the general meetings of shareholders.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board must step down from their position if they believe they are unable to perform their duties in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and/or rules of procedure.\n\n#### *2.1.2.11.Professionalism, Self-Appraisal and Protection*\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board must contribute to the collaborative and efficient management of the work of the Supervisory Board and of any Committees. They must make any recommendations likely to improve Board procedures.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board is required to ensure that the Supervisory Board's decisions are made in the Company's best interests, and that these are recorded in the minutes of its meetings.\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board is responsible for ensuring that all the information required for the discussion of an item on the agenda is obtained in a timely manner.\n\nOnce a year, the President of the Supervisory Board obtains the opinion of each Supervisory Board member on the performance of the Board and its Committees, and on the preparation of the Board's work.\n\nAs part of this process, the Supervisory Board assesses its performance through an operating rules assessment questionnaire, which is given to each Board member and is answered anonymously.\n\nThe summary of the responses from Supervisory Board members, which was shared with Board members and discussed at the meeting on November 9, 2023, continues to show that members are satisfied with the way the Supervisory Board operates.\n\nThe President of the Supervisory Board ensures that the potential liability of Supervisory Board members is duly insured, and informs each member of the coverage in place.\n\n#### *2.1.2.12.Assessment Procedure for Standard Agreements Concluded in the Normal Course of Business*\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-29 of the French Commercial Code, the Supervisory Board, at its meeting on February 13, 2020, implemented an internal procedure for assessing agreements related to current operations and concluded in the normal course of business.\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to regularly assess whether agreements related to current operations and concluded in the normal course of business meet the conditions set out in Article L. 22-10-29 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThis procedure:\n\n- defines the criteria for identifying these standard agreements;\n- establishes a procedure for categorizing and assessing them.\n\nEach year, the Company's Finance and Legal Departments draw up a list of agreements governed by Article L. 225-87 of the French Commercial Code, and assess whether they meet the criteria for classification as standard agreements concluded in the normal course of business. The Finance and Legal Departments report annually to the Audit Committee and the Board.\n\nIn accordance with this procedure, the Supervisory Board meeting on April 4, 2024 assessed the agreements concluded by the Group.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *2.1.2.13.Stock Market Code of Ethics*\n\nThe Company has drawn up a Stock Market Code of Ethics, which is sent to all persons who may have access to insider information. This code includes a reminder of the definition of insider information, a description of the legal and regulatory provisions in force, a calendar for the year including blackout periods, and information on the penalties incurred.\n\n#### *2.1.2.14.Committees*\n\nThe Supervisory Board may decide to establish its own Committees to facilitate its smooth operation and contribute effectively to the preparation of its decisions.\n\nThe role of a Committee is to study the matters and projects submitted to it by the Supervisory Board or its President, to prepare the work and decisions of the Supervisory Board related to these matters and projects, and to report its findings to the Supervisory Board in the form of reports, proposals, opinions, information and recommendations.\n\nThe Committees carry out their duties under the responsibility of the Supervisory Board.

Remuneration Policy for Corporate Officers**\n\nThe Company's remuneration policy for corporate officers (hereinafter the \"Remuneration Policy\") has been drawn up pursuant to Article L. 22-10-26-I of the French Commercial Code and the recommendations of the Middlenext Corporate Governance Code. It also takes into account the Company's specific characteristics.\n\nIt is in line with the policy approved by the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders on May 28, 2020, and has not been modified since.\n\nIt will apply, where applicable, to any additional corporate officers appointed during the 2024 financial year, until the next General Meeting of Shareholders called to approve the remuneration policy for corporate officers.\n\n#### **3.1.1. General Principles**\n\nThe Remuneration Policy, as detailed below, and in particular the performance criteria, is aligned with the Company's corporate interest, contributes to the Company's business strategy and long-term viability, and takes into consideration the remuneration and employment conditions of the Company's employees.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy is designed to be competitive with the remuneration policies adopted by other companies of comparable size and in the same sector, in order to attract, reward and retain talent recognized as particularly competent in the Group's areas of activity.\n\nThe principles of the Remuneration Policy also take into account the following objectives:\n\n- remuneration must be considered in its entirety: all components of remuneration and the balance between them must be taken into account;\n- a balance between fixed and variable remuneration;\n- when setting variable remuneration, it must take into account a combination of individual performance, the Company's general economic situation and the Group's results. The assessment of individual performance is based on quantitative (financial) and qualitative (non-financial) criteria.\n\n#### *3.1.1.1. Remuneration Paid to Members of the Executive Board*\n\nRemuneration paid to members of the Executive Board consists of the following components:\n\n- fixed annual remuneration;\n- variable annual remuneration;\n- multi-year variable remuneration;\n- benefits in kind.\n\nExecutive Board members are entitled to the reimbursement of expenses incurred in the performance of their duties, in particular travel and accommodation expenses.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *3.1.1.1.1. Fixed Annual Remuneration*\n\nFixed remuneration is designed to attract talent from within the Company's ranks or, where appropriate, from outside, to the highest management positions. It must also contribute to their commitment and loyalty.\n\nIt is determined in consideration of their experience, skills and the responsibilities assumed by each of them.\n\nFixed remuneration is paid in 12 monthly installments.\n\nChanges in fixed remuneration are reviewed annually but — except in exceptional circumstances — fixed remuneration is only revised at relatively long intervals.\n\nThe criteria taken into account when deciding on an increase are changes in the scope and level of responsibility, the incumbent's performance and development in the position held, market positioning for equivalent roles in multinational companies of a comparable size, and the economic and social context of the Group and the Group to which it belongs.\n\n#### *3.1.1.1.2. Variable Annual Remuneration*\n\n<span id=\"page-124-0\"></span>Variable annual remuneration is intended to reflect the personal contribution of Executive Board members to the Group's development.\n\nIts payment is conditional on the achievement of specific and demanding performance targets for each financial year, thus helping to maintain a link between the Group's performance and the remuneration of Executive Board members in a short-term perspective.\n\nVariable annual remuneration is balanced in relation to fixed annual remuneration, and may therefore give rise to each member of the Executive Board receiving variable annual remuneration equal to 60% of their fixed remuneration (hereinafter referred to as the Variable Remuneration Cap).\n\nThe targets that determine the granting of variable annual remuneration to Executive Board members are based, in equal proportions, on return on capital employed and customer satisfaction, with these two criteria being assessed over the two half-years of the financial year.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Supervisory Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, sets the performance targets for the current year, assigning a weighting coefficient reflecting its priorities, as well as the associated points grid for each of the indicators selected.\n\nThe amount of variable remuneration ranges from 0 to a cap of 60% of the Executive Board member's fixed remuneration, depending on the number of points obtained for each indicator.\n\nThe amount of variable annual remuneration is equal to the sum of the various bonuses determined in this way.\n\nVariable remuneration is paid in June of the year of allocation, subject to approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders in accordance with the conditions set out in Article L. 22-10-34-II paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe payment of variable remuneration is not coupled with a reimbursement system.\n\nThe performance targets and indicators adopted by the Supervisory Board at its meeting on April 4, 2024 for the current year are as follows:\n\nIndicator linked to the return on capital employed\n\nReturn is defined as the ratio of operating income to capital employed. This indicator reflects the quality of the Group's economic and financial management.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe target set by the Supervisory Board for the current financial year and the weighting of this indicator in the amount of annual variable remuneration are as follows:\n\n| Indicator                                                                                                              | -        | =                | +              | ++  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|----------------|-----|\n| ROCE (RE/CE)                                                                                                           | <= 10.4% | > 10.4% =/<11.7% | > 11.7% =/<13% | 13% |\n| Weighting of the indicator in the<br>amount of variable annual<br>remuneration (50% of the annual<br>remuneration cap) | 0        | 1/3              | 2/3            | 3/3 |\n\n#### **Customer Satisfaction Indicator:**\n\nCustomer satisfaction (R) groups together three quality indicators, which are:\n\n#### **R = PPM + IPB + Responsiveness**\n\n**PPM (parts per million)**: number of bad or non-conforming parts declared by customers per million parts delivered.\n\n**IPB (incidents per billion)**: number of incidents reported by customers per billion parts delivered.\n\n**Post-incident responsiveness**: 8D steps closed in time by number of 8D reports. This quality indicator makes it possible to ensure that problems identified during audits are resolved quickly.\n\nThe results of the indicators concerned will be those recorded in the manufacturer customer portals on December 31 of each year.\n\nThe purpose of these indicators is to monitor the Company's production quality and its response to production incidents.\n\nThe target set by the Supervisory Board for the current year and the weighting of this indicator in the amount of annual variable remuneration are as follows:\n\n| Indicators                                                                                                                | -               | =                          | +                          | ++                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|\n| PPM                                                                                                                       | More than 4     | Between 3 and 4            | Between 2.5 and 3          | Fewer than 2.5      |\n| IPB                                                                                                                       | More than 1,750 | Between 1,500 and<br>1,750 | Between 1,500 and<br>1,250 | Fewer than<br>1,250 |\n| Post-incident<br>responsiveness                                                                                           | Less than 90%   | Between 90% and<br>92%     | Between 92% and<br>94%     | More than 94%       |\n| Weighting of the indicator<br>in the amount of variable<br>annual remuneration<br>(50% of the annual<br>remuneration cap) | 0               | 1/3                        | 2/3                        | 3/3                 |\n\nThe points grid attached to these indicators is as follows:\n\n| Number of PPM Points | Number of IPB Points | Number of Post-Incident<br>Responsiveness Points | Rating |               |\n|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|\n| 6 pts                | 9 pts                | 3 pts                                            | ++     | 15 << R << 18 |\n| 4 pts                | 6 pts                | 2 pts                                            | +      | 10 << R << 14 |\n| 2 pts                | 3 pts                | 1 pt                                             | =      | 5 << R << 9   |\n| 0 pt                 | 0 pt                 | 0 pt                                             | -      | 0 << R << 4   |\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *3.1.1.1.3.

Extraordinary Remuneration*\n\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted the following principle:\n\n- the members of the Executive Board may receive extraordinary remuneration in exceptional circumstances, which must be explicitly communicated and substantiated. Such remuneration can only be paid subject to the approval of the shareholders pursuant to Article L. 22-10-26-I of the French Commercial Code;\n- members of the Supervisory Board may receive extraordinary remuneration in cash for specific assignments entrusted to certain members or due to the unique nature of their profile or role; such remuneration is subject to the approval procedure for related-party transactions.\n\n#### *3.1.1.3.2. Share Subscription or Purchase Option Plans*\n\nThe corporate officers do not receive allocations of options to subscribe or purchase shares.\n\n#### *3.1.1.3.3. Performance Shares*\n\nThe corporate officers do not receive allocations of performance shares or bonus shares.\n\n#### *3.1.1.3.4. Post-Employment Benefits*\n\nRemuneration or benefits payable or likely to become payable upon termination or change of duties.\n\nCorporate officers do not receive any contractual compensation for the termination of their mandate.\n\n*End-of-Career Benefits.* Corporate officers do not receive end-of-career benefits in the event of retirement. Employment contracts of corporate officers who had such a contract before their appointment are suspended for the duration of their corporate mandate. Moreover, on the same basis and under the same conditions as Group employees, members of the Management Board who have an employment contract may receive a statutory endof-career bonus.\n\n*Corporate Benefits.* Corporate officers benefit, on the same basis as all executives, from the collective welfare, health and retirement plans in force within the Group.\n\n*Non-Compete Agreement.* The corporate officers do not benefit from any commitment made by the Company corresponding to indemnities under a non-compete clause.\n\n#### **3.1.2. Decision-Making Process for Drafting, Revising and Implementing the Remuneration Policy**\n\nTo ensure that the remuneration of corporate officers aligns with the interests of shareholders and the Group's performance, the Supervisory Board and the CSR and Remuneration Committee play a crucial role in drafting, revising and implementing the Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe same applies to shareholders who vote on the Remuneration Policy and the components paid out through a binding vote annually at the General Meeting.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 At the beginning of the year, the Remuneration Policy is subject to review by the CSR and Remuneration Committee, which proposes that the Supervisory Committee keep it unchanged or amend it according to market conditions, changes in the Company itself, changes in employee remuneration at the Company and the remuneration paid by comparable companies, or in the event of a significant change in the scope of responsibility of the members of the Executive Board.\n\nAt the proposal of the CSR and Remuneration Committee, the Supervisory Committee stipulates the remuneration of the Group's corporate officers.\n\nSpecifically, it determines their fixed and their variable annual remuneration (ceiling, thresholds, terms and criteria for allocation) for the financial year ending on December 31 of the previous year, taking into account the changes in the environment and competitive context. It sets the economic and non-economic criteria on which the variable remuneration for the coming year will be based.\n\nThe CSR and Remuneration Committee develops the decisions to be submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders concerning these matters.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted the principle that it shall not deviate from the application of the Remuneration Policy.\n\n### **3.1.3. Process of Evaluating the Performance of Executive Board Members**\n\nFollowing the close of the financial year, the Remuneration Committee assesses to what extent achievement of these annual or multi-year objectives have been achieved. Then, based on this review, the Supervisory Board decides to allocate all or part of the variable annual remuneration and, if applicable, the multi-year variable remuneration to the members of the Executive Board.\n\nAs such, variable remuneration allocated for a financial year is settled and paid during the following financial year, after approval by the General Meeting, in accordance with Article L. 22-10-34. II paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-128-0\"></span>**3.2. Items in the Remuneration Policy Pertaining to Each Corporate Officer Subject to a Shareholders' Vote Pursuant to Article L. 22-10-26 II of the French Commercial Code**\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-26. II of the French Commercial Code, the General Meeting of Shareholders on May 23, 2024 will be asked to vote on a resolution proposal establishing the remuneration policy for corporate officers as follows.\n\nThe remuneration policy for members of the Executive Board was approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders on May 25, 2023, with a majority of 99.91%, and the policy for members of the Supervisory Board was also approved with a majority of 100%.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Types of<br>Remuneration      | Principles                                                                                                                                                                       | Determination Criteria                                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remuneration                  | The General Meeting shall determine the<br>total amount of remuneration paid to the<br>members of the Board.                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Variable<br>remuneration      | Each member of the Supervisory Board<br>receives variable remuneration based on the<br>Board and Committee meetings they attend.                                                 | The amount of variable remuneration is<br>defined in accordance with the rules<br>mentioned in the Section 3.1.1.2 of the<br>corporate governance report. |\n| Extraordinary<br>Remuneration | Supervisory Board members may receive<br>exceptional remuneration for specific<br>assignments entrusted to certain members or<br>due to the uniqueness of their profile or role. | Such remuneration is subject to the approval<br>procedure for related-party transactions.                                                                 |\n\n# **3.2.1.

Variable Annual Remuneration of the Members of the Executive Board*\n\n#### **Reminder of Objectives and of Quantitative and Qualitative Criteria**\n\nThe payment of the variable annual remuneration for 2023 to the members of the Executive Board is subject to the achievement of several specific and pre-established objectives, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, with minimum, target and maximum thresholds set by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe variable annual remuneration is equally based on return on capital employed and customer satisfaction.\n\nFor 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to frame the Executive Board's objectives around the following two indicators:\n\nIndicator linked to the return on capital employed\n\n| Indicator                                                                                                           | -        | =                | +              | ++    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|----------------|-------|\n| ROCE (RE/CE)                                                                                                        | <= 10.4% | > 10.4% =/<11.7% | > 11.7% =/<13% | > 13% |\n| Weighting of the indicator in the amount<br>of variable annual remuneration (50% of<br>the annual remuneration cap) | 0        | 1/3              | 2/3            | 3/3   |\n\nCustomer Satisfaction Indicator:\n\nCustomer satisfaction (R) groups together three quality indicators, which are:\n\n**R = PPM + IPB + Responsiveness**\n\n**PPM (parts per million)**: number of bad or non-conforming parts declared by customers per million parts delivered.\n\n**IPB (incidents per billion)**: number of incidents reported by customers per billion parts delivered.\n\n**Post-incident responsiveness**: 8D steps closed in time by number of 8D reports. This quality indicator makes it possible to ensure that problems identified during audits are resolved quickly.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has also decided that these two indicators will be assessed over the two halves of the financial year.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe target set by the Supervisory Board for the 2023 financial year and the weighting of this indicator related to customer satisfaction in the amount of annual variable remuneration was as follows:\n\n| Indicators                                                                                                             | -               | =                          | +                          | ++               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| PPM                                                                                                                    | More than 4     | Between 3 and 4            | Between 2.5 and 3          | Fewer than 2.5   |\n| IPB                                                                                                                    | More than 1,750 | Between 1,500 and<br>1,750 | Between 1,500<br>and 1,250 | Fewer than 1,250 |\n| Post-incident responsiveness                                                                                           | Less than 90%   | Between 90% and<br>92%     | Between 92% and<br>94%     | More than 94%    |\n| Weighting of the indicator in the<br>amount of variable annual<br>remuneration (50% of the annual<br>remuneration cap) | 0               | 1/3                        | 2/3                        | 3/3              |\n\nThe scoring grid associated with these indicators for 2023 is as follows:\n\n| Number of<br>Points | PPM   | Number of IPB Points | Number of Post-<br>Incident<br>Responsiveness Points | Rating      |\n|---------------------|-------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| 6 pts               | 9 pts | 3 pts                | ++                                                   | 15 « R « 18 |\n| 4 pts               | 6 pts | 2 pts                | +                                                    | 10 « R « 14 |\n| 2 pts               | 3 pts | 1 pt                 | =                                                    | 5 « R « 9   |\n| 0 pt                | 0 pt  | 0 pt                 | -                                                    | 0 « R « 4   |\n\n#### *3.3.1.2.2.

Equity Ratio and Change in Remuneration and in the Group's Performance**\n\nIn accordance with Article L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code, the table below indicates, for each corporate officer of the Group, the ratios between their level of remuneration and:\n\n- the mean remuneration on a full-time equivalent basis of Group employees other than corporate officers;\n- the median remuneration on a full-time equivalent basis of Group employees other than corporate officers.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the regulatory requirements mentioned above and in accordance with the provisions of the Middlenext Code, the table indicates for each corporate officer of the Group the ratio between their level of remuneration and the level of the gross annual minimum wage (SMIC).\n\nThe table also presents the annual changes in remuneration for each corporate officer, the performance of the Group (consolidated turnover and current operating income, and the mean remuneration of Group employees over the past five financial years).\n\nThe evolution of the equity ratio is compared with the evolution of consolidated turnover and current operating income.\n\nThe amount of annual gross minimum wage was obtained by adding the monthly minimum wage amount as at January 1, 2023 (€1,709.28 gross monthly), multiplied by 4 and the minimum wage amount as at May 1, 2023 (€1,747.20 gross monthly) multiplied by 8.\n\nAs such, the amount of the gross annual net minimum wage for 2023 is €20,814.72 (based on 35 hours per week).\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor 2023, the median salary of Group employees employed full time, other than corporate officers, amounts to €29,588.88 and the mean salary of employees employed full time amounts to €36,810.96.\n\nIn order to identify the median and mean employee salaries, all employees registered at the end of the month were taken into account, with the exception of subsidized contracts (apprentices, professionalization) and interns. Part-time employees were excluded from the calculation.\n\nTotal remuneration includes:\n\n- for Group employees: the base salary, arrears, bonuses (quality bonus, performance bonus, other bonuses [exceptional bonus, birth, patent, purchasing power compensation]), sums received under profitsharing schemes and benefits in kind;\n- for members of the Executive Board: (i) their fixed remuneration for corporate officer positions held in the Group, (ii) their variable remuneration (bonuses), and (iii) benefits in kind paid out;\n- for the President of the Supervisory Board, the total remuneration includes (i) his remuneration for his role as President of the Supervisory Board and (ii) his remuneration allocated for his participation in the governance of the Group (formerly attendance fees).\n\n#### **André Coutier — President of the Supervisory Board**\n\n|                                                                            | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 | 12/31/2021

Factors That Could Have an Impact in the Event of a Public Offer**\n\nPlease take note of the following points pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code:\n\nThe capital structure as well as the known direct stakes in the Group's capital are described above and below.\n\nThere is concerted action within the meaning of Article 233-10 of the French Commercial Code between COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT (a family holding company controlled by André, Roger, the successors of Joseph Coutier and their family) and André, Roger and the successors of Joseph Coutier, which represent 69.70% of the capital and 82.08% of the voting rights.\n\nIn addition, please keep in mind that COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT and André and Roger Coutier signed an agreement on May 24, 1994 in which they decided to coordinate to implement a common shareholder policy for the Group. This agreement has been subject to regulatory declarations to the supervisory authorities, who have ensured its disclosure (SBF Notice No. 94-2365 of July 29, 1994). The duration of this shareholder agreement is five years, automatically renewable for successive five-year periods unless one of the parties terminates its commitment before the expiration of the period. In such case, the remaining members in the agreement would still be bound by the resulting obligations.\n\n#### Double voting rights exist.\n\nArticle 10 paragraph III of the Group's bylaws imposes an obligation of disclosure on any person who acquires or disposes of a percentage of capital or voting rights equal to or greater than 1%, or any multiple thereof, up to a threshold of 50%.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 In case of non-compliance with this disclosure obligation, the shares exceeding the portion that should have been declared are deprived of voting rights at shareholder meetings if, at a meeting, the failure to declare is noted and if one or more shareholders jointly holding 5% of the capital or voting rights make such request at that meeting. In this case, the shares deprived of voting rights regain this right only after a period of two years following the date on which such notice is properly served.\n\nThe Group's bylaws do not contain any other specific provisions, particularly regarding the rules for appointing and revoking members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, as well as the rules governing the management of powers within these bodies.\n\nAny amendment to the Group's bylaws must carried out in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions.\n\n# **5. Additional Information**\n\n#### **5.1. Family Links between the Corporate Officers**\n\nThe Company is majority-owned by a group of family shareholders. As a result, there is a family link between various members of the Executive Board and/or some members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAndré Coutier and Geneviève Coutier are married and are the parents of Benoit Coutier and Mathieu Coutier.\n\nEmilie Coutier, Nicolas Coutier and Christophe Coutier are cousins of Benoit Coutier and Mathieu Coutier.\n\nEmilie Coutier, Nicolas Coutier and Christophe Coutier are siblings.\n\nTo the best of the Group's knowledge, there are no other close family relationships among the corporate officers.\n\n#### **5.2. Lack of Fraud Convictions against Members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board has been subject to a fraud conviction in the past five years.\n\n#### **5.3. Bankruptcy, Court-Ordered Receivership or Liquidation with Which Members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board Have Been Associated**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, none of the members of the Management Board or the Supervisory Board has been involved in a bankruptcy, court-ordered receivership or liquidation in the past five years as a member of a management, executive or supervisory body.\n\n#### **5.4. Official Public Indictment and/or Sanction Imposed against Members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board has been subject to any official public indictment or sanction imposed by the statutory or regulatory authorities (including designated professional bodies) in the last five years.\n\n#### **5.5. Ban on Acting As a Corporate Officer or Intervening in the Management or Conduct of Affairs of an Issuer**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board has been prohibited by a court from acting as a member of a management body, including executive or supervisory roles, or from intervening in the management or conduct of affairs of an issuer in the last five years.\n\n# **5.6. Conflicts of Interest at the Level of Executive and Supervisory Bodies**\n\nAs at the date of this report, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no conflicts of interest have been identified between the duties of each member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board toward the Group in their capacity as corporate officers and their private interests or other duties.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **5.7. Restrictions on Asset Transfers**\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, no restriction has been accepted by a member of the Supervisory Board concerning the transfer, for a given period, of their holding in the Group's share capital.\n\n#### **5.8. Agreements Entered Into between a Director or a Significant Shareholder and a Subsidiary**\n\nThroughout the financial year, the agreements entered into within the scope of Article L.225-37-4 (2) of the French Commercial Code are as follows:\n\n- lease agreement between COUTIER DEVELOPPEMENT and AKWEL GERMANY SERVICES GMBH;\n- lease agreement between COUTIER DEVELOPMENT and AKWEL CADILLAC USA, INC.\n\n# **6. Observations by the Supervisory Board on the Management Report Prepared by the Executive Board and on the Annual Accounts for the 2023 Financial Year**\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nSummoned to the Combined General Meeting in accordance with the law and the bylaws, notably to present the financial statements of the past financial year for your consideration and approval, you have recently reviewed the reports of the Executive Board and of the Statutory Auditors on the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-20 of the French Commercial Code, we would like to draw your attention to our observations regarding the Executive Board's management report and the annual accounts for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nFurthermore, we wish to inform you of the topics discussed by the Supervisory Board, as presented in Section *[2.1.2.4](#page-113-0)* of the annual report.\n\nFirstly, good relations were maintained throughout the financial year with the Executive Board, which regularly provided reports on its activities and all necessary information, enabling the Supervisory Board to fulfill its ongoing monitoring endeavor with due diligence.\n\nWe would like to inform you that the statutory and consolidated annual accounts for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, along with the management report, have been submitted to the Supervisory Board within the deadlines stipulated by the legal and regulatory provisions.\n\nThus, during the meeting of the Supervisory Board on April 4, 2024, the Executive Board presented to us the statutory annual accounts for the 2023 financial year, the consolidated financial statements and the management report prepared on the accounts and operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Executive Board's report to the General Meeting does not elicit any specific comments from the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe accounts for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, highlight the following main items:\n\n| (in thousands of euro)   | Consolidated Accounts | Corporate Accounts |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Balance Sheet Total      | 882,942               | 454,128            |\n| Revenue                  | 1,066,373             | 362,168            |\n| Profit/Loss for the Year | 35,469                | (94)               |\n\nOver the year, the activity was notably marked by:\n\n- the 5.7% growth of the global automotive market, which allowed the Group to increase its revenue and to return to profitability. The Group's entities were also able to pass on some of the cost increases to their sales prices; and\n- a slightly lower net cash position compared to 2022 but still at a high level (€105 million).\n\nThe Supervisory Board studied the proposals for resolutions that were submitted to the General Meeting and invites you to approve them in order to provide the Executive Board the necessary means to implement its strategy.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board does not have any particular observation to make concerning the accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, as they were presented to you after being examined by the Audit Committee and certified by the Statutory Auditors.

Accounting Rules and Methods**\n\nThe Group's consolidated accounts were approved by the Executive Board on April 3, 2024.\n\n#### **1.1. Key Events of the Past Financial Year**\n\nDuring the past financial year, significant operations and events in terms of scope or organization were as follows:\n\n- Decision to close the Gournay site\n- Increase in turnover due to growth in the automotive production market and the impact of increases in raw material costs and other costs on sales prices\n- Increase in personnel costs due to wage inflation\n\n#### **1.2. Compliance Statement**\n\nIn accordance with European Regulations 1606/2002 and 1725/2003, the consolidated financial statements of the AKWEL Group are prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards applicable within the European Union as at December 31, 2023. International accounting standards include IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), IAS (International Accounting Standards), and amendments by the SIC and the IFRIC (Standards Interpretations Committee and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee) and their interpretations, which are available on the following website: [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/fr/index.htm)\n\nThe consolidated accounts are presented in euro and rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n#### **1.3. New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Applicable in 2023**\n\nThe consolidated accounts are prepared in accordance with the accounting and valuation rules defined by the IFRS framework (standards, amendments and interpretations) adopted by the European Commission as at December 31, 2023. This framework is available on the European Commission's website.\n\nThe new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Commission, applicable from January 1, 2023, are presented below:\n\n- amendments to IAS 1, Disclosure of Accounting Policies; and update of a practical application guide on materiality (IFRS Practice Statement 2: Making Materiality Judgements), adopted by the European Union (EU) in March 2022;\n- amendments to IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, adopted by the EU in March 2022;\n- amendments to IAS 12, Deferred taxes related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction, adopted by the EU in August 2022;\n- amendments to IAS 12 Pillar 2, adopted by the EU in November 2023 and immediately applicable in 2023 (a). IFRS 17 and amendments – \"Insurance Contracts\" and amendments to standard 17.\n\nThese amendments had no impact on the Group's accounts as at December 31, 2023.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 The Group applied the IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" amendment concerning the application of European Directive Pillar 2, which enables it to exclude potential effects of the Directive on the calculation of deferred taxes. The impact on the Group's consolidated accounts is currently being assessed. Based on the information available to date, the Group does not anticipate a significant impact from the implementation of Pillar 2, starting from the 2024 financial year, on the current tax expenses related to the top-up tax payable under Pillar 2.\n\nOther new standards, amendments and interpretations applicable from January 1, 2023 are either not applicable or have not had a significant impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe Group has chosen not to implement in advance the standards, amendments and interpretations adopted or in the process of being adopted by the European Union, but whose early application would have been possible as interpretations of existing texts, and which will come into force after December 31, 2023, notably:\n\nFor periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024:\n\n- the IFRS 16 amendment \"Lease Liability in a sale and Leaseback Transaction,\" published by the EU in November 2023;\n- the IAS 1 amendment \"Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\" and \"Non-current Liabilities with Covenants,\" adopted by the EU in December 2023;\n- the IFRS 7 amendment \"Financial Instruments: Supplier Finance Arrangements,\" adopted by the IASB in May 2023 and currently being adopted by the EU;\n- the amendment of standard and interpretation IFRS 14 \"Regulatory Deferral Accounts.\"\n\nFor periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025:\n\n The IAS 21 amendment \"Lack of Exchangeability,\" adopted by the IASB in August 2023 and currently being adopted by the EU.\n\nThe Group does not expect these amendments to have a significant impact on its financial statements.\n\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe financial statements reflect the assumptions and estimates made by the Group's Management. Presenting financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in order to evaluate certain assets, liabilities, income, expenses and commitments. The final data may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Goodwill, impairment tests, deferred tax assets, provisions recorded in the balance sheet liabilities and lease contract durations are the main elements of the consolidated financial statements affected by the use of assumptions and estimates.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Group did not observe a significant change in the level of uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, especially considering the uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, with the exception of the very high volatility of the discount rate used to calculate employee commitments (see note *[1.6.9](#page-181-0) [Pension Obligations](#page-181-0)*) and those related to translation adjustments.\n\n#### **1.3.1. The Impacts of Hyperinflation in Türkiye and Argentina on the Group**\n\n#### <span id=\"page-173-1\"></span><span id=\"page-173-0\"></span>*1.3.1.1. The Euro as the Functional Currency for Turkish Subsidiaries*\n\nIn 2022, due to the high inflation rate in Türkiye (64% for the year) and the continuous depreciation of the Turkish lira since 2020, Türkiye was included in the list of hyperinflationary economies. This led the Group to apply IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\" The impact of applying this standard resulted in recognizing a loss on monetary position of €14.3 million in the consolidated income statement at December 31, 2022.\n\nIn 2023, after thorough analysis, it was determined that the functional currency for both Turkish subsidiaries was the euro. As a result, the Group now applies IAS 21 \"The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.\"\n\nThe chosen effective date is January 1, 2022, closest to the date when Türkiye was declared to be in hyperinflation (April 2022). As a result, the Group had to revise its 2022 accounts.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe consolidated financial statements (Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement) present, in a dedicated column, the restated figures for the 2022 financial year. Where appropriate, the notes disclose the impact accordingly.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 8, significant adjustments resulting from error corrections must be recognized retrospectively, i.e. by correcting the recognition, measurement and disclosures (IAS 8.5 and 8.42).\n\nThe corrections made in the 2022 financial year have the following impacts:\n\n| (in thousands of euro)

flows or on the valuation of the CGUs (no amendment to the conclusions of the impairment tests conducted as at December 31, 2022).\n\n#### *1.3.1.2. Impacts of Hyperinflation in Argentina*\n\nConsidering the non-significant nature of the subsidiary, the Group does not apply IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\"\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.4. Scope of Consolidation**\n\nSignificant companies in which the Group has direct or indirect exclusive control are fully consolidated. The exclusive control is assessed according to the criteria defined by IFRS 10 (direct or indirect power to direct the financial and operational policies of the relevant activities, exposure to variable returns and the ability to use its power to influence returns). This control is generally presumed to exist in companies where the Group directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the voting rights of the controlled entity. To assess this control, potential immediately exercisable voting rights are taken into account, including those held by another entity.\n\nSignificant associated companies in which the Group directly or indirectly exerts notable influence are accounted for using the equity method. Notable influence refers to having the power to shape the financial and operational policies of a company without, however, exercising control over its policies. It is presumed to exist when the Group directly or indirectly holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Equity accounting involves substituting the carrying amount of the securities held with the share they represent in the associated Group's equity, including the results of the financial year.\n\nThe analysis of partnerships conducted according to the criteria defined by IFRS 11 revealed only joint ventures and no joint activities. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe list of companies included in the consolidation scope as of December 31, 2023, is provided in *note [2](#page-187-0)*.\n\nAll significant transactions between the consolidated companies are eliminated, as well as unrealized internal profits included in the fixed assets and inventories of the consolidated entities.\n\n#### **1.4.1. Business Combinations**\n\nSince 2010, the Group has been applying the revised standards IFRS 3 \"Business Combinations\" and IAS 27 \"Consolidate and Separate Financial Statements.\" In accordance with this method, the Group recognizes the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at their fair value, as of the date of acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition cost corresponds to the fair value, at the date of the exchange, of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and/or equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquired entity.\n\nExpenses related to a business combination are not part of the fair value exchanged. They are recognized as expenses and are not included in the acquisition cost of the securities.\n\nThe Group assesses minority interests in a takeover either at their fair value (full goodwill method) or based on their share of the acquired Group's net assets (partial goodwill method). The option is chosen for each acquisition.\n\nThe impact of changes in the consolidation scope without amending the control is recognized directly in consolidated reserves.\n\nWhen the business combination agreement provides for a price adjustment dependent on future events, the Group includes the amount of this adjustment in the business combination cost at the acquisition date if this adjustment is likely and can be reliably measured. Any subsequent variation is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group has a 12-month period from the acquisition date to complete the accounting for the considered business combination (excluding variations in price adjustments — see above). Any change to the acquisition price made outside the allocation period results in no change to the acquisition cost or goodwill. This 12-month period does not apply to price adjustment clauses, the variations of which are recognized in profit or loss post-acquisition.\n\n#### **1.5. Conversion of the Financial Statements and Foreign-Currency Transactions**\n\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency that is significant to the operations of the respective subsidiary. This is most often the local currency.\n\nThe Group applies the closing-rate method to convert subsidiary financial statements:\n\n- all balance-sheet items of foreign subsidiaries are converted at the closing rate, except for equity;\n- income statement items of foreign subsidiaries, denominated in the local currency, are converted at the average rate for the period;\n- Group share of equity is converted at the historical rate, except for the current year's profit, which is converted at the average rate;\n- translation adjustments are recognized in other comprehensive income;\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\ngoodwill arising from foreign subsidiaries is recorded in the subsidiary's currency.\n\nExchange differences resulting from currency transactions during the period are included in the income statement under current operating income.\n\nThe accounting principles adopted for the conversion of subsidiaries located in hyperinflationary economies are presented in note *[1.3.1](#page-173-1)*. Except for Turkish subsidiaries from 2022 onward, the Group has no other significant subsidiaries in hyperinflationary countries.\n\nThe Group has not implemented any currency risk hedging instruments for the periods presented.\n\nIn the event of the disposal of foreign subsidiaries that prepare their accounts in a currency other than the euro, the cumulative translation adjustments are recycled into profit or loss to be included in the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nExchange differences related to a monetary item that is essentially part of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary are recognized directly in consolidated equity under the \"Translation adjustment\" item, provided the criteria defined by the standard are met.\n\n#### **1.6. Accounting Principles and Methods**\n\nThe accounts of the Group's companies, prepared according to the accounting rules in force in their country of operation, are adjusted before being consolidated when there are discrepancies in accounting principles compared to those adopted by the Group.\n\n#### **1.6.1. Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost and primarily include the following:\n\n- patents (amortized on a straight-line basis over their protection period);\n- software (amortized on a straight-line basis over a period ranging from one to three years).\n\nResearch expenses are recognized as charges in the financial year in which they are incurred. Development costs are recognized as intangible assets when the conditions related to technical feasibility, market potential, the ability to reliably measure attributable costs, and the generation of future economic benefits are met. Development costs are reviewed on an annual basis in order to determine whether the accounting criteria of an intangible asset have been fulfilled.\n\nIn 2023, as in 2022, no development cost has been capitalized as the capitalization criteria were not met. Indeed, in order to capitalize development costs incurred as part of a new product project or a significant change in an existing product, six criteria must be met.\n\nOne of these criteria requires that the existence of a market for the output of the project be demonstrated. The market is considered proven when the Group has received manufacturer homologation and the volumes proposed by the manufacturers generate sufficient profitability. However, the corresponding development costs are incurred at a stage of the project prior to manufacturer homologation. The amount of Research and Development expenses recognized as expenses during the 2023 financial year amounts to €62.6 million (€58.5 million in 2022).\n\n#### **1.6.2. Goodwill**\n\nThe positive difference between the acquisition cost of the securities and the fair value of the subsidiary's assets and liabilities at that date constitutes goodwill, which is recorded as an intangible asset under \"Goodwill\" in the consolidated balance sheet. Unallocated business goodwill is also deemed goodwill.\n\nThe acquisition price includes the impact of any adjustments to the acquisition price, such as price supplements. Price supplements are calculated by applying the criteria stipulated in the purchase agreement (turnover, income, etc.) to the most likely forecasts. They are estimated again upon each closure, and any changes are allocated to profit or loss (including within a year following the acquisition date). They are updated whenever there is a significant impact. Where appropriate, the impact of the \"unwinding\" of the debt recorded in the liabilities is recognized in the \"Cost of net financial indebtedness\" category. Acquisition costs are recognized directly as expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the exception provided by IFRS 1, the value of positive goodwill determined according to French GAAP was not adjusted to IFRS standards during the transition to IFRS in 2005.\n\nWhen goodwill is negative, it is immediately recognized in profit or loss.\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is not amortized. It is, however, subject to impairment tests (see *note [7](#page-191-0)*).\n\n#### **Impairment Tests on Non-Financial, Non-Current Assets**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, impairment tests are conducted at least once a year for non-amortized assets (mainly goodwill), and for other tangible and intangible assets if there are indications of impairment.\n\nIn practice, non-financial, non-current assets mainly consist of goodwill and land.\n\nFor the impairment testing of goodwill, the goodwill is allocated among the cash-generating units (CGUs), which are homogeneous groups that generate independent cash flows.\n\nRegarding goodwill, the CGUs correspond to the countries of operation (France, Spain, Türkiye, China, United States, Sweden, etc.). There have been no CGU changes over the financial years presented.\n\nThe carrying amount of the assets grouped in this manner is compared to the higher of their value in use and their net market value minus sales costs. In practice, only the value in use is applied.\n\nThe value in use of goodwill is determined based on the discounted future cash flows of the CGUs using the following economic assumptions:\n\n- the cash flows used are derived from the 2024 budgets and are extended over a total explicit period of five years;\n- beyond this period, the terminal value is calculated by capitalizing the last cash flow of the explicit period indefinitely at a perpetual growth rate of 1.5% (1.5% in 2022);\n- the discount rate corresponds to a weighted average cost of capital after tax. Using this method results in recoverable amounts that are identical to those obtained using a pre-tax rate on pre-tax cash flows.\n\nThe discount rate used as at December 31, 2023 to discount future cash flows is 10.3%, compared to 9.0% as at December 31, 2022.\n\nIn the absence of identified country risks, identical industry sectors, a similar customer base and homogeneous operations, the Group has not customized the discount rate or the perpetual growth rate for each CGU.\n\nWhen the tests indicate an impairment, it is first charged against goodwill, and then against the other assets of the CGU, up to their recoverable amount. Impairments are recognized in either current or non-current operating income, depending on the cause of the impairment. Impairments on goodwill are irreversible until the related cash-generating units are disposed of, except in the case of equity associates.\n\n#### **1.6.3. Property, plant and equipment**\n\n<span id=\"page-177-0\"></span>Fixed assets are measured at their acquisition cost or at their fair value in the case of business combinations. The Group has opted for the revaluation of land as presented below in *note [9](#page-193-0)*.\n\nThe analysis conducted according to IAS 23 did not result in the capitalization of borrowing costs.\n\nFor consistency, depreciation is adjusted on a straight-line basis over the assets' useful life.\n\nThe generally adopted depreciation periods are as follows:\n\n- buildings: 25 to 40 years;\n- building fixtures: 5 to 10 years;\n- technical installations: 5 to 10 years;\n- industrial equipment and tools: 5 to 10 years;\n- general installations: 10 years;\n- furniture and office equipment: 5 to 10 years.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, the Group would conduct impairment tests, using a methodology similar to that applied to goodwill, if any indicators of impairment were identified.\n\nThe Group's assets are not subject to expenditures under major multi-year maintenance or overhaul programs. The expenses incurred serve solely to verify the proper functioning of the installations and to perform maintenance without extending their useful life beyond the initially planned period.\n\nThe Group's property, plant and equipment do not have significant residual values.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe analysis conducted did not identify any lease-related assets that would need to be tested independently of a cash generating unit (CGU).\n\n#### **Accounting Principles Related to the Adjustments of Lease Contracts**\n\nIFRS 16 no longer distinguishes, from the lessee's perspective, between finance leases and operating leases.\n\nLease contracts, or contracts that contain a lease, are agreements that grant the right to control the use of an identified asset for a specified period in exchange for consideration.\n\nLease contracts meeting this definition are accounted for according to the guidelines below, except in cases of exemptions stipulated by the standard (such as contracts with terms under 12 months or low-value underlying assets) and for contracts not adjusted due to their negligible impact. In practice, the analysis has resulted in adjustments being made solely for real estate lease contracts.\n\nFor contracts not treated as lease contracts, rental payments are recognized as expenses evenly over the contract term.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor contracts falling under the purview of IFRS 16, the accounting treatment is as follows:\n\n- at the contract start date, the Group recognizes an asset for the right of use and a financial liability for the lease obligation;\n- the lease obligation is assessed at the discounted value of the unpaid lease payments over the contract term. The discounted value is calculated using the explicit interest rate for finance leases and the incremental borrowing rate for other cases. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated for each country according to the contract term and the repayment profile (duration rate);\n- the lease term is the non-cancellable period that corresponds to the enforceable period. In accordance with the IFRS IC interpretation of November 2019, the Group considers the date until which the lessee is reasonably certain to continue the lease beyond the contractual term;\n- there are no early termination clauses in the various leases, and there are no clauses that would lead lessors to pay the Group a more than insignificant penalty if the lease is not renewed at the end of the noncancellable period.\n\nIn practice:\n\n- the durations used for lease contracts in France correspond to the enforceable period of nine years (\"3/6/9\" commercial leases): a non-cancellable period of three years and certainty of exercising renewal options after three and six years. In cases where there is no specified duration in the contract, assets related to the right of use will be amortized over ten years, which corresponds to the average economic useful life of the assets concerned.\n- there are no early termination clauses in the various leases, and there are no clauses that would lead lessors to pay the Group a more than insignificant penalty if the lease is not renewed at the end of the noncancellable period.\n\nLease payments include fixed payments, variable payments dependent on an index or rate, and the exercise prices of purchase options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. In practice, most lease payments are fixed and there are no purchase options.\n\nAssets related to usage rights are measured using the cost model as follows: the cost is reduced by the accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted to reflect any revaluations of the lease liability.\n\nAssets related to usage rights are amortized over the economic useful life for leases with a purchase option, and over the lease term used to determine the lease liability for other leases.\n\n#### **Impact on Cash Flows**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 7, only the repayments of debt related to lease liabilities are reported in the cash flow statement — under financing activities. The flows related to the increase in assets and liabilities from lease contracts are offset.\n\n<span id=\"page-179-0\"></span>The interest paid on lease liabilities is presented under \"Changes in debt,\" similar to other interest payments.\n\n#### **1.6.4. Non-current financial assets**\n\n**Financial assets valued at amortized cost:**\n\nThis item primarily includes deposits and guarantees paid by the Group's companies.\n\n#### **Assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income:**\n\nThe Group measures non-consolidated equity securities at their fair value through other comprehensive income, which is not recyclable to profit or loss (see *1*[.9\\)](#page-185-0). In exceptional circumstances (e.g. lack of reliable and recent information), the historical cost is deemed to be an acceptable benchmark of the fair value.\n\n#### **Assets measured at fair value through profit and loss:**\n\nNo non-current financial assets are included in this category.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.6.5. Inventory**\n\nInventory is valued at the purchase price for raw materials and at the factory cost price for finished goods and work in progress. Factory cost price excludes overheads that do not contribute to production and financial expenses. All of these costs are calculated using the first in, first out method and, given the inventory turnover, are close to the latest cost prices.\n\nA provision for impairment is recognized when the net value of the inventory exceeds its net realizable value and/or when indicators of value loss are identified (turnover, obsolescence, etc.).\n\nTools are valued at full cost up to the billable price to customers.\n\n#### **1.6.6. Accounts Receivable , Other Asset and Liabilities Related to Customer Contracts**\n\n#### **Accounts Receivable:**\n\nAccounts receivable are initially recorded at the fair value of the consideration to be received. The fair value of accounts receivable is considered to be their nominal value, given the usual payment terms of three months or less. Accounts receivable are adjusted at the balance sheet date for bills sent for collection that are not yet due, as well as for bills subject to discounting. Trade receivables that have not yet matured and are sold under a factoring agreement, but do not meet the derecognition criteria of IAS 39, remain under the \"Trade and similar receivables\" item; otherwise, they are recorded as cash.\n\nA provision is recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 based on expected credit losses, taking into account any collateral. It should be noted that, overall, the customer risk is considered to be low.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach for impairment of receivables. The Group distinguishes doubtful receivables (customers with a high risk of default) from other accounts receivable.\n\nDoubtful receivables are adjusted on a case-by-case basis.\n\nNon-doubtful accounts receivable are adjusted based on a provisioning matrix, which considers both the probability of default and the probability of loss given default.\n\nThe probabilities are based on a risk analysis considering quantitative and qualitative criteria such as the financial situation of the customer, the age of the receivable and the existence of any disputes.\n\n#### **Other assets related to customer contracts:**\n\nThere are no assets related to the costs of obtaining or executing contracts.\n\n#### **Netting agreements:**\n\nNone.\n\n#### **Contracts with a significant financing component:**\n\nNone.\n\n**Liabilities related to customer contracts:**\n\nLiabilities related to customer contracts include:\n\n- debts owed to customers for consideration to be paid to customers;\n- <span id=\"page-180-0\"></span>deferred income, of little significance, aimed at allocating revenue over the financial year.\n\n#### **1.6.7. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash at bank and in hand essentially comprises overdraft bank accounts.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are marketable securities that meet the criteria of IAS 7 for classification as \"cash and cash equivalents\": short-term investments, highly liquid and easily convertible into a known amount of cash, and subject to negligible risk of value fluctuations.\n\nThey are initially recorded at acquisition cost and subsequently measured at fair value, which corresponds to the market value at the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are recorded under financial income.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.6.8. Payable and Deferred Taxes**\n\n#### **Taxes Payable**\n\nTax receivables and payables include assets and liabilities related to tax uncertainties and risks, in accordance with IFRIC 23. In practice, no amount has been reported in the financial years presented regarding tax uncertainties.\n\n#### **Deferred taxes**\n\nDeferred taxes reflect the timing differences between expenses and revenues recognized for financial reporting purposes in the consolidated financial statements and those recognized for corporate income tax purposes.\n\nThese deferred taxes, determined using the variable-rate method, mainly result from:\n\n- provisions not deductible on a temporary basis;\n- consolidation adjustments (amortization method, lease contracts, severance pay, etc.).\n- elimination of internal profit included in inventories.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted or substantially enacted tax rate at year-end. In practice, no significant changes in tax rates are expected. Deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards are recognized only to the extent that they can be offset against future taxable differences when there is a reasonable likelihood of realization or recovery through offsetting against future results, or when there are opportunities for tax optimization initiated by AKWEL. The time horizon for estimating future profits is a maximum of five years, with a periodic review of the assumptions and forecasts used. Furthermore, any regulations governing the capping of the use of deficits are considered, where relevant.\n\nApplying the above principles has led to the non-recognition, at Group level, of deferred tax assets related to tax losses incurred by certain subsidiaries at year-end due to uncertainties regarding their future use and the absence of a precise schedule for using tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset when they relate to the same tax entity.\n\n<span id=\"page-181-0\"></span>In accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are not discounted.\n\n#### **1.6.9. Pension Obligations**\n\nFor defined contribution plans, the Group's payments are recognized as expenses in the period to which they relate.\n\nFor defined benefit plans concerning post-employment benefits, the costs of benefits are estimated using the projected unit credit method with end-of-career salary.\n\nThe amounts of rights acquired by employees under various applicable collective agreements are assessed based on actuarial assumptions (changes in salary, retirement age, mortality, staff turnover), then discounted to their present value based on a discount rate. The corresponding provision for these acquired rights is fully recognized in provisions for retirement and other benefits.\n\nIn the absence of collective agreements providing for ceilings and/or acquisition tiers of rights, the obligations are recognized taking into account employees' length of service.\n\nThe discount rate was determined taking into account the yield on private bonds with no risk and a maturity close to that of the commitments.\n\nThe amounts were calculated based on a discount rate of 3.22% (compared to 3.84% at year-end 2022), a salary increase of 2.5% (compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022) for both executives and non-executives, a retirement age of 67 and average assumptions regarding staff turnover. These assumptions apply to the French entities, which represent the most significant portion of the recognized pension obligations.\n\nActive and former members of the governing and management bodies does not receive any specific benefit in terms of pension.\n\nThe cost of services rendered and the financial cost are reported in consolidated profit or loss. The impact of changes in system is also immediately recognized in consolidated profit or loss. There have been no changes in system over the financial years presented.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Actuarial gains and losses (related to changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not recyclable to profit or loss.\n\nNo changes or amendments to the plan have occurred during the periods presented, except for the pension reform in France, which was adopted in April 2023 and came into force on September 1, 2023. The impact of this reform is insignificant.\n\nFinally, the Group has not opted to outsource funding of the obligation to a fund.\n\n### **1.6.10. Share-Based Payments**\n\nWhere applicable, pursuant IFRS 2, the stock subscription or purchase options granted to employees that are settled in shares are measured at their fair value. This fair value is recognized in the income statement over the vesting period of the exercise rights by the employees, taking into account a probability of rights vesting, reevaluated at each year-end. The cumulative benefit amount is fixed at the vesting date, based on the rights actually vested. It is then reclassified to reserves when the rights are exercised or forfeited.\n\n# **1.6.11. Provisions (Excluding Tax Uncertainties)**\n\nIn general, management has reviewed every known dispute involving the Group as at the balance sheet date. Where appropriate, after consulting with external advisors, provisions deemed necessary have been made to hedge the estimated risks.\n\nContingent assets are disclosed in the notes when their realization is likely and their amount is significant. Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the notes when their amount is significant.\n\n#### **1.6.12. Loans and Financial Debt**\n\nLoans and financial debt are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nThe accounting rules for lease liabilities under IFRS 16 are presented in note *[1.6.3](#page-177-0)* on accounting principles related to the adjustments of lease contracts.\n\n#### **1.6.13. Derivatives**\n\n#### *1.6.13.1.Currency Risk*\n\nThe Group and its subsidiaries primarily conduct purchase and sales transactions in the same currencies, thereby naturally hedging against exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, the Group does not currently use financial instruments to hedge its commercial flows.\n\n#### *1.6.13.2.Interest-Rate Risk*\n\nHistorically, the Group's companies have not held any hedging contracts to secure a maximum fixed rate on a portion of the variable-rate financings in place.\n\n#### **1.6.14. Assets/Liabilities Held for Sale, Discontinued Operations**\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value minus costs to sell.\n\nWhen applicable, and in compliance with IFRS 5, the results of discontinued operations are presented on a separate line in the income statement. No assets or liabilities meet this definition for the periods presented.\n\n#### **1.6.15. Own Shares**\n\nMovements (acquisitions and disposals) of the parent company's shares, whether held by the Parent Company itself or by one of its consolidated subsidiaries, are recognized directly in equity.\n\nGains or losses on the disposal of these shares are directly allocated to equity, net of the corresponding tax.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-183-0\"></span>**1.7. Presentation of the Income Statement**\n\n#### **1.7.1. Revenue**\n\nIFRS 15 establishes the principles for recognizing revenue based on a five-step analysis:\n\n- identification of the contract;\n- identification of the various performance obligations, i.e. the list of goods or services the seller has committed to providing to the buyer;\n- determination of the overall contract price;\n- allocation of the overall price to each performance obligation;\n- recognition of revenue and the related costs when a performance obligation is met.\n\nSales of parts and tools are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery, which corresponds to the date control is transferred, according to the specific terms of each contract or order.\n\nThe Group has selected the main transactions and contracts that represent its current and future activities. These transactions and contracts have been analyzed according to the five-step model required by the standard, particularly to identify areas of judgment. The conclusions of this analysis are outlined below.\n\nFor a particular automotive project, the three main commitments made by the Group to a manufacturer, generally identified during the preliminary analysis, are as follows:\n\n- product study, which includes determining the intrinsic technical specifications of the parts as well as those related to the associated production process;\n- provision of production tools, such as molds and other equipment used for manufacturing parts;\n- supply of parts.\n\nThe analysis concluded that these three phases are distinct performance obligations for which the Group recognizes revenue upon delivery/completion. In most cases, each performance obligation has a specific legal contract. Each contract is therefore independent, and after fulfilling the performance obligation, the manufacturer can opt out of the other contracts related to the same references without penalty, demonstrating the distinct nature of these performance obligations. When multiple performance obligations are combined in a single contract, the Group's policy is to set the price for each performance obligation independently. This approach mitigates the risk of loss if a contract is terminated after a specific service is completed.\n\nRevenue from tools is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is considered satisfied when the customer validates the conformity of the tool. Until this transfer is completed, production costs are capitalized up to the billable amount to the customer.\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Transaction prices are allocated to the performance obligations based on the contractual prices specific to each obligation as described above. Given the independence of the contracts and the risk of the manufacturer opting out of executing the other legal contracts, the Group negotiates with manufacturers for each contract based on standalone prices.\n\nAs for contributions received from clients on development costs and prototypes, they are now presented on the \"Turnover\" line as they result from a contract with a customer to obtain, in exchange for consideration, goods or services derived from the Group's regular activities. Moreover, the guarantees given are not optional.\n\n#### **Guarantees:**\n\nFurthermore, the Group considers that the contractual promise made to the manufacturer regarding the warranty of supplied parts does not meet the definition of a distinct performance obligation as it does not entail an \"additional service.\" Therefore, warranty costs will continue to be recognized in accordance with IAS 37 \"Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\"\n\n#### **Agent/Principal Distinction:**\n\nThe use of subcontracting is limited due to the degree of integration within the Group. When subcontracting occurs, the Group bundles subcontracted products into larger groups and therefore remains responsible for providing the goods or services as the principal.\n\nFor certain specific contracts, upon reviewing the relationship with the end customer, the Group considers itself to be acting as an agent rather than a principal.\n\n#### **Other points:**\n\n- customer contracts do not include a \"financing\" component;\n- revenue recognition rules do not rely on significant estimates.\n\n#### **1.7.2. Personnel expenses**\n\nPersonnel expenses include temporary staff costs and employee profit-sharing.\n\n#### **1.7.3. Territorial Economic Contribution**\n\n<span id=\"page-184-0\"></span>Both CVAE (contribution on the added value of enterprises) and CFE (business property tax) are classified as operational expenses.\n\n#### **1.7.4. Current operating income**\n\nThe Group primarily uses current operating income as a performance indicator.\n\nThe current operating income corresponds to the net income before taking into account:\n\n- various income and expenses, which mainly include significant restructuring costs;\n- gains and losses and changes in provisions covering exceptional events, either because they are abnormal in amount or impact, or because they occur rarely;\n- gains or losses on disposals or depreciation of assets;\n- non-current impairments of goodwill, where the event leading to the impairment is non-current;\n- of the financial income;\n- current and deferred taxes;\n- the net income of associated companies.\n\nThis presentation is in line with the recommendation of the French Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) No. 2013-03 dated November 7, 2013.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1.8. Earnings per Share**\n\nEarnings per share is calculated based on the average number of shares in circulation during the financial year, using the net income attributable to the Group.\n\nDiluted earnings per share takes into account potential shares resulting from the exercise of rights attached to issued subscription warrants. As at December 31, 2023, there were no new shares that could potentially be created, as no subscription options were outstanding or exercised.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-185-0\"></span>**1.9. Financial Instruments — Financial Assets and Liabilities, Derivatives**\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented in several sections of the balance sheet (non-current financial assets, customers, other current assets, trade payables, other current debt, financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents). Financial instruments are allocated to categories that do not correspond to identified sections of the balance sheet, with the allocation determining the rules for recognition and measurement.\n\nPresentation of the three categories of financial assets: see *note [1.6.4.](#page-179-0)*\n\nThe main financial liabilities (mainly loans and trade payables) are evaluated at amortized cost.\n\nThe Group has not implemented hedging instruments meeting the definition of hedge as provided in IFRS 9.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, financial instruments are presented in three categories (see *note [22](#page-203-0)*), according to a hierarchy of methods for determining fair value:\n\n- Level 1: Fair value calculated by reference to unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets and liabilities;\n- Level 2: Fair value calculated by reference to observable market data for the asset or liability concerned, either directly (adjusted Level 1 quoted prices), or indirectly through data derived from pricing techniques based on observable data such as prices of similar assets or liabilities or parameters quoted in an active market;\n- Level 3: Fair value calculated by reference to data relating to the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data (e.g. based on valuation techniques relying in whole or in part on unobservable data such as prices in an inactive market or valuation based on multiples for unquoted securities).\n\nThe application of this standard to calculate the fair value of financial instruments did not result in identifying adjustments due to non-performance risk (counterparty risk and own credit risk) compared to previous calculations.\n\n#### **1.10. Segment Information**\n\nThe Group has defined only one business segment, which is the design, production and delivery of components, parts or functions for the automotive industry.\n\nThe Group has identified five geographical regions to allocate resources to different sectors and to assess their performance:\n\n- France;\n- Europe and Africa;\n- North America;\n- South America;\n- Rest of the world.\n\nThese regions were determined based on their geographical proximity, their similar economic characteristics, and their contribution to the Group's revenue and income.\n\nThe breakdown of revenue and assets by geographical areas is provided in *note [3.1](#page-189-0)*.\n\nGeographical data tracked in the Group's management reports is limited to investments only.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 The Group's revenue depends directly on the level of automotive production worldwide, particularly in Europe, North America, Türkiye and China. This production can be affected by the general economic situation, government programs (notably vehicle purchase incentives), trade agreements, regulatory changes, and social issues (including strikes and work stoppages). In addition, the Group does 67% of its business directly with the three automakers (Stellantis, Ford and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi). The performance of these three manufacturers therefore has a considerable impact on the Group's revenue.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-186-0\"></span>**1.11. Cash Flow Statement**\n\nThe Group applies the indirect method of presenting cash flows, following a presentation similar to the model proposed by the French Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) in its recommendation 2013-03 of November 7, 2013.\n\nThe cash flows for the financial year are divided between cash flows generated by operating activities, investing activities and equity transactions.\n\nThe cash flow statement is prepared based on the following rules:\n\n- net cash corresponds to the net of debit and credit positions;\n- capital gains and losses are presented net of tax when the Group incurs a tax liability;\n- provisions for current assets are recorded in the changes in operating flow of working capital and are allocated to the corresponding asset items (inventory, accounts receivable, other current or non-current receivables).\n- property, plant and equipment acquisitions are presented net of changes in liabilities related thereto. Income from disposals is presented net of changes in receivables from fixed asset disposals;\n- increases in assets related to usage rights (IFRS 16) are offset against increases in lease liabilities;\n- repayments of lease-related debts are presented in financing cash flows;\n- the interest paid on lease liabilities is presented under \"Changes in debt,\" similar to other interest payments.\n\nThe impact of changes in consolidation scope is presented as a net amount in investment cash flows. It corresponds to the price actually paid/received during the financial year, adjusted for the acquired cash assets/liabilities.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are described in the \"Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated accounts\" section of this report.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nWe carried out our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules set forth in the French Commercial Code and the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of issuance of our report. We did not provide any services prohibited under Article 5 Paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n#### **Observation**\n\nWithout qualifying our opinion expressed above, we would like to draw your attention to the matter described in note 1.3.1.1 of the notes to the consolidated accounts, which outlines the accounting treatment applied at the end of the financial year for the Turkish subsidiaries.\n\n# **Justification of Assessments — Key Audit Matters**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180 of the French Commercial Code concerning the justification of our assessments, we wish to bring to your attention the key audit matters related to the risks of material misstatement. The latter, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the consolidated accounts for the year, as well as the responses we provided to address these risks.\n\nThese assessments are made in the context of the audit of the consolidated accounts taken as a whole and in the formation of our opinion expressed above. We do not express an opinion on individual components of these consolidated accounts.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Evaluation of Provisions Related to Technical and Commercial Risks**\n\nNotes 1.6.11 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Accounts\n\n#### Identified Risk\n\nAs the Group is present in several countries and is a supplier to numerous automotive manufacturers, it is exposed to risks inherent in its business, particularly regarding commercial and industrial considerations.\n\nWith this in mind, the Group may encounter uncertain, litigious or contentious situations, particularly in the context of technical risks and recall campaigns carried out by automobile manufacturers.\n\nThe estimation of risks is regularly reviewed by the Group's management. Incomplete identification and/or incorrect assessment of a risk could result in the Group overestimating or underestimating its provisions.\n\nAt the close of the 2023 financial year, other provisions for risks and charges amounted to €56.1 million and are primarily related to technical and commercial risks. We considered the evaluation of provisions related to technical and commercial risks to be a key audit matter due to the potential financial impact on the Group and management's judgment in estimating the risks and the amounts recognized.\n\n#### Responses Provided during Our Audit\n\nOur work predominantly included:\n\n- Obtaining external confirmations from attorneys to identify the litigations and contentious situations involving the Group;\n- Reviewing the Group's risk analysis, corresponding documentation and, where applicable, the written consultations of its external advisors;\n- Conducting interviews with the product line director responsible for technical risks;\n- Assessing the main risks identified and examining the soundness of the assumptions made by management in estimating the amount of provisions recognized, based on the information collected.\n\n# **Specific Checks**\n\nAdditionally, in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, we performed specific checks required by legal and regulatory texts regarding the information related to the Group provided in the Executive Board's management report.\n\nWe have no comments to make concerning their accuracy and their consistency with the consolidated accounts.\n\nWe hereby certify that the consolidated Non-Financial Performance Statement, as required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code, is included in the information related to the Group provided in the management report. It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L.823-10 of said code, the information contained in this statement has not been subject to verification by us for accuracy or consistency with the consolidated accounts and must be subject to a report by an independent third-party.\n\n# **Other Checks or Information Required by Legal and Regulatory Texts**\n\n#### **Presentation Format of the Consolidated Accounts Intended for Inclusion in the Annual Financial Report**\n\nIn accordance with the professional standard on the auditor's procedures relating to the annual and consolidated accounts set out in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), we also verified the compliance of this format as defined by the Delegated European Regulation No 2019/815 of December 17, 2018 in the presentation of the consolidated accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, prepared under the responsibility of the President of the Executive Board. With regard to consolidated accounts, our procedures include verifying the compliance of the tagging of these accounts with the format defined by the aforementioned regulation.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 We are unable to conclude on the compliance of the presentation of the consolidated accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report with ESEF. Indeed, we were unable to perform the necessary procedures to verify this compliance for the following reason: the ESEF-formatted accounts intended for inclusion in the financial report were not provided in time to allow for the organization of the verification work.\n\n#### **Appointment of Statutory Auditors**\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of AKWEL by the Ordinary General Meeting of February 23, 2004 for Mazars, and by the Ordinary General Meeting of June 24, 2005, for Orfis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Mazars was in the 20<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of engagement, and Orfis was in its 19<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of engagement.\n\n# **Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Accounts**\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing consolidated accounts that provide a true and fair picture in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. It is also tasked with implementing the internal control it deems necessary to ensure the consolidated accounts are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated accounts, management is obligated to assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and overseeing the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as internal audit—where applicable—in relation to the procedures involved in preparing and processing accounting and financial information.\n\nThe consolidated accounts have been approved by the Executive Board.\n\n# **Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors Relating to the Audit of the Consolidated Accounts**\n\n#### **Audit Objective and Approach**\n\nWe are tasked with preparing a report on the consolidated accounts. Our goal is to achieve reasonable assurance that the consolidated accounts, as a whole, are free from material misstatements. Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance, but there is no guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if it could reasonably be expected that they, individually or collectively, could impact the economic decisions made by users relying on these accounts.\n\nAs specified by Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our certification engagement does not involve guaranteeing the viability or quality of your company's management.\n\nIn the context of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- it identifies and assesses the risks of significant misstatements in the consolidated accounts whether due to fraud or error, defines and implements audit procedures to address these risks, and gathers sufficient and appropriate evidence to support its opinion. The risk of not detecting a significant misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than that of a significant misstatement resulting from an error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, deliberate omissions, misrepresentations or circumvention of internal controls;\n- it reviews the relevant internal control for the audit to define appropriate audit procedures in the circumstances, not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control;\n- it assesses the appropriateness of the accounting methods adopted and the reasonableness of management's accounting estimates, as well as the information concerning them provided in the consolidated accounts;\n- it evaluates the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the information collected, determines whether there is significant uncertainty regarding events or circumstances that could raise doubts about the company's ability to continue operating. This assessment is based on the information collected up to the date of its report; however, it should be kept in\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n1 mind that subsequent events or circumstances could challenge the going concern assumption. If it determines that there is significant uncertainty, it will draw the attention of readers to the information provided in the consolidated accounts regarding this uncertainty. In cases where such information is not provided or is irrelevant, it issues a qualified opinion or declines to certify;\n\n- it evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated accounts and assesses whether they accurately reflect the underlying transactions and events to provide a true and fair picture;\n- regarding the financial information of persons or entities included in the consolidation scope, it gathers sufficient and appropriate evidence to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. It is responsible for directing, overseeing and conducting the audit of the consolidated accounts, as well as for the opinion expressed on these accounts.\n\n#### **Report to the Audit Committee**\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report outlining the scope of our audit work and the executed work plan, as well as the conclusions resulting from our work. Additionally, we bring to its attention any significant weaknesses in internal control that we have identified regarding procedures related to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.\n\nIncluded in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of significant misstatements that we deem to have been the most important for the audit of the consolidated accounts for the period. These risks represent the key audit areas, which we are responsible for describing in this report.\n\nFurthermore, we provide the Audit Committee with the declaration required under Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 confirming our independence, in accordance with the applicable rules in France as defined primarily by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code and the code of ethics for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks to our independence and the safeguard measures implemented.\n\n*The Statutory Auditors*\n\nMazars In Annecy on April 29, 2024\n\nJérôme Neyret\n\nOrfis In Villeurbanne on April 29, 2024\n\nJérôme Neyret Jean-Louis Flèche\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-209-0\"></span>**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — AKWEL**\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-210-0\"></span>**BALANCE SHEET**\n\n*Financial Statements as at December 31, 2023 (in* \n\n*thousands of euro)*\n\n| ASSETS                                                   | Notes | Gross<br>Amounts | Amort./Depr<br>ec. or<br>Provisions | 12/31/23 Net<br>Amounts | 12/31/22<br>Net<br>Amounts |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Intangible Assets                                        | 3.1   | 16,957           | 14,941                              | 2,016                   | 2,133                      |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment                            | 3.1   |                  |                                     |                         |                            |\n| Land                                                     |       | 989              | 188                                 | 801                     | 806                        |\n| Buildings                                                |       | 29,018           | 18,806                              | 10,212                  | 9,245                      |\n| Technical installations, equipment and toc               |       | 174,505          | 150,062                             | 24,443                  | 27,212                     |\n| Other property, plant and equipment                      |       | 21,844           | 18,742                              | 3,102                   | 3,080                      |\n| Work in progress, advances and<br>prepayments            |       | 2,678            | -

Presentation of AKWEL and Key Events in the Financial Year**\n\nAKWEL's activities include designing, developing and producing tools and parts, which are mainly sold to French and international automobile and heavy-vehicle manufacturers. Its mission is to act as a designer, manufacturer and assembler of functional components. AKWEL, as the Group's parent company, also coordinates the industrial and financial activities of all the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nThe annual accounts are prepared in thousands of euro.\n\nFor the past financial year, significant operations or events concerning the scope or organization include:\n\n- an increase in turnover linked to the growth in global automobile production;\n- an increase in value-added and EBITDA, owing to a reduction in warranty return costs and the passing on of price increases (transport, energy, wage inflation) to our customers;\n- recognition of a provision allowance of up to €9.2 million for the closure of the Gournay site offset by a reversal of the provision for warranty return risks amounting to -€4.6 million;\n- significantly negative financial income impacted by write-downs of securities and current accounts (primarily related to one of the subsidiaries in Sweden).\n\n# **2. Accounting Principles and Valuation Methods**\n\n#### **2.1. Accounting Principles**\n\nThe accounts as at December 31, 2023 are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in France and take into account ANC Regulation 2023-05 of November 10, 2023 amending ANC Regulation No. 2014-03 related to the General Accounting Plan.\n\nThe general accounting conventions have been applied while adhering to the principle of prudence, in accordance with the following basic assumptions:\n\n- going concern;\n- consistency of accounting methods from one financial year to the next;\n- independence of financial years.\n\nFurthermore, the general rules for preparing and presenting annual accounts have been followed.\n\nThere have been no changes in accounting methods during the financial years presented.\n\n#### **2.2. Fixed Assets and Depreciation**\n\nFixed assets are valued at their acquisition or production cost.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.2.1. Intangible Assets**\n\nResearch and development expenses are recorded as expenses in the financial year during which they are incurred.\n\nGoodwill is recorded based on its transfer value. Goodwill listed on the balance sheet is subject to a depreciation provision when the inventory value is lower than the book value. The inventory value is determined based on criteria related to the observed profitability and future prospects of the relevant activity. After applying Regulation 2002-10 on January 1, 2005, AKWEL no longer amortizes goodwill listed as an asset on the balance sheet.\n\nMicrocomputer software is amortized over a period of 12 months. Other software or expenses incurred while setting up a new information system (SAP) are capitalized and amortized over a period of three years.\n\nPatents are amortized over their protection period.\n\nAKWEL performs impairment tests on its goodwill each year.\n\nThe useful life of goodwill is presumed to be indefinite.\n\nAKWEL depreciates the value of an asset when its current value (the higher of fair value and value in use) falls below its net carrying amount.\n\n#### **2.2.2. Tangible Assets**\n\nDepreciation of tangible assets is calculated over the useful life of the assets, using either the straight-line method or the declining-balance method.\n\nThe main depreciation periods selected can be summed up as follows:\n\n- buildings: 25 to 40 years;\n- building fixtures: 5 to 10 years;\n- technical installations: 5 to 10 years;\n- industrial equipment and tools: 5 to 10 years;\n- general installations: 10 years;\n- furniture and office equipment: 5 to 10 years.\n\nAdditional depreciations resulting from the application of tax provisions (declining-balance, extraordinary) are treated as accelerated depreciation, which is recognized under \"Regulated provisions.\"\n\n#### **2.2.3. Financial Assets**\n\nEquity investments and other equity interests are recorded on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost.\n\nEquity investments are subject to a provision for impairment when their value in use appears to be lower than their book value. The value in use of equity investments is assessed using several criteria, in particular including equity, multiples of EBITDA, and growth and profitability prospects.\n\n#### **2.3. Receivables Concerning Associated Companies**\n\nAs of January 2, 2002, the Group has established cash management agreements among all its subsidiaries. Such agreements stipulate that all matured and unpaid intra-group commercial receivables and debts are treated as cash advances. As the settlement of these advances is not scheduled, they are recognized under the headings \"Receivables concerning associated companies\" or \"Payables related to investments.\"\n\nThe receivables are measured at their nominal value and may be impaired, in connection with the analysis conducted on the equity investments, to reflect the risks of non-recovery to which they may give rise based on the information available at the closing date of the accounts.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.4. Inventory**\n\nInventory is valued at the purchase price for raw materials using the first in, first out method, and at the factory cost price for finished goods and work in progress. Cost price excludes overheads that do not contribute to production and financial expenses.\n\nProvisions are made as necessary for inventory at risk of obsolescence or for which the cost exceeds the realization value. Tools are valued at full cost (external costs) up to the billable price to customers.\n\n#### **2.5. Accounts receivable**\n\nReceivables and payables are valued at their nominal value. Provisions for doubtful receivables are determined based on the age of unrecovered receivables. A provision is also recorded whenever a real and serious dispute is identified, or when a customer becomes subject to legal proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, provisions for the impairment of accounts receivable are calculated based on the age of the outstanding invoices, following these guidelines:\n\n- provision equal to 25% of the amount excluding taxes of unrecovered receivables for receivables overdue by more than 150 days but less than 360 days;\n- provision equal to 100% of the amount excluding taxes of unrecovered receivables for receivables overdue by more than 360 days.\n\n#### **2.6. Provisions for Liabilities and for Expenses**\n\nIn general, management has reviewed every known dispute involving AKWEL as at the balance sheet date. Where appropriate, after consulting with external advisors, provisions deemed necessary have been made to hedge the estimated risks.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>**2.7. Pension Obligations**\n\nRights acquired by employees for end-of-career bonuses are not adjusted. However, they are valued and their amount at the end of the financial year is disclosed as financial commitments (see *5*[.1\\)](#page-223-0).\n\nThe amounts of rights acquired by employees under various applicable collective agreements are assessed based on assumptions (changes in salary, retirement age, mortality, staff turnover), then discounted to their present value based on a discount rate. The assumptions were made based on a discount rate of 3.22% (compared to 3.84% at year-end 2022), a salary increase of 2.5% (compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022) for both executives and nonexecutives, a retirement age of 67 and average assumptions regarding staff turnover. AKWEL has assessed the impact of Law No. 2010-1330 of November 9, 2010 concerning pension reform on the valuation of its employee commitments. After examining the characteristics of its employee population (age, date of entry into employment, career profile, etc.), AKWEL has maintained the assumption of a retirement age of 67. Long-service awards are not subject to provisions for liabilities and expenses because the corresponding commitments are not significant. The collective agreements applicable to AKWEL's establishments do not provide for this obligation, and AKWEL's practices in this area remain incidental.\n\n#### **2.8. Extraordinary Expenses and Income**\n\nExtraordinary income includes, in particular, income and expenses resulting from events or transactions clearly distinct from the company's ordinary activities and that, as such, are not expected to occur frequently or regularly. Extraordinary expenses and income include, in particular, allocations or reversals related to accelerated depreciation, proceeds from asset disposals, and income and expenses unrelated to ordinary activities.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2.9. Foreign Currency Transactions**\n\nForeign currency expenses and income are recorded at their equivalent value on the transaction date. Foreign currency receivables and payables are valued at the exchange rate in effect at the closing date. The difference resulting from the revaluation of foreign currency payables and receivables at the closing rate is recognized in the balance sheet as translation adjustment. Unrealized exchange losses are treated as provisions for liabilities.\n\n#### **2.10. Tax Consolidation**\n\nAKWEL has entered into a tax consolidation agreement with its French subsidiaries with a direct or indirect holding of over 95%.\n\nThis agreement, which first came into effect on December 22, 2011, was signed as part of AKWEL's choice for the Group regime as defined in Articles 223 A et seqq. of the French General Tax Code. Each fiscally integrated company is placed in the situation it would have been in if it had been taxed separately. The additional tax savings or expense resulting from the difference between the tax owed by the consolidated subsidiaries and the tax resulting from the determination of the consolidated result is recorded by AKWEL.\n\nThe application of the tax consolidation regime resulted in a net tax savings of €193,147 in 2023 for the scope of consolidation.\n\n# **3.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under these standards are described in the \"Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the annual accounts\" section of this report.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nWe carried out our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules set forth in the French Commercial Code and the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of issuance of our report. We did not provide any services prohibited under Article 5 Paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n#### **Justification of Assessments — Key Audit Matters**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180 of the French Commercial Code concerning the justification of our assessments, we wish to bring to your attention the key audit matters related to the risks of material misstatement. The latter, in our professional judgment, were the most significant for the audit of the annual accounts for the year, as well as the responses we provided to address these risks.\n\nThese assessments are made in the context of the audit of the annual accounts taken as a whole and in the formation of our opinion expressed above. We do not express an opinion on individual components of these annual accounts.\n\n#### **Valuation of Equity Investments and Receivables Concerning Associated Companies**\n\nNotes 2.2.3., 2.3 and 3.2 of the notes to the annual accounts\n\n#### Identified Risk\n\nEquity investments and receivables concerning associated companies are reported on AKWEL's balance sheet as at December 31, 2023, for a net amount of €233.2 million.\n\nEquity investments are recognized at their acquisition cost and are impaired when their estimated value in use at the end of the reporting period is lower than their carrying amount. The value in use of equity investments is assessed using several criteria, in particular including equity, multiples of EBITDA, and growth and profitability prospects. This assumption requires management to exercise judgment, particularly when based on forecast items.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties associated with forecast items used in these calculations, we have considered the evaluation of equity investments, and by extension, the receivables related to them, to be a key point of our audit.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Our Response\n\nWe have reviewed the controls implemented by the company to estimate the value in use of equity investments. Our work predominantly included:\n\n- comparing the proportional share of net assets used to determine the values in use of equity investments to data derived from the accounting records;\n- verifying, when values in use were determined based on forecast elements, that their estimation was based on an appropriate valuation method;\n- assessing the soundness of the main assumptions used in estimating values in use through discussions with Management;\n- checking the arithmetic accuracy of the value-in-use calculations performed by the Company;\n- assessing the recoverability of receivables related to the results of impairment tests for equity investments.\n\n#### **Evaluation of Provisions Related to Technical and Commercial Risks**\n\nNotes 2.6 and 3.10 of the notes to the annual accounts\n\n#### Identified Risk\n\nAs a first-tier supplier to numerous automotive manufacturers, the company is exposed to risks inherent in its business, particularly regarding commercial and industrial considerations.\n\nWith this in mind, the company may encounter uncertain, litigious or contentious situations, particularly in the context of technical risks and recall campaigns carried out by automobile manufacturers.\n\nThe estimation of risks is regularly reviewed by the company's management. Incomplete identification and/or incorrect assessment of a risk could result in the company overestimating or underestimating its provisions.\n\nAt the close of the 2023 financial year, provisions for disputes amounted to €32.2 million and are primarily related to technical and commercial risks. We considered the evaluation of provisions related to technical and commercial risks to be a key audit matter due to the potential financial impact on the company and management's judgment in estimating the risks and the amounts recognized.\n\n#### Responses Provided during Our Audit\n\nOur work predominantly included:\n\n- Obtaining external confirmations from attorneys to identify the litigations and contentious situations involving the company;\n- Reviewing the company's risk analysis, corresponding documentation and, where applicable, the written consultations of its external advisors;\n- Conducting interviews with the product line director responsible for technical risks;\n- Assessing the main risks identified and examining the soundness of the assumptions made by management in estimating the amount of provisions recognized, based on the information collected.\n\n#### **Specific Checks**\n\nWe have also conducted specific checks in accordance with the applicable professional standards in France, as required by legal and regulatory texts.\n\n#### **Information Provided in the Management Report and in Other Documents on the Financial Position and Annual Accounts Addressed to Shareholders**\n\nWe have no observations to make as to whether the information provided by the Executive Board in the management report and other financial documents sent to shareholders accurately matches the annual accounts.\n\nWe attest to the accuracy and consistency with the annual accounts of the information regarding payment terms mentioned in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n#### **Corporate Governance Report**\n\nWe certify the presence, in the Supervisory Board's corporate governance report, of the information required by Articles L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\nRegarding the information provided in accordance with the provisions of Article L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code concerning the remuneration and benefits paid or attributed to corporate officers, as well as commitments made in their favor, we have verified their consistency with the accounts or the data used to prepare these accounts and, where appropriate, with the information gathered by your company from the companies controlled by it that are included in the scope of consolidation. Based on this work, we confirm the accuracy and sincerity of this information.\n\nWith regard to the information on items that your company has considered could potentially be impacted in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange offer, provided in accordance with the provisions of Article L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code, we have verified their conformity with the documents from which they originate and that have been shared with us. Based on this work, we have no comments to make on this information.\n\n#### **Other Information**\n\nIn accordance with the law, we have ensured that various information regarding the identity of shareholders or voting rights holders and reciprocal interests has been communicated to you in the management report.\n\n#### **Other Checks or Information Required by Legal and Regulatory Texts**\n\n#### **Presentation Format of the Annual Accounts Intended for Inclusion in the Annual Financial Report**\n\nIn accordance with the professional standard on the auditor's procedures relating to the annual and consolidated accounts set out in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), we also verified the compliance of this format as defined by the Delegated European Regulation No 2019/815 of December 17, 2018 in the presentation of the annual accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, prepared under the responsibility of the President of the Executive Board.\n\nWe are unable to conclude on the compliance of the presentation of the annual accounts intended to be included in the annual financial report with ESEF. Indeed, we were unable to perform the necessary procedures to verify this compliance for the following reason: the ESEF-formatted accounts intended for inclusion in the financial report were not provided in time to allow for the organization of the verification work.\n\n#### **Appointment of Statutory Auditors**\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of AKWEL by the ordinary general meetings of February 23, 2004 for Mazars, and June 24, 2005, for Orfis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Mazars was in the 20th consecutive year of engagement, and Orfis was in its 19th year.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Annual Accounts**\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing annual accounts that provide a true and fair picture in accordance with French accounting rules and principles. It is also tasked with implementing the internal control it deems necessary to ensure the annual accounts are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts, management is obligated to assess the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and overseeing the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as internal audit—where applicable—in relation to the procedures involved in preparing and processing accounting and financial information.\n\nThe annual accounts have been approved by the Executive Board.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors Relating to the Audit of the Annual Accounts**\n\n#### **Audit Objective and Approach**\n\nWe are tasked with preparing a report on the annual accounts. Our goal is to achieve reasonable assurance that the annual accounts, as a whole, are free from material misstatements. Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance, but there is no guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if it could reasonably be expected that they, individually or collectively, could impact the economic decisions made by users relying on these accounts.\n\nAs specified by Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our certification engagement does not involve guaranteeing the viability or quality of your company's management.\n\nIn the context of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- it identifies and assesses the risks of significant misstatements in the annual accounts whether due to fraud or error, defines and implements audit procedures to address these risks, and gathers sufficient and appropriate evidence to support its opinion. The risk of not detecting a significant misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than that of a significant misstatement resulting from an error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, deliberate omissions, misrepresentations or circumvention of internal controls;\n- it reviews the relevant internal control for the audit to define appropriate audit procedures in the circumstances, not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control;\n- it assesses the appropriateness of the accounting methods adopted and the reasonableness of management's accounting estimates, as well as the information concerning them provided in the annual accounts;\n- it evaluates the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the information collected, determines whether there is significant uncertainty regarding events or circumstances that could raise doubts about the company's ability to continue operating. This assessment is based on the information collected up to the date of its report; however, it should be kept in mind that subsequent events or circumstances could challenge the going concern assumption. If it determines that there is significant uncertainty, it will draw the attention of readers to the information provided in the annual accounts regarding this uncertainty. In cases where such information is not provided or is irrelevant, it issues a qualified opinion or declines to certify;\n- it evaluates the overall presentation of the annual accounts and assesses whether they accurately reflect the underlying transactions and events to provide a true and fair picture.\n\n#### **Report to the Audit Committee**\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report outlining the scope of our audit work and the executed work plan, as well as the conclusions resulting from our work. Additionally, we bring to its attention any significant weaknesses in internal control that we have identified regarding procedures related to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.\n\nIncluded in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of significant misstatements that we deem to have been the most important for the audit of the annual accounts for the period. These risks represent the key audit areas, which we are responsible for describing in this report.\n\nFurthermore, we provide the Audit Committee with the declaration required under Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 confirming our independence, in accordance with the applicable rules in France as defined primarily by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code and the code of ethics for statutory auditors.
