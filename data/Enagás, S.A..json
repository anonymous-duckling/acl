The logo features the word \"enagas\" in a sans-serif font, with the \"e\" and the top portion of the \"n\" in a light green color, and the rest of the letters in a darker blue color. Below the word \"enagas\" is a stylized blue shape that resembles a flame or a drop of liquid.\n\n## Sustainable mobility\n\n[GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2]\n\nEnagás is committed to decarbonising transport by promoting the use of natural gas and renewable gases in mobility.\n\nNatural gas plays a highly relevant role in ensuring security of supply and competitiveness, while meeting the energy requirements of highly demanding sectors, such as intensive industry or segments that are difficult to electrify, where there are currently no solutions that can meet the requirements of the majority of users. In the field of heavy and maritime transport, natural gas is positioning itself as one of the most sustainable and realistic fuels in the short-term, key to reducing emissions and immediately improving air quality.\n\nThe use of natural gas as a fuel for transport would allow for NOx emissions to be reduced by 80-90%, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions to be reduced by 20-30% and SOX emissions and particles by practically 100% compared to traditional fuels. This makes natural gas a sustainable alternative for mobility and heavy, maritime and rail transport.\n\nIts contribution is particularly important in the case of maritime transport, as it allows vessels to adhere to new environmental regulations set forth by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and European Directive 2016/802.\n\nAs part of its commitment to innovation, Enagás has made technical adaptations to its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals which are now ready to offer new services related to the role of gas as a fuel, such as bunkering (supplying fuel for ships). In addition, we are promoting these new uses through our coordination in projects such as 'CORE LNGas hive' and 'LNGhive2', as well as through our participation in other projects with European CEF funds in the road and railway field, such as the ECO-net and RAILNG projects. .\n\n**Renewable hydrogen is a new energy carrier that offers countless possibilities for energy consumption, storage and mobility**  The European Union allocates around 45 million euros to the CORE LNGas hive and LNGhive2 projects, which Enagás is driving through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which promotes more sustainable and efficient transport.\n\nAmong other projects, the European Commission supports with 20 million euros the development of two new projects for the supply of LNG (liquefied natural gas) to ships (bunkering) in the ports of Barcelona and Algeciras, coordinated by Enagás and developed by its subsidiary Scale Gas. These projects are part of the 'LNGhive2' institutional strategy, managed by Puertos del Estado, aimed at promoting the development of the LNG market as marine fuel and to ensure supply in ports, in compliance with European Directive 2014/94 on alternative fuels.\n\nIn the railway sector, Enagás was one of the companies to participate in the first pilot test in Europe for railway traction using LNG. In addition, as part of the implementation of the Railway Roadmap set out with Renfe, it is working with all segments of rail traction to retrofit diesel vehicles for natural gas in business areas where electrification would be unprofitable.\n\nEnagás, together with Renfe and several partners, is currently working on the 'Dual mode H2 Train' project to introduce fuel cells for rail traction, as well as in the supply chain.\n\nRenewable hydrogen is a new energy carrier that offers countless possibilities for energy consumption, storage and mobility. It is a real, clean and sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources and therefore, using it as a vehicle fuel also helps towards sustainable mobility.\n\nWithin the terrestrial field, the start-up 'Scale Gas' (see the '[Corporate](#page-49-0)  [innovation and technology](#page-49-0)' sub-section in this chapter) is participating in the EU-supported project 'ECO-net', for the construction of 15 LNG supply points integrated into the existing traditional fuel supply network, with the aim of integrating natural gas as another fuel in the energy mix. In addition, in 2021, Scale Gas unveiled the first hydrogen refuelling station in Spain in Madrid. It has a supply capacity of 700 bar and is currently supplying hydrogen to a range of users, including heavy-duty VTC vehicles.

The logo is in blue and green.\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\n## Financing linked to sustainability\n\nEnagás has part of its financing linked to decarbonisation targets. From 2019, the price of the syndicated loan has been linked to meeting the company's CO2 emission reduction targets.\n\nIn 2022, this loan was renewed, for which the emission reduction targets linked to the credit were revised and extended (changes validated through a Second Party Opinion):\n\n- The 2025 targets have been revised in line with the new operating context brought about by the energy crisis (see the '[Climate](#page-60-0)  [action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section in the '[Environmental,](#page-53-0)  [Social and Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).\n- Targets have been added to 2026 and 2027, in line with the objectives of the company's 2030 Strategic Plan (see the '[2030](#page-19-0)  [Strategic Plan](#page-19-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Scope 3 emission reduction targets have been added in line with the targets set by the company for 2030 and 2040 (see the '[Targets and roadmap to decarbonisation](#page-23-0)' section in this chapter).\n\nIn this regard, Enagás has signed the extension of the maturity of this syndicated credit line of 1,550 million euros until 2028 with 12 financial institutions, maintaining its commitment to link the economic conditions to compliance with environmental indicators for the reduction of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, in line with the targets and roadmap to decarbonisation (see the '[Targets and roadmap to](#page-23-0)  [decarbonisation](#page-23-0)' section in this chapter).\n\n## European Sustainable Activities Taxonomy\n\nIn the framework of the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities was developed (Regulation 2020/852 and associated legislation<sup>5</sup>). It aims to establish criteria for determining whether an activity is considered environmentally sustainable for the purpose of determining the degree of environmental sustainability of an investment and to facilitate the use of a common concept of socially sustainable investment by Member States and the European Union.\n\nIn the various associated Delegated Regulations, technical selection criteria have been established to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to contribute substantially to environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, adaptation to climate change, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and control of pollution, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission has published several communications on the interpretation of the legal provisions (FAQs) included in the delegated regulations, which have contributed to the interpretation of the implementing legislation. However, the current regulatory framework is under development, which implies a continuous review of the criteria and methodologies established by the company to respond to the established requirements.\n\n### Eligibility and alignment concepts\n\nAn activity is considered eligible when it has the potential to substantially contribute to the corresponding environmental target, while an activity is considered aligned when it additionally meets the criteria of substantial contribution, do no significant harm (DNSH) and the minimum social safeguards set out in the taxonomy regulation, which ensure that the activity is carried out in compliance with characteristics that ensure a contribution to the environmental targets set by the European Union.\n\n#### Assessment of the eligibility of Enagás' activities\n\nSince 2021, Enagás has been assessing the eligibility of its activities regarding the mitigation and adaptation to climate change objectives, and in line with the reporting requirements, in 2023, Enagás also assessed the eligibility of its activities regarding the other four environmental objectives.\n\nAs a result of this assessment, Enagás has identified eligible activities that have the potential to contribute to two of the environmental objectives covered by the EU Taxonomy:\n\n#### **Climate change mitigation and adaptation**\n\nThey correspond to activities associated with the area of renewable gases: mainly the adaptation of infrastructure to be able to transport these renewable gases, to the construction of hydrogen transport and distribution pipelines and hydrogen storage (see the '[Our](#page-16-0)  [commitment to the energy transition](#page-16-0)' chapter).\n\n**• Activity 4.14 CCM. Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases:** Enagás, an independent European TSO, is an international benchmark in the development and maintenance of gas infrastructures and the operation and management of gas networks. In addition, as of December 2023, Enagás has been appointed as the provisional manager of the Hydrogen Backbone network (HTNO) in Spain. It has been entrusted with the preparation of a proposal for the development of the hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon.\n\nFor all these reasons, and in line with one of the growth axes of the 2030 Strategic Plan, Enagás is working on the renewal of gas transmission and distribution infrastructures to promote the integration of hydrogen and other low-carbon gases and on the construction of new transmission and distribution networks for hydrogen and other low-carbon gases.\n\n<sup>5</sup> [Regulation \\(EU\\) 2021/2139](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2139), [Delegated Regulation \\(EU\\) 2021/2178,](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2178) [Delegated Regulation \\(EU\\) 2022/1214](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1214), [Delegated Regulation \\(EU\\) 2023/2485](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302485) and [Delegated](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302486)  [Regulation \\(EU\\) 2023/2486](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302486).\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n**Our commitment to** [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  **[the energy transition](#page-16-0)** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/32/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a blue sans-serif font, with a stylized blue and green circular graphic above the text. The graphic appears to be a stylized representation of a gas molecule or a circular flow.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nIn 2023, Enagás modified its eligibility criteria, in line with those used in the 2021 report, to a more conservative approach; instead of considering all concepts associated with projects on the gas transmission network as eligible due to their potential for future reconversion, only concepts associated with projects for the construction of new hydrogen and low-carbon gas transmission infrastructure will be considered eligible, as will the conversion and reconversion of existing infrastructure to be able to transport renewable gases. In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 in the reporting tables. [GRI 2-4]\n\n**• Activity 4.12 CCM. Storage of hydrogen:** Enagás has three underground natural gas storage facilities. In line with one of the growth axes of the 2030 Strategic Plan, Enagás is currently working on the conversion of these infrastructures into hydrogen storage facilities and the construction of new facilities.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás modified its eligibility criteria, in line with those used in the 2021 report, to a more conservative approach; instead of considering all concepts associated with projects on the gas transmission network as eligible due to their potential for future reconversion, only concepts associated with projects for the construction of new hydrogen storage infrastructure will be considered eligible, as will the conversion of existing infrastructure to be able to storage hydrogen. In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomyaligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 in the reporting tables. [GRI 2-4]\n\n- **• Activity 6.15 CCM. Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport:** Enagás' subsidiary ScaleGas has a 700 bar HRS (Hydrogen Refuelling Station) with the capacity to supply hydrogen-powered electric vehicles in Madrid (Spain). This activity is eligible, as the hydrogen refuelling station is considered to be an infrastructure for the circulation of vehicles with zero CO<sup>2</sup> exhaust emissions.\n- **• Activity 4.1 CCM. Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology:** Enagás considers eligible projects aimed at generating electricity through photovoltaic panels for self-consumption at some of its facilities, thus improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n- **• Activity 3.10 CCM. Manufacture of hydrogen:** Enagás considers as eligible the renewable hydrogen manufacture projects for selfconsumption that it develops at some of its facilities, thus enabling the improvement of energy efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n- **• Activity 7.4 CCM. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings):** Enagás considers projects to install charging stations for electric vehicles in its facilities' parking spaces to be eligible.\n\n**• Activity 8.1 CCM. Data processing, hosting and related activities:** Enagás considers projects for the renovation of storage arrays at Enagás' data centres to be eligible.\n\n#### **Transition to a circular economy**\n\n**• Activity 3.3 EC. Demolition and wrecking of buildings and other structures:** Enagás holds that the project to seal off and permanently abandon the Castor underground gas storage wells is eligible, as it forms part of the above-mentioned underground storage dismantling project. All of the above is in accordance with the 'demolition of wells and boreholes' activity included in the description of the activity. Although this infrastructure does not form part of the Enagás Group, the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge appointed Enagás Transporte S.A.U. to carry out this activity<sup>6</sup> .\n\nOnce the eligible economic activities were identified, for each of them, the projects implemented during the year were identified.\n\n#### Assessment of the alignment of Enagás' activities\n\nEnagás has assessed the alignment of its activities that contribute to the goal of climate change mitigation. In line with the reporting requirements, in 2024, it will incorporate into this alignment analysis those activities that also contribute to the objective of transitioning to a circular economy.\n\nTo assess alignment, it has been analysed whether eligible projects comply with the criteria of substantial contribution defined in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139: technical selection criteria do not cause significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives and comply with the established minimum social safeguards.\n\nIn order to assess compliance with the requirements set out by the Taxonomy, Enagás has assessed its existing policies, procedures and processes at a corporate level, as well as detailed documentation at project level.\n\nIn assessing the substantial contribution criteria of taxonomy activities aligned with the climate change mitigation objective:\n\n**• In the activities '4.14 CCM.** Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases' and '**4.12 CCM.** Storage of hydrogen', documents such as the technical reports of the projects have been assessed to ensure that the nature of the projects under consideration complies with the nature of the activity itself, which is the main requirement for assessing compliance.\n\n<sup>6</sup> [Resolution of November 6, 2019, of the Secretary of State for Energy, publishing the Agreement of the Council of Ministers of October 31, 2019, which ends the](https://www.boe.es/doue/2022/188/L00001-00045.pdf)  [hibernation of the \"Castor\" underground storage facilities, agreeing to their dismantling and ordering the sealing and definitive abandonment of the wells.](https://www.boe.es/doue/2022/188/L00001-00045.pdf) \n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/33/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the logo for ENA on the right. The ENA logo is a green and blue circle with the letters \"ena\" inside.\n\n- **•** In relation to the projects associated with the **activity '3.10 CCM.**  Manufacture of hydrogen', it should be noted that these consist of hydrogen production for self-consumption. For these projects, the EU Taxonomy regulations requires threshold requirements to ensure greenhouse gas emission reductions. In 2022, the projects were considered taxonomy-aligned because, as they were still in the early stages, requirements had been included in the investment plan to ensure that the design of the hydrogen manufacturing process would meet the thresholds set by the technical criteria to ensure greenhouse gas emission reductions. However, in 2023, these projects are at a more advanced stage; as they have not yet started, it is not possible to verify the fulfilment of the technical criteria. As such, the projects comprising this activity are considered to be non-aligned.\n- **• Activity '4.1 CCM.** Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology' fulfils the criteria, as it is linked to the operation of solar panels to generate electricity for self-consumption.\n- **• The activity '6.15 CCM.** Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport', part of the work of our subsidiary ScaleGas, also meets the criteria, as it is related to enabling hydrogen refuelling stations.\n- **•** Also, **the activity '7.4 CCM**. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings' meets the criteria as well, as it is linked to the installation of charging stations.\n- **•** In relation to the projects of the activity **\"8.1 CCM.** Data processing, hosting and related activities\": it has not been possible to obtain independent third-party verification of whether the project to renovate the storage arrays at Enagás' data centres has applied all pertinent practices to comply with the technical selection criterion of substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. Therefore, the project pertaining to this activity is considered non-aligned.\n\nWith regard to compliance with the criteria of no significant harm to other targets (DNSH), Enagás has an analysis of the physical climate risks of its current infrastructure and has control and management measures in place to mitigate them, thereby complying with the DNSH criterion for the adaptation objective (see the '[Climate action](#page-60-0)  [and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section in the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Managemen](#page-53-0)t' chapter). In relation to other DNSH matters (water and marine resources, circular economy, pollution and biodiversity), although the criteria differ by activity, in general, the company has an ISO 14001-certified environmental management system, takes specific actions in the field of the circular economy, and each project has its own waste management plan, as well as a management model for natural capital and biodiversity. All of this ensures compliance with the requirements of the Taxonomy (see the '[Natural capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section in the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter). In addition, most of the facilities where these projects are taking place have received an Integrated Environmental Authorisation or gone through an Environmental Impact Assessment.\n\nFinally, the taxonomy regulation requires the company to carry out its activities in compliance with Minimum Safeguards in terms of human rights, corruption prevention, proper tax management and respect for fair competition. In this regard, the different mechanisms that the company has in place to ensure compliance with these requirements are described throughout this report (see the '[People](#page-74-0)' '[Ethics and i](#page-118-0)ntegrity' '[Financial and operational excellence](#page-125-0)', and '[Human rights](#page-138-0)' sections in the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).\n\n#### Calculation of key performance indicators\n\nThe identification of the key performance indicators for the projects associated with the taxonomic activities has been carried out after the closure of the annual accounting consolidation. Projects have been identified for accounting purposes by project code, thus eliminating the potential risk of double counting. In the analysis of the Enagás Group's key indicators 'Total (A+B)', transactions between Enagás Group companies have not been considered.\n\nBased on the organisation's existing formal accounting and consolidation procedures, the different economic indicators detailed in the Taxonomy Regulation have been calculated and prepared, taking into account the considerations detailed below.\n\nAs for the denominator, the following information relates to eligibility and alignment.\n\n- **• Turnover:** revenues from regulated and non-regulated activities and other operating revenues of the Enagás Group (See '[Note 2.1.a.](#page-238-0)  [Operating profit, Income](#page-238-0)' of the [Consolidated Annual Accounts](#page-210-0)).\n- **• CapEx:** investments in material and intangible fixed assets of the Enagás Group, discounting the effect of the IFRS16 accounting regulations (sum of the additions of material fixed assets in '[Note](#page-246-0)  [2.4. Property, plant and equipment, Supplementary information](#page-246-0)  [on IFRS16](#page-246-0)' and the additions of intangible fixed assets in '[Note 2.5.](#page-250-0)  [Intangible fixed assets](#page-250-0)', discounting the additions by IFRS16 of '[Note 2.4. Property, plant and equipment, Supplementary](#page-246-0)  [information on IFRS16](#page-246-0)' of the [Consolidated Annual Accounts](#page-210-0)). No business combinations occurred in the two previous years. The variation of more than 150% in CapEx in 2023 compared to the previous year is mainly due to the purchase and sale of Reganosa's gas pipeline network (53.5 million euros) and the acquisition of equipment for current facilities (compressors, climate control equipment, etc.) (23.9 million euros).\n- **• OpEx:** non-capitalised direct costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs and other direct expenses related to the day-to-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment assets by the company or a third party to whom activities are outsourced and that are necessary to ensure the continued effective operation of such assets.

In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 The data reported in 2022 under heading A.2 of not Taxonomy-aligned activities were: Turnover: 57.7% (activity 4.14) and 11.1% (activity 4.12). This change in criteria means that in 2023 no proportion of the financial indicators are not taxonomy-aligned for these two activities.

In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 The data reported in 2022 under heading A.2 of not Taxonomy-aligned activities were: CapEx: 24.5% (activity 4.14) and 18.3% (activity 4.12). This change in criteria means that in 2023 no proportion of the financial indicators are not taxonomy-aligned for these two activities.

In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 The data reported in 2022 under heading A.2 of not Taxonomy-aligned activities were: OpEx: 25.1% (activity 4.14) and 16% (activity 4.12). This change in criteria means that in 2023 no proportion of the financial indicators are not taxonomy-aligned for these two activities.\n\n(3) In line with the reporting obligations, in 2023, the alignment with the environmental objectives of sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and control of pollution, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n**Our commitment to** [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) **the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/42/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. The letters are in a teal color. Above the word \"enagas\" is a circle, also in teal, with a curved line of green inside the circle.\n\nAnnual Accounts\n\nAlthough the amount of taxonomy-compliant CapEx remains stable (5.7 million euros in 2023 compared to 5.9 million euros in 2022), there is a downward trend in the share of CapEx that is taxonomycompliant (3.7% in 2023 and 10.1% in 2022). This is explained by a significant increase in the Enagás Group's total CapEx (155.4 million euros in 2023 and 58.7 million euros in 2022). This increase in the Group's CapEx is mainly due to the purchase and sale of Reganosa's gas pipeline network (53.5 million euros) and the acquisition of equipment for current facilities (compressors, climate control equipment, etc.) (23.9 million euros).\n\nThe results of the taxonomy analysis reflect the company's potential to contribute to the climate change mitigation objective by transforming its business to align and conform to the taxonomy. In line with the aim of decarbonising the energy system and the company's new strategy, Enagás is investing in assets and projects (CapEx) that enable the transmission and storage of hydrogen through the construction of new infrastructures and the adaptation of existing ones. All this with the aim of generating future income through activities that are taxonomy-aligned. In this respect, according to the financial projections to 2030, 77% of the planned CapEx is aligned with the activities laid out in the taxonomy regulation.\n\n**Enagás is advancing in the development of hydrogen infrastructures and other sustainable activities with a CapEx aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation of 5.7 million euros in 2023, as is 77% of the CapEx planned until 2030**\n\nIn addition, Enagás, through its affiliates over which it has no operational control, has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation through other activities such as:\n\n- **• 'Activity 3.10.** Manufacture of hydrogen' and **'Activity 4.1.**  Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology': Through projects such as Enagás Renovable's Power to Green Hydrogen Mallorca, among others.\n- **• 'Activity 3.1.** Manufacture of renewable energy technologies'. Through start-ups such as DualMetha, Solatom and Trovant.\n\n### Control measures established by Enagás in the framework of the EU Taxonomy Report\n\nIn order to meet all the reporting requirements defined in the Taxonomy Regulation, Enagás has an environmental taxonomy reporting procedure which sets out a methodology for preparing the annual eligibility and alignment exercise through the collection of the necessary information. In this process, and in order to ensure compliance with the disclosure standards, the financial area is mainly involved in extracting the financial information and ensuring its equivalence with the Consolidated Annual Accounts. The infrastructure and sustainability areas are mainly involved in identifying projects and assessing their compliance with the Taxonomy Regulation requirements.\n\nIn addition, the Non-Financial Information Control System covers the reporting cycles for the key performance indicators required by the Taxonomy Regulation that are most relevant to Enagás (CapEx and OpEx). This entails assigning responsibilities in the calculation and reporting of indicators, as well as defining and implementing controls that improve the segregation of duties and reduce the risk of completeness and accuracy of information as well as the risk of non-compliance with regulations.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nAnnual Accounts\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/7 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a green arc.\n\n## Governance model for climate change management\n\n#### [GRI 2-12, GRI 2-13]\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nAt Enagás there is a governance structure led by the Board of Directors that supervises the company's climate change performance. The Board of Directors is informed on a quarterly basis about the risk control processes, where climate change risks and opportunities are integrated. The Sustainability and Appointments Committee, through the Sustainability Committee, approves and monitors the CO2 emissions reduction targets linked to variable remuneration as well as initiatives that help achieve said reduction that are included in the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit and Compliance Committee supervises the efficiency of risk control and management systems and assesses the possible impact of climate change.\n\nThe Executive Committee establishes the overall risk management strategy and global limits for the company, and also reviews the level of risk exposure and corrective actions.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee is made up of the company's main General Managements, including the Energy Transition General Management. This General Management presides over the functions of Sustainability and Climate Action, Strategy and National and International Regulation, areas that provide the input for the definition of the decarbonisation strategy, as well as the identification of risks and opportunities derived from climate change.\n\nThe Health and Safety, Environment and Quality Committee periodically assesses and manages issues related to climate change associated with business processes, impact assessment studies and the evaluation of environmental aspects.\n\nThere are also various working groups reporting to these committees, such as the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Group, responsible for drafting and monitoring the Energy Efficiency Plan and setting the company's emissions reduction targets, among other matters.\n\nIn terms of risk management, business units are responsible for risk identification and measurement, the risk function controls and manages risks and the Internal Audit function supervises the effectiveness of the established controls to mitigate these risks (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter).\n\nConsult the **[Climate Action Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Climate-action-policy-2022.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n**At Enagás there is a governance structure led by the Board of Directors that supervises the company's climate change performance** \n\n## Management of risks and opportunities arising from climate change\n\n#### [GRI 201-2]\n\nAt Enagás, the processes for identifying and assessing climate risks are integrated into the corporate risk control and management model, which is aimed at ensuring that the company's targets are met in a predictable manner and with a medium total risk profile. This model makes it possible to identify and quantify the risks likely to affect the company's performance, including those arising from climate change. These risks are framed within the company's risk taxonomy (basically, physical risks are 'operational and technological' risks and transition risks are 'strategic and business' risks). Quantifying these risks allows them to be integrated into company strategy and targets to be set in order to minimise risks and maximise opportunities.\n\n#### Risk assessment methodology\n\nEnagás follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in its management of climate risks and has a methodology for their identification, prioritisation and economic quantification. In accordance with the classification provided by the TCFD standard, physical risks (extreme weather events, sea level rise) and transitional risks (regulatory, technological, market and reputational) are identified and assessed.\n\nThe assessment methodology allows to analyse the probability of occurrence, the time horizon and the impact under different temperature scenarios. As for the assessment time horizons, the short term is taken to run to 2026, aligned with the company's projections and regulatory period. The medium term runs to 2030, aligned with the company's Strategic Plan and the PNIEC, and the long term runs to 2050, aligned with European decarbonisation objectives and the PNIEC.\n\nMeasuring climate change-derived risks means estimating possible prospective climate and business scenarios that could eventually have a negative impact on the company's interests. 'Standard' methodologies are used for measurement according to the risk typology:\n\n- Physical risks at the company's facilities are assessed through stochastic methods, using standard climate models (XDI tool, AEMET models) to evaluate exposure to climate factors (river and coastal flooding, fires, earth movements, extreme winds, earthquakes, etc.), performing sensitivity analyses and stress tests on the most significant RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios from the sixth report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for the 2050 time horizon. Expert assessments are also available to evaluate the need for additional adaptation and prevention measures.\n- Transition risks (technological, regulatory, market, reputational) are assessed using deterministic methods, taking as a base scenario the company's projections and its strategic plan. Sensitivity analyses are performed on this based on the scenarios (STEPS, APS\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **and Governance**  [management](#page-152-0) **[Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/62/Picture/5 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts'.\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

record of the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge.\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/5 description: The image shows a logo with a circular design in light blue. The text \"REDUZCO\" is written along the top left curve, \"COMPENSO\" along the top right curve, and \"CALCULO\" along the bottom left curve. In the center of the circle is the number \"2022\" in a bold font. Below the circle is the number \"2\" in a larger, bold font. At the bottom of the image is a small rectangular section with the Spanish coat of arms on the left and text on the right, which includes the words \"GOBIERNO DE ESPAÑA\" and \"MINISTERIO PARA LA TRANSICIÓN ECOLÓGICA Y EL RETO DEMOGRÁFICO\".\n\nEnagás, from 2014 to 2023, has reduced more than 48% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions thanks to the measures included in its Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan. It should be noted that from the end of 2021, there were very significant changes in the context of the operation of the Spanish Gas System that have had an impact on the company's carbon footprint during 2022 (see the '[New energy](#page-17-0)  [paradigm](#page-17-0)' section in the Strategy chapter). The main changes that have remained in force in 2023 are highlighted below, together with their effects on energy consumption and therefore emissions:\n\n• The cessation of imports from November 2021 from Algeria through the Maghreb pipeline to Europe implied a change in the configuration of the Gas System. The usual entry through Tarifa, which meant flow ran from south to north (the configuration for which the gas network was designed), was replaced by other entry points, mainly through LNG terminals and Almeria, with the flow direction becoming east to west, a more inefficient direction in terms of energy consumption needs and therefore emissions.\n\n• The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began in February 2022, has led to a strengthening of interconnections, increasing exports to France in line with the More Energy Security Plan, as well as the application of the requirements for filling underground storage facilities (Royal Decree-Law 6/2022 of March 29 and EU Regulation 2022/1032)<sup>10</sup> .\n\nDespite the energy efficiency measures implemented by Enagás, these milestones led to an increase in the company's emissions volume in 2022. During 2023, emissions were reduced by 23.5% compared to 2022 due to:\n\n- A drop in demand (-11%) that entailed a lower volume of inflows to the system (-15%) through the Cartagena LNG terminal and through Almeria, mitigating the impact of the closure of the Maghreb pipeline. This has reduced the energy consumption needs of the compressor stations in these areas.\n- A mitigation of the effect of the Russia-Ukraine conflict through a greater role for LNG terminals at the European level as a result of the conflict, highlighting the incorporation of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal into the Gas System as a logistics terminal at the service of the Member States. The start of regasification at this terminal has also reduced south-north transport via the Silver Route, which means less use of the stations associated with the area and therefore less energy consumption and associated emissions.\n\n<sup>10</sup> Royal Decree-Law 6/2022, of March 29, increased the minimum security stock holding obligations for natural gas shippers and direct consumers in the market from 20 to 27.5 days of firm consumption. In addition, on June 29, 2022, the European Union adopted Regulation EU 2022/1032 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 29 2022 amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1938 and (EC) No 715/2009 with regard to gas storage, imposing an obligation on Member States to reach a filling level of 80% of underground storage facilities by November 1, 2022, and 90% by the same date in 2023.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-142-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)** [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The Shareholders' Agreements regulate, among other things, decisions that require joint decision-making by shareholders. Enagás' influence and decision-making is exercised through leadership on Boards of Directors and other governing bodies (e.g. Remuneration Committee, etc.), appointing directors with extensive experience in the sector and the country.\n\nHowever, Enagás has developed a management model for these companies that seeks to guarantee compliance with the business plans and their long-term sustainability, contributing Enagás' experience, knowledge and best practices as an industrial partner, while at the same time allowing affiliates to contribute to Enagás' growth, ensuring the objectives communicated to the market.\n\nEnagás has an internal management team in each affiliate, as well as the support of specific working groups for the corporate and business areas in their areas of expertise. In addition, Enagás guarantees the suitability of the managers of the affiliates for their positions by analysing and evaluating their profiles, as well as by appointing specialised profiles from the company to key positions in the affiliates (seconded personnel).\n\n#### Critical management standards\n\nEnagás actively manages its relations with partners and managers of affiliates in order to mitigate the risks associated with their management. In this regard, Enagás, in its ESG risk assessment,\n\nhas identified risks classified according to the Enagás taxonomy as reputational, strategic and business, criminal liability and compliance and model risks (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter).\n\nThe company has set out critical management standards, based on its material topics, which it extends to its affiliates according to their level of influence, and monitors them by setting out a plan of objectives for each affiliate to be implemented over a five-year horizon.\n\nCritical management standards are transferred through working groups led by the specific managers of each affiliate, involving members of the General Management of Enagás who co-lead matters falling under their remit. These working groups are instrumental in aligning positions and ensuring the operability of the Board of Directors of the affiliate, where the decisions taken by consensus will be concluded in the groups.\n\nEnagás has an Internal Monitoring Committee, established at the management level, which supervises the critical decisions of affiliates and reports quarterly on key matters to the Enagás Board of Directors.\n\n**Enagás has defined critical management standards based on its material topics; it requires its affiliates to comply with these standards in order to ensure that they are managed sustainably**\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nCritical management standards\n\nFinancial and operational\nexcellence\n\nFinancial excellence:\n- Financial and cash planning and\n management\n- Insurance\n- Management control\n- Taxation\n- Financial reporting\n- Accounting and administration\n\nOperational excellence:\n- Quality management system\n- Operational efficiency\n- Prioritisation of assets\n- Maintenance management system\n- Operation\n- Warehouse management\n- Customer service\n- Affiliate programming management\n- Measurement\n- Distribution and balances\n\nPeople\n\n- Remuneration policy\n- Contractual relations and trade union\nrights\n- Negotiation and representation\n- Human Resources Policy\n- Human resource development\n(training and recruitment)\n- Workplace climate\n\nHealth and safety\n\n- Asset protection\n- Health and safety management system\n- Emergency plan\n- Risk analysis\n- Health monitoring\n- Cybersecurity\n\nLocal communities\n\n- Stakeholder management model\n- Local development actions\n\nGood Governance\n\n- Procedure rules\n- Board of Directors Remuneration\nPolicy\n- Company governance (agreements,\nworking groups, etc.)\n\nNatural capital and\nbiodiversity management\n\n- Environmental management system\n- Conducting environmental impact\nassessments\n\nEthics and\ncompliance\n\n- Code of conduct\n- Corporate Defence Programme\n- Whistleblowing channel\n\nClimate action and energy\nefficiency\n\n- Energy efficiency measures and\nemissions reduction\n\nOther management\nstandards\n\n- Risk Map: identification and\nmonitoring of risks\n- Internal control (general control and\nprocess control)\n- Internal audit\n\nHuman rights\n\n- Human rights due diligence\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n**Supply chain**\n\n[Annual Report](#page-1-0)\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0) \n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/145/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the Enagas logo on the right. The Enagas logo is a green and blue circle with the word \"enagas\" inside.\n\n### Internal control in affiliates\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nEnagás, together with its business partners, is conducting internal audits of its affiliates in order to verify the solidity of internal controls associated with the processes at greatest risk for fraud, corruption and bribery, and is establishing control activities to strengthen these processes wherever necessary. It also monitors the established local internal audit plans, focusing in 2024 on the most relevant issues, such as the management of payments, the procurement process and the management of the recruitment and payroll processes. The aim is to ensure that the main risks of the affiliate are covered by internal audits.\n\nDuring 2023, we continued with the continuous process of complying with the audit plans approved by the different committees to ensure maximum coverage of the processes with the highest risk. Examples include partner audits to assess the existence of an adequate internal control framework, in relation to cash cycles, derivatives and debt management at the SAGGAS LNG terminal, tax cycles, personnel and the Corporate Governance process at the Soto de La Marina Compressor Station, or physical and logical security and the performance of an SCD penetration test at the BBG LNG terminal. In turn, the affiliates have their own internal audit plans, agreed with the partners, which focus on the main risks such as cybersecurity, physical security, resilience, etc.\n\n- For further

The company currently works with 1,706 approved suppliers (1,523 in 2022), which are classified in families according to the products or services they offer:\n\n- Suppliers of works and services: IT & communication suppliers, engineering, etc. In 2023, 2,518 persons belonging to 512 service providers carried out work at Enagás facilities (in 2022, 2,820 persons belonging to 529 service providers). [GRI 2-8]\n- Suppliers of supplies: electrical equipment suppliers, piping manufacturers, rotary machine manufacturers, manufacturers of instrumentation and control devices, among others.\n\nCritical suppliers are considered to be those belonging to families of products or services whose failure or malfunction would have a high economic impact, or those that are of high criticality for the business (critical components or services) that have a low number of suppliers (difficulty of substitution). Enagás has 265 approved critical suppliers (233 in 2022), comprising 15.5% of all approved suppliers (15.3% in 2022) and 26.5% of purchases made (35.3% in 2022). We have also identified more than 77 critical indirect suppliers (72 in 2022).\n\nIn 2023, work began with 84 new suppliers (92 in 2022), of which 100% have undergone an approval process and meet the established social and environmental criteria. The company has also stopped working with 49 suppliers (53 in 2022) for not complying with Enagás' approval criteria. In no cases were these in relation to social or environmental criteria<sup>46</sup>.

In the last satisfaction survey carried out in 2022, the main results were a positive NPS (Net Promoter Score), indicating that suppliers were satisfied with the different purchasing processes and that they considered transparency to be one of the strong points of the Enagás purchasing process. [GRI 2-29]\n\n## Supply chain risk management\n\nEnagás has identified the areas of supply chain management in which there may be risks to the business and to our stakeholders (risks identified in its ESG risk assessment, classified according to Enagás' taxonomy as reputational, strategic and business, criminal liability, compliance and model, and operational and technological (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter). These areas, which cover both economic, ethical, environmental and social aspects, form the basis for the assessments we perform on our suppliers in the different procurement processes. The areas analysed are:\n\n<sup>46</sup> Of the suppliers identified as having significant negative environmental and/or social impacts, no relationships with the same have been terminated as a result of social or environmental criteria (0%).\n\n<sup>47</sup> Local purchases are considered to be purchases made domestically in Spain.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Management [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)** \n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/149/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the ENA logo on the right.\n\n- Product and/or service quality.\n- Financial situation, civil liability, economic dependence on Enagás.\n- Health and safety.\n- Ethics and compliance: criminal risks, ethical compliance, legal compliance, responsible tax practice.\n- Human rights: labour rights (diversity, work-life balance, gender equality), respect for the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights compliance in the supply chain (see the '[Human rights](#page-138-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Environment: emission intensity, environmental impact (resource consumption, waste generation, noise emissions, gas emissions, etc.), environmental safety (discharges, spills, pollution, etc.).\n\nTo ensure that sustainability targets are met in supply chain management, procurement management professionals receive regular training in this area.\n\nThe Board of Directors, through the Sustainability and Appointments Committee, is the body with the highest level of responsibility for sustainable supply chain management. [GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2]\n\n#### Approval process\n\nEnagás has a supplier management model that takes into account the inherent risks for each supplier according to their nature. Enagás therefore establishes approval requirements depending on the level of risk in the economic, ethical, compliance, social and environmental aspects of the family of products and services to which each supplier belongs.\n\nThe requirements established in the supplier approval process are:\n\n#### **• For all suppliers:**\n\n- Capacity and resources to meet the quality, ethics and compliance, financial, labour, environmental, safety and technical requirements established by Enagás; as well as the long-term maintenance of these requirements within the satisfactory levels defined by Enagás.\n- Acceptance of the Enagás Code of Ethics.\n\nThe company's Code of Ethics establishes Enagás' ethical culture and is applicable in its corresponding areas of relation with the company, for contractors, suppliers and for those who collaborate with Enagás or act on its behalf. This Code incorporates guidelines for behaviour in the areas of integrity, transparency, safety, respect for people and diversity, and the environment, among others.\n\nAll Enagás suppliers and contractors are bound by the Code and expressly confirm their commitment to be familiar with it, comply with it and enforce it through acceptance of the general contracting conditions.\n\n#### See the **[Ethical principles and guidelines for suppliers](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/proveedores/Ethical-Principles-Guidelines-for-Suppliers-Enagas-Group.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n- Respect the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n- Compliance with the quotas set out in the Spanish Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act<sup>48</sup>.\n\n.\n\n- Implementation of a Gender Equality Plan<sup>47</sup>\n- **• For suppliers of specific families of products or services:** \n\t- Quality, environmental and/or occupational risk prevention certification requirements for suppliers (required from 86.8%, 30.0% and 52.7% of Enagás suppliers, respectively).\n\t- Policies or measures to promote work-life balance of professionals or Family-Responsible Company certificate.\n\n#### Supplier assessment\n\n- **• To identify suppliers:** a systematic public information analysis of potential suppliers is carried out to assess their sustainability risks based on the inherent risk level of the country, the sector and other similar companies. This is done by taking into account public financial information and consulting on human rights, ESG, ethics and compliance matters via reputational analysis platforms.\n- **• During the approval process:** Enagás evaluates its suppliers in the areas of human rights, ethics, social and environmental matters in line with the company's material issues through a questionnaire and documentary review. In 2023, Enagás updated this questionnaire in order to produce an ESG score that is taken into account during the approval process and in subsequent supplier assessments. The company will also evaluate, through pilot tests, its use in procurement, so that ESG performance will be one of the decision variables when selecting suppliers.\n- **• During the execution of the contract:** Enagás evaluates its suppliers in the aforementioned areas through different evaluation methodologies, taking into account criteria such as criticality, sustainability risks (environmental, social and governance) and turnover, among others.\n- **• After the end of the contract:** once the main and critical contracts are finalised, a quality assessment of the supplier and the associated contract is carried out.\n\n<sup>48</sup> Requisite set for companies with a workforce greater than that indicated by the applicable laws.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/1 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

For this reason, the company has joined the Global Compact's 'Sustainable Supplier' training programme as one of the driving forces.** \n\n**Through this initiative, some of Enagás' small and medium-sized suppliers - and those of other large companies - will receive training in sustainability matters based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact and the SDG. In the campaign launched in 2023, 509 of Enagás' small and medium-sized suppliers were invited.**\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás was part of the Global Compact's 'Sustainable Supplier' training programme**\n\n[GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2]\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-152-0\"></span>Image /page/152/Picture/0 description: The image is a document cover page.

This model is perfect for adapting to the complexity of a globalised competitive environment and a complex economic backdrop. This model is based on five aspects:\n\n1. The consideration of a risk taxonomy, which sets out standard typologies of risks according to their nature. The taxonomy comprises the following categories: Strategic and Business, Operational and Technological, Financial and Tax and Credit and Counterparty. There are other cross-domain types of risk: Reputational, Compliance and Criminal Liability.\n\nThe Enagás Group is also exposed to cross-domain risks that do not correspond to a single risk category, but rather may be correlated with multiple. These are the risks related to the three ESG pillars of sustainability: environmental, social and governance.\n\nThe taxonomy defined is taken as a reference point for the identification of the risk inventory to which society is exposed. It should also be noted that the methodologies used for risk measurement differ depending on each type.\n\n2. The segregation and independence of the functions of risk control and management at the company, in three 'lines of defence':\n\n- On the one hand, the business units that are responsible for the risks they take on when conducting their ordinary business activities, and are therefore responsible for identifying and measuring them.\n- Moreover, there is a risk area responsible for: (i) ensuring that the risk control and management system functions properly, (ii) active participation in the development of the risk strategy and definitions of impacts on their management, and (iii) ensuring that the control and management systems adequately mitigate risks.\n- Lastly the internal audit function is responsible for monitoring the efficiency of controls in relation to identified risks.\n\nImage /page/153/Figure/16 description: The image shows a pyramid diagram illustrating different types of risks. The pyramid is divided into several layers, each representing a specific risk category. From top to bottom, the layers are labeled as follows: \"Environment, social and governance\", \"Compliance\", \"Reputational\", \"Credit and Counterparty\", \"Financial and Tax\", \"Operational and Technological\", \"Strategic and Business\", and \"Criminal Liability\".\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n\n#### Internal risk control and management framework\n\n|                                      | 1st line of defence - Business units                                  | 2nd line of defence - Risk area                                                                              | 3rd line of defence - Internal audit                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance                           |                                                                       | Define the regulatory framework and<br>governance.                                                           |                                                                             |\n|                                      | Identify the risks they assume in their<br>ordinary activity.         | Define a taxonomy of risks and advise the<br>business units on identifying risks.                            |                                                                             |\n|                                      | Assess and measure risks following the                                | Establish the risk measurement<br>methodologies and the risk consolidation<br>and reporting system.          |                                                                             |\n| Risk profile                         | established measurement methodologies,<br>assuming and managing them. | Validate the measurements made by the<br>business units.                                                     |                                                                             |\n|                                      | Define risk control and management<br>measures.                       | Ensure that management controls and<br>measures are aligned with the company's<br>strategy.                  | Verify and monitor the risk function and<br>established control activities. |\n|                                      | Define actions to correct failure to comply<br>with risk limits.      | Provide a global and homogeneous vision<br>of risks, reporting to Senior Management<br>and Governing Bodies. |                                                                             |\n|                                      |                                                                       | Inform the Governing Bodies of the risk<br>appetite and its associated limit structure.                      |                                                                             |\n| Risk appetite                        |                                                                       | Validate measures and strategies for<br>correcting any non-compliance.                                       |                                                                             |\n| Coordination<br>with second<br>lines |                                                                       | Ongoing coordination with Insurance,<br>Cybersecurity and Health and Safety areas                            |                                                                             |\n\n### **Enagás is also exposed to risks of a cross-domain nature, which are risks related to the three ESG sustainability pillars**\n\n1. The existence of certain governing bodies with responsibilities in the process of risk control and management in the company: [GRI 2-12, GRI 2-13]\n\n#### **Governing Bodies**\n\n#### **Board of Directors**\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for approving the Risk Control and Management Policy. Other responsibilities with respect to risks are delegated in the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\n#### **Audit and Compliance Committee**\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee mainly monitors the efficiency of the risk control and management systems and evaluates the risks to the company (identification, measurement and establishment of measures for their management).\n\n#### **Executive Committee**\n\nThe Executive Committee establishes the overall strategy for risks, the limits of global risk for the company, and reviews the level of exposure to risk and the corrective actions, should there be any non-compliance.\n\n2. Establishing a risk appetite framework which defines the risk levels considered acceptable and that is in line with established business objectives and the market environment in which the company's activities are carried out.\n\n> There is also a scorecard of key risk indicators (KRIs) with their associated limits for the company's main processes and risks. These delimit the risk appetite that the Group wishes to assume in its quest for profitability and value.\n\n3. The transparency of information supplied to third parties, to guarantee its reliability and accuracy.\n\n#### See the **[Risk Control and Management Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Risk-Control-and-Management-Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nThe Model complies with international best practice standards in terms of risk control and management, primarily referring to ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard and 2nd COSO<sup>49</sup> Report: ERM (Enterprise Risks Management). It is also fully aligned with the national regulatory framework in this area (requirements of the Spanish Corporate Enterprises Act and the recommendations of the CNMV's Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and Technical Guide 3/2017 on Audit Committees for Public Interest Entities).

The risk area carries out this analysis on an independent, transversal (covering all types of risks) and homogeneous basis (following the same methodologies as in the global risk measurement).\n\nAn external audit/assessment of the company's Risk Control and Management Function will be carried out in 2024. Furthermore, within the framework of ISO 55001 - Asset Management Certification, ISO 14001 - Environmental Management Systems (EMS) Certification and ISO 37001 - Anti-Bribery Management Systems\n\nCertification, regular external audits are carried out on the Risk Control and Management Model.\n\n## **The Risk Map includes the main risks to which the Enagás Group is exposed, including those associated with climate change**\n\nThe Enagás risk map is shown below, detailing the risks to which the Enagás Group is exposed, represented in aggregate (in accordance with level 2 of the company's risk taxonomy).\n\nThis map includes aggregate Sustainability (ESG) risks, defined as the effects of non-compliance with commitments and objectives in the company's material topics. Enagás has identified and assessed these risks based on the company's materiality analysis (see the '[Sustainable Management Model](#page-54-0)' section in the '[Environmental,](#page-53-0)  [Social and Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter). The result is risks with ESG factors or impacts for each of the material topics. Details of those arising from the material topics of Climate Action and Natural Capital are published in this report (see the '[Climate](#page-60-0)  [action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' and '[Natural capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)  [management](#page-100-0)' sections of the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter, respectively). The typology of risks identified in the areas of human rights, supply chain and affiliates is also indicated (see the '[Human rights](#page-138-0)', ['Supply chain](#page-147-0)' and '[Affiliates](#page-142-0)' sections in the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n**[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)**\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. The letters are in a dark teal color. Above the word \"enagas\" is a curved line in a light green color, forming a semi-circle shape over the word.\n\nThe main emerging risks also appear, related to uncertainty about issues such as 'the role of natural gas in the future energy mix', 'the technological and regulatory deployment of hydrogen' and 'data governance'. The first two risks are assessed as having a low probability of materialisation and a high impact/exposure, hence a 'Significant' risk level. 'Data governance' has a moderate probability of materialisation and a low impact/exposure for the company, therefore, its risk level is 'Acceptable'. Some of these risks stem from climate change, among other factors.

The matrix is divided into zones labeled 'Critical', 'Significant', 'Tolerable', and 'Acceptable'. Numbered points are scattered across the matrix, each representing a different risk. A legend lists the risks associated with each number: 1. Role of natural gas in the future energy mix, 2. Technological and regulatory deployment of hydrogen, 3. Geopolitical risks, 4. Global environment (inflation), 5. Sustainability (ESG), 6. Regulatory and remuneration, 7. Legal, 8. Affiliates - International business, 9. Industrial risks in infrastructure operation, 10. Cybersecurity (industrial and corporate systems), 11. Data governance (decision making, AI), 12. Non-availability of gas at source, 13. Suppliers and counterparties, 14. Unintentional failures or errors in corporate processes, 15. Worsening of the company's financing conditions, 16. Financial (interest rate, exchange rate and liquidity), 17. Tax risks, 18. Direct reputational risks, 19. Compliance risks, and 20. Criminal liability risks. The point for risk 11 is shown as a square, and is labeled as an 'Emerging risk'.\n\n**20.** Criminal liability risks\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Type of risk

(parent company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) is prepared annually and includes the non-financial information statement that was prepared by the Board of Directors on February 19, 2024, complying with the requirements of: [GRI 2-14]\n\n- a. Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial information and diversity, as well as with the associated Spanish legislation (Law 11/2018). See Appendix '[Non-financial and diversity](#page-178-0)  [reporting requirements \\(Law 11/2018\\) and the EU](#page-178-0)  [Taxonomy for sustainable activities Regulation](#page-178-0)'.\n- b. Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments and its delegated acts, which establish the obligation to disclose information on how and to what extent the company's activities are associated with economic activities that are considered environmentally sustainable. See Appendix '[Non-financial and diversity reporting requirements \\(Law](#page-178-0)  [11/2018\\) and the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities](#page-178-0)  [Regulation](#page-178-0)'.\n\nThe following standards and principles were used in preparing this 2023 Consolidated Management Report:\n\n- In accordance with the GRI Standards, including the 2021 updated version of the global standards and the sector standard GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021. Enagás, in addition to the GRI Standards content associated with the material topics indicated in this sector standard, identifies other GRI Standards relevant to the company's activity and nature. See Appendix '[GRI content index](#page-185-0)'.\n- The principles of standard AA1000: inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact.\n- The SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) reporting standard for the Oil & Gas - Midstream sector. See Appendix '[SASB](#page-199-0)  [content index](#page-199-0)'.\n- Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures (TCFD). See Appendix ['](#page-201-0)[TCFD content index](#page-201-0)'.\n- The Sustainable Development Goals approved by the United Nations General Assembly, which Enagás integrates in its strategy and are set out in the sub-section 'C[ontribution to the SDG](#page-44-0)'.\n- The Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, as set out in the Appendix ['](#page-203-0)[Global Compact content index](#page-203-0)['.](#page-203-0)\n- Recommendations included in the 'Guide for the preparation of management reports of listed companies' of the CNMV.\n\n#### External verification [GRI 2-5]\n\nThe Non-Financial Information Statement was verified by an independent third party, in this case EY, in order to comply with the requirement of Law 11/2018 for external verification and in line with Enagás' commitment to transparency, reliability and rigour of the information. For the scope of this verification, see the Appendix ['](#page-172-0)[External verification report](#page-172-0)['.](#page-172-0)\n\n## Scope of the financial and non-financial information\n\nThe scope of this report includes the information on 2023 financial year of the Enagás Group (hereinafter 'Enagás'). The following criteria have been applied to the information reported herein:\n\n- The financial information is presented in accordance with the consolidation principles applied in the annual accounts.\n- Non-financial information relates to operations over which Enagás maintains control (companies consolidated in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the full consolidation method). These companies are mainly located in Spain.<sup>52</sup> [GRI 2-2]\n- For further details on the scope of the financial information, refer to the '**[Consolidated Annual Accounts', section 1.3 'Basis of](#page-228-0)  [consolidation](#page-228-0)**'.\n- For further details on the ownership structure of Enagás, see the '**[Annual Corporate Governance Report', section 'A. Ownership](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)  [structure](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)**'.\n\n<sup>52</sup> Excluded from the scope are start-ups that have been integrated into the Enagás Group with operational control (Efficiency for LNG Applications S.L., Scale Gas Solutions S.L. and Sercomgas Gas Solutions. See sub-section '[Innovation and Corporate Venture](#page-49-0)') and whose businesses as of 2023 are in the early stages of development. Therefore, their impacts are considered to be of little relevance (for example, in 2023, they accounted for 2.6% of Enagás' workforce). In 2023, the impact of the operations of these start-ups has been assessed, with the conclusion that the degree of maturity of their business and activities is becoming representative. Therefore, from 2024 onwards, these start-ups will be included in the scope of Enagás' non-financial information.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-170-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nbusiness\nodel\nOur\nthe\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/170/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

This amount will be applied first to the temporary imbalances between revenues and costs of the system and then to those annual payments relating to the accumulated deficit of the gas system at December 31, 2014.\n\nSince 2018, positive annual mismatches between income and remuneration have been generated (surplus), so that the 2015 and 2017 financial years were amortised on an accelerated basis against the surplus of this 2018 financial year. Similarly, in 2019, the annual mismatch between income and remuneration resulted in a surplus of 353,859 thousands of euros, with the collection right pending receipt for the 2016 (33,475 thousands of euros) mismatch being fully amortised, and the 2014 mismatch being partially amortised (320,384 thousands of euros).\n\nFrom that date, the annual mismatch between revenues and remuneration is used to cover the negative mismatch pending from 2014, partially amortising 186,691 thousands of euros against the surplus for 2020 and 81,127 thousands of euros against the surplus for 2021, whose resolution was approved by the CNMC on July 28, 2022.\n\nSince 2023, only the surplus originated in the settlement of charges is used to amortise the negative mismatch pending from 2014. Therefore, 11,280 thousands of euros are amortised against the surplus from 2022, a resolution approved on July 27, 2023.\n\nAs of October 1, 2022 (start of gas year 2023) the outstanding capital amounts to 58,832 thousands of euros. In 2023, the outstanding deficit accumulated up until 2014, as per the provisions of article 66 of Law 18/2014, was successfully reduced by an annual amount of 6,429 thousands of euros.\n\nFurthermore, in 2023, the surplus resulting from the settlement of charges for the gas year 2022, totalling 11,280 thousands of euros, was utilised for the first time to offset the remaining negative imbalance from 2014, this decision having been made on July 27, 2023.\n\nThus, the 2014 mismatch remaining to be amortised at October 1, 2023 (start of the 2024 gas year) amounts to 41,122 thousands of\n\neuros, which is much lower than the 1,025,053 thousands of euros accumulated at December 31, 2014.\n\nWith regard to the Company's share of the deficit generated by the system during 2014, it should be noted that, as reported in the 2017 annual accounts, on December 1, 2017 the receivables from the accumulated deficit rights at December 31, 2014 were assigned. Said rights represented an amount of 354,751 thousands of euros, corresponding to the nominal amount plus accrued interest pending collection at the date of cession.

The man is positioned on the left side of the frame, with his body angled slightly towards the viewer. He has a fair complexion and a gentle smile. The suit is a deep blue color, and the tie has a subtle pattern of brown and white. The background is a solid, neutral gray, which helps to highlight the man and his attire.\n\n**2023 has been a big year for Enagás:** intense in terms of the magnitude of the challenges we have faced and in which we have taken truly significant steps for our future growth.\n\nThe global context continues to be highly complex, and geopolitical conflicts like those that continue today in Ukraine, the Middle East and the Red Sea - with their attendant energy consequences - have left their mark on much of the year. Among others, the European Union, countries such as Spain and companies have learned important lessons from the disruptive events of recent years. We know that navigating the new paradigm of uncertainty,\n\nvolatility and the acceleration of major transformations has two keys: anticipation and cooperation.\n\nAfter laying the foundations in 2022 with REPowerEU, Europe has continued to build a truly collective energy policy as one of the fundamental pillars of its strategic autonomy. The EU has adopted very significant measures over the past year at a crucial time for energy. Likewise, Spain's term holding the presidency of the European Council has produced very satisfactory results in this area, such as the agreements for the EU Directive and Regulation on the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package, and the agreement on electricity market reform.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\nImage /page/5/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a simple, sans-serif font. To the right of the text is a stylized logo featuring a green and blue design.\n\n#### A key role in European energy security\n\nSpain has continued to play an essential role in strengthening European security of supply. We were the first country to meet the EU's target of 90% fill levels at underground storage facilities by November. We achieved this six months ahead of schedule; in August, we reached 100%. The EU as a whole managed to fill its storage to 99%, a success that made this winter far more comfortable than the last.\n\nWe will also end 2023 with one more LNG terminal in operation thanks to the start-up of the El Musel terminal in Gijón, which provides 20% of Europe's additional new regasification capacity. Our seven LNG terminals are a major strategic asset for Spain and have allowed us to receive gas from 17 different origins this year. Our country has consolidated its position as the LNG gateway to Europe, and Enagás became the world's leading tanker loading operator in 2023.\n\nOur robust gas pipeline network has also made it easier for Spain to remain in energy solidarity with the rest of the EU: gas exports by pipeline increased by 23.7% in 2023 and, last April, Spain broke the all-time record for natural gas exports to Europe through interconnections with France.\n\n#### A new investment phase centred on renewable hydrogen\n\nAll the knowledge, experience and talent that this company has accumulated over the last 50 years building, operating and maintaining the gas network is being applied to make a future hydrogen network in Spain a reality. In turn, this will form part of a European network.\n\nAs a locally-produced and clean energy carrier, renewable hydrogen strengthens our strategic autonomy and is the key to decarbonisation for Spanish and European industry. The energy transition - let us not forget - is also an opportunity for reindustrialisation.\n\nThe European Commission is betting heavily on green hydrogen, which represents a huge opportunity for Spain; everything is in place for Spain to become the continent's major hydrogen hub. As a company, we are also betting on hydrogen as the future to ensure our sustained growth over time. Developing Spain's gas network was a major challenge and, as has become particularly evident in recent years, a major success. Now, once again, we are facing an intense investment period to make the deployment of renewable hydrogen a reality through projects as massive as the Spanish hydrogen infrastructure project and the H2med corridor.\n\nOur results and milestones for 2023, in which we exceeded all our targets for the seventeenth consecutive year, demonstrate the good work we are doing and are our best guarantee as we tackle the challenges that lie ahead for our sector and Enagás in particular. In 2024, we will continue to work towards becoming a carbon-neutral company by 2040 and contributing to clean, reliable and competitive energy for industries and citizens. Completing the energy trifecta, in short.\n\nEnagás has a truly exceptional team of professionals. Thank you again for your hard work, responsibility and enthusiasm. Many thanks to our magnificent Board of Directors for their involvement and commitment, and to our shareholders for supporting Enagás' future-oriented project and their longterm faith in the company.

He has short, dark hair and a light complexion. He is smiling slightly and looking directly at the camera. He is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a blue and green patterned tie. His arms are crossed. The background is a solid gray color.\n\n#### **How was 2023 for Enagás?**\n\n2022 was the year of security of supply, and 2023 has indisputably been the year of hydrogen. In just twelve months, we have made progress that lays a firm foundation for the company's future. I would like to highlight three main milestones. The first was that we launched our promised Call for Interest for Spanish hydrogen infrastructure. This attracted enormous interest: 206 companies submitted 650 projects, demonstrating that there is both supply and demand for renewable hydrogen in Spain; these require infrastructure to become a real market.\n\n**'2023 has been a year full of milestones, with a very significant one being the designation of Enagás as the provisional hydrogen network operator'**\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\nImage /page/7/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the \"eni\" logo on the right.\n\nThe other two major milestones are the wonderful news we received as the year drew to a close: the European Commission included on its list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI) both the European H2med corridor and the Spanish hydrogen infrastructure presented by Enagás, opening the door for them to receive European funding. At the same time, through Royal Decree-Law 8/2023, the Spanish government designated us as the provisional hydrogen transmission network operator.\n\nIn parallel to all these advances in hydrogen, we continued to guarantee the perfect operation of the Spanish Gas System, which had 100% availability in 2023. Likewise, we strengthened its role as a key energy hub for Europe's energy sovereignty. In short, we have continued to contribute to the well-being and progress of Spanish society, that of the countries where we operate, and that of those around us.\n\n#### **How is the company preparing for 2024?**\n\nWe are once again facing an intense and exciting year in which we will continue to work towards security of supply and decarbonisation in Spain and Europe. We started the year off with our second Enagás Hydrogen Day; at this very well-received event, we presented the results of the Call for Interest process. This information provided by the sector is the best starting point for the first mission that has been entrusted to us as the provisional HTNO (Hydrogen Transmission Network Operator): to present a hydrogen backbone infrastructure proposal to the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge in April.\n\nIn March, the final list of PCIs will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, and we will be able to apply for European CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) funds for the Spanish infrastructure and H2med studies.\n\nWith the visibility we have now, after all these developments in such a short time, we will update our Strategic Plan during 2024.\n\nWith regard to the GSP arbitration, according to the Arbitration Tribunal, the award terminating the arbitration proceedings will be rendered in the first half of 2024.\n\n## **'As promised, we launched the Call for Interest for Spanish hydrogen infrastructure, which attracted enormous interest and participation from the whole sector'**\n\n#### **What are the main features of the 2023 results?**\n\nThese are very good results; we exceeded all the targets we set ourselves for 2023 and recorded a net profit of 343 million euros.\n\nThese results are mainly explained by two factors. The first is our Efficiency Plan, which has proven to be highly effective in controlling operating and financial expenses and thus minimising the impact of inflation on manageable costs. In particular, we have managed to keep recurring operating expenses at 2022 levels.\n\nThe second factor is the positive evolution and contributions of our affiliates.\n\n#### **How would you sum up the year from a financial perspective?**\n\nWe have continued to strengthen our balance sheet through asset rotation. In this regard, the closing of the sale of our stake in Morelos Pipeline in Mexico had a positive impact, generating a gross capital gain of 46.7 million euros.\n\nWe ended 2023 with an excellent liquidity position of 3.309 billion euros. Our net debt was 3.347 billion euros, 122 million euros less than the previous year. Among other factors, this was thanks to the strong performance of working capital due to the premiums collected from the increased utilisation of LNG terminals in 2023.\n\nWe have a very solid position, with more than 80% of our debt at fixed rates. In addition, the successful issue of 600 million euros in\n\nbonds maturing in 2034 with an annual coupon rate of 3.625% was recently completed in 2024. We have taken advantage of favourable market conditions to extend the average maturity of our debt and to have the next maturities covered.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/24 description: A man in a suit and tie is standing with his hands clasped in front of him.

To the right of the text is a logo with the letters \"e\" and \"w\" in blue and green.\n\n**How well has the Strategic Plan been implemented?** \n\nWe have exceeded our expectations and progressed faster than planned in implementing the Plan. 2023 was a year of significant steps in our investment plan.\n\nIn Europe, we entered Germany, joining the Hanseatic Energy Hub (HEH) consortium as a 10% industrial partner to develop the Stade LNG terminal, which includes both a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) and a future onshore terminal. We also increased our stake in a strategic infrastructure for the European Union - the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) - to 20%.\n\nIn Spain, we reached an agreement with Reganosa whereby we acquired their network of 130 kilometres of gas pipelines and gave them a 25% stake in the El Musel LNG terminal, which has now started operations and is entering a new phase as the Musel E-Hub LNG terminal.\n\nAnother achievement of the year was the launch by Enagás GTS of the Guarantees of Origin System for renewable gases in Spain.\n\n#### **What is the key to remaining a sustainability leader?**\n\nClear commitments, rigorous measurement and transparent progress reporting year after year. We are committed to being a carbon-neutral company by 2040; to this end, we are following a very ambitious decarbonisation pathway which includes both our direct operations and our value chain. We are making progress and reporting this properly; this means that, for example, the start of 2024 saw us included for the fourth consecutive year on the CDP Climate Change A List. This distinction sets us apart among the world's leading companies in climate action.\n\nWe are on all the major indices, including the global leader, Dow Jones Sustainability, where we have been listed for sixteen consecutive years.\n\nThe key is that our sustainability strategy is at the heart of the business and the company; it concerns and occupies all of us who work here.\n\n#### **What would you highlight from your performance in other ESG areas?**\n\nA clear focus is our commitment to people and the generation of quality employment. We have been recognised for fourteen years as one of the best companies to work for in Spain, certified as a Top Employer company, as well as having the highest level of excellence (A+) as a Family-Responsible Company (EFR). We opened 2024 with the signing of the Group's 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement, a sign of the good understanding between the company and the workers' representatives that shows that at Enagás, we are all pulling in the same direction.\n\nIn these times of profound transformation for our sector, we are more committed than ever to talent and training for the development of the new skills the future needs. Among many other initiatives, we are developing our training school into a Corporate University.\n\nAnother major commitment taken on by Enagás - and by me personally - is to be an increasingly inclusive company. Diversity is key to our present and future strategy. Regarding gender diversity in particular, more than a decade ago, we were one of the first companies to receive the Spanish Ministry of Equality's Gender Equality badge; today, we are world leaders in our sector on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.\n\n## **'Our sustainability strategy is at the heart of the business and the company; it concerns and occupies all of us who work here'**\n\n#### **Is there anything else you would like to highlight about the company's prospects?**\n\nThis is a decisive moment for energy and for the future of Enagás. Decarbonisation, the energy transition and the hydrogen economy are challenges to which we have a lot to contribute, as we have unrivalled experience and the best possible team of professionals.\n\nWe are very pleased with the progress made in 2023 with our Transformation Plan, which we put in place to facilitate the challenges ahead of us through digitalisation, agility and new ways of working. We have also launched transformative initiatives like the Ingenia Energy Challenge, our call to find disruptive projects that contribute to accelerating the energy transition.\n\nThe designation of Enagás as a provisional HTNO by Royal Decree-Law 8/2023 is a huge responsibility and a great opportunity for the company's future growth built around renewable hydrogen. Our goal is always to create maximum value for society and for our shareholders, to whom I am especially grateful for their confidence in the company's vision and management. Rest assured that our top priority is to create sustainable value for you.\n\nMy thanks also go to all Enagás professionals for the great work they are doing and to the members of the Board of Directors for their support and magnificent work.\n\nLastly, I would like to mention that the Enagás Board of Directors has approved this Annual Report, which represents the renewal of our commitment to the ten principles of the Global Compact, and at the same time, reflects our contribution to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n[GRI 2-14, GRI 2-22]\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-3-0)\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/8 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

It begins with the extraction of natural gas from a gasfield, followed by liquefaction, where the gas is cooled to -160°C to reduce its volume for transmission. LNG is then transported in methane tankers from the country of origin to the destination country via LNG maritime transport. Tanker offloading/loading occurs at the LNG terminal, where LNG is offloaded from the tanker and loaded onto the tanker. The LNG terminal returns the gas to its original gaseous state. Truck loading involves loading LNG onto tank trucks. The diagram also shows the demand for electricity generation. Natural gas transmission involves transmitting natural gas through the high-pressure network. Distribution to customers involves distributing natural gas to end customers for consumption. Underground storage involves storing natural gas in existing geological structures. The diagram also mentions gas network operation, which is managed by the Technical Manager of the Spanish Gas System, certified as an independent European TSO. Conventional demand, including household, commercial, and industrial, is also depicted.\n\n- Activities carried out by other players (e.g. customers) on the gas value chain\n\nMore details about **[Gas transmission](https://www.enagas.es/en/energy-transition/gas-network/energy-infrastructure/transmission-network/)** are available on the corporate website.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-14-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n**Our business** [Our commitment to](#page-16-0) **[model](#page-10-0)** [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n# Purpose, vision and values\n\nThe company's purpose, vision and values, as well as its policies and strategy, are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a curved line in a light green color, forming a semi-circle shape.\n\n# Strategy\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n## New energy paradigm\n\n## Business context\n\nMore than a year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 2023 has been characterised by a reduction in energy prices, particularly for natural gas. The average spot price in Europe was around €40/ MWh in 2023, compared to the average price in 2022, which was around €120/MWh.\n\nDespite this price reduction, markets have remained tense and volatile due to situations that have led to one-off reductions in supply, such as labour strikes at liquefaction pants in Australia; geopolitical factors, such as the risk of a prolonged conflict between Israel and Palestine; and the fear of a blockade in the Suez Canal due to the intensification of attacks by Houthi militants in the Red Sea area.\n\nWith regard to the structure of natural gas supplies in the European Union, it should be noted that imports of Russian gas continued to fall during 2023. Specifically, Russia supplied the European Union with a total of 46 bcm of natural gas, of which 27 bcm was supplied by pipeline (17% of total imports) and 20 bcm as LNG (liquefied natural gas) (14% of total LNG imports), representing a 45% decrease compared to total imports in 2022.\n\nIn this context, security of supply in the European Union was guaranteed thanks, to a large extent, to the increase in LNG imports from other origins, such as the United States. In 2023, 45% of the LNG received by the European Union was supplied by the United States, which represents an increase of more than 13% compared to 2022, highlighting the key role of LNG terminals as a guarantor of security of supply.\n\nThis important role for LNG terminals has been corroborated by the signing of more than 90 bcm of new LNG contracts worldwide by 2023, most of them long-term, of which more than 20 bcm are located in the European Union. To this should be added the more than 250 bcm of regasification projects under construction globally, of which 60 bcm are located in the European Union.\n\nThe start-up of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal in the summer of 2023, as part of the Spanish Government's 'More Energy Security' Plan, has strengthened the place of the Spanish Gas System as a key player in guaranteeing security of supply in Europe. This is evidenced by the fact that Spain was the nonproducing country that re-exported the most LNG in the world during 2023, with 22.1 TWh.\n\nOn the other hand, the demand for natural gas in Spain decreased by 11% compared to 2022, mainly due to lower residential and commercial demand because of the effect of more moderate temperatures, as well as lower demand for gas for electricity generation as a result of higher hydropower and renewable generation. However, industrial gas demand showed signs of recovery after last year's energy crisis, with an increase of almost 4%, mainly concentrated in the refining sector and chemical industry. In addition, exports of natural gas from Spain to Europe by pipeline through France - via the Irún and Larrau interconnections - increased by 6.1% to 37.5 TWh, helping boost the security of the European energy supply.\n\n2023 was also marked by the updating of the draft 2030 National Energy and Climate Plans, which have highlighted the key role of natural gas in the decarbonisation and energy transition process, as well as the deployment of renewable gases - in particular, of green hydrogen - as a particularly significant decarbonisation vector in those industrial sectors that are most difficult to electrify and as a common element across the three pillars of energy policy: security of supply, decarbonisation and price. In Spain, the updated draft National Energy and Climate Plan gave a boost to hydrogen development, with the inclusion of a target of 11 GW of installed capacity in electrolysers by 2030. Furthermore, the H2med project is mentioned, which will allow to turn Spain into the first renewable hydrogen hub worldwide. It will include the first axes of the national backbone network that will connect green hydrogen production centres with domestic demand and the two international interconnections with France and Portugal.\n\nWithin this fundamental role for renewable hydrogen in the decarbonisation of the global and European energy system, very significant milestones were reached in 2023 that constitute a boost for hydrogen development and consolidate Spain's role as a key player.\n\n**Enagás will play a key role, in collaboration with other European TSOs, in the integration of the European energy system** \n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/18/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in grey font on the left side of the image. On the right side of the image is a logo with the letters \"en\" in blue and green.\n\n#### Global milestones:\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nBetween November 30 and December 12, the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) took place in Dubai, where the first stocktake of progress on climate action (Global Stocktake, GST) was signed, recognising the role of transition fuels, including natural gas, and their contribution to the energy transition as a key element in ensuring energy security.\n\nAmong the main agreements reached at the summit were the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030; the progressive reduction of coal use that lacks emission mitigation measures; the deployment of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, particularly significant in sectors that are difficult to decarbonise; and the development of carbon capture, transport and storage.\n\n#### European milestones:\n\n- October: presentation in Berlin of the H2med project, with the participation of representatives from the governments and TSOs of Germany, France, Portugal and Spain, who showed their support for the development of H2med as a great green corridor that will connect the Iberian Peninsula with north-western Europe, enabling the transport of renewable hydrogen from production areas to the areas of greatest consumption through the associated national hydrogen backbones.\n- Inclusion of H2med and the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network in the European Commission's list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI) in November, which will be presented to the Council and the European Parliament for approval at the beginning of 2024; this represents an important step forward in the promotion of these projects.\n- Provisional agreement between the European Parliament and the European Council on the European Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Package, which will act as a catalyst for the deployment of renewable and low-carbon gases, including hydrogen, in Europe. All through the lens of ensuring security of supply and energy affordability. This package, among other measures, includes rules for the development of the European hydrogen market and a new governance structure in the form of the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH) to promote dedicated hydrogen infrastructure. It also strengthens the long-term planning of the infrastructure needed for a decarbonised gas sector in Europe.\n\n#### Milestones in Spain:\n\n- Enagás' September launch of the non-binding Call for Interest consultation process for the first axes of the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network. This process closed in November; more than 200 companies participated, showing the enormous interest aroused.\n- Publication of Royal Decree-Law 8/2023, which included the designation of Enagás as the provisional manager of the Hydrogen Backbone network (HTNO) in Spain and entrusted it with the preparation of a proposal for the development of the hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon.\n\n## Regulatory vision to 2030\n\nIn Spain, the 2021-2026 regulatory framework is stable and transparent, and establishes a period of six-years without intermediate revision. This framework supports climate and energy targets by establishing incentives to keep the gas system infrastructure available, and to fulfil the role assigned by the Spanish National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan for natural gas and renewable gases in the energy transition process. This shows that the use of existing gas infrastructure is essential if advances are to be made in energy transition at the lowest cost.\n\nIn 2023, very significant regulatory actions were taken to accelerate the energy transition and highlight the key role of Enagás' infrastructures for Europe's energy security, which will serve to maintain regulatory stability and anticipate the new energy model:\n\n- On the one hand, after having agreed on the final texts of the European Directives and Regulations on the internal markets for natural gas, renewable gases and hydrogen, which will be formally approved during the first half of 2024, the process of transposition into Spanish law will begin. This will be done through an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law, with a maximum of two years to do so.\n- Likewise, through Royal Decree 8/2023 of December 27, which adopts measures to deal with the economic and social consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as to alleviate the effects of the drought:\n\t- Enagás is provisionally designated as the Hydrogen Network Operator (HTNO).\n\t- It is also tasked with presenting a development proposal for hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon.\n- This will lay the foundations for a stable regulatory framework for the new natural gas period as well as for the new renewable gas networks, especially hydrogen, which will begin in 2027, by making the most of the natural gas infrastructures, their subsequent adaptation to hydrogen and the new hydrogen infrastructures. This will make possible:\n- Enagás' transition from interim hydrogen network operator to a certified hydrogen network operator.\n- The completion of hydrogen networks in Spain and their integration with the European market, commissioning Enagás to start work and build hydrogen backbone infrastructure.\n- The ensuring of adequate return on investment and profitability in both natural gas and hydrogen networks.\n- Temporary coexistence of natural gas and hydrogen networks.\n- A framework for the development of research work on saline storages for hydrogen.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nur business\nodel\nOur\nthe\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  **Our commitment to**  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/7 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enagas.

To this end, it has outlined a decarbonisation pathway with emission reduction targets by 2026, 2030 and 2040 aligned with the 1.5ºC temperature increase scenario.\n\n#### Update of Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets (t CO2e)\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/13 description: This image shows a bar chart with the years 2014, 2023, 2026, 2030, and 2040 on the x-axis. The y-axis shows the values 571,033, 294,649, 202,359, 151,160, and 23,162. The bar chart shows a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2040. The values above the bars are -48%, -65%, -74%, and -96%.\n\n(1) Carbon neutrality will be achieved in 2040 with 23,162 tonnes of CO2e offset by nature-based solutions projects (reforestation).\n\nIn 2023, Enagás remained on track to meet its emissions reduction targets, having achieved a 48% reduction compared to 2014.\n\nThe Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction targets include the Global Methane Alliance methane emissions reduction commitment, which will reduce methane emissions from our business by 45% by 2025 and 60% by 2030, compared to 2015 levels.\n\nIn addition, we held to our emissions reduction targets linked to variable remuneration (see the '[Targets linked to variable](#page-21-0)  [remuneration](#page-21-0)' sub-section), including the emissions reduction targets in both the annual Target Management Programme and the Long-Term Incentive Plan. Enagás' target is to reduce its emissions by 5% in 2024, a target included in the annual target management programme and therefore linked to variable remuneration.\n\nIn addition, the company has set the following targets for the reduction of its indirect Scope 3 emissions:\n\n#### Indirect emissions reduction targets (scope 3) (t  $CO\\_2e$ ) (1)\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/20 description: The image is a bar graph showing the values 825,211 in 2021, 723,986 in 2023, 618,908 in 2030, and 412,605 in 2040. The value in 2023 is 12% less than the value in 2021. The value in 2030 is 25% less than the value in 2023. The value in 2040 is 50% less than the value in 2030.\n\n(1) Targets corresponding to 100% of indirect Scope 3 emissions, the most significant of which include emissions derived from natural gas flowing on and off our infrastructure network, emissions from our affiliates and our main suppliers (GHG Protocol categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15).\n\nIn 2023, Enagás reduced its Scope 3 emissions by 12% compared to the base year 2021, thus moving towards the decarbonisation of its value chain and in line with the targets set.\n\nThese targets reinforce the commitments adopted through its adherence to various international climate action initiatives:\n\n- Science Based Targets<sup>3</sup>: we are committed to setting out targets based in science.\n- We Mean Business: we are committed to driving policies towards a low-carbon economy, setting a carbon price and reporting climate change information in corporate publications.\n- Global Methane Alliance: we are committed to reducing methane emissions from our activity by 45% by 2025 and 60% by 2030 with respect to 2015 figures.\n- Methane Guiding Principles: we have signed up to commitments on methane emissions reduction and transparency.\n- Oil & Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP 2.0): we have joined the reporting framework initiative aimed at improving the quantification and reduction of methane emissions.\n\n<sup>3</sup> At the time of writing, SBTi has not yet defined a methodology for the Oil&Gas sector covering Enagás' midstream activities. However, Enagás incorporates SBTi's main recommendations in its target-setting methodology.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**Our commitment to** [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  **the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in blue, with a green arc above it.\n\n## Decarbonisation of our operations\n\nIn order to meet the carbon neutrality and scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets established in the decarbonisation pathway, Enagás is applying the mitigation hierarchy by implementing specific actions that the company has identified and planned as part of its Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan.\n\nIn this regard, Enagás is working on a plan to electrify turbocompressors in compressor stations and underground storage facilities by 2040. This plan is reviewed and updated in line with the operating context (see the '[New energy paradigm](#page-17-0)' section in this chapter and the ['](#page-60-0)[Climate action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section in the '[Environmental, Social and Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter), taking into account the following premises for facility selection:\n\n- Act on the facilities that are going to be more intensive in operation (higher CO<sup>2</sup> emissions).\n- Make the most of the useful remunerative life of the facilities.\n- Match interventions to the need for maintenance development to minimise costs.\n- Act on facilities with restrictions, either due to atmospheric emissions (NO<sup>x</sup> emission limits) or due to operational problems which could compromise their operation.\n- Have H2-ready facilities distributed along the main axes of the Gas System.\n\nThis plan foresees the electrification of 14 turbocompressors in the 2023-2031 period. In 2023, the first two electric engines have been deployed, with more to follow in subsequent years until the plan is completed in 2031.\n\nOnce the maximum technically possible reduction has been achieved at the facility level, with the above measures and those included annually in the Enagás Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan, the subsequent neutralisation and compensation of residual emissions will be addressed. For this, carbon capture and storage solutions are being studied, as well as alternatives to reach carbon neutrality in the points where the previous options are not possible and/or profitable (offsetting - reforestation).\n\n## Decarbonisation of our value chain\n\nTo achieve the scope 3 emission reduction targets, namely 25% reduction by 2030 and 50% reduction by 2040 as compared to 2021, Enagás is working to:\n\n- Essentially, in the adaptation of existing infrastructure and the development of new infrastructure for renewable gases. In addition, through its subsidiary Enagás Renovable, it promotes renewable gas production projects (see subsection '[Renewable](#page-25-0)  [gases](#page-25-0)' in this chapter).\n- Promoting new uses for natural gas in mobility, mainly in maritime and rail transport (see the '[Sustainable Mobility](#page-30-0)' sub-section in this chapter).\n- Collaboration with the company's affiliates (see the '[Affiliates](#page-142-0)' section in the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter), supply chain (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)' section in the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter) and companies and sectoral associations in the field of decarbonisation (see the ['](#page-60-0)[Climate action and energy](#page-60-0)  [efficiency](#page-60-0)' section of the '[Environmental, Social and Governance](#page-53-0)  [\\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).

These axes reinforce Europe's renewable energy and energy efficiency while allowing new infrastructure developments to be driven forward to integrate EU markets.\n\nSpain occupies a privileged position thanks to its geographical location and its consolidated network of infrastructures and international connections. It is poised to become a leading country for the production and export of non-electrical renewable energies (hydrogen and biomethane), indispensable energy carriers that contribute to the development of a circular economy and to the energy transition process, as they enable progress towards a carbonneutral economy.\n\nRenewable hydrogen, which is obtained from electrical renewable energy, is an energy carrier for the future and a key solution for storing renewable energy. It also has multiple applications, as it can be used in all energy sectors (industry, mobility, domesticcommercial and electricity generation).\n\nBiogas obtained from waste is a source of renewable, local and storable energy, with a positive impact on employment and the rural economy. After a process of cleaning and CO2, separation, the biogas transforms into biomethane: a totally renewable gas, of equivalent quality to natural gas, that can be injected into the transmission network.\n\nAt Enagás, we want to actively contribute to the energy transition process, promoting the integration of renewable gases in the Spanish and European Gas System.\n\nSee Enagás' explanatory videos on **[Biogas](https://youtu.be/AMMLKHCJxfM?feature=shared)** and **[Renewable](https://youtu.be/HicKLqqSOvY?feature=shared)  [hydrogen](https://youtu.be/HicKLqqSOvY?feature=shared)**.\n\nImage /page/25/Figure/16 description: The image shows a circular diagram illustrating the concept of a circular economy. In the center of the diagram is a gray circle with the words \"CIRCULAR ECONOMY\" written in white. Surrounding the central circle are four segments, each representing a stage in the circular economy process. Starting from the top and moving clockwise, the segments are: \"Waste generated\" connected by a blue arrow to \"Anaerobic decomposition\", then \"Biogas\" connected by a blue arrow to \"Upgrading\", then \"Biomethane\" connected by a green arrow to a list of three items: \"Injection into pipelines\", \"Fuel for vehicles\", and \"Industry\", connected by a yellow arrow back to \"Waste generated\", completing the cycle.\n\n**Enagás is working towards the integration of a European energy system through infrastructures, the promotion of a future hydrogen network in Europe and the creation of a market for renewable gases** \n\nImage /page/25/Figure/18 description: The image shows a diagram of hydrogen production and use. Electrical energy from renewable sources is used to produce hydrogen (H2). The hydrogen can then be used for direct use, injection into pipelines, mobility, power generation, industry, and tertiary/domestic use.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/26/Figure/0 description: This image shows a timeline of renewable hydrogen infrastructures. The timeline starts in January and ends in December. The two most important milestones for renewable hydrogen infrastructure in 2023 are described below. [GRI 201-2, GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2]. January 19: First Enagás Hydrogen Day. January 24: Launch of the Guarantees of Origin platform for renewable gases. June 28: Update of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC). September 14: Launch of the Call for Interest process. October 18: H2med presentation in Berlin. November 28: European Projects of Common Interest (PCI) List: inclusion of H2med. December 8: European H₂ and Decarbonised Gas Regulation agreement. December 27: Royal Decree-Law 8/2023 of December 27: Enagás, interim operator.\n\nIn fact, Enagás is one of the 31 European gas infrastructure operators driving the European Hydrogen Backbone for the development of a dedicated hydrogen transmission infrastructure.\n\nAs a leading TSO in Europe, Enagás can and must be a key player in the decarbonisation process and contribute its experience and knowledge to the adaptation of existing infrastructures and the\n\nEnagás, interim operator of the hydrogen\n\nbackbone network\n\ndevelopment of new ones.\n\n**and Spanish H<sup>2</sup> Infrastructure 2030 H2 and Decarbonised Gas Directive agreement** \n\nIn line with this purpose, in April 2022, Enagás set up the subsidiary 'Enagás Infraestructuras de Hidrógeno' (Enagás Hydrogen Infrastructures), through which the company is spinning off its functions as a natural gas infrastructure operator (TSO) for the possible future management of hydrogen infrastructures. Its objective is the development, construction and operation of infrastructures to meet the need for hydrogen transmission and storage, in line with national and European legislation, plans and roadmaps.\n\nOn December 28, 2023, Royal Decree-Law 8/2023 of December 27 was published in the Official State Gazette (BOE), providing that Enagás, as manager of the natural gas<sup>4</sup> transmission network, may operate as provisional manager of the hydrogen backbone network, enabling it to:\n\n• Submit to the Directorate General of Energy Policy and Mines, within four months, a non-binding proposal for the development of the hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon (April 29).\n\n• Act as representatives in the creation of the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH).\n\nof the hydrogen backbone network\n\n• To be able to exercise the functions of hydrogen backbone development within the sphere of European Projects of Common Interest (PCI), on a provisional basis, through horizontally separate legal entities.\n\nThis provisional regime will apply until the definitive designation of the Hydrogen Network Operators in accordance with the conditions established in the applicable European regulations.\n\n### H2med and the Spanish Backbone Network, included on the European Commission's PCI list\n\nIn November 2023, the European Commission adopted the Delegated Act on Projects of Common Interest (PCI). This includes the H2med corridor, the first axes of the associated Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network and two underground hydrogen storage facilities.

Following this initial push, the TSOs of Portugal, Spain, France and Germany presented the project at an event in Berlin on October 18, where the support of the governments of these four countries and that of the European Commission was ratified, as well as that of industry and the main sector players in Germany.\n\nThe H2med corridor consists of a connection between Celorico da Beira in Portugal and Zamora in Spain (CelZa) and a maritime\n\nconnection between Barcelona and Marseille (BarMar). With a planned combined investment of around 2.5 billion euros, CelZa will\n\nhave a maximum capacity of 0.75 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen, a length of 248 km and a 24.6 MW compressor station in Zamora. BarMar will have a maximum capacity of 2 million tonnes, a length of 455 km and a 140 MW compressor station in Barcelona.\n\nImage /page/27/Figure/11 description: This image shows a map of the European Vision of Hydrogen Network 2030. The map includes the Spanish hydrogen infrastructure 2030, which is presented to the PCI, and underground storage facilities. The map also includes the following locations: H2Med-CelZa, Portuguese Hydrogen Backbone, DHUNE, MosaHyc, WHHYN, Connection to main demand centers in Germany, HY-FEN, RHYn, HySoW, Hynframed, H2Med-BarMar, and H2ercules Network South.\n\nThe first sections of the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network presented as PCI are the Vía de la Plata axis with its connection to the Puertollano Hydrogen Valley - totalling a planned length of approximately 1,250 km - and the axis that includes the Cantabrian Coast, Ebro Valley and Levante axes, which are around 1,500 km in total and the Guitiriz-Zamora axis. Also included are two underground hydrogen storage facilities in Cantabria and the Basque Country, located in new salt cavities, with a planned capacity of 335 and 240 GWh, respectively.\n\nThe inclusion of the H2med corridor, the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network and the two underground hydrogen storage facilities on the list of PCIs - once it passes the European Parliament and Council - will help to advance the fulfilment of the RePowerEU Plan to achieve the European and Spanish objectives of energy independence, industrial competitiveness and decarbonisation.\n\n### **Estimated investments**\n\nThe Spanish hydrogen infrastructure submitted as a PCI would involve a total gross investment of 4.9 billion euros. Spain's total gross investment in H2med will be around 1 billion euros. These investments will be finalised in accordance with the binding planning to be defined by the Spanish Government.\n\n#### **Socio-economic impact of renewable hydrogen infrastructures**\n\nThe construction and subsequent operation of these infrastructures will generate a significant positive impact on the Spanish economy and society.\n\nIn terms of GDP, the construction and operation of H2med and the Spanish Backbone Network would generate an impact of up to 4.8 billion euros. Likewise, construction alone would have an impact on employment equivalent to 3.7% of the net jobs\n\n[GRI 201-2, GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2]\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/28/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light gray font.

This process also included public consultation on ammonia, oxygen and CO2.\n\nThe process, which has been audited and verified by Bureau Veritas, had the support and participation of key actors in the sector, with more than 200 companies (producers, consumers and/or shippers) and 650 registered projects.\n\nThe main objective of the process was to contrast the theoretical analysis carried out at the end of 2022 with real market information, so that the preliminary infrastructure proposal presented at the first Enagás Hydrogen Day could be adapted based on the real needs found.\n\nTaking into account the information received, the identified domestic demand (≈ 1.3 Mt in 2030) would be in line with that indicated on First Enagás Hydrogen Day, far exceeding the 500-600,000 t/y of current grey hydrogen consumption. This indicates new uses for green hydrogen.\n\nMoreover, the production capacity identified (more than double the potential announced on First Enagás Hydrogen Day) is more than sufficient both to meet domestic demand and to enable export by H2med and carriers. Spain is thus positioned as a major producer of green hydrogen with the capacity to export to other countries and with a key role in achieving the European consumption target of 20 million tonnes of hydrogen in 2030 established in REPowerEU, of which 10 million tonnes would be produced in Europe.\n\nThe matching of supply and demand identified in this Call for Interest process confirms the infrastructures proposed in the First Enagás Hydrogen Day and submitted to the European Commission's call for PCIs: the Cantabrian Coast Axis, Ebro Valley Axis, Levante Axis, Vía de la Plata Axis (with its connection to the Puertollano Hydrogen Valley), the Guitiriz-Zamora Axis, and two underground hydrogen storage facilities in Cantabria and the Basque Country.\n\n## **The matching of supply and demand identified in the Call for Interest process backs up the infrastructures submitted to the European Commission's call for PCI proposal**\n\nThe results have also made it possible to identify new areas for demand and production aggregation; these will be assessed based on the real needs found.\n\nLikewise, the key role that storage facilities must play in order to guarantee proper system operation and demand coverage continues to be highlighted. This is why work continues on identifying possible geological structures that allow for the seasonal underground storage of this new energy carrier and on developing a roadmap to ensure that these infrastructures are viable.\n\n#### **Results regarding ammonia and CO<sup>2</sup>**\n\nThe Call For Interest has also noted industry interest in producing more than 5 Mt/y of ammonia (NH3), which implies an approximate consumption of 0.9 Mt/y of hydrogen. In addition, 41 companies have expressed interest in the use of infrastructure to transport about 4 Mt/y of ammonia.\n\nLikewise, the data obtained show that a total of 37 companies are interested in CO2 capture (it is estimated that they are interested in capturing 10.4 Mt/y), and 53 in having infrastructures for its transport and storage.\n\n## Management of the system of guarantees of origin of renewable gases\n\nEnagás GTS, as the responsible entity designated by the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, has launched the new System of Guarantees of Origin of gas from renewable sources. In compliance with the milestones established by the Spanish Government in applicable regulations, the system already allows for the certification of biogas, biomethane and hydrogen produced in Spain as being of renewable origin, providing information on how and where it was produced.\n\nFurthermore, also in compliance with regulatory provisions, Enagás GTS has set up a Committee of Subjects of the Guarantees of Origin System. The aim of this committee is to know and be informed of the functioning and management of the System of Guarantees of Origin, as well as to elaborate and provide a channel for improvement proposals.\n\nIn the first year of operation of the System of Guarantees of Origin, a total of 129 entities - including producers, suppliers and intermediaries - have registered and are now able to issue, transfer and redeem Guarantees of Origin. Likewise, 33 production facilities have completed their registration with the system, 13 of them definitively (already in operation with access to issue Guarantees of Origin) and 20 provisionally (not yet operational).

Its main objective is to drive decarbonisation through technology, digitalisation and innovation. This roadmap, supported by the company's Strategic and Transformation Plans, is led by the Innovation and Corporate Venture Department and is built around five fundamental goals:\n\n- Test and incorporate disruptive technologies and develop new adjacent businesses. To this end, Enagás created the Corporate Entrepreneurship and Open Innovation initiative 'Enagás Emprende', which is structured along the following lines:\n\t- **Corporate entrepreneurship/Venture Building:** development of business projects and ideas based on Enagás' technical, economic and market-related skills.\n\t- **Venture Capital:** investment and support of start-ups, both directly and through investment funds.\n\t- **Open Innovation:** incorporation of projects and technologies supported by capabilities external to Enagás, through origination tools, the entrepreneurial ecosystem, innovation radar and prospecting reports, among other strategies.\n\n'Enagás Emprende' studies and analyses each proposal individually and offers incubation and acceleration programmes tailored to the needs of each project. These can include financial resources, technical pilots, co-development, support in commercial development, or other forms of support.\n\n- Maximise the capture of value from the energy transition investment funds in which Enagás holds a stake, in the form of knowledge and financial returns.\n- Adapt the Enagás Emprende start-up portfolio strategy to the nine priorities of the company's Strategic Plan. This new strategy calls for an update of the investment thesis, geographical focus and target portfolio.\n- Foster public-private collaboration and strategic alliances for the effective development of innovative collaborative projects and optimise their funding pull.\n- Commit to Corporate Innovation and develop innovative and entrepreneurial culture and talent.\n\nEnagás Emprende also promotes and coordinates cross-cutting projects to transform the company in key areas through innovation, such as the Flagship Projects (alliances between several organisations with the aim of promoting new technologies in an area of common interest using open innovation tools and public funding for innovation).\n\n#### 09/2023\n\n**Enagás is once again launching its Ingenia Energy Challenge, an open call for disruptive solutions that contribute to the energy transition.** \n\n**Under the slogan 'Come ride the innovation wave of the energy transition', this year, Enagás is encouraging the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem to participate; the challenge is open to the public, both internal and external. The aim is not only to accelerate technology transfer from universities and laboratories to the market for the reindustrialisation and development of relevant areas, but also to add a new award to boost the visibility of women entrepreneurs.** \n\nImage /page/49/Figure/23 description: The image is a circular diagram illustrating areas of interest.

The Sustainability Committee, made up of members of the Executive Committee, reports to this committee and is responsible for approving initiatives in this matter (by delegation from the Sustainability and Appointments Committee). Both bodies meet at least twice a year.\n\nAt executive level, the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for managing the company's business, and is responsible for driving the company forward and the ongoing coordination of its activities.\n\nUnder the umbrella of the Chief Executive Officer and as a general rule, the Finance Department is responsible for managing financial matters, while the Energy Transition General Management handles climate and environmental matters, and the People and Transformation General Management, social matters.\n\nSee the **[Sustainability and Good Governance Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Sustainability%20and%20good%20governance%20policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n## Sustainable Management Model\n\nImage /page/54/Figure/15 description: The image shows a diagram of a sustainable management plan. The diagram is divided into three sections: Governance Model, Assessment Tools, and Sustainable Management Plan. The Governance Model section lists the involvement of senior management, including the Sustainability and Appointments Committee, the Sustainability Committee, and working groups. It also mentions setting targets linked to variable remuneration. The Assessment Tools section lists ISO Standards for Quality, Health and Safety, Environment, Energy Efficiency, Waste, and Carbon Footprint. It also mentions sustainability indices and rating agency assessments (DJSI) and commitment and relations with stakeholders. The Sustainable Management Plan section includes environmental aspects, governance aspects, and social dimensions. The diagram also includes the phrases \"Involvement of senior management\", \"Innovation and continuous improvement\", \"Performance report\", and \"Improvements identified\".\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[Management](#page-53-0)**\n\nEnvironmental, Social Risk **[and Governance](#page-53-0)**  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/55/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" stacked on top of each other.\n\n![enagas](https://i.imgur.com/9999999.png)\n\n## Commitment to stakeholders\n\nOur commitment to stakeholders is reflected in the company's Sustainability and Good Governance Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, which includes, among other commitments, the establishment of procedures for relationships, dialogue and participation with the local environment that facilitate Enagás' social acceptance and integration in the communities where it operates (see the ['](#page-133-0)[Local communities](#page-133-0)[' section in this chapter\\) and a](#page-133-0)  [commitment to report regularly, transparently, in a timely and](#page-133-0)  [reliable manner to the various stakeholders.

Every year, internal supervisors at Enagás review these groups and their segmentation, the relationship channels with each of them, according to the company's strategy and organisational model. By this means, the stakeholder relationship model is defined: [GRI 2-29, GRI 3-1, GRI 207-3]\n\n## **Our commitment to stakeholders is reflected in the company's Sustainability and Good Governance

The perspective adopted is that of \"dual materiality\", i.e., the impact on the value of the company and the impact on the environment of each material topic.\n\nThe materiality analysis is based on the company's activities, the strategy and operating context, as well as on the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. All this with a focus on the short, medium and long term, taking into account both own operations and the value chain, and in a manner consistent with the company's risk analysis.\n\nIn addition, Enagás reinforces this dual materiality perspective with reporting based on the GRI standard, to cover the impact on the environment (impact materiality), and with reporting based on the SASB and TCFD standards, to cover the impact of the environment on the company's financial value (financial materiality). See the '[About our Consolidated Management](#page-169-0)  [Report](#page-169-0)' appendix.\n\n#### **Material topics in the Enagás value chain**\n\nIn line with the 2030 Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Strategy, Enagás updated its material topics in the Governance, Social and Environmental dimensions and their prioritisation in the materiality matrix shown in the following section.\n\nIn this way, the human rights issue is highlighted as a specific material topic, as it is an essential part of sustainability due diligence. This issue was already included in the areas of Ethics and Compliance, People (labour rights), Local communities (rights of communities), Health and Safety and Management of natural capital and biodiversity (right to use natural resources) (see the '[Human](#page-138-0)  [rights](#page-138-0)' section in this chapter).\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/15 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white outline of an energy efficiency label inside.

This update takes into account dual materiality, i.e., the impact on the value of the company and the impact on the environment of each material topic. This is the case of the update carried out as a result of the 2030 Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Strategy, which took into account the relevance that investors, through the main\n\nsustainability indices and rating agencies, and the regulator, through sustainability regulations, give to the different aspects of environmental, social and governance issues. The result is the variation in the prioritisation of the following material topics as follows:\n\n- Decarbonisation as the focus of the strategic plan and the increased need to accelerate decarbonisation imply an increased importance both for stakeholders and for Enagás.\n- People are considered a fundamental axis for achieving the objectives set out in the new strategy. Therefore, the importance of the material topic of \"people\" has been increased for Enagás.\n- The importance for stakeholders and, to a lesser extent, for Enagás, of the due diligence in the value chain (affiliates and supply chain) is increased.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) Environmental, Social Risk **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/58/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left side of the image.

The level of importance for stakeholders would be equivalent to that of climate action, although somewhat lower, and for Enagás it would be at a level equivalent to that of value chain issues. [GRI 3-1, GRI 3-2]\n- Updating of the relevant issues for each of the material topics on the basis of the feedback received from our stakeholders through the channels indicated above. The result of this update can be\n\nseen in the topics included in the following sub-sections of this chapter corresponding to material topics. An example of a revision is the publication in 2021 of the GRI sector standard GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021. This allowed us to confirm that the relevant issues were those that the company had been reporting and additional issues have been included to complement what has already been reported (see the '[GRI Content Index](#page-185-0)', section in the '[Appendices](#page-168-0)' chapter). [GRI 3-1]\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/10 description: The image shows a materiality matrix for Enagás. The matrix has two axes: \"Level of Importance to Enagás\" on the y-axis and \"Level of Importance\" on the x-axis. The top right quadrant of the matrix contains several icons, including people, a building, a stethoscope, a leaf, a handshake, a puzzle piece, and a recycling symbol. An arrow points from this quadrant to another matrix. In the second matrix, the top right quadrant contains icons of people and a building, while the bottom right quadrant contains icons of a lightbulb and a recycling symbol.\n\n#### Enagás materiality matrix [GRI 3-2]\n\nDirect operations Value chain\n\nImage /page/58/Picture/13 description: The image is a green circle with a white outline of a building with a triangular roof supported by three columns.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a green circle that is open at the bottom.\n\nInternal control over non-financial reporting system\n\nEnagás has implemented an internal control system over nonfinancial information that reinforces the reliability of this information, equivalent to the internal control system over financial reporting (see Appendix 'Audit Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (\"ICFR\")' of the '[Annual Corporate Governance Report](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)'). This system covers the company's areas of sustainability (environmental, social and governance) through the most representative indicators of material topics.\n\nSince its implementation, Enagás carries out a yearly review with a focus on continuous improvement of this internal control system, increasing its scope and improving the traceability of the associated databases. Furthermore, each year this internal control system for non-financial information is externally reviewed by EY through an agreed-upon procedures report.\n\nIn 2023, the scope of the internal control system over non-financial reporting included the following indicators:\n\n| Material topic                              | Indicators                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Good Governance                             | The Council's abilities and experience assessment process                                                                                                                             |\n| Good Governance                             | Board remuneration                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Good Governance                             | Executive Committee remuneration                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Ethics and integrity                        | Communications received via the whistleblowing line                                                                                                                                   |\n| Ethics and integrity                        | Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions                                                                                                                                               |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (categories 4, 9 and 11 according to GHG Protocol)                                                                                                   |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Energy consumption (self-consumption of natural gas)                                                                                                                                  |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Taxonomic CapEx of activities significantly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives (eligible and aligned activity and eligible and non-aligned activity) |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Taxonomic OpEx of activities contributing significantly to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives (eligible and aligned activity and eligible and non-aligned activity)  |\n| Natural capital and biodiversity management | Biodiversity (area restored/revegetated)                                                                                                                                              |\n| Natural capital and biodiversity management | Volume of waste generated and managed                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Natural capital and biodiversity management | Water capture, consumption and discharge                                                                                                                                              |\n| People                                      | Diversity -

In this regard, the ratios for each type of facility are included below, as well as the overall ratio of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions with respect to the sum of compressed, injected and regasified gas.\n\n#### Emissions by type of installation\n\n|                                                                                                                                                | 2021    | 2022    | 2023    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Emissions at compressor<br>stations with respect to<br>compressed gas at compressor<br>stations (tonnes of CO2e at<br>compressor stations/TWh) | 934.1   | 843.8   | 870.2   |\n| Emissions in storage facilities<br>with respect to gas injected into<br>storage facilities (tonnes of CO2e<br>in storage facilities/TWh)       | 4,566.9 | 4,762.3 | 5,095.2 |\n| Emissions at LNG terminals<br>with respect to gas regasified<br>at LNG terminals (tonnes of<br>CO2e at LNG terminals/TWh)                      | 0.0     | 0.0     | 0.0     |\n| Total emissions with respect<br>to total compressed, injected<br>and regasified gas (tonnes of<br>CO2e/TWh)                                    | 855.5   | 773.30  | 780.7   |\n\nThe emissions intensity indicator calculated with respect to net profit (860 tonnes of CO2e/million euros in 2023 and 1,683 tonnes of CO2e/million euros in 2022)<sup>12</sup>, despite being a standard and widely used indicator, does not represent the most accurate unit for measuring our environmental performance, as 97.5% of our revenues come from regulated activities and the current regulatory framework (see the '[2030 Strategic Plan](#page-19-0)' section in the '[Strategy](#page-17-0)' chapter) establishes a methodology to determine such revenues. It does not include concepts related to the level of use of gas infrastructures, which is the parameter to which environmental impacts are related.\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/9 description: The image shows the title \"Scope 1 and 2 emissions by type of facility in 2023\" followed by the text \"[GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2]\".\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/10 description: The image is a pie chart with the following data:\nCompressor stations: 73.8%\nUnderground storage facilities: 12.5%\nRegulation and metering stations: 6.3%\nGas pipeline: 4.5%\n2.2%\n0.8%\n\nGas pipeline LNG terminal Offices, transport depots and vehicle fleet\n\n#### Scope 1 and 2 emissions by source in 2023 [GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2]\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/13 description: This image is a donut chart with the following percentages: 72.0%, 10.3%, 6.4%, 5.1%, 3.6%, and 2.6%.\n\nTurbo-compressors\n\n- Venting in normal operations/incident\n- Process boilers\n- Fugitive emissions\n- Others Compressor seal vents\n\nAt a facility level, 73.8% of emissions are concentrated at compressor stations, followed by underground storage facilities, which account for 12.5%. In terms of emission sources, 72% of the total emission footprint (Scope 1 and 2) is generated by the self-consumption of natural gas in turbocompressors at compressor stations and underground storage facilities. In this regard, Enagás has an ambitious turbocompressor electrification plan to progressively replace natural gas compressors with electric compressors, thereby reducing emissions and helping to achieve the targets set out in the decarbonisation pathway (see the '[Decarbonisation and carbon neutrality](#page-23-0)' chapter).\n\n<sup>12</sup> To calculate the intensity indicator, the adjusted net profit has been used without considering the result of investments accounted for by the equity method. In 2023, the net profit after tax was 342.5 million euros.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |  |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|--|\n| 2023          |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                |            |                                 |  |\n\n#### Infrastructure activity data [GRI 302-2]\n\n|                                   |                                                            | Unit | 2022    | 2023    | 2023 vs. 2022 (%) |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| LNG terminals                     | Regasified gas, tank and ship loading at LNG terminals     | GWh  | 171,640 | 138,870 | -19%              |\n| Compressor stations               | Compressed gas at Compressor stations                      | GWh  | 346,451 | 260,424 | -25%              |\n| Underground storage<br>facilities | Total net injection underground storage facilities         | GWh  | 14,130  | 7,009   | -50%              |\n|                                   | Total gross withdrawal from underground storage facilities | GWh  | 3,901   | 8,194   | +110%             |\n\n#### Scope 1 and 2 emissions by gas type in 2023\n\n[GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2]\n\nemissions\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/5 description: This image is a pie chart showing the composition of something. CO2 makes up 81.0%, CH4 makes up 18.8%, and HFCs makes up 0.2%.\n\n#### Change in methane emissions (tonnes of  $CH$ <sup>4</sup>)\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/7 description: The image is a bar graph comparing fugitive and venting emissions from 2015 to 2023. The y-axis represents the amount of emissions, and the x-axis represents the year. In 2015, the total emissions were 3,440. In 2019, the total emissions were 2,461. In 2020, the total emissions were 2,291. In 2021, the total emissions were 1,097. In 2022, the total emissions were 2,413. In 2023, the total emissions were 1,985. There is a blue arrow going from left to right with the text '-42%'.\n\n81% of Enagás' carbon footprint (scopes 1 and 2) corresponds to  $CO$ <sup>2</sup> emissions, generated mainly during the combustion of natural gas in stationary sources, i.e. turbocompressors, boilers, flares, etc.\n\nMethane emissions, which account for 18.8% of the footprint (scopes 1 and 2), are mainly due to natural gas venting (73%) and fugitive emissions (27%). Venting may occur as a result of operation and maintenance, operating safety, pneumatic valves and analysis equipment such as chromatographs. For their part, fugitive emissions correspond to uncontrolled gas leaks in the equipment\n\n(flanges, connectors, etc.). The latter have decreased by 7% compared to the previous year. With regard to gas losses, in 2023 they represented 0.010% and 0.033% in transmission and storage activities respectively.\n\nGlobally, emissions of this gas ( $CH$ <sup>4</sup>) have decreased by 18% compared to 2022, mainly due to:\n\n- Improved data recording on venting at LNG terminals and underground storage facilities and during transmission thanks to the development of a computer application that improves data collection and consolidation.\n- Improvements in the quantification methodology, incorporating the guidelines that are being developed at the international level.\n- Improvements to incident detection, quantification and reporting.\n\nEnagás' adherence to the methane emissions reporting framework of the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP2.0), together with significant efforts to reduce the uncertainty of this data, entail a constant review of our quantification methodology. In this regard, the Enagás Implementation Plan for maintaining the Gold Standard involves the review of all our methane sources and, therefore, the possibility of incorporating possible new sources in the coming years. In addition, various measurements have been carried out with new technologies that allow data reconciliation. This comprehensive review may be extended until 2024, by which time Enagás expects to achieve the highest data quality in line with OGMP commitments and deadlines (see the '[Methane emissions reduction](#page-70-0)' sub-section in this section).\n\n#### EU Emissions Trading System\n\n70% of emissions included in the Carbon Footprint (scopes 1 and 2) are included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).\n\nIn 2023, 50,881 emission allowances were received through free allocation and 274,000 emission allowances were purchased to cover the period's emission rights needs. [GRI 201-2]\n\n## Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan\n\nAt Enagás, energy efficiency plays a key role in emissions reduction and considerable efforts have been made in this regard. In recent years, starting in 2014, we reduced by 48% our  $CO$ <sup>2</sup> emissions thanks to the implementation of energy efficiency measures, in which we have invested around 96 million euros since 2008. [GRI 201-2]\n\nDuring the 2015-2023 period, the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan has enabled the avoidance of 1,002,990 tonnes of CO2e.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n**Annual Report** [Consolidated](#page-3-0) [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/68/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts' on the left side of the image.\n\nThese emissions include the accumulated emissions prevented as a result of the measures of the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan implemented from 2015 to 2023.\n\nWe are working to ensure the continuous improvement of the energy efficiency of our infrastructures. As such, we have an\n\nenergy management system certified according to the ISO 50001 standard that allows us to identify opportunities to improve the energy performance of our facilities and to evaluate progress in the reduction of energy consumption.

origin over total electricity consumption from the grid was 100% in all facilities. In other words, all electricity consumed by Enagás has a zero emission factor.\n\nIn 2023, own electricity generation from renewable, clean or efficient sources reached 21 GWh, representing 9.1% of total electricity consumption. Part of the energy generated is delivered to the national grid and another part is consumed at Enagás' own facilities. The energy sent back to the grid (11.7 GWh) helps reduce 3,212 tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> for third parties, contributes to reducing the national electricity mix factor and reinforces the principles of the circular economy, whereby Enagás' surplus electricity is used by third parties, thereby reducing their carbon footprint (see the '[Circular economy'](#page-106-0), sub-section in the '[Natural and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section).\n\n#### Energy consumption by source (GWh/y) [GRI 302-1]\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/11 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the consumption of natural gas, diesel, petrol, and electricity in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2021, the consumption of natural gas was 1,099.5, diesel was 11.1, petrol was 0.7, and electricity was 197.3. In 2022, the consumption of natural gas was 1,765.9, diesel was 9, petrol was 1.4, and electricity was 250.5.

These measures include:\n\n- Detection, quantification and repair of fugitive emission points covering all our facilities, which enabled us to avoid the emission of 10,155 tonnes of CO2e in 2023.\n- Implementation of a vented gas recovery system at the Lumbier Compressor Station, which will lead to reductions of approximately 3,500 tonnes of CO2e per year.\n- Continued replacement of pneumatic actuators with electric actuators in the transmission network, which has prevented the emission of almost 210 tonnes of CO2e into the atmosphere.\n- Continued recovery of part of the compressor venting from the LNG terminals, which has prevented the emission of approximately 112 tonnes of CO2e.\n\nIn addition, the company continues to make progress in reducing the uncertainty of methane emissions data under the OGMP2.0 (Oil and Gas Methane Partnership) initiative, to which it adheres. This is an initiative for the reporting of methane emissions in line with the European Union Methane Emission Reduction Strategy. In 2023 Enagás obtained the \"Gold Standard\" seal, which recognises the company's commitment to reducing methane emissions, as well as the company's plan to improve the reliability of methane data both for the assets over which Enagás has operational control and for its affiliates.\n\n#### 10/2023\n\nImage /page/70/Picture/16 description: The image shows the logo for the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0. The logo consists of a stylized globe on the left and the letters \"GMP\" on the right. The text \"Oil And Gas Methane Partnership 2.0\" is below the globe.\n\n **The International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) has recognised Enagás with the highest rating, 'Gold Standard', for the third consecutive year, highlighting its methane emissions plan as one of the most robust and detailed in the framework of 'The Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0' (OGMP 2.0).** \n\nIn this area, Enagás has carried out several actions applying continuous technological improvement, among which the following are noteworthy:\n\n- Measurements with different top-down technologies (DIAL, Differential Absorption Lidar, from a truck and the GASTRAQ methodology from a drone) for subsequent reconciliation with Enagás inventory data. These measurements allow Enagás to compare localised emissions with bottom-up inspections, draw lessons learned in order to continue making further progress on mitigating these emissions in the framework of the OGMP2.0 reporting.\n- Development and continuous improvement of a digital application to record venting and fugitive emissions in the\n\ntransmission network. In 2023, this application allowed for the more detailed monitoring of venting at LNG terminals and underground storage facilities and during transmission and to obtain the information broken down in accordance with the OGMP2.0 reporting framework.\n\n- Leadership in the research project promoted by GERG (European Gas Research Group). Enagás coordinated and led a pioneering global innovation project to provide guidelines on how reconciliation should be carried out at source and site level. After testing the performance of 12 cutting-edge technologies (nine top-down and three bottom-up), in order to assess their accuracy and reliability for methane emissions quantification, a first reconciliation pilot project was carried out, including testing of technologies at a site and source level at an operating compressor station in Belgium and a subsequent reconciliation analysis. Recommendations for operators are currently being finalised.\n- In 2023, Enagás and SATLANTIS continued the calibration tests of high-precision optics in two compressor stations, which will be inserted in a constellation of space microsatellites, called GEISAT (Greenhouse Gases), to detect and quantify methane emissions on Earth.\n\n#### 09/2023\n\n**The journal Atmospheric Measurement Techniques has published an article with the results of a European project led by the company within the GERG (European Gas Research Group) for the quantification and subsequent mitigation of methane emissions.** \n\n**This project aimed to identify how to improve the knowledge and use of new technologies to quantify and reduce methane emissions in midstream infrastructures.** \n\nThe company also maintained its high level of collaboration with regulators and international organisations, with the following actions being of particular note in 2023: [GRI S11.2.4]\n\n- Participation in CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) working groups to develop standards applicable to the future European Regulation on methane emissions reduction. Participation in specific LDAR (Leak Detection and Repair), quantification, venting and flaring groups.\n- Active participation in various European Commission consultations on the legislative development roadmap, dealing with the content and monitoring, reporting and verification of methane emissions.\n- Collaboration in the preparation of OGMP technical guidelines via comment submission.\n- Participation in MARCOGAZ technical recommendations: 'Workshop on a regulatory approach on leak detection and repair of methane emissions in the oil and gas sectors', and 'Mitigating methane emissions: the role of the gas sector'.

This compensation was carried out with avoided-deforestation projects in Peru and a reforestation project in Spain.\n\nIn addition, Enagás participates in the largest reforestation project in Spain, Motor Verde, developed by Repsol and Sylvestris, with which it will offset part of its residual emissions in the future.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions [GRI 305-3]\n\nIn addition to its activity chain's impact on emissions, Enagás includes the impact of the gas transported by the company in the natural gas value chain in its Scope 3 emissions. In this regard, it is important to note that the gas that Enagás transports through its infrastructures is not owned by the company; for this reason, the company includes in its Scope 3 emissions only the activities associated with the service it provides to its customers (gas transmission through company infrastructure), without including those associated with the product transported (natural gas), which include activities associated with conventional gas demand (domestic, commercial and institutional), among others.\n\nThe operating context of 2023, marked by the energy crisis (see the '[New energy paradigm](#page-17-0)' section in the Strategy chapter), has not only had an impact on Enagás' Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also on its Scope 3 emissions. In this regard, there was a decrease in emissions from upstream transmission and distribution, specifically emissions from ships transporting natural gas arriving at Enagás' facilities. In 2023, the number of ship unloadings decreased by 44% compared to 2022, decreasing the associated emissions by 42%. Enagás sold some of its shareholdings in 2022, such as the GNL Quintero LNG terminal in Chile, the Morelos pipeline and Compañía Operadora de Gas del Amazonas (COGA) in Peru.\n\n#### Scope 3 emissions classification in 2023 [GRI 305-3]\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/21 description: This image is a donut chart with six categories.

This is due to the nature of our business, as Enagás does not own or sell natural gas, and therefore we consider distribution companies to be end customers of our services, and their emissions to be the final ones linked to the natural gas we transport.\n\n(2) This category is not applicable to Enagás as we do not operate any upstream or downstream leased assets.\n\n(3) These categories are not applicable to Enagás as our activity is limited to the transmission of natural gas, classified within the midstream segment. Enagás is not the owner of the gas at any stage of the value chain and is not responsible for emissions related to the end-of-life treatment of products or the processing of products for sale.

Does not include Tallgrass Energy emissions due to lack of data.\n\n(5) This category is not applicable to Enagás because the company does not have franchises.\n\n(6) In addition to the emission factors used in the calculation of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, the following emission factors have been considered for the calculation of Scope 3 emissions:\n\n• Maritime transport: DEFRA, Page Fuels, Maritime Oil. 2023. version 1.\n\n• Air transport: Aviation: COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2018/2066 of December 19, 2018, on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 [\\(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R2066) [legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R2066](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R2066)).

The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a blue sans-serif font, with a green circle above it. The circle is not fully closed, with a gap at the bottom.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nEnagás has reviewed the indirect emissions relevance analysis according to the criteria set out by the ISO 14064 standard, namely: volume of emissions in each category with respect to the total, level of influence, access to information, data accuracy and relevance. As a result of the significance analysis, the categories corresponding to upstream transmission and distribution of goods, downstream transmission and distribution, purchased goods, investments and fuel and energy related activities not included in scope 1 and scope 2 have been classified as relevant. It should be noted that, although only five categories were identified as significant, Enagás is aware of the importance of emissions linked to the value chain and reports all categories in a bid for transparency.\n\n#### Reduction of Scope 3 emissions [GRI 305-3]\n\nEnagás addresses the reduction of Scope 3 emissions throughout its value chain, especially those included in the company's carbon footprint, through the following actions:\n\n• Development of renewable gases. Enagás is strengthening its participation in the development of renewable gas projects (renewable hydrogen) that will allow for their progressive incorporation into the energy model (see the '[Renewable Gases](#page-25-0)['](#page-25-0)) sub-section) for the decarbonisation of the entire natural gas value chain.\n\n- Promotion of the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in mobility (maritime transport) (see the '[Sustainable Mobility](#page-30-0)' sub-section).\n- Collaboration with industry and associations on decarbonisation (see the '[Reduction of methane emissions](#page-70-0)' sub-section in this section). Promotion of decarbonisation at Enagás affiliates: emissions reduction and energy efficiency measures are among the critical management standards that Enagás extends to its affiliates (see the ['](#page-142-0)[Affiliates](#page-142-0)['](#page-142-0) section). In addition, a climate action due diligence analysis has been performed on all our affiliates, which has allowed us to verify the progress of the companies in terms of setting emission reduction targets, as well as in terms of calculating and reporting methane emissions and evaluating best practices for reducing methane emissions. Regarding this last point, Enagás will continue to monitor methane emissions through the OGMP2.0 reporting framework (see the '[Reduction of](#page-70-0)  [methane emissions](#page-70-0)' sub-section in this section).\n- Promotion of decarbonisation in the supply chain: Enagás has several platforms for the approval and evaluation of its suppliers' performance. In this way, Enagás evaluates its main suppliers in terms of climate action and identifies working areas aimed at reducing its carbon footprint (see the ['](#page-147-0)[Supply chain](#page-147-0)['](#page-147-0) section).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/74/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enaga\" in blue and green on the right.\n\n# 3.2 People\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nPeople management is a key area for the company, since, as reflected in our Human Capital Management Policy, it enables Enagás to equip itself with the resources required for the deployment of its strategy.\n\n[GRI 3-3]\n\nThe key aspects that we address in our people management model are the structure and sizing of our organisation (workforce), the development of skills and knowledge of professionals, job stability and quality and compliance with labour rights, with special attention to the areas of diversity and inclusion, work-life balance and shared responsibility, and equal opportunity.\n\n## Sustainable Management Plan\n\n#### Main lines in 2023\n\n- Negotiation of the fourth collective bargaining agreement of the Enagás Group.\n- Definition of the action plan derived from the climate survey and launch of surveys for the assessment of work-life balance measures and for the follow-up of the 2022 results.\n- Implementation of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and the Diversity Allies Network.\n- Leadership programme to develop the skills and competences of the management team.\n- Corporate University Project.\n- Specific programme on bias to strengthen the Diversity and Inclusion model.\n\n#### 2024 lines\n\n- Signing of the fourth collective bargaining agreement of the Enagás Group.\n- Continuation of the Leadership Programme for managers to develop the skills of the management team in line with the company's new Strategic Plan and Transformation Plan.\n- Implementation of a new Remuneration Model in line with the company's challenges and targets, as well as ensuring its competitiveness based on best practices and market trends.\n- Launch of the Enagás Corporate University and implementation of associated initiatives.\n- Transparency and equal pay: completion of the analysis process on the premises of the European Directive for the calculation of an adjusted pay gap and definition of an action plan.\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/25 description: A green circle contains the text \"1,354 professionals\" in white.\n\n## 58.1 average training hours per employee (€1,096 investment per employee)\n\n36 internal promotions (33% women)\n\n78.4% of the workforce underwent a performance assessment\n\n41% women in management and premanagement positions\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Annual Report** [Consolidated](#page-3-0) **[2023](#page-1-0)** [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [Our business](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0) [model](#page-10-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)** [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n## Our professionals [GRI 2-7, GRI 2-8]\n\nThe following outlines the distribution of Enagás' 1,354 professionals<sup>13</sup> <sup>14</sup>(1,346.3 FTEs<sup>15</sup>) by country, age group, professional group and gender at year-end.\n\n#### Number of professionals per country at year-end<sup>13</sup>\n\n| Country             | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Spain               | 1,327 | 1,353 | 1,352 |\n| Other countries (1) | 17    | 12    | 2     |\n| Belgium             | 3     | 3     | 2     |\n| Kuwait              | 4     | 4     | 0     |\n| Peru                | 3     | 3     | 0     |\n| Greece              | 2     | 1     | 0     |\n| Mexico              | 3     | 1     | 0     |\n| France              | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n| Chile               | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n| TOTAL               | 1,344 | 1,365 | 1,354 |\n\n(1) 100% of professionals outside Spain have a permanent full-time contract.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2023, 13 professionals were hired through temporary employment agencies (9 in 2022) and 55 interns (45 in 2022) were working at Enagás in Spain.

The company ensures the appropriate transmission of expert knowledge through planned and voluntary departures. In 2023, there were two involuntary departures<sup>16</sup> from the company (two men, one under 35 years of age and the other between 36 and 55 years of age). [GRI 2-7]\n\n## Transformation Plan [GRI 404-2]\n\nIn order to respond to the company's strategic challenges in accordance with the new Strategic Plan, Enagás is promoting a Transformation Plan which, through the development of crosscutting and top management-sponsored initiatives, enables it to drive cultural change and the internal transformation of the company with a focus on people.\n\nAll of this is underpinned by pillars such as talent, diversity, new ways of working and digitalisation, among others.\n\nThis plan focuses on the following areas:\n\n- Roles, profiles and agile resource planning model, as well as competency and capacity development to successfully cope with an environment that demands new skills and knowledge.\n- Strategic management of diverse and inclusive talent, which places the professional at the centre, promotes self-driven growth and learning, and ensures the commitment, engagement and development of key talent.\n- An agile, flexible and more adaptable organisation, with a more cross-cutting, fluid structure, oriented towards adding value and characterised by the adoption of agile values and new ways of working.\n- Digitalisation and efficiency of processes, boosting customer orientation, improving response time and data-driven decision making. Fostering a safety culture in order to evolve towards being a more resilient organisation and ensure business continuity.\n- New spaces and forms of intelligent work that provide greater flexibility in the current hybrid context, leveraging the use of new technological tools and promoting a culture of health that guarantees the physical and emotional well-being of professionals.\n- Cross-cutting actions to respond to the company's strategic challenges with a focus on operational excellence and flexibility, sustainability and evolution resulting from the decarbonisation and energy transition context (hydrogen, other renewable gases, etc.), among others.\n\n<sup>16</sup> In 2022, no involuntary departures took place; in 2021, there was one (a man, professional group 'Operator', aged 36-55).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/80/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase sans-serif font. The \"e\" is green, and the rest of the letters are blue. The word is enclosed in a circle, with the top half of the circle being green and the bottom half being blue.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n All of this is complemented by a Communication and Change Management Programme, which activates the transformation by placing the professional as an active part of the action plan and ensures the success and measurement of the impact on results.\n\nMajor projects being pushed forward in 2023 include: the improvement of key business processes, simplification of reporting, development of leadership and training programmes at a company level, promotion of digitalisation and development of digital products (SL-ATR, Guarantees of Origin), listening actions and improvement of the employee experience, actions within the agile framework, health and safety and resilience change management and the adaptation of spaces around the new hybrid context.\n\nEnagás has Corporate Guidelines on the Right to Digital Switch-Off, which moderate possible effects of permanent connectivity and promote a positive impact on people's productivity and well-being. . [GRI 404-2]\n\n#### See the **[Corporate Guidelines on the Right to Disconnect](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Corporate%20Directives%20Right%20to%20Digital%20SwichOff.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n### Agility and new ways of working\n\nIn addition, Enagás is leading a programme of agility and new ways of working that aims to adopt agile principles throughout the company through specific actions in three areas:\n\n- Evolve towards an organisation with greater transversality, customer orientation and process simplicity.\n- Promote the use of methodologies that seek to adopt collaborative frameworks that foster early value delivery, continuous improvement and innovation.\n- Promote new behaviours and attitudes that foster communication, transversality and agility training for professionals.\n\nIn 2023, from the 'Agility Hub', the company continued its commitment to agility and the adoption of new ways of working at the company, highlighting the launch and execution of the following initiatives:\n\n- Organisational evolution of areas of the company based on structures and management models agile in defining transversal roles with a customer vision, promoting agile project offices and creating permanent product-oriented structures made up of agile cells.\n- Methodological support to teams in the adoption of agility and new ways of working in day-to-day and project work through Communities of Practice and other associated specific actions.\n- Promotion of internal communications to reinforce the dissemination of agile culture (effective meetings, sharing of best practices and internal company testimonials, among others).\n\nAt Enagás, in accordance with the drive for teams to adopt agility and new ways of working, reflection sessions have been implemented on the natural team and project team level, using an agile/scrum philosophy that allows for an 'informal' evaluation at the team performance level. These sessions are characterised by being 'spaces for reflection' in which the teams 'self-evaluate' by identifying areas for improvement that need to be strengthened from both an individual and collective point of view.\n\nIn addition, in order to continue disseminating agility and new ways of working to all Enagás professionals, a training plan on new methodologies was launched for all company workforce (see the '[Training](#page-81-0)' sub-section in this section).\n\n## Awareness of in-house talent [GRI 404-3]\n\nThe company has different evaluation models aimed at getting to know internal talent in order to effectively guide their training and professional development.\n\nThe performance assessment model is based on the corporate skills that make up the Leadership Model for each professional category, thus allowing the identification of strengths and areas for individual development of each professional. There is also a management-byobjectives model to align employees' individual performance and contribution with the company's strategic challenges, via the annual definition of measurable and defined objectives for each professional with regular monitoring by their managers, through the annual variable remuneration of professionals not covered by the collective bargaining agreement. These assessments are carried out annually and serve as a base for promoting continuous improvement and designing personal development plans.\n\nDevelopment Centre sessions are also held; in these, through various techniques and simulation exercises, participants obtain personalised feedback about their potential strengths and areas for development in the performance of different roles and responsibilities. In 2023, in response to the company's organisational needs during the year, 43 professionals (79 in 2022) participated in a talent identification programme and 16 (51 in 2022) received a skillsbased assessment for possible promotion to management positions.\n\nWith the aim of continuing to promote feedback culture at the company and fostering open communication, Enagás has an online platform for all professionals to receive and give feedback to other professionals. This aims to encourage the identification of improvements at work and to recognise achievements.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that in 2023, with the aim of adapting the management team's skills to successfully face the challenges of the Strategic Plan and the Transformation Plan, a Leadership Development Programme has been put in place. This has entailed the identification of critical knowledge and skills to be developed at the company to achieve our strategic challenges. 40 professionals (members of the Executive Committee and company Directors) have participated in a 360º evaluation process (evaluation by their managers, teams and peers and/or internal customers) to provide them with an expanded vision of their strengths and areas for improvement, thus focusing both the individual and collective actions we will take next to boost their development of skills that are critical for Enagás.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social Risk [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of professionals assessed by the number of staff at year-end. The Chief Executive Officer is not included, as he is not covered by the performance assessment.\n\n(2) The data of the performance assessment of the group of professionals included in the collective bargaining agreement refer to the 2022 financial year, as the 2023 evaluation campaign ended after the approval of this report.\n\n## Professional development programmes\n\nThe information obtained from the various assessments of our professionals to date makes it possible to design individualised development plans tailored to the identified needs identified. These are approached from an integral perspective, following the 70:20:10 learning model, based on the fact that for this process to be as effective as possible, we must focus on three complementary areas: experience, exposure and education.\n\nIn relation to the first area of experiential learning, internal rotation programmes are fostered so that new knowledge can be applied to real situations, and participation in transversal projects or temporary assignments can also be taken advantage of. In 2023, there were 144 internal movements (163 in 2022), of which 36 were promotions, 103 horizontal movements and 5 expatriation. 46% of hirings selected internal candidates (43% in 2022). 21 interns also stayed on at the company (31 in 2022).\n\nIn relation to the second area, namely exposure or informal learning, there is the option of carrying out internal and/or external coaching and mentoring programmes. These programmes contribute to the achievement of the company's strategic objectives, and their main benefits are the development and retention of talent, increased satisfaction and motivation of professionals, improved internal communication and teamwork, increased productivity, leadership development and strategic vision, as well as the promotion of female talent and the increased presence of women in positions of responsibility.\n\n• Enagás promotes personalised coaching programmes aimed at working on the capabilities and skills necessary for the performance of each professional, facing times of change or undertaking new roles. In 2023, 29 professionals participated in coaching programmes (six professionals in 2022). In addition, professionals in the company have received training and are\n\ncertified in coaching; they are therefore qualified to carry out internal coaching processes.\n\n• Enagás has continued to strengthen its internal mentoring programme aimed at all the company's professionals, which encourages two-way learning among colleagues. Enagás continued to strengthen its internal mentoring programme, aimed at all company professionals. In 2023, 54 professionals (27 mentees and 27 mentors) participated in the internal mentoring programme, and 46 professionals (31 mentees and 16 mentors) participated in the external mentoring programme. The aim of these external programmes is to encourage and enable professionals to reach senior management positions, to foster their development and to receive advice from more senior professionals from a company other than their own, allowing for a greater exchange of experiences.\n\nFinally, the third area - education - promotes a culture of continuous learning, putting the employee at the centre, empowering them and providing them with the capacity for self-development through training ecosystems where they can access different learning programmes and initiatives.\n\nIn addition, there have been two career models at the company. On the one hand, there is the management career, where you are promoted vertically to positions of greater responsibility and based on team management. On the other hand, there is the technical career, aimed at creating and identifying experts in those areas of knowledge that are critical for Enagás.\n\n### Training [GRI 404-2]\n\nEnagás is committed to training its professionals from when they join the company and throughout their professional career.\n\nTraining begins with the Enagás Welcome Plan, which includes communication and training activities. It includes e-learning training on aspects such as the Code of Ethics, a corporate defence programme, a corruption prevention programme, human rights and equality, among others, which are compulsory for all professionals, and face-to-face training on the Enagás value chain that offers professionals a global vision of the company's business. As a complement to this plan, new recruits participate in a buddy programme; during their Enagás onboarding process, they are accompanied by a colleague who guides and helps them as they take their first steps.\n\nBesides, depending on the type of work the person performs, a training plan has been designed in areas related to operations, maintenance, security and administrative management.\n\nThe company's training is driven by the new Enagás Corporate University, where over 10% of the workforce participate as trainers in different programmes. Beyond classroom and on-the-job training, virtual training, e-learning, mobile training and communities of practice, we also promote the use of experiential technologies, allowing real cases to be simulated and people to learn from experience without putting people's safety at risk or modifying infrastructure operations.\n\nEnagás' commitment to training all its professionals is evidenced by a training penetration rate<sup>17</sup> of 94.9% in 2023 (97.1% in 2022), an\n\n<sup>17</sup>The training penetration rate is the number of professionals who have received at least one training activity during the year out of the total number of employees at year-end.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0) \n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

These schedules are set out to generate progressive improvement in our professionals' qualification levels, anticipating their short- and long-term needs, and include corporate, operation and maintenance, environmental and health and safety training. This year, they have been extended to strategic areas, including Agility and\n\nNew Ways of Working, Digital Transformation and Hydrogen. The\n\ntraining associated with these training schedules (training counted as compulsory) represents 19% of the training hours and 14% of the economic investment per professional.\n\nAdditionally, we have programmes based on the skills and behaviours established for each profile associated with our leadership model. We also have training, upskilling and reskilling programmes that provide technical training to new employees, allowing them to take on new roles and participate in new projects and initiatives. [GRI 404-2]\n\nWithin the framework of the Enagás Knowledge Management Model, with the aim of promoting the dissemination and transfer of critical knowledge generated within the company, especially in Infrastructure, the company has continued to work on a series of initiatives, including the promotion of social learning so that professionals can earn and share knowledge through the 'Expert Talk' programme. In this programme, experts and company leaders share their knowledge with the rest of the company's professionals through monthly lectures on relevant topics in the gas sector, and the creation of lessons on different subjects that other professionals can consult. Likewise, in order to minimise knowledge loss, we continue with the critical knowledge transfer plans linked to the relay plans.\n\n#### Hours of training (1) received by professional, by professional group and gender [GRI 404-1]\n\nImage /page/82/Figure/16 description: This image is a bar chart comparing data from 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a curved line that forms a semi-circle, creating a visual element that resembles a smile or an arc. The color of the word \"enagas\" and the curved line is a shade of teal or light green.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion [GRI 3-3]\n\nEnagás has a Diversity and Inclusion Policy that sets out the commitments and lines of action to position diversity management and inclusion as key elements of its global strategy. This policy promotes equal opportunities as the central axis around which human resources policies should be oriented, with the aim of creating strategic assets and promoting the full personal and professional development of company employees at all times, thus consolidating the right of all professionals to truly equal opportunities and equal treatment. It also includes the integration of diversity in the main human resources processes such as access to employment, personal progress and professional development and promotion, all while guaranteeing a management free of bias associated with differences.\n\nSee our **[Diversity and Inclusion Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Diversity%20and%20Inclusion%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nEnagás promotes a culture that ensures a diverse and inclusive environment, and fosters a working environment in which trust and mutual respect prevail and where integration and recognition of individual merit are hallmarks of the company.\n\nEnagás has designed a Master Plan establishing two bodies to continuously promote Diversity and Inclusion at the company:\n\n- Diversity and Inclusion Committee, whose goal is to involve the company's management and middle management in the Diversity and Inclusion strategy by promoting inclusion in their areas of responsibility, being active and prominent advocates of inclusive practices and leadership. This provides a space for sharing experiences, reflecting, finding synergies and proposing concrete actions to advance with a sustainable, inclusive and egalitarian model of people management. This Committee, which is composed of directors representing all areas of the company, has met twice since June 2023.\n- Diversity and Inclusion Allies Network, to take the pulse of the organisation in terms of Diversity and Inclusion and ensure the implementation of a diversity and inclusion culture on a day-today basis, serving as a link between the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and the rest of the workforce.\n\nThe Enagás diversity allies network met for the first time on October 25. This network involves 90 professionals from all areas of the company who have expressed an interest in promoting an inclusive culture based on the six axes of diversity.\n\nThe Diversity and Inclusion Master Plan was implemented in 2023.\n\nIt also reflects the company's commitment to the promotion of policies and measures to enhance shared responsibility and work-life balance of its professionals. In the same way, and safeguarding freedom of management, Enagás extends this commitment to all its stakeholders, paying special attention to suppliers and contractors as indispensable partners in achieving the company's business objectives (see the ['](#page-147-0)[Supply chain](#page-147-0)['](#page-147-0) section in this chapter).\n\n### Diversity leadership\n\nIn terms of management, Enagás has a specific People and Diversity Department, reporting to the People and Transformation General Manager. This General Manager is a member of the Executive Committee reporting directly to the CEO; his duties include the development and maintenance of Enagás' Diversity and Inclusion strategy.\n\n#### Non-discrimination\n\nEnagás expressly rejects any discrimination based on gender, age, disability, nationality or culture, race, religious beliefs, thought and sexual orientation, or any other personal, family, economic or social condition among its professionals, fostering work environments free of direct and indirect discrimination, harassment or other forms of intolerance at all levels of the organisation.\n\nThe company is determined to create diverse and inclusive work environments, where each and every person feels that they can be themselves and that they are valued, without prejudice, for their work and their talent. In 2023, Enagás launched a specific programme on cognitive biases aimed at Directors and managers to help develop a culture favourable to the diversity and inclusion model that the company seeks. Its goal is to help identify the presence of biases and assess their influence and impact on interpersonal interactions and management, providing team managers with both the necessary tools to be aware of their existence and the measures and actions available to eliminate them. In 2024, this training will be extended to the partner network, and training videos will be distributed to all professionals.\n\nEnagás has a prevention and action protocol for any situation of harassment in the workplace, the aim of which is to set out guidelines for identifying a situation of harassment, whether psychological or moral, sexual, or gender-based, among others, in order to resolve a discriminatory situation, ensuring that the rights of the victims are guaranteed at all times. In this regard, in 2020, Enagás launched an online course on the Code of Ethics aimed at all professionals that addresses this matter.\n\nConsult the **[Prevention and action protocol for any workplace](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/personas/diversidad/Prevention%20and%20action%20protocol%20for%20any%20situation%20of%20harassment%20in%20the%20workplace.pdf)  [harassment situation](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/personas/diversidad/Prevention%20and%20action%20protocol%20for%20any%20situation%20of%20harassment%20in%20the%20workplace.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n#### 2023\n\n**In 2023, Enagás continued its communication campaign #EllasTeLoCuentan (#ShesTellingYou). Through the testimonies of company professionals, this aims to raise the profile of Enagás women's talent and create female role models to help build the number of women in technical and operational jobs. The campaign was launched in February 2022, and in 2023 testimonials by men were added, #EllasTeLoCuentan, con ellos (#ShesTellingYou, with them), to highlight the team cohesion without the gender of any of their members prevailing.** \n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social Risk**  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/84/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts'.\n\nEnagás, aware of the richness that the confluence of different knowledge, skills and experiences brings to the organisation, has set out its Diversity and Inclusion Strategy based on the following pillars: [GRI 3-3]\n\nImage /page/84/Figure/9 description: The image shows six circular icons, each representing a different aspect of diversity and inclusion. The first icon, labeled \"Gender,\" depicts two figures and describes guaranteeing equal treatment and opportunities in hiring, development, and growth for all genders. The second icon, labeled \"Disability,\" features a puzzle piece and discusses moving forward with the full inclusion of people with disabilities in the workforce. The third icon, labeled \"Generational,\" shows three figures and encourages different generations to work together in a favorable environment. The fourth icon, labeled \"Cultural,\" displays a globe and focuses on taking advantage of multiculturalism to improve employee experience. The fifth icon, labeled \"Thinking,\" presents a lightbulb and aims to create a culture where the uniqueness of beliefs, education, skills, and preferences contributes to employee innovation. The sixth icon, labeled \"LGTBIQ+,\" features a heart and aims to make visible, integrate, and normalize LGBTQI+ groups in the professional environment.\n\nThis strategy is supported by a Diversity and Equality Action Plan which aims to ensure equality of opportunity by promoting a diverse, inclusive environment.\n\n## **We have joined the European Diversity Month with testimonials from our company's Executive Committee management team**\n\n#### Gender diversity\n\nIn the area of gender diversity, Enagás guarantees equal treatment and opportunities in the hiring, development and growth of men and women; to promote an environment and conditions in which all people aspire to, and are able to, achieve positions of responsibility.\n\nTo this end, it has an Equality Plan that sets out a framework for action to promote effective equality, equity, merit, personal progress, shared responsibility and work-life balance among all professionals.\n\nEnagás has also joined the commemoration of specific days including International Women's Day, European Equal Pay Day, International Day of Women and Girls in Science, International Women in Engineering Day, Women's Entrepreneurship Day and International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\nConsult the **[2nd Gender Equality Plan](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/es/ficheros/conocenos/personas/diversidad/plan-igualdad.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social Risk**  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/85/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the logo of ENA on the right.\n\n#### **Gender diversity programmes**\n\nEnagás promotes measures aimed at increasing the participation of women in positions of responsibility, such as the 'Women with Talent' development programme, the 'Promociona' project and the\n\n'Progresa' project. The latter ones are being developed in collaboration with the CEOE, and aim to create networking groups based on the sharing of experiences to provide high-potential women with the tools and skills necessary to boost their professional careers and take on positions of high responsibility in the future. It\n\n#### **Other gender diversity indicators**\n\nhas also launched the Management Development Programme 'Women with High Potential', together with the EOI and the\n\nmentoring programme for managers, AED Lead Mentoring.

Average remuneration includes: base year salary at December 31, variable remuneration, allowances, payments to long-term savings plans and any other item, such as overtime. Only the transfer allowance is excluded, as it is not considered remuneration as such; it accounts for less than 0.1% of the total amount of remuneration.\n\nThis takes into consideration all professionals in Spain with a permanent or temporary contract, both full-time and part-time, who have remained in the company\n\nthroughout the year (93.7% of the workforce). In the case of part-time workforce, the base salary has been extrapolated to a full-time salary for comparability. For 2022, given the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer in February 2022, the Chief Executive Officer's annual base salary was considered together with the actual remuneration received in the year for comparability purposes.\n\n(2) In 2022, the long-term incentive plans (2019-2021) were settled, significantly increasing the remuneration of the company's professionals. The allocation of these incentive plans was structured according to the professional group's degree of contribution to the established targets. In 2023, the partial settlement of the term incentive plans (2019-2021) for senior management was finalised.\n\n(3) There are no women in this professional group.\n\n(4) Unrepresentative data, as there are less than three professionals in this group for one of the genders. Although there were three women on the Executive Committee in 2022, only two were taken into account for the wage gap calculation, as one of them was not with the company for the whole year.\n\n(5) Figure calculated as the difference between the average remuneration of men and women divided by the average remuneration of men.\n\nIn 2023, the wage gap continued to decrease, but not materially. The wage gap in the year, considering total remuneration, was 0.99 (1.29% difference between men's and women's base salary).\n\nWhen analysing the pay gap by occupational group, the difference in the 'Other Executive Committee members' group is due to differences in management seniority among the members of this group, which leads to differences in other remuneration without an identifiable pay gap in base salary among this occupational group (1.00).\n\nThe difference in the professional group \"Other executives\" (1.03) has decreased in recent years, in line with the development and promotion of female talent (women managers and pre-managers). The difference in salary in the professional group of administrative workforce (1.10) is due to the fact that this is a category made up mostly of women (88%), in which some positions have functionrelated bonuses.\n\nSimilarly, the difference in the category of operational workforce (0.79) is explained by a greater presence of men (88.6%) with an average seniority greater than that of women (an average of 14.9 years for men compared to 4.3 years for women). In this regard, Enagás is promoting the incorporation of women in the technical specialist professional group through initiatives such as the search for female profiles in vocational schools.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás has launched a new study on the gender pay gap in anticipation of the transposition into Spanish law of the requirements of the EU Directive.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |  |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|--|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|--|\n\n#### Changes in average remuneration (1) by professional group, age and gender [GRI 2-19, GRI 405-2]\n\n|                          | 2021                                     | 2022<br>(year of settlement of long-term<br>incentive plans) (2) | 2023 (2   |               |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Professional group       |                                          |                                                                  |           |               |\n| Managers                 | Chief Executive Officer (3)              | 1,592,399                                                        | 1,377,688 | 1,879,700 (4) |\n|                          | Other members of the Executive Committee | 561,410                                                          | 595,687   | 641,438       |\n|                          | Other managers                           | 150,128                                                          | 176,791   | 161,048       |\n|                          | Technicians                              | 66,243                                                           | 73,404    | 70,983        |\n| Administrative workforce |                                          | 46,414                                                           | 51,109    | 50,210        |\n| Operational workforce    |                                          | 53,067                                                           | 58,686    | 57,289        |\n| Age range                | <=35 years                               | 51,074                                                           | 55,556    | 53,320        |\n|                          | 36-55 years                              | 76,611                                                           | 83,893    | 80,975        |\n|                          | >55 years                                | 95,912                                                           | 93,164    | 91,534        |\n| Gender                   | Women                                    | 70,493                                                           | 80,573    | 78,195        |\n|                          | Men                                      | 78,451                                                           | 82.116    | 79.217        |\n\n(1) Average remuneration that includes: base year salary at December 31, variable remuneration, allowances, payments to long-term savings plans and any other item, such as overtime.

There are two periods, summer and non-summer, with a divided or continuous working day, flexible in both cases, to be chosen by the professionals depending on the area of activity to which they are assigned<sup>20</sup>. In addition, Enagás has established a teleworking system that allows it to respond to the current context, in which 91% of professionals whose position is compatible with this type of work voluntarily participate.\n\nEnagás has been certified as an Family-Friendly Company since 2007; it obtained the highest rating (A+ Level) for excellence in work-life balance from the Más Familia Foundation. Work-life balance is a voluntary commitment that Enagás has made to contribute to the professional and personal success of its workforce.\n\nTo this end, the company has more than 125 measures aimed at reconciling the different aspects of people's lives. They support professional and personal development and facilitate a balance between the different dimensions of each person's life, as well as those of their immediate family. Work-life balance becomes a key instrument to guarantee equality of opportunity.\n\nEnagás believes that the Family-Friendly Company model is integrated into the management of the business and is a valuable tool that has also allowed the company to be perceived as an excellent place to work. The Family-Friendly Company model is subject to an external audit, which evaluates, among other aspects, the return on investment of work-life balance and obliges the company to always be in a process of continuous improvement.\n\n<sup>20</sup> Except shift personnel.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/90/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enagas.

This collective bargaining agreement covers, among other matters, the health and safety of all Enagás Group professionals (see the '[Health and safety](#page-93-0)' section in this chapter). In 2023, Enagás began negotiating the Group's 4th collective bargaining agreement, having signed in December the preagreement issued by the Negotiating Committee.\n\nIn addition, Enagás enters into collective bargaining and carries out regular consultations with the workers' legal representation regarding working conditions, remuneration, dispute resolution, internal relations and issues of mutual concern. In 2023, various working group meetings were held with social representatives, including meetings to negotiate the Enagás Group's 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement and the ordinary meetings of the joint committees established in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Equality Plan and the Pension Plan. All of this has resulted in various agreements, notably including the pre-agreement issued by the Negotiating Committee for the Enagás Group's 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement and the system of misconduct and penalties applicable to the Enagás Group.\n\nFor professionals not included in the Enagás Group's collective bargaining agreement, the regulations governing working conditions in general are those outlined in the Spanish Workers' Statute. However, those conditions of the Enagás Group collective bargaining agreement that improve on those established in the Workers' Statute are applicable to 100% of the workforce.\n\n#### Percentage of professionals covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement by professional group at year-end(1)\n\n|                          | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Technicians              | 25.4%  | 26.2%  | 27.8%  |\n| Administrative workforce | 84.5%  | 84.5%  | 86.0%  |\n| Operational workforce    | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n| Total                    | 48.4%  | 50.8%  | 51.6%  |\n\n(1) These data refer to professionals in Spain.\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/21 description: The image shows a blue icon of a computer mouse with a cursor hovering over it.

These surveys are carried out regularly every two years.\n\nThat year, participation by our professionals increased compared to the previous survey, reaching 77% (73% in 2020). Overall professional satisfaction stood at 72% (82% in 2020) and the sustainable engagement index at 82% (91% in 2020), the latter remaining in line with external benchmarks.\n\nAs conclusions of the results of the climate survey, 94% of professionals consider Enagás a good place to work, and most of them understand how their work contributes to the business objectives. In addition, the categories of 'stakeholder orientation', 'sustainable engagement' and 'internal relations' are highly rated. The categories 'inclusion and diversity', 'well-being' and 'stakeholder orientation' are the most stable categories compared to the previous survey.\n\nIn 2023, to continued with the Global Listening Strategy, the following actions were taken:\n\n- Establishment of action plans derived from the areas for improvement found through the climate survey.\n- Launch of a brief survey to monitor the organisation's climate; by randomly selecting a representative sample of the company (50% of the workforce), this survey aimed to gather the views of Enagás persons in order to continue identifying opportunities for\n\nimprovement and deepen the degree of knowledge of the professionals on the projects implemented by the company. The initiative, in line with the Enagás Transformation Plan, aims to strengthen the commitment and development of people in order to continue growing as a company.\n\nThis survey had a 68% participation rate and showed improvement in most categories compared to 2022, with a sustainable commitment of 85% (three points higher than 2022).\n\n• Launch of a specific survey on social benefits and work-life balance measures aimed at all professionals; this had a 64% participation rate. The purpose of this survey was to give Enagás professionals the opportunity to share their thoughts on a series of measures provided by Enagás to support co-responsibility and facilitate work-life balance. This survey also allowed us to find out what impact these measures and social benefits had on the employee value proposition. 73% of professionals believe that the work-life balance measures offered by Enagás have a high impact on its employee value proposition. 85% of Enagás professionals positively value work-life balance measures/social benefits as an additional part of their salary.\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/17 description: The image is a red logo for \"Top Employer Spain 2024\".

This system, which is subject to internal audits and external certification, covers 100% of the professionals and contractors (more than 3,850 people in 2023) who carry out work on Enagás infrastructures. [GRI 403-1, GRI 403-7, GRI 403-8]\n\nEnagás also has a Road Traffic Safety Management System certified in accordance with ISO 39001. In this area, the company has a Mobility and Road Safety Plan, guidelines in this area and a protocol for vehicle use. There is also a Sustainable and Safe Fleet Management Manual and a Guide to Good Road Safety Practices for fleet management.\n\nEnagás promotes safety throughout its supply chain and requires ISO 45001 certification in its approval process for suppliers of certain families of products or services (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)' section in this chapter). Additionally, in order to guarantee the coordination of business activities and the coordination of health and safety on building projects, the company has the Enagás Contractor Access System (SACE) to manage the safety of its suppliers, contractors and the whole subcontracting chain. This system offers contractors the operating safety procedures applicable to the possible risks involved in the works they perform. [GRI 403-7]\n\nProfessionals and contractors have access to various channels through which they can participate in and consult the operation, implementation and assessment of the management system. These include the bulletin board, forms, meetings, internal memos, informational pamphlets, posters and/or electronic communications, as well as any other method that can be documented and guarantees receipt by the intended recipient. Additionally, there are cross-company and cascading communication channels that also cover health and safety issues. Enagás also has a chatbot (virtual assistant) to answer the most frequently asked health and safety questions (see the 'Commitment to stakeholders' section in the '[Sustainable Management Mode](#page-54-0)l' section in this chapter). [GRI 403-4]\n\nEnagás has various employee representative bodies where they may exercise their participation and consultation rights. Different committees comprise health and safety officers and management representatives. The Health and Safety Committees<sup>24</sup> meet every three months, while the Group and Enagás Transporte SAU Intercentre Health and Safety Committees meet with a frequency set out in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. A chatbot and an email account for suggestions and questions are also available to all professionals. [GRI 403-4]\n\n#### Awareness-raising [GRI 403-5]\n\nIn 2023, a total of 12,206 hours of health and safety training were provided (13,955 hours in 2022); 60% of employees received training (69% in 2022).\n\nHealth and Safety training is a key part of any preventative action to improve worker awareness and protection from the hazards that may be present in daily operations. This is why Enagás has designed a training schedule for all different job profiles at the company that sets out the specific training activities needed for each risk group. In 2023, these activities notably included training regarding work with dangerous goods, explosive atmospheres, storage of chemical products, hygiene and ergonomics, first aid and road safety, among others.\n\n#### 06/2023\n\n**For World Road Safety Day, which is commemorated every year on June 10, Enagás organised various initiatives to raise awareness among its professionals so that they exercise the greatest caution behind the wheel** \n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, more than 70 informational messages were sent to all Enagás personnel through the corporate mailbox with info bites promoting health programmes (the Steppers challenge, vaccines, etc.), offering talks on a range of topics (sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, etc.), and more [GRI 403-4, GRI 403-6]\n\nIn 2023, Enagás carried on the \"Guide Project\" campaign to guide employees towards a culture of health and safety through the acquisition of knowledge and good habits that enable people to maintain their well-being in the professional and personal spheres. The actions launched within the framework of this project include an awareness-raising campaign on best safety practices promoted by the members of the Executive Committee, as well as informative videos on hydrogen safety challenges, what to do in case of a safety incident and work with electrical hazards.\n\nEnagás is also providing training to all its contractors through the SACE platform. This training is complemented to the face-to-face chats at infrastructure facilities where particularly hazardous work may be carried out. In 2023, 5,480 hours of training (5,656 hours in 2022) were delivered through the SACE platform to 2,742 contractors from 732 contractor companies.\n\nSee the **[Health and Safety](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**[,](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf) **[Environment and Quality Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**, as well as the Prevention of Major Accidents Policy and the **[Corporate Road Safety Guidelines](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Directrices%20Corporativas%20Seguridad%20Vial%20en.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n<sup>24</sup> Health and Safety Committees are established, as per regulation, for centres with more than 50 workers, in those centres with less than 50 employees at which there is a Prevention Delegate, health and safety meetings are held on a regular basis.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/5 description: The image shows the Enagas logo.

Enagás has therefore not identified any cases of occupational illnesses either for its own workforce or for subcontractors in the last three years.\n\n## Risk assessments and incident handling [GRI 403-2, GRI 403-9]\n\nWithin its Health and Safety Management System, Enagás has a procedure for the identification of occupational hazards and subsequent risk assessment. Additionally, the following procedures are available:\n\n- An internal procedure for occupational risk assessment using a method based on the Simplified Accident Risk Assessment System from the National Occupational Safety and Hygiene Institute, which assesses risks associated with both positions and the workplace. This methodology is used for both routine and nonroutine work. In the latter case, the methodology is associated with a special operational instruction that makes it possible to quantify the magnitude of the existing risks and to define their correction priority.\n- Procedures for the assessment of industrial risks based on different methodologies, such as HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study), a risk and operability assessment technique that permits the identification of potential and operational risks produced by system deviations from design conditions; SIL (Safety Integrity Level), a technique for assessing safety levels by assigning the required safety integrity level to each instrumented safety function and verifying that it meets the safety requirements of that level; 'What If', a technique for easily identifying potential hazards, assessing the significance of hazards and the adequacy of existing safeguards; risk analysis methodology for facilities under the SEVESO Directive, a methodology for assessing explosion risk which enables the assessment of both the existence and likelihood of the formation of an explosive atmosphere and the\n\nexistence and likelihood of activation for all possible sources of ignition.\n\nFor routine work, in addition to the general risk assessment, specific risk assessments are available for newly implemented maintenance ranges or operating instructions.\n\n• Safety inspections (planned observations, safety visits and safety walks) and work permits are other procedures that make up the Enagás management system, in which hazards are identified and risks evaluated.\n\nThese risk assessments are reviewed when there is a change that requires it or every five years, according to the associated procedures. These assessments are carried out by competent technicians according to national regulations, and the process is verified through internal and external health and safety audits.\n\nThe most representative risks of our activity are those related to work in classified areas (areas where there is a potential for explosion and/ or fire due to the presence of gases, vapours or dusts in the atmosphere) and those associated with driving.\n\nFollowing any risk assessment, corrective actions are established to mitigate the relevant identified risks, and the effectiveness of the action is subsequently evaluated. These results are reviewed by management and may lead to improvements in the management system.\n\nThe specific assessment for road safety and the mobility plan were also revised in 2023.\n\nThe review of psychosocial risk assessments planned for 2023-2025 has also begun. This fiscal year, 600 professionals were assessed using both quantitative and qualitative data, the latter involving more than 100 individual interviews. Preliminary results to date show favourable results in areas such as worker interest and compensation, psychological demands and autonomy. In 2024 and 2025, the psychosocial assessment of the rest of our professionals will continue, as will the establishment and implementation of corrective actions to manage the identified areas with the greatest room for improvement.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/97/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in gray font on the left side of the image.

There are various channels for establishing these communications, such as Health and Safety Committees and meetings, workers' representatives, an electronic suggestion mailbox available to all professionals, and coordination meetings with contractors, through the prevention service or through those directly responsible, and a specific mailbox enabled on the SACE platform for contractors and suppliers. Along these lines, continuous sensitivity-raising and awareness-raising campaigns are carried out with the aim of promoting a culture of risk observation and hazard warnings where necessary.\n\nIf a situation involving an imminent, major risk is identified, professionals are obligated to stop working, remain in a safe location and notify their direct supervisor of the situation.\n\nEnagás has a procedure for action, notification, investigation and statistical analysis of all incidents.\n\nIf the following circumstances arise, a specialised investigation using a cause analysis methodology is carried out, which generates a specific register:\n\n- Incidents with a risk score above a specific level, established according to the method included in the procedure.\n- By request of the Intercentre Health and Safety Committee and/or the Health and Safety Committee of the facility, the chain of command or the Prevention Service.\n- Major or fatal accidents.\n- Major accidents according to RD 840/2015.\n\nFollowing the investigation, a report is produced including the causes of the incident, the potential risk assessment, the corrective actions identified, the persons responsible for carrying out and monitoring the corrective measures (including those that affect the risk assessment review or changes to the management system), as well as resources and timelines, following the procedure for managing corrective actions.\n\nThe criteria used for recording and consolidating reported accident data is based on the OSHA standard.\n\nSee the **[Health and Safety](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**[,](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf) **[Environment and Quality Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**, the **[General Policy on the Integrated Security of Strategic](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)  [Infrastructures](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)** and the Prevention of Major Accidents Policy on the corporate website.\n\n[GRI 403-2, GRI 403-9]\n\n## Resilience: crisis management, business continuity and emergencies\n\nEnagás is moving towards a resilient management model, promoting improvements in different areas such as crisis management, business continuity management and accident and emergency management. This model makes it possible to increase the company's capacity to adapt to a changing environment, reducing the time required to act and recover from the possible appearance of a disruptive situation.\n\nEnagás periodically updates its Crisis Management Standard, adapting it to new risks, policies and emerging businesses, establishing various action committees to control incidents depending on the degree of severity and consequences of each scenario. As part of its Global Security Plan, the company organises annual crisis management drills, which enable it to train its professionals at both the technical and highest executive level. Likewise, to facilitate its response capacity, Enagás has maps of both corporate and local stakeholders so that, in the event of a hypothetical crisis situation, both the key people and the communication channels are identified, enabling efficient management.\n\nDuring the year 2023, we continued to promote business continuity, establishing different actions within the company's Transformation Plan that will enable it to achieve improvements in this area.\n\nEnagás also periodically reviews its emergency and self-protection plans and establishes emergency collaboration agreements with the authorities in each Autonomous Community through the signing of agreements in order to achieve a rapid, effective response in the event of a possible crisis situation.\n\nEmergency plans are sent to the relevant public administrations so that they can be taken into account in external emergency plans and in for any communication of information of public interest that may be required.\n\n**Enagás is moving towards a resilient management model, promoting improvements in different areas such as crisis management, business continuity management and accident and emergency management** \n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/98/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left side of the image.

This policy is implemented at the company through internal procedures and controls.\n\n## See the **[Cybersecurity Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Cibersecurity%20policy.pdf)** on our corporate website.\n\nThe Enagás information security management model is applicable to cybersecurity, based on international and national regulations and the continued assessment of cyber risk. This provides, through all means within its reach and in proportion to the threats detected, the resources required so that the organisation has an environment that is aligned with business targets and the cybersecurity targets established. The Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for supervising the company's cybersecurity, and therefore periodically reports to this Committee on the established cyber risk indicators and other relevant matters. [GRI 2-13]\n\nEnagás also has a Cybersecurity Committee chaired by a member of the Executive Committee, which reports quarterly to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Executive Committee on the actions taken to mitigate risk.\n\nIn 2022, Enagás approved its 2022-2024 Strategic Cybersecurity Plan, which establishes the policies to be followed to help ensure a secure, reliable cyberspace, using a 360º approach. For this reason, in 2023, the company has continued to carry out different informative and training actions that contributed to greater awareness and involvement among all professionals, aimed at improving professionals' detection and reaction skills.\n\nEnagás has a cybersecurity management model with segregation of duties between government and operation, as well as a Cybersecurity Master Plan with a three-year scope that is reviewed annually. This plan has been updated in accordance with the requirements of Royal Decree 43/2021; it has designated a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) with the relevant administrative body.\n\nThis Master Plan, based on the results of the risk analysis, is focused on improving the resilience of Enagás' information systems. It also facilitates secure teleworking without affecting the company's normal operations, works on digitalisation-related inertia and the growing migration to cloud solutions.\n\n#### 12/2023\n\n**Enagás has launched a Cyber Awareness platform to make cybersecurity content even more familiar to our professionals. Through this mandatory training space, Enagás professionals are trained to protect their digital lives, both professionally and personally.** \n\n## **In 2023, Enagás launched a Cyber Awareness platform to make cybersecurity content even more familiar to our professionals**\n\nEnagás has a reporting procedure that professionals can follow if they encounter any suspicious situation. Additionally, Enagás carries out periodic phishing simulation exercises to assess its professionals' awareness levels and tailor training measures as needed.\n\nCurrently, Enagás has renewed the ISO 27001:2013 certification for its logistics and commercial systems, gas pipeline control systems and industrial control systems for each type of infrastructure that it operates. In 2023 and 2024, Enagás is updating its management system to the new version of the ISO 27001:2022 standard.\n\nEnagás has implemented procedures to prevent incidents in its technological infrastructure; likewise, it has implemented continuity plans to guarantee the continuity of normal systems operation in the event of changes and incidents and to guarantee rapid recovery. These plans are tested on an ongoing basis throughout the year.\n\nEnagás also takes a series of other actions to ensure the soundness of its information security management systems and IT infrastructures, such as the simulation of cyber-attacks and vulnerability analysis by third parties, audits of the control environment of the information systems that support important processes during the audit of the company's accounts, and so on.\n\nEnagás also manages cyber risks in the life cycle of its suppliers. This enables it to enhance cybers[ec](#page-147-0)urity measures in industrial information systems (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)['](#page-147-0) section in this chapter).\n\nAs enhanced protection for the critical infrastructures operated by Enagás, a General Policy on the Integrated Security of Strategic Infrastructures has been defined in which the processes of physical and logical security have been combined for compliance with Law 8/2011 governing the Protection of Critical Infrastructure (LPIC) and Royal Decree-Law 12/2018 on the security of network and information systems (NIS). Enagás is working towards the full adoption of the requirements of EU Directive 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, as well as the Good Cybersecurity Governance Code published by the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).\n\nSee the\nInfrastructure\n\nSee the **[General Policy on the Integrated Security of Strategic](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)  [Infrastructures](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)** on our corporate website.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/99/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the logo for \"enagas\" on the right.

impacts and dependencies\n\nEnagás, in line with Natural Capital Coalition's Natural Capital Protocol, assesses natural capital's dependencies and impacts in order to identify actions that enable us to minimise our environmental impact.\n\nThe environmental impacts are shown below, ordered by relevance and their origin, as well as the main actions Enagás carries out to prevent and reduce them.\n\nSee the **[Health and

    |\n\nWith regard to natural capital dependencies, Enagás depends on the ecosystems in which its infrastructures are located, so that alterations to these - such as earth movements, flooding, etc., caused by extreme temperature phenomena - constitute a physical risk.\n\nOn an environmental aspect level, energy consumption (natural gas and electricity) is key to carrying out our work and is therefore our main natural capital dependency, alongside the land on which our infrastructures are located. They are also the source of our main environmental impact, greenhouse gas emissions. Within the framework of its ISO 50001-certified energy management system, Enagás analyses the most significant energy consumption in terms\n\nof facilities and equipment, as well as their dependence on the main variables, enabling us to establish and prioritise the energy efficiency initiatives with the greatest impact (see the ['](#page-60-0)[Climate action and](#page-60-0)  [energy efficiency](#page-60-0)['](#page-60-0) section).\n\nConstruction projects generate the company's main impacts on biodiversity. During these projects, Enagás carries out activities for the protection and conservation of flora and fauna species, in accordance with the impact mitigation hierarchy, aimed at preserving ecosystems and their biodiversity. Such activities start with on-site reconnaissance before any work commences in order to check for the presence or absence of species along the route.

These projects restored 100% of the affected land, returning it to its previous state as soon as possible after its alteration. This minimises the risk of erosion and helps re-establish the land's natural watershed, as well as the state of affected habitats and the landscape. In 2023, as a result of construction projects, 133,582  $m^2$  have been disturbed, of which 127,003  $m^2$  have been restored and 52,586  $m^2$  have been revegetated<sup>30</sup>. In addition, 31,301  $m^2$  corresponding to an area disturbed in 2022 have been revegetated in 2023. In 2024, Enagás will continue to work towards the reclamation of the remaining surface area.

For this reason, the company has joined the new Pact for Biodiversity and Natural Capital with the highest level of commitment. This initiative is backed by the Spanish Business and Biodiversity Initiative (IEEB), which is coordinated by the Biodiversity Foundation of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO).** \n\n## **Enagás' biodiversity strategy establishes the objective of no net loss of biodiversity by 2040 and net positive impact on nature by 2050**\n\n### Applying the LEAP process of the TNFD framework to infrastructure operation\n\nIn order to make progress towards meeting our positive impact on nature targets, work was carried out during 2023 on the implementation of the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) process from the TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures) framework. The results obtained are detailed in the following sections.\n\nEnagás is, in turn, using this LEAP process as a base, especially in the location and evaluation phases. This allows it to start valuing the potential natural capital impacts associated with the development of the identified business opportunities starting from a project's v[e](#page-60-0)ry [e](#page-60-0)arly phases (see section on climate risks and opportunities in the '[Climate action and efficiency energy](#page-60-0)['](#page-60-0) section in this chapter).\n\n#### **Sensitive locations**\n\nKnowing in which protected areas we work, as well as the species that live in the areas of influence of our facilities, is fundamental to being able to manage our activities properly, assessing the possible effects in order to prevent impacts and adopt mitigation measures or undertake recovery and conservation projects.\n\nOur infrastructures are mainly located in terrestrial (41%) and freshwater (32%) biomes<sup>31</sup> Of the terrestrial ecosystems, 50% of the installations are located in cultivated areas and temperate forests. Of the freshwater biomes, around 60% are located in man-made ecosystems and wetlands.\n\nTaking into account the different parameters associated with geographic information layers (GIS)<sup>32</sup>, we identified that a high percentage of installations are located in sensitive areas, especially in places with high biodiversity intactness and water stress.\n\n<sup>30</sup> In 2022, 536,619  $m^2$  of the 1,679,201  $m^2$  disturbed were restored.\n\n<sup>31</sup> Source: UICN Global Ecosystem Typology.\n\n<sup>32</sup> Ecosystem integrity: the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) GIS layer is used to show the presence of protected natural areas. Biodiversity importance: the GIS Biodiversity Inactness Index (BII) layer is used to show the presence of areas rich in biodiversity where there are high risks associated with the loss or deterioration of nature. Water stress: the Overall Water Risk (OWR) layer is used to show water-stressed areas, both in terms of water quantity and quality.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/103/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Of the facilities located within critical biodiversity protection areas, the Gaviota and Serrablo underground storage facilities stand out, both of which have a specific biodiversity management plan covering the entire surface area of both facilities (0.11  $km^2$ ). [GRI 304-1]\n\nEnagás conducts biodiversity impact assessments at all of its aboveground facilities (800 operating facilities, which occupy a surface area of 3.5  $km^2$ ), as well as at construction projects carried out at the facilities and in pipeline areas. The entire surface area is assessed for this on a regular basis (installations and construction projects).\n\nEnagás has also identified the endangered species included on the IUCN Red List with habitats in the areas where it operates in order to prevent effects on them.

Therefore, after identifying and assessing the impacts and dependencies during operation, based on the five drivers of biodiversity loss identified by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), we conclude that 56% of the pipelines are classified as priority because they are located in protected areas.\n\n#### **Impacts and dependencies on priority locations and monitoring metrics** [GRI304-2]\n\nThe following table shows the impacts and dependencies identified in priority locations during infrastructure operation, as well as the monitoring metrics identified, both in terms of the state of nature (assessment of the variations in ecosystem conditions generated by Enagás via its activity) and ecosystem services (assessment of

company's materiality analysis and risk assessment processes,\n\n### Type of risk\n\nidentifies and assesses the risk level of each of the risks associated with nature and biodiversity with a scope based on the location of its infrastructure (for more information on ESG risks and their integration in the company's global risk model, see the '[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)' chapter). Thus, the physical risks identified are associated with dependence on ecosystems; the regulatory and reputational risks identified are associated with impacts on ecosystems, and some of them are associated with specific environmental aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions or protected species, as shown in the table below.\n\nThe scope of this analysis is limited to areas where our own operations are conducted, as well as adjacent areas. To carry out this analysis, Enagás has taken the TNFD framework as a base.

It also has an industrial liability policy that covers compensation payments to third parties arising from sudden, accidental and unforeseen pollution or contamination with a limit of 300 million euros per claim. [GRI 3-3]\n\n#### Environmental management\n\nEnagás undertakes its environmental commitments (as outlined in the Health and Safety, Environment and Quality Policy) via its environmental management system. 100% of Enagás activity is ISO 14001 certified.\n\nFurthermore, the Serrablo and Yela underground storage facilities and the Huelva and Barcelona LNG terminals are EMAS certified.\n\nIn line with the ISO 14001 standard, Enagás analyses environmental impacts through assessments of environmental aspects for construction, operation and maintenance activities. Environmental monitoring is carried out through audits, environmental surveillance programmes, assessments of legal compliance at all facilities and monitoring of environmental indicators and improvement plans.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/105/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enaga\" with a green and blue logo on the right.\n\nWhat is more, for infrastructure construction projects, and based on their type and on applicable regulations, environmental impact studies are carried out which include both the impacts themselves and the measures taken to mitigate them. All of this involves establishing consultation processes with stakeholders (see the ['](#page-133-0)[Local](#page-133-0)  [communities](#page-133-0)['](#page-133-0) section).\n\nAll of this enables us to identify the natural capital assets in which we have the greatest impact at facility level and to therefore prioritise environmental actions based on them.\n\n### Natural capital management\n\nEnagás has conducted an assessment of natural capital based on an analysis of environmental materiality at infrastructure level. In certain cases, a more detailed assessment is conducted to analyse the ecosystem services of the environment. This is the case of the Landscape Integration Study that was carried out prior to the construction of the Euskadour Compressor Station and which resulted in the identification of revegetation and recovery measures for soils, vegetation and water courses, with more than 900 species planted. [GRI 3-3]\n\n#### **Natural capital valuation study at the Euskadour Compressor Station** [GRI 304-2]\n\nEnagás has carried out a study to value and monetise environmental impacts at the facility. The project consisted of the following activities and conclusions:\n\n- Identification of the ecosystem services present in the environment and their indicators: mainly regulating services and, to a lesser extent, supply and cultural services.\n- Quantification of the variation of these services at three points in time: during construction, after the implementation of recovery and compensation measures, and after the permit period (25 years). It was found that the impact of construction on the ecosystem services provided by the environment was low thanks to the design and construction criteria used (as established in the Enagás Corporate Biodiversity Guidelines). In addition, measures implemented after construction and in the operating phase have resulted in a significant impact reduction, 64%, in regulating services, a percentage that will increase to 70% by the end of the period due to the effect of the measures.\n- Monetisation of residual debt, with a result of 1,457.55 euros and 1,234.38 euros at the beginning and end of the concession period, respectively.\n- Proposed compensation actions to neutralise this debt, which have been included in the company's biodiversity plan.\n\n#### **Collaborative projects and nature-based solutions**\n\nSince 2016, Enagás has been working on collaborative projects with different stakeholders (environmental companies, other companies, Public Administrations and farmers) to carry out vegetation control through the pasturing of range livestock (horses) along gas pipelines. [GRI 304-3]\n\nThe results obtained over the years have demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of the use of livestock, for example in the growth of plant cover resulting from the animals' activity.\n\nThis is the case for gas pipeline sections located in the province of Huesca, attached to the Caspe Transmission Centre and the Sabiñánigo Transmission Centre, and the sections located in the Alto Bernesga Biosphere Reserve (León). In these sections, regular grazing is used as the most sustainable solution for vegetation control, due to its high positive impact on the environment and the community:\n\n- Fertilisation and soil disturbance by livestock has a favourable effect on flora and fauna, increasing biodiversity. For this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is assessing its classification as a nature-based solution.\n- It means giving visibility to the ability of the livestock sector to provide ecosystem services.\n\nDuring 2023, the assessment of the natural capital impact of these actions began, with the aim of learning about differential biodiversity rates in areas with livestock activity compared to areas without it.\n\nTo this end, several samplings were carried out during the year to measure the following parameters:\n\n- Richness of plant biodiversity (herbaceous (including floristic richness), shrub and tree species) and arthropod biodiversity.\n- Visual vegetation cover.\n- Arthropod abundance.\n\nPrevious results obtained after sampling were favourable, reinforcing the positive effect of livestock on the biodiversity of the grazed area.\n\n#### **2023**\n\n**Enagás maintains a collaboration agreement with the environmental company Agrovidar and Red Eléctrica to replace the usual pruning and felling methods for biomass control with the use of extensive livestock pasturing. Two female farmers and their herds of cattle and horses will maintain 17 hectares of the Alto Bernesga biosphere reserve through which a Red Eléctrica and an Enagás line run.** \n\n**Regular grazing was shown to be the most sustainable alternative to regular logging and pruning because of its high positive impact on the environment and the community.** \n\n**The project is open to other companies, public entities, livestock farms and shepherd schools to replicate it in natural areas affected by infrastructures.** \n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nCircular Economy [GRI 306-2] At Enagás, we have signed the 'Circular Economy Pact', committing ourselves to promoting the transition towards a circular economy. To this end, we are working along the following lines: Actions aimed at process circularity: [GRI 306-2] Energy use and reducing the carbon footprint of our own and third-party production processes • Enagás' Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan, which has enabled us to reduce our carbon footprint by 48% compared to 2014 (see the ['Climate action and energy efficiency'](#page-60-0) section). • Electricity generation projects for our own and third-party consumption, using renewable energies, cleaner technologies and more efficient processes, through which we generated 9.1% of the electricity consumed in 2023 (see the ['Climate action and energy efficiency'](#page-60-0) section). • A project to make use of the residual cold produced by liquefied natural gas (LNG), making it possible for the residual cold produced in the regasification process of the LNG terminals to be used in thirdparty air conditioning installations or industrial processes, producing energy savings in energy costs and a reduction in the carbon footprint. Use of renewable energy • Integration of renewable gases into the Spanish and European Gas System through infrastructures, the promotion of a future hydrogen network in Europe and the creation of a market for renewable gases (see section '[Renewable gases](#page-25-0)' in the '[Decarbonisation and carbon neutrality'](#page-23-0) section of the '[Our](#page-16-0)  [commitment to the energy transition'](#page-16-0) chapter). • Hydrogen generation projects at LNG terminals for own consumption (see the '[Innovation and](#page-49-0)  [corporate venture'](#page-49-0) section in the '[Our commitment to the energy transition'](#page-16-0) chapter). • 100% of electricity consumption from guaranteed renewable energy beginning in 2021 (see the ['Climate action and energy efficiency'](#page-60-0) section). Life cycle optimisation for products and facilities. Recovery and extension of the useful life of auxiliary substances and incorporation of eco-design principles • Methanol water treatment plant at the Serrablo underground storage facility, which in 2023 recovered 8,366 litres of methanol. • Extension of the useful life of oils and lubricants used in the equipment of its facilities by cleaning and filtering these products. • Recycling of triethylene glycol (TEG) used in the gas drying process at underground storage facilities by subjecting it to a distillation process that optimises the life cycle of this product. • Incorporation of eco-design criteria in construction projects. • Use of the gas pipeline network route to install fibre optics. • Implementation of mechanical weeding in fields to replace water-diluted herbicides. [Report](#page-3-0)\n\nWater saving and efficiency • Rainwater capture systems in facilities used for fire suppression and irrigation. • Replacement of lawns with native vegetation at facilities for more responsible water use, which will allow us to reduce water consumption by up to 80% at two of the facilities with the highest consumption. Ecological remediation and ecosystem restoration • Biodiversity Strategy: adopt nature-based solutions to preserve, restore and manage ecosystems and species, contributing to climate change mitigation, resilience and adaptation with benefits for nature. • Reclamation and revegetation at 100% of infrastructure development projects with impacts on biodiversity. • Vegetation control through extensive livestock management along pipelines. Waste recovery and recycling • Waste recovery and recycling treatments required of waste managers, enabling us to recover 91.6% of waste in 2023. • Methanol water treatment plant at the Serrablo underground storage facility, which in 2023 treated 75,754 litres of this waste, recovering the methanol. The resulting water was injected back into the storage facility. Product reuse • Signing of a collaboration agreement with Oroel to research the development of new personal protective clothing from material already in use in order to give them a second useful life. • In 2023, disused furniture, outdated corporate material and more than 450 pairs of safety footwear were donated for further re-use.

Enagás is committed to promoting the circular economy through the efficient use of these materials, reducing consumption, pollution, waste generation and its impact on the environment while encouraging innovation.\n\n#### Consumption of main auxiliary materials\n\n| Auxiliary material                | 2021        | 2022        | 2023    |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| Tetrahydrothiophene (THT) (kg)    | 432,202     | 440,839     | 391,783 |\n| Sodium hypochlorite (kg)          | 541,812 (1) | 523,882 (1) | 554,282 |\n| Chlorine dioxide (kg)             | 26,940      | 45,695      | 9,946   |\n| Methanol (litres)                 | 589,247     | 265,030     | 431,894 |\n| Triethylene glycol (TEG) (litres) | 9,369       | 2,050       | 3,127   |\n\n(1) Data recalculated to include the consumption of the Castor underground storage facility. [GRI 2-4]\n\nIn 2023, there was an increase in methanol consumption (63% compared to 2022) and in triethylene glycol consumption (53% compared to 2022). These products are used in the gas extraction process in underground storage facilities, and their variation is directly related to the increase in extraction activity (which increased more than 110% compared to 2022). The sum of the consumption of chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite, substances used as biocides in LNG terminals, did not change significantly compared to the previous year.\n\n## Waste generation and management\n\n[GRI 3-3, GRI 306-1]\n\nThe waste generated by Enagás is mostly associated with the maintenance of facilities and equipment, and is mainly liquid waste.\n\nEnagás has implemented a system of segregation, management, storage and delivery to authorised managers of\n\nhazardous and non-hazardous waste who manage the waste outside the company's facilities. However, in 2023, 2.56% of waste was treated in-house at Enagás (75,754 litres of water with methanol treated in the methanol regeneration unit of the Serrablo underground storage).\n\nIn 2023, Enagás obtained the 'Zero Waste' certification from AENOR<sup>33</sup>, which recognises the company's progress in maximising the volume of waste recycled or recovered, as well as minimising the waste generated. Therefore, in its various contracts with waste managers, the company has set out the treatments to be applied to each waste product in line with applicable legislation and its commitments, which include the target of treating (recycling/ recovering) a percentage equal to or greater than 90% of all hazardous and non-hazardous waste. In addition, Enagás has a plan with actions aimed at increasing the percentage of waste recovery at infrastructure facilities as well as concrete actions and objectives to minimise waste generation. These improvement actions are identified in the quarterly and annual monitoring that Enagás carries out of all waste at its facilities, as well as during the waste environmental aspect assessment. Enagás provides all the necessary resources, both material and human, to ensure they are carried out.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás implemented a waste management platform that guarantees better traceability of the treatment of the waste generated, greater control of management documentation in accordance with the requirements of each autonomous community and optimal communication with government.\n\nFor years, Enagás has been implementing measures to reduce waste generation and improve waste treatment, as well as holding regular campaigns to raise awareness of this issue. [GRI 306-2, GRI 306-4, GRI 306-5]\n\n## **Enagás has recycled/recovered 91.6% of all waste generated**\n\nImage /page/107/Figure/22 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the amount of recovery/recycling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2021, the amount of non-hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,121, and the amount that was disposed of was 123. In 2021, the amount of hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 3,892, and the amount that was disposed of was 62. In 2022, the amount of non-hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,304, and the amount that was disposed of was 180. In 2022, the amount of hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 928, and the amount that was disposed of was 51. In 2023, the amount of non-hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,503, and the amount that was disposed of was 128. In 2023, the amount of hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,207, and the amount that was disposed of was 121.

The waste that has been disposed of is of various types, many of which are difficult to recover (asbestos, aqueous cleaning liquids and aqueous waste containing hydrocarbons). Enagás continues to work with waste managers to increase this percentage as much as possible.\n\nIn 2023, the hazardous waste generated increased by 36% compared to the previous year due to the increase in waste water with methanol (liquid industrial waste), which represents more than 60% of Enagás' hazardous waste. This waste is generated in underground storage facilities during the extraction period. Therefore, this waste is generated proportionally to the storage extraction activity, depending also\n\non the amount of water contained in the wells. In 2023, extraction activity increased more than 110% compared to the previous year; consequently, the amount of this waste has increased. In 2023, the volume of waste water containing hydrocarbons also increased significantly due to a specific incident that occurred during the startup of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal. A quantity of oil was spilt, which, although initially relatively little, became a larger volume due to heavy rainfall in the area.\n\nOn the other hand, the volume of non-hazardous waste generated increased by 10% compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in septic tank sludge (non-industrial liquid waste). 100% of this waste has been recycled/recovered.\n\n#### Waste generated and managed by waste typology and waste destination (t)\n\n[GRI 306-3, GRI 306-4, GRI 306-5]\n\n| Type of waste | Waste destination    |                                        | 2021     | 2022     | 2023     |\n|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Non-hazardous | Recovery / recycling | Preparation for re-use                 | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Recycling                              | 1,068.10 | 1,285.05 | 1,391.53 |\n|               |                      | Other recovery operations(1)           | 52.50    | 19.14    | 111.91   |\n|               |                      | Total recovery/recycling               | 1,120.60 | 1,304.19 | 1,503.44 |\n|               | Disposal             | Incineration (with energy recovery)    | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Incineration (without energy recovery) | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Transfer to a landfill                 | 25.07    | 28.53    | 22.13    |\n|               |                      | Other disposal operations(1)           | 98.28    | 151.87   | 105.63   |\n|               |                      | Total elimination                      | 123.35   | 180.40   | 127.76   |\n| Total waste   |                      |                                        | 1,243.95 | 1,484.59 | 1,631.20 |\n| Hazardous     | Recovery / recycling | Preparation for re-use                 | 0.42     | 0.09     | 0.01     |\n|               |                      | Recycling(1)                           | 3,855.96 | 893.57   | 1,120.75 |\n|               |                      | Other recovery operations(1)           | 36.15    | 34.64    | 86.21    |\n|               |                      | Total recovery/recycling               | 3,892.53 | 928.30   | 1,206.97 |\n|               | Disposal             | Incineration (with energy recovery)    | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Incineration (without energy recovery) | 0.80     | 0.49     | 1.80     |\n|               |                      | Transfer to a landfill                 | 6.62     | 4.91     | 15.64    |\n|               |                      | Other disposal operations              | 54.72    | 45.73    | 102.93   |\n|               |                      | Total elimination                      | 62.14    | 51.13    | 120.37   |\n| Total waste   |                      |                                        | 3,954.67 | 979.43   | 1,327.34 |\n\n(1) Data for 2021 and 2022 have been recalculated to include the waste generated at the Castor underground storage facility.

In 2023, the amount of surface water is 3,428, the amount of groundwater is 6,530, and the amount of water from the municipal network is 89,465.\n\n(1) Data for 2021 and 2022 have been recalculated to include water withdrawn at the Castor underground storage facility. [GRI 2-4]\n\nIn 2023, water drawn from the municipal network increased due to the start-up of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal (whose consumption increased by 120% compared to 2022) and minor leaks and incidents at several facilities, all of which have been resolved. This has prevented the achievement of the 5% municipal water reduction target set for 2023. Enagás also draws water from other sources, mainly for sanitary use, irrigation and fire-fighting equipment. Of the 99,423 m<sup>3</sup> of municipal water used in 2023 for these applications, 18,398 m<sup>3</sup> have been discharged. This water is mainly discharged into the sewage system and septic tanks, in the latter case complying with all the limit values established by the relevant authorities. As a result, no improvements in wastewater quality have been identified. [GRI 303-4]\n\nWater consumption in 2023 was 101,136 m<sup>3</sup> (including the 9,254 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater captured at the Barcelona LNG terminal for desalination)<sup>36</sup>, a figure that represents only 0.04% of the total water withdrawn. [GRI 303-5]\n\nEnagás also has fire suppression water tanks at its facilities, with an estimated volume of stored water of 10,857 m<sup>3</sup>. At the Denia and Lumbier compressor stations, these basins are filled using recycled rainwater.\n\n### **Enagás' main water intake is seawater, which is fully returned in the state which it was withdrawn**\n\nEnagás has been implementing measures to reduce water consumption for years, as well as holding regular campaigns to raise awareness of this issue, including the implementation in 2023 of mechanical weeding in fields to replace water-diluted pesticide application at two facilities (its extension to other applicable facilities is being assessed), as well as the continuation of measures to reduce consumption in the event of drought at the Barcelona LNG terminal. Each year, Enagás carries out individualised monitoring of quarterly consumption trends at its facilities in order to identify improvements in water efficiency. On the basis of this monitoring, Enagás has set targets to reduce water consumption at facilities that exceed the average consumption of the last three years. Together, this means that 2024's overall target will reduce domestic water consumption by 2% compared to 2023. [GRI 3-3, GRI 303-1, GRI 303-2]\n\n### Air pollution [GRI 3-3, GRI 305-7]\n\nThe main non-greenhouse gases emitted at our facilities are CO, SOX, NOX, PM10 particles and Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC). These emissions are produced by the consumption of natural gas and diesel by various pieces of equipment and, therefore, are directly related to CO2 emissions. Energy efficiency measures and CO2 emission reduction targets (see the '[Climate action and energy](#page-60-0) [efficiency](#page-60-0)' section) are directly related to the reduction of these atmospheric emissions.\n\n#### Non-GHG emissions (tonnes) (1)(2)\n\nImage /page/110/Figure/13 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the levels of different pollutants in the air from 2021 to 2023. The pollutants are CO, NOx, SOx, PM10, and NMVOC. In 2021, the levels were: CO: 35, NOx: 217, SOx: 3, PM10: 3, NMVOC: 8. In 2022, the levels were: CO: 44, NOx: 329, SOx: 4, PM10: 3, NMVOC: 11. In 2023, the levels were: CO: 41, NOx: 249, SOx: 4, PM10: 5, NMVOC: 10.\n\n(1) Enagás does not emit the following compounds: Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). The source of the emission factors used for the calculation of these emissions is the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2023, by the European Environment Agency.\n\n(2) The data for 2021 and 2022 have been recalculated to include emissions from the Castor underground storage facility. [GRI 2-4]\n\nIn 2023, the decrease in non-greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year is directly related to the decrease in natural gas consumption (see the '[Climate action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section), which has enabled Enagás to meet its 2023 target of reducing NOx emissions by 5% compared to 2022.\n\n<sup>36</sup> Of the 79,581 m<sup>3</sup> withdrawn in 2021 for these uses, 14,365 m<sup>3</sup> were discharged, meaning that water consumption totalled 69,770 m<sup>3</sup> (an amount that includes the 4,554 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater pumped at the Barcelona LNG terminal for desalination). Of the 68,678 m<sup>3</sup> withdrawn in 2022 for these uses, 16,602 m<sup>3</sup> were discharged, meaning that water consumption totalled 52,076 m<sup>3</sup> (an amount that includes the 1,350 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater pumped at the Barcelona LNG terminal for desalination).\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/111/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated\" and \"Annual Accounts\" stacked on top of each other.\n\nBy 2024, Enagás has set a target of reducing its NOx emissions by 5% compared to 2023, which it will achieve mainly through its Emissions Reduction and Energy Efficiency Plan. This will enable the company to achieve its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2040 and meet its emissions reduction targets.\n\nEnagás carries out regulatory and voluntary atmospheric checks (selfchecks) at all its combustion sites. The control actions are as follows:\n\n- Periodic regulatory inspections (conducted by an authorised inspection organisation (AIO).\n- Annual TESTO check carried out with their own resources (Analysing team and Enagás employees).\n\nBoth the regulatory inspections and the internal TESTO checks are planned annually for every facility as part of the 'Atmospheric Monitoring Programme'.\n\nNoise at Enagás' facilities is produced by the operation of regulators, turbines, vaporisers and pumps among others. Regular environmental noise measurements are carried out at all facilities, where legally required, around their perimeter to ensure that noise levels remain within the limits established in applicable legislation. In those cases where deviations are found, corrective actions are implemented (acoustic screens, silencers, soundproofing, etc.).\n\nWith regard to light pollution, Enagás has also reduced night-time lighting at its facilities by switching off the lighting at night, with the exception of LNG terminals, where minimum perimeter lighting is maintained.

This is all in accordance with the Conflict of Interest Policy, the provisions of current corporate and regulatory regulations and the Enagás Corporate Governance System, with the ultimate aim of avoiding potential conflicts of interest and ensuring full transparency in this regard. For more details on these mechanisms, see the '[Annual Corporate Governance Report](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)', section D.6.\n\n## See the **[Conflict of Interest Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Policy%20of%20Conflicts%20of%20Interest%202023.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nEvery year, an assessment of the Board is performed with the participation of an independent external expert. This assessment is performed objectively and from a best-practice viewpoint by means of questionnaires completed by all members of the Board. The conclusions of this phase are checked in interviews with the same Directors. The aim is to sustain and bolster the performance of the Board of Directors. For more details on the results of the assessment carried out during 2023, see the '[Annual Corporate Governance](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)  [Repor](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)t', sections C.1.17 and C.1.18.\n\nAs a result of the assessment, it was concluded that the Board of Directors performs its duties in accordance with best corporate governance practices. In accordance with the priorities identified by the members of the Board of Directors in the previous year's performance review, the following lines of action were pursued in 2023:\n\n- Increase the duration of sessions.\n- Report information on a quarterly basis regarding developments in risk assessments, compliance actions and the monitoring of actions to mitigate cybersecurity risks.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for Enaga.

The Remuneration Committee proposes the remuneration criteria, within the limits set forth in the Articles of Association and pursuant to the decisions taken at the General Shareholders' Meeting. The Committee also monitors the transparency of remuneration. Thus, in 2021, the General Shareholders' Meeting approved the new Directors' Remuneration Policy 2022-2024. This is largely a continuation of previous policies, maintaining their fundamental premises around the criteria of independence, stakeholder involvement (the remuneration report is put to a consultative vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting) and internal and external advice, incorporating best practices. The new Directors' Remuneration Policy 2025-2027 will be approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2024.\n\n#### Remuneration of the Board of Directors in 2023 [GRI 2-19, GRI 2-20]\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors for their Board membership and those corresponding to the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer for the exercise of their executive and non-executive functions, respectively, during 2023 were approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024\", and was modified by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022, as Item 8 of the Agenda.\n\nThe Chairman, Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá, was beneficiary of the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on March 29, 2019 as Item 8 of the Agenda. During the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years, the aforementioned incentive was settled; a total of 25,061 gross shares were awarded in 2022 and 27,398 gross shares in 2023 (valued at 502 thousand euros), which will not vest until April 2024.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022 as item 9 of the Agenda, assigning him a total of 96,970 rights relating to shares. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Management Committee) are equally beneficiaries of the 2019-2021 Long-Term\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/117/Picture/5 description: The image contains the text \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a gray, sans-serif font.

In the terms approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, in the settlement of this incentive in the 2023 financial year, 29,239 gross shares and a cash incentive amount of 205 thousands of euros corresponded to them.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Executive Committee) are equally beneficiaries of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan. As approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, the Board has assigned them a total of 145,764 rights relating to shares as well as an incentive in cash amounting to approximately 1,000 thousands of euros. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nThe Group has outsourced its pension commitments with respect to its Senior Managers through a mixed group insurance policy for\n\npension commitments, including benefits in the event of survival, death, and employment disability. The Chairman was part of the group covered by this policy and of the total premium paid for this during 2022, 62 thousands of euros corresponded to him. The Chief Executive Officer does not have a pension commitment instrument, as he does not have an employment relationship with the company, but rather a commercial relationship. The Chief Executive Officer maintains an assimilated individual savings insurance at a cost of 222 thousands of euros.\n\nThe members of the Senior Management also form part of the group insured under the mixed group insurance policy for pension commitments. The total premium paid for the same during the financial year amounts to 698 thousands of euros.\n\nThe aforementioned remuneration, broken down for each member of the Board of Directors, without taking into account insurance premiums, is as follows:\n\n#### Remuneration of the Board of Directors (thousands of euros)[GRI 2-19]\n\n| Director                                                                    | 2023 (5) | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá (Chairman) (1)                                 | 730      | 1,594 |\n| Mr Arturo Gonzalo Aizpiri (Chief Executive Officer) (3) (4) (5)             | 2,152    | 969   |\n| Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (Proprietary Director) (4) | 160      | 160   |\n| Mr José Blanco López (Independent Director) (4)                             | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms Ana Palacio Vallelersundi (Independent Leading Director) (4)             | 190      | 190   |\n| Mr José Montilla Aguilera (Independent Director) (3) (4)                    | 175      | 175   |\n| Mr Cristóbal José Gallego Castillo (Independent Director) (4)               | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms Eva Patricia Úrbez Sanz (Independent Director) (4)                       | 160      | 160   |\n| Mr Santiago Ferrer Costa (Proprietary Director) (4)                         | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms Natalia Fabra Portela (Independent Director) (3) (4)                     | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms María Teresa Arcos Sánchez (Independent Director) (3) (4)                | 175      | 170   |\n| Mr David Sandalow (Independent Director) (3) (4)                            | 160      | 114   |\n| Ms Clara García Fernández- Muro (Independent Director) (3) (4)              | 160      | 113   |\n| Ms María Teresa Costa Campi (Independent Director) (3) (4)                  | 160      | 114   |\n| Mr Manuel Gabriel González Ramos (Independent Director) (3) (4)             | 160      | 113   |\n| Mr Ignacio Grangel Vicente (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | 0        | 44    |\n| Mr Gonzalo Solana González (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | 0        | 44    |\n| Mr Antonio Hernández Mancha (Independent Director) (3)(4)                   | 0        | 44    |\n| Ms Isabel Tocino Biscarolasaga (Independent Director) (3) (4)               | 0        | 44    |\n| Mr Marcelino Oreja Arburúa (former Chief Executive Officer) (2) (3)         | 0        | 431   |\n| Total                                                                       | 5,022    | 5,119 |\n\n(1) The remuneration of the Executive Chairman for the exercise of his executive duties during 2022 was approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years\" as approved as Item 10 of the Agenda as amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022 under Item 8 of the Agenda to cover his remuneration as non-executive Chairman as from that date. In 2023, the Chairman obtained fixed remuneration of 600 thousands of euros. He also obtained remuneration for Board membership amounting to 130 thousands of euros, totalling 730 thousands of euros, and a individual savings insurance at a cost of 62 thousands of euros.\n\n(2) The remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 financial year was approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years\", approved as Item 10 of the Agenda and modified by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022, as Item 8 of the Agenda. During financial year 2023, he obtained fixed remuneration of 1,000 thousands of euros and has accrued a variable remuneration of 583 thousands of euros. In addition, he obtained remuneration in the amount of 130 thousands of euros for Board membership, as well as other remuneration in kind amounting to 89 thousands of euros (the changes in remuneration in kind with respect to previous years are exclusively a result of measurement differences without there having been any additional items included in the remuneration), in addition, the company has implemented a 2022-2024 ILP of which the current Chief Executive Officer is beneficiary and whose settlement will take place as from 2025, under the terms explained in this report. During 2023 the Chief Executive Officer has accrued 350 thousand euros for this concept, totalling 2,152 thousand euros. In addition, he was also the beneficiary of a life insurance policy with a premium of 73 thousands of euros for the year. The Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. Item 9 of its Agenda states that the meeting assigned him a total of 96,970 performance shares or rights relating to shares. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's targets will be generated within thirty (30) days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025. In addition, the CEO maintains an individual savings insurance at a cost of 222 thousands of euros.\n\n(3) The remuneration for these Directors relating to Board and committee membership was approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting on March 31, 2022 as part of the proposal to modify the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023, and 2024 financial years\".\n\n(4) On February 21, 2022 the Board of Directors co-opted Mr Arturo Gonzalo Aizpiri as Executive Director to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the former Chief Executive Officer, Mr Marcelino Oreja Arburúa, on that date. On March 31, 2022, Mr Antonio Hernández Mancha, Mr Gonzalo Solana González, Mr Ignacio Grangel Vicente and Ms Isabel Tocino Biscarolasaga stepped down from their posts, while Mr David Sandalow, Mr Manuel González Ramos, Ms Clara García Fernández-Muro and Ms María Teresa Costa Campi were appointed as new Directors.\n\n(5) The average remuneration of Directors in 2023, broken down by sex, amounted to 343 thousands of euros for men and 168 thousands of euros for women. The difference in remuneration is due to the fact that the Chairman and the CEO are men (remuneration averaged 162 thousands of euros for men, excluding the Chairman and the CEO).\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-118-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/118/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in gray font.

[GRI 2-23, GRI 2-24, GRI 2-25]\n\nIn 2023, Enagás updated its Code of Ethics to incorporate best practices and ethical standards, highlighting the following aspects:\n\n- Adaptation of the Code of Ethics to the challenges posed by the development of the company's 2022-2030 Strategic Plan.\n- Adaptation of the Whistleblowing Line (Ethics Channel) to regulations which require that communications through it can be anonymous and will be handled confidentially; Enagás was already in compliance with this regulation.\n- Reinforcement of the message of the separation of Enagás' activities in the different areas in which it operates.\n- Inclusion of a section on sanctions, whereby Enagás reflects its firm commitment to comply with national and international sanctions and embargo regulations, as well as other regulations related to financial and commercial sanctions, and any others that may be applicable to us.\n\nIn line with this update, in 2024, all Enagás professionals will be asked to confirm via signature that they have read, are familiar with and understand the content of the new Enagás Group Code of Ethics (98% of professionals signed this declaration for the previous version).\n\nThe Enagás Group's Code of Ethics is developed through policies, guidelines, standards and procedures. As for the corporate policy management model, the Board of Directors is responsible for approving said policies, while the organisational units involved in the different matters are responsible for ensuring the implementation of the various commitments and their integration into internal procedures. [GRI 2-12. GRI 2-13, GRI 2-24]\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás updated its Code of Ethics to incorporate best practices and ethical standards**\n\nEnagás has the following procedures in place associated with the Code of Ethics:\n\n• Procedure for the functioning of the Ethical Compliance Committee. The Committee, functionally and directly dependent on the Board of Directors' Audit and Compliance Committee, has competencies relating to the Code of Ethics.\n\n- Procedure for managing the offering and acceptance of gifts, which states that professionals who offer or receive gifts are obligated to report them. This procedure establishes as a general rule that payments in kind - or any other benefit that, due to its value, properties or circumstances, is more than purely symbolic may not be made, offered or received.\n- Procedure for management of consultations and reporting regarding irregularities or breaches of the Ethics and Compliance Model in order to encourage compliance with the Code of Ethics and the regulations that govern its implementation. For this purpose, the company enables Enagás employees and the company's suppliers, contractors and those who collaborate with it or act on its behalf, including business partners, to resolve any doubts or to report any irregularities or breaches through one of the following channels or any other means the company may set up in the future (Whistleblowing Line), informing the party who made the report of the status of their report at all times.

In this area, although Enagás already had an Whistleblowing Line, it adapted it in 2023 to the new regulations, allowing communications to be anonymous and to be handled confidentially (they may not be disclosed to the reported party or to any third party without the consent of the informant, thus guaranteeing the confidentiality of the informant's identity).\n\nSee the **[Internal Reporting System Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Internal%20Reporting%20System%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nsolidated\nual Accounts\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nThe procedure for handling notifications and queries regarding irregularities or breaches of the Ethics and Compliance Model sets out the stages for handling received messages:\n\n- Receipt of report: all reports are received by the Secretary and the Chairman of the Ethical Compliance Committee simultaneously.\n- Prior analysis of the report and study of the information provided: the Secretary and Chairman of the Ethical Compliance Committee shall assess whether the report is to be accepted or rejected.\n- Deliberation on notification and information to the reporter: the Secretary and Chairman of the Ethics Compliance Committee shall respond to the reporter within the legally established time frame on the decision taken on the report.\n- Analysis and assessment of the message: carried out by the Ethical Compliance Committee, together with the Enagás managements or bodies that it considers appropriate in each case. It may be supported by third parties.\n- Resolution and notification: The Ethical Compliance Committee will take the relevant decisions regarding the notified case. The Secretary and/or Chairman of the committee will communicate the conclusions to the reporter.\n\nEnagás is committed to resolving all reports received. In 2023, the average time for handling notifications submitted to the Whistleblowing Line, from the time the reporter sends the report to the time the reporter is notified of the agreed resolution and the conclusions and actions reached, was less than 50 days.\n\nAny non-compliance with the Code of Ethics and with the regulations that implement it shall be analysed by the Ethical Compliance Committee. When it is found that a person has contravened the Code of Ethics, the Ethical Compliance Committee, together with the People and Transformation General Management, will propose the corresponding disciplinary measures based on the regulations in force and the applicable labour framework.\n\nIn 2023, seven notifications were received (three communications in 2022) through the different modalities of the Whistleblowing Line: [GRI 205-3]\n\n- Five messages about labour matters:\n- A message relating to a case of possible workplace harassment; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, it was concluded that although no workplace harassment took place, there were acts of disrespect and professional discredit. The People and Transformation General Management issued a written warning to the person to whom the message pertained and ordered a follow-up of the requested attitude change, warning that if no change was seen, punitive measures would be taken.\n- A message concerning a case of possible workplace harassment and false accusations; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, it was concluded that although no workplace harassment took place, there were false accusations towards another employee, and a written reprimand was issued by the People and Transformation General Management to the person to whom the message pertained.\n- A message concerning a case of possible discrimination and access to private correspondence; after due assessment and the launch of\n\nan information-gathering investigation, this complaint was dismissed as spurious.\n\n- A message concerning a case of possible inappropriate treatment of an employee; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, this complaint was dismissed due to a lack of evidence supporting the reported facts.\n- A message to the Legal Services and Compliance Department from the Business Development and Affiliates General Management regarding potential wrongdoing by an employee of one of our affiliates. The compliance officer of the affiliate was notified in order to manage the report in accordance with their own whistleblowing procedure, as it was an affiliate over which the Enagás Group did not hold effective control, in accordance with the provisions of our Code of Ethics; the report was dismissed due to a lack of evidence provided.\n- A message concerning a case of a regulatory infringement by a contractor of an affiliate; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, this complaint was dismissed as spurious.\n\nThe commitments to responsible business conduct set out in the Code of Ethics are translated into specific policies and corporate guidelines. These policies, which are approved at the highest Company level, by the Board of Directors, apply to all employees, executives and administrators of all companies that make up the Enagás Group, including those affiliates over which it holds effective control, within the limits set out under applicable regulations. For those affiliates in which the Enagás Group does not hold effective control, the company shall encourage principles and guidelines that are consistent with those set out in these policies. With regard to third parties with which Enagás maintains business relations (regular suppliers and national or international business partners), Enagás shall promote principles and guidelines consistent with its Code of Ethics and its Policies, so that third parties have a framework of ethics and integrity aligned with that existing at Enagás.\n\nAs a result of the Whistleblowing Line messages described above, two labour-related infractions of the Code of Ethics were identified in 2023: one infraction for lack of respect and professional discrediting and another for false accusations (no infraction in 2022 and 2021). Both infractions were dealt with and appropriate action was taken, which consisted of issuing a warning to the persons responsible for the infractions.\n\n## Compliance Management System\n\n#### [GRI 2-23, GRI 2-24, GRI 2-25]\n\nThe Enagás Compliance Management System is overseen by a specific functional area, which is supported by synergistic functions and other corporate support areas including the participation of local compliance officers located in certain countries where Enagás operates.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company entrusts the exercise of the Compliance Function to the Ethical Compliance Committee (ECC), a chartered, high-level body with autonomous initiative and control powers of an executive and decision-oriented nature. The Committee has a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), as its executive unit.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/121/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enaga\" in blue on the right, with a green and blue circle around it.\n\nThe Head of the Compliance Function (the Legal Advice and Compliance Director), who is a member of the Ethical Compliance Committee, reports organically to the General Secretariat and functionally to the Board of Directors through the Audit and Compliance Committee, with which they communicate and report on their activities, thus becoming a high-level Enagás committee.\n\nThe Compliance Function is autonomous, carrying out its tasks in accordance with the Compliance Policy and the standards and procedures that implement it. It is endowed with the utmost independence, so that its judgement and its way of proceeding are not conditioned by issues that prevent or hinder it from freely carrying out its essential tasks in order to achieve Compliance objectives. [GRI 2-13]\n\nThe appointment and eventual dismissal of the Head of Legal Counsel and Compliance shall be carried out through Enagás' existing procedures for such purposes, also requiring the approval of the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Enagás Compliance Management System is built around the Compliance Policy and the rules and procedures that implement it.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás updated its Compliance Policy to emphasise the independence of the Compliance Function, which proactively and autonomously oversees the proper functioning and effectiveness of its Compliance Management System and the effectiveness of its controls, without prejudice to the supervisory responsibilities corresponding to other entities and divisions within the company. The addition of the foundational elements that show the independence of the Compliance Function and the suitability of the members of the Ethical Compliance Committee and the Head of the Compliance Function are particularly notable.\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás updated its Compliance Policy to emphasise the independence of the Compliance Function**\n\nThe Compliance Function is in charge of managing the Compliance System in accordance with the provisions of the Policy and the General Compliance Standard, also identifying those responsible for other synergistic areas or areas that may regulate matters subject to monitoring on its part, in order to coordinate with these managers the prevention, detection and management of any non-compliance risks associated with their activities. The Compliance Function also assumes other responsibilities related to the System, including but not limited to training and raising awareness in compliance matters and the management of non-compliance risks.\n\nThe Management System also sets out a double reporting line for the Compliance Function: one through the corporate areas and the other managed by Compliance Officers at the different subsidiaries in countries in which they have been appointed. The Compliance Function thus coordinates compliance risks globally, avoiding information losses and inconsistencies.\n\nThe General Compliance Standard establishes a sanctions procedure to implement the most important aspects of external due diligence at Enagás with regard to the rules on embargoes and sanctions imposed by international bodies that may be imposed on third parties with which Enagás has a relationship. [GRI 2-23, GRI 2-24, GRI 2-25]\n\nSee the **[Compliance Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Compliance-Policy-Enagas.pdf)** on our corporate website.\n\n## Corporate Defence\n\nAs part of in the Compliance Management System, Enagás has a Corporate Defence Programme. It acts as the core of the company's criminal compliance, notwithstanding the existence of policies, procedures and controls that illustrate its content and contribute to preventing crimes being committed by any person who is part of Enagás as well as, in their respective areas of relation, by contractors, suppliers, business partners and any third party that collaborates with or acts on their behalf.\n\nThis programme is based on the company's Corporate Defence Policy, which includes commitments on crime prevention that reflect the company's resolute opposition to the commission of any criminal offences and its will to combat such acts, in line with the company's principle of \"zero tolerance\" towards the commission of crimes.\n\nThe Corporate Defence Programme in Spain includes the following elements:\n\n- Criminal risks, taking into account the activities carried out by the company and its exposure to the commission of different crimes. These include Money Laundering, establishing specific controls to prevent and detect possible acts that could cause this risk to become a reality.\n- Roles and responsibilities defined by a governance structure aligned with Art. 31 bis 2.1 and 2 of the Spanish Criminal Code. In this respect, the role of the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has been defined as the Crime Prevention Body.\n- Map of criminal risks and activities exposed to those risks.\n\nWithin this map, Enagás has taken into account some particularly important risks and included them in the Bribery and Corruption Risk in a broad sense (such as bribery, corruption in business and money laundering), so as to ensure special vigilance and control of activities that could lead to conducts related to these crimes, without falling under the specific criminal type. In this regard, Enagás has updated its risk map in 2023, adapting it to the regulatory changes that have modified the Spanish Criminal Code and expanded the catalogue of offences attributable to legal entities.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Annual Report** [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n- Inventory of controls, both general and specific, that help prevent potential crimes from being committed at Enagás.\n- Disciplinary system articulated around compliance with the Code of Ethics which ensures compliance with the model via disciplinary measures.\n\nIn addition to its Corporate Defence Programme, in line with the Spanish Criminal Code, Enagás has specific Corporate Defence Programmes for Mexico and Peru, adapted to each country's local regulations governing the liability of legal entities for the commission of crimes.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás engaged in monitoring for the compliance programmes of its affiliates, contributing to their promotion and participation in various meetings and working groups, as well as monitoring the development of its whistleblowing lines as a fundamental tool in the fight against crime prevention.\n\nSee the **[Corporate Defence Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Corporate%20Defense%20Policy%2020220321.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n## Anti-fraud, Corruption and Bribery\n\nEnagás has an Anti-Fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy in place which reflects the company's vehement opposition to the committing of illicit or unlawful acts and its firm will to combat and prevent them, for the purpose of fulfilling its zero tolerance principles. It is the Board of Directors that approves the Anti-Fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy, and therefore 100% of the Board members are informed about the commitments set out in the Policy and the rules and procedures that implement it. [GRI 205-2]\n\nAll activities have been analysed for potential corruption risks and the company has put in place a framework of controls in order to prevent and mitigate them. In particular, the risk of corruption in relations with public officials or other third parties with which Enagás has dealings. In this context, Enagás has established clear guidelines for action: to accurately record all payments to third parties and not to accept or make inappropriate payments, such as facilitation payments, payments in kind or commissions, or advantages or privileges of any kind for unethical purposes. These measures also contribute to the prevention of potentially more serious acts, such as money laundering. Of course, in order to avoid any appearance of money laundering, both the offer and the acceptance of payments in cash or equivalent are expressly prohibited. Enagás pays special attention to suspicious payments from third parties, such as payments by bearer cheques, payments in currencies other than agreed currencies, payments from persons or entities domiciled in tax havens, payments from entities where it is not possible to identify the parties or the final beneficiaries, among others.\n\nEnagás also collaborates with the authorities if they require help to investigate possible cases in the markets in which Enagás operates. It also provides the information they may request in a transparent manner. [GRI 205-1]\n\nThe Enagás Corruption Prevention Programme is based on the ISO 37001 standard on anti-bribery management systems, and is laid out in the Enagás Anti-Fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy, and the internal regulations which implement it.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás has externally certified its Corruption Prevention Programme based on ISO 37001, the anti-bribery management system standard.\n\nAn anti-corruption risk reassessment was also carried out in 2023, reviewing the corruption risk events that may affect the different areas of the company, as well as the controls in place to prevent the materialisation of such risks.\n\nFurthermore, the established anti-corruption principles have been extended to our suppliers by expressly communicating the Anti-Fraud, Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy to them.\n\nFinally, the Compliance Function has strengthened the information on the system provided to senior management for review and to the Governing Body for oversight.\n\n## **The Corruption Prevention Programme has been externally certified under ISO 37001**\n\nSee the **[Anti-fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica-contra-el-fraude-la-corrupcion-y-el-soborno-ENG.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nIn 2023, no cases of corruption were identified in the company, as in the previous two years. [GRI 205-3]\n\n## Antitrust\n\nAs part of the Company's Compliance Management System, Enagás has implemented an Antitrust Programme whose purpose is not only to avoid or reduce any possible administrative sanctions in this issue, but also to promote a corporate culture of ethics and compliance that respects the regulations that defend free competition.\n\nThe pillars of the Antitrust Programme are:\n\n- The Antitrust Policy establishes the bases and mechanisms to promote a culture of business ethics that is conscious and respectful of the principles of free competition, and sets out the essential guidelines for corporate and employee behaviour in this regard.\n- The Antitrust General Standard describes in a structured manner the elements that Enagás has established for the prevention, detection and management of risks, in order to comply with the provisions of antitrust regulation and to achieve the company's strategic and operational goals and objectives where Compliance is concerned.\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/29 description: The image contains the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase sans-serif font.

The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. The \"e\" is blue, and the rest of the letters are a darker blue. Above the word \"enagas\" is a green arc.\n\nThis Standard is aligned with the recommendations in this area of the National Commission on Markets and Competition. To this end, the main purpose of the Standard is to structure an environment of prevention, detection and early management of antitrust risks, as well as to reduce any undesired effects in the event that they do materialise, contributing to the creation of a culture of ethics and respect for the law among all professionals in all applicable areas, so that all can reflect it in their daily conduct.\n\n### See the **[Antitrust Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Antitrust%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás approved a guide to best practices in antitrust matters. This has been made available to all professionals; it enables them to prevent, detect and react in a timely manner to conduct likely to be anticompetitive or generate liability for the company in its relations with other economic operators and/or affect its reputation. In addition, antitrust training courses have been held for those employees considered to be at a higher risk in this area.\n\nIn addition, an Action Protocol has also been approved and made available to all professionals to guarantee the independence of our work to develop hydrogen and other renewable gas transport infrastructures from the activity of the affiliate Enagás Renovable, S.A.\n\n## Responsible tax practice\n\n[GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2, GRI 207-3]\n\nEnagás adopts a focus of responsible tax practice based on prudence and aligned with the recommendations set out in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nThe Responsible Tax Practice Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, sets out the strategy and principles that must guide the conduct of all employees, senior managers and directors of Enagás, as well as third parties with whom the company has relationships.\n\nEnagás adheres to the Code of Good Tax Practices, and presents a Fiscal Transparency Report in line with the company's commitment to tax transparency. The Board of Directors reviews and approves this report on an annual basis.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with the public reporting commitments set out in the Fiscal Policy, the company publishes in this report the total tax contribution and the taxes paid in the different jurisdictions where the company operated through affiliates (see the ['](#page-125-0)[Financial](#page-125-0)  [and operational excellence](#page-125-0)['](#page-125-0) section in this chapter).\n\nWith regard to tax havens, and in accordance with the Tax Policy, Enagás does not use opaque structures in order to reduce its tax burden, nor does it carry out artificial operations not linked to its business activity to reduce taxation. Likewise, it will not make investments in or through territories classified as tax havens according to current Spanish tax regulations in order to reduce its tax burden. The Enagás Group does not currently have a presence or carry out any activities in territories classified as tax havens in accordance with current Spanish legislation.\n\n## **Enagás adopts a focus of responsible tax practice based on prudence and aligned with the recommendations set out in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises**\n\nAs for audits of applicable taxation, at the end of 2023, audits were pending for the years 2020 to 2023 for the taxes applicable to the Group, with the exception of Corporate Income Tax, which is pending audit for the years 2019 to 2023. During financial year 2021, Enagás, S.A. and Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. were notified that the Central Economic Administrative Court (TEAC) had rejected the claims filed in relation to the assessments signed challenging the Corporate Income Tax for the years 2012 to 2015. A contentious-administrative appeal was filed in 2022 against these findings of the TEAC before the National Court. However, it is not expected that any liabilities will arise that will significantly affect the Enagás Group's equity situation.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás, S.A. recorded a provision of 5.6 million euros (this amount includes the fee and interest on arrears) that has its origin in the disputed tax assessments due to the non-acceptance of part of the deduction for technological innovation (TI) applied in the 2012-2015 fiscal years. This risk has been considered likely due to the publication of several rulings by the National High Court, in which the High Court changes the criterion for the classification of software and therefore generally accepts the thesis of the Tax Authority 's IT team with regard to the classification of software for the purposes of applying the deduction for technological innovation.\n\nImage /page/123/Picture/21 description: The image shows a blue mouse icon next to the text \"See the Fiscal Policy on the corporate website.\"\n\n## European Transparency Register\n\n[GRI 2-28, GRI S11.2.4]\n\nThe company is enrolled in the European Transparency Register, to which it periodically reports information on its activities and resources in order to contribute to the improvement and progress of European Union legislative and regulatory frameworks, especially in those developments that have a direct or indirect impact on the gas transmission and storage business, liquefied natural gas, renewable gases and the Spanish and European gas industry in general.

This gives the country great capacity for storage, transmission and operational flexibility.\n\nGiven this situation, and after more than fifty years of experience in developing, maintaining and operating LNG terminals and transmission pipelines, Enagás positions itself as one of the most reputable transmission companies in Europe in terms of facility efficiency. Our terminals are now recognised as among the most efficient in Europe, with availability of over 99%.\n\nAt Enagás, we make our facilities available to customers and provide traditional LNG logistics services such as tanker unloading, regasification, transferring LNG to tankers and truck loading, as well as new small-scale and bunkering services. For the latter, we are adapting our terminals, implementing the latest technologies that will position the Spanish Gas System as a 'logistics hub' for Europe in the gas market. With respect to small scale operations, a total of 70 operations were carried out at our terminals during 2023, an increase of more than 71% compared to the number of operations carried out in 2022. It is worth mentioning the increase in bunkering activity during 2023, with 1.3 TWh loaded for use as marine fuel (3.3 times the amount loaded in 2022), with Barcelona being the terminal with the highest volume loaded (86%) thanks to the start of simultaneous operations at the large scale and small scale docks. ◦ Extraction **[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### The Spanish Gas System\n\nEnagás was certified as an independent network operator (TSO: Transmission System Operator) by the European Commission in 2012, securing its positioning as a European sector leader. It also works as the Technical Manager of the System from the publication of the Hydrocarbons Law. This means it is responsible for the operation and technical management of the Basic Network and the secondary transmission network, guaranteeing the continuity and security of the natural gas supply as well as proper coordination between marketers, the operators of access points, storage facilities, and transmission and distribution networks.\n\nEnagás has been carrying out the majority of its activities in Spain since its founding in 1969. It has built up a meshed network of more than 11,000 km of high-pressure gas pipelines, facilitating access to gas from almost every point on the Iberian Peninsula. Enagás holds stakes in six of the seven LNG terminals in the Iberian Peninsula (four wholly-owned terminals and two part-owned), and has three underground storage facilities. As the main transmission company, Enagás has developed the main infrastructure facilities of the Spanish Gas System, making it a leader in security and diversification of supply and consolidating its presence on the international stage.\n\nSee the **[Annual Report on the Spanish Gas System](https://www.enagas.es/en/press-room/publications/spanish-gas-system-report/)** on our corporate website.\n\n#### LNG terminals\n\nEnagás is one of the companies with the most LNG terminals in the world. We are pioneers in the development, maintenance and operation of this type of infrastructure, and our knowledge and experience have made us international leaders in the sector.\n\nOur terminals have a unique logistical position: their placement between the Atlantic, Cantabrian and Mediterranean catchment areas favours sea transmission and the diversification of LNG sources and destinations. In addition, as regards emissions, Spain is the entry point for a possible ECA (Emission Control Area), an area that could be declared particularly vulnerable to pollution, and where the growth of the small-scale market could be a solution.\n\nAt Enagás, we offer a vetting service for the assessment and inspection of methane tankers operating in our facilities, both in the large and small-scale sectors.\n\n#### At the forefront of technology and efficiency\n\n- 100% commercial availability at all LNG terminals.\n- Load rate higher than 3,500 m<sup>3</sup> /h in all our LNG terminals.\n- Zero operational losses from boil-off during tanker loading operations.\n- Low coefficient of shrinkage in operations.\n- Maximum flexibility in the allocation and adjustment of slots for tanker offloading and loading.\n- Terminals ready to receive the largest LNG tanker ships in the world Q-Max with up to 266,000 m<sup>3</sup>of LNG<sup>42</sup> .\n\n#### Commercial services in Spain [GRI 2-6]\n\nAt Enagás, we are working to provide our customers with logistics services, which we provide in accordance with current regulations. The Third-Party Network Access (ATR) services that we provide at our facilities are fundamentally classified as:\n\n- **• Individual services:**\n- Tanker unloading\n- Regasification\n- LNG storage\n- Truck loading\n- LNG terminal-to-tanker bunkering\n- LNG ship-to-ship transfer\n- Ship cooling\n- Virtual liquefaction\n- Entry to the Virtual Balancing Point\n- Departure from the Virtual Balancing Point\n- Departure from the Virtual Balancing Point to a consumer\n- Natural gas storage in basic underground storage facilities\n- Injection\n- \n\n<sup>130</sup> <sup>42</sup> Except for the Huelva terminal, which can only moor vessels of up to 180,000 m<sup>3</sup> of LNG.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sale of these services is carried out through a framework access contract and through standard capacity products, i.e. through the signing of annual, quarterly, monthly, daily or intraday contracts.\n\n- **• Bundled services**\n- Vessel unloading, LNG storage and regasification.\n- Vessel unloading, LNG storage, regasification and flow on to the Virtual Balancing Point.\n- LNG storage and regasification.\n- LNG storage, regasification and flow on to the Virtual Balancing Point.\n- Vessel unloading, LNG storage and LNG loading from LNG terminal to vessels.\n- Underground natural gas storage, injection and extraction.\n\n#### Find out more about **[commercial services](https://www.enagas.es/en/energy-transition/gas-network/lng-natural-gas-services/)** in Spain on our corporate website.\n\nAs Enagás' activity is carried out in an environment covered by the regulation, this and its implementation form the basis of our plans moving forward. It should be noted that in recent years the last pieces of regulation required to establish the regulatory framework that has made it possible to complete the new management and commercialisation model for the Spanish Gas System.\n\nIn 2023, commercial availability was at 100% and technical availability was at 99.24% (in 2022, 100% and 99.72 %, respectively). This year,\n\nEnagás terminals unloaded a gas volume of 139 TWh (172 TWh in 2022); regasification amounted to 121 TWh (150 TWh in 2022).

Provisional data, as responses are still being received at the time of completion of this report.\n\n(2) The satisfaction target set for 2022 and 2023 was 8.3.\n\n(3) Survey conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) established in the Incentives Circular (Circular 6/2021, June 30). The remuneration received by the Technical System Manager is linked to the participation rate of customers in the survey.\n\n(4) The number of responses out of the total represents 56% of the total turnover in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás resolved 100% of the 177 formal complaints it received from customers (127 in 2022). These complaints were received in connection with Enagás' activity as Technical Manager of the System (GTS). Their quantity falls within normal bounds given its processes and nature, as well as the regulatory changes of the last few years. Enagás also has a specific tool for the management of queries and incidents was implemented to automate the process and provide traceability.\n\nIn terms of managing customer's information privacy, Enagás has a Privacy Policy and complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this regard, Enagás uses its customers' data exclusively for the purposes for which they have been collected and with the prior consent of the interested parties. In 2023, Enagás did not receive any complaints related to privacy or loss of customers' personal data (nor did it receive any complaints in this area in 2022 and 2021).\n\nSee the **[Information Privacy Policy](https://www.enagas.es/en/legal-notice/)** on the corporate website.\n\n[GRI 2-6]\n\n#### Asset management: business continuity and resilience [GRI 3-3]\n\nEnagás has basic principles and guidelines for action in the face of possible threats and adverse situations that give it an increasingly solid structure for managing a crisis.\n\nCrisis management, emergencies and business continuity are areas promoted within the framework of the company's Transformation Plan as areas aimed at strengthening resilience.\n\nThe company has worked on the development of a Business Continuity Plan for the Infrastructure Management Department, which will continue to be implemented throughout 2024. In this regard, it will also focus on revising the specific Technical Manager of the System Plan.\n\nWithin the framework of crisis management, Enagás carries out operational drills and crisis management drills, enabling the company to practise how to act in the event of an accident and thus reduce its reaction times.\n\nIn addition, to reinforce the culture of resilience at our organisation, Enagás draws up lessons learned from both internal and external events that are distributed internally.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás obtained ISO 55001 certification in asset management. This accreditation represents recognition under an international standard for the company's infrastructure asset management model in accordance with the practices identified during the audit process.\n\nAmong the most significant aspects of the standard are a holistic vision of the asset's life cycle, consolidated management of operational risk, alignment of the model with the Strategic Asset Management Plan and the use of technical methodologies to support decision-making. All this is within a framework that guarantees total asset cost and the availability and quality of customer service.\n\nThese management practices are aligned with the company's goals under the principle of continuous process improvement and the integration of new ways of working, with a clear commitment to innovation and digitalisation, all in line with industrial safety and ESG criteria.\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás obtained ISO 55001 certification in asset management**\n\nThis accreditation represents a success after 10 years of work to establish and implement an asset management model, framed within the company's Integrated Safety, Environment and Quality Management System.\n\n#### Pipeline integrity\n\nEnagás carries out inspection and maintenance work to ensure the integrity of its gas infrastructures, making sure they remain in proper condition. The company sets out integrity plans each year based on the risk involved in the activities to be carried out in the gas pipelines. These activities include:\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Internal inspections with smart tools to find potential anomalies in gas pipelines. During 2023, more than 11.0% of Enagás' gas pipeline network was inspected internally (9.3% in 2022).\n- Indirect external inspections to locate defects in the anti-corrosive coating of gas pipelines.\n- Excavations (test pits) for the direct evaluation of anomalies identified through inspections (internal and/or external indirect).\n- Complementary safety activities to detect incidents within the gas pipeline right-of-way (observation by car, observation by foot, aerial observation and leak detection). In 2023, more than 82,000 km of gas pipelines were monitored (more than 89,500 km in 2022).\n\nAs a result of the inspection and maintenance work, in 2023, a bypass of a section of the pipeline in the Pajares area was built as a mitigation measure for the physical risks identified.\n\n#### Closure and rehabilitation\n\n[GRI 3-3, GRI S11.7.4, GRI S11.7.5, GRI S11.7.6]\n\nEnagás facilities have a useful life set out during their design and construction. Enagás makes investments and technical improvements to extend the useful life of its assets while maintaining the required levels of safety, quality, environmental protection and efficiency. However, Enagás establishes decommissioning and rehabilitation plans that consider possible impacts on the environment and local communities once the assets' useful life has ended, taking into account the different stakeholders and involving local communities. Enagás has recorded financial provisions for the dismantling of all its LNG terminals and underground storage facilities, amounting to more than 231,000 euros.\n\nAlthough the useful life of the underground storage facilities has not yet been reached, these infrastructures already have detailed closure and rehabilitation plans as required by the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\nIn the case of pipelines, decommissioning plans are regularly updated in line with annual maintenance plans.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, no Enagás facilities were closed down.\n\n#### Continuous improvement programmes\n\nThe company continues to boost operational excellence through different programmes and initiatives that, leveraging new methodologies such as Lean-Kaizen and Design Thinking, among others, identify innovative solutions focused on efficiency and process improvement, thus generating disruptive results in the short term.\n\nIn this line and in order to face new challenges, in the area of infrastructures, the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Continuous Improvement has continued with the aim of identifying and prioritising cross-cutting initiatives with an impact on strategic drivers of continuous improvement, which encourage the development of people and the use of new methodologies and which promote the culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence.\n\nIn 2023, we have continued to promote the identification of improvement initiatives by professionals through the different existing channels at a company level: cross-cutting improvement groups, the continuous improvement mailbox, roadshows, the Ingenia Energy Challenge programme, and more. In an outstanding initiative this year, the Technical Manager of the System provided a solution to the 'Security of Supply' challenge by developing different team sessions using the Design Thinking methodology.\n\nWithin the Continuous Improvement Programme, the \"Daily Kaizen\" continued being promoted. The programme focuses on people and on strengthening team communication and collaboration. Teams are equipped with lean tools in order to generate autonomous teams, thus allowing for a sustainable cultural change over time (Kanban boards, 5S, standards and problem solving).\n\nIn addition, and with a view to facing new challenges for the company, cross-cutting Kaizen projects are being launched to provide innovative solutions focused on the efficiency of specific processes.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-133-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/133/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for the company Enagas.

On the basis of this assessment, local stakeholders are identified, and impacts are assessed in line with the corporate framework for our commitment to stakeholders (see the 'Commitment to stakeholders ' section of the [Sustainable](#page-54-0)  [Management Model](#page-54-0)).\n\nThis enables stakeholder maps to be created for the management of crises and emergencies affecting infrastructure, in which key collectives, communication channels and relevant issues are identified (see the '[Health and safety](#page-93-0)' section).\n\nFurthermore, the needs analysis of the area enabled the identification of key collectives and associations (vulnerable groups, NGOs, local councils, etc.) which are an important source of information for understanding the local context and for the establishment of partnerships (see the 'Social action' sub-section in this section).\n\n#### Information and consultation processes\n\nEnagás conducts environmental impact studies (which also assess social aspects) for construction projects and assesses environmental aspects for infrastructure operation and maintenance projects. Environmental impact studies are open to public information and are also subject to processes of consultation in which stakeholders may voice their opinion and even propose modifications to a project. Facilities that hold EMAS certification (see the '[Natural](#page-100-0)  [capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section in this chapter) publish an annual report (LNG terminals at Barcelona and Cartagena, underground storage facilities at Yela and Serrablo).\n\nIn the case of gas pipeline construction projects, the route design already takes into account criteria for minimising the impact on local plant and animal wildlife, and for avoiding the occupation of private property. Where the latter is concerned, a regulated procedure is applicable in Spain which includes public information and consultation with the entities affected, which also guarantees transparency in the construction of infrastructure and equal treatment before the law. [GRI 413-2]\n\nIn matters related to infrastructure safety, Enagás develops internal emergency plans, which include information on stored chemical substances, human and material resources, scenarios, emergency plans, liability, etc. These plans are registered with the local government authorities, which are responsible for communicating them to the community and creating an associated action plan.\n\nEnagás also holds information sessions in local areas for the purpose of explaining details of projects that are being executed locally, and safety and environment-related issues, among others.\n\n#### Communication channels with local communities\n\nImage /page/134/Picture/21 description: The image shows a stylized logo. It features a central circle with a keyhole shape in the middle, colored in yellow. Surrounding the circle are three sets of concentric arcs in blue, emanating outwards from the center.

Enagás is committed to allocating around 60% of its contributions to initiatives related to this target. In addition, the company will allocate 20% of its total contributions to actions focused on education, culture, health and aid to vulnerable groups in areas where it operates.\n\n## **Enagás' social investment is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals**\n\nIn terms of geographical scope, at least 15% of contributions will be allocated to local communities in which Enagás has infrastructure facilities and projects.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023                                                                                                                                                                      | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators                             | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| The company's goal is also to allocate at least 0.4% of its current net<br>profit to social action contributions.                                                                          |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                                            |            |                                 |\n| Through dialogue and collaboration with stakeholders, we maximise<br>the positive social impact of our initiatives, whether through<br>volunteering, sponsorships, patronage or donations. |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                                            |            |                                 |\n| See the Social Action Strategy on our corporate website.                                                                                                                                   |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                                            |            |                                 |\n| Needs analysis<br>in operating<br>regions                                                                                                                                                  |                                      |                       | Partnerships<br>with<br>associations       |                                                       |                    | Analysis<br>and<br>initiative<br>selection |            |                                 |\n| Stakeholder dialogue                                                                                                                                                                       |                                      |                       | Collaboration initiatives                  |                                                       |                    | Social impact                              |            |                                 |\n\nIn 2023, the total amount of this social investment reached 1.7 million euros, distributed as follows:\n\n|                                                           | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Amount allocated for social<br>investment (million euros) | 1.81 | 1.94 | 1.70 |\n\n#### Types of contributions\n\nImage /page/135/Figure/4 description: This image is a pie chart showing the breakdown of expenses. 73.4% is sponsorships, patronage and donations, 15.5% is management expenses, and 11.0% is time spent by professionals during the workday. 0.1% is not labeled.\n\nTime spent by professionals during the workday on volunteering\n\nDonations in kind\n\nThe amount allocated to sponsorships, patronage and monetary donations was 1,246,608 euros (see the '[Sponsorships, patronage](#page-136-0)  [and donations](#page-136-0)' sub-section of this section), while general management expenses (cost of professionals dedicated to the management of social investment and cost of the volunteer programme) amounted to 262,916 euros.

Some of our professionals have\n\nalso donated the money for the traditional Christmas hampers to the Theodora Foundation, reaching a total of 2,313 euros.\n\n#### Corporate volunteering programme [GRI 413-1]\n\nEnagás professionals participate in the company's Corporate Volunteering programme, giving up their time and bringing their skills and talent. There are two forms of cooperation:\n\n- **• On-site corporate volunteering directly managed by Enagás:**  activities carried out in collaboration with associations and thirdsector organisations, supervised by the company. These on-site corporate volunteering initiatives are carried out during working hours and respond to the needs of the local communities in which Enagás is present. The company, in line with its commitment to equal opportunity and non-discrimination, guarantees that participation in volunteering activities will not lead to work-related discrimination.\n- **• On-site and virtual volunteering platform**: the company connects with volunteering opportunities through different associations and third-sector organisations by means of the corporate volunteering portal, a platform that strengthens and extends the existing programme. It encompasses special days organised by the company as well as over 1,200 national and international collaboration opportunities, both face-to-face and virtual, put forward by NGOs.\n\n#### 11/2023\n\n**From November 13 to 17, Enagás organised its first Volunteering Week, an initiative that came to a successful conclusion thanks to the participation of the 218 professionals who participated in at least one of the 13 scheduled activities, in collaboration with different non-profit organisations.** \n\n**Through these activities - which focused mainly on care for the environment and inclusive sport, as well as spending time and interacting with vulnerable groups - our professionals have been able to grow more familiar with other realities and share experiences that have contributed to their general awareness, skills development and personal growth.**\n\nEnagás commits to:\n\n- Carrying out at least 10 corporate volunteering initiatives per year, aligned with the scenarios envisaged in the Social Action Strategy and Agenda 2030.\n- Encouraging middle management, executives and specific profiles to volunteer so that they can contribute their experience and knowledge to help support disadvantaged groups, as well as encouraging Enagás professionals to participate in activities within the Social Action Strategy framework (seasonal solidarity campaigns and specific programmes to help children and combat gender-based violence, among others).\n- Reinforcing, through volunteer initiatives, the commitments set out in the various axes of diversity approved in the Enagás Diversity and Inclusion Policy.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/137/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enaga.

These workshops were carried out in collaboration with the Randstad and the José María de Llanos Foundations.**\n\nIn 2023, Enagás has encouraged more face-to-face and collective activities, and the number of activities and participation therein has increased considerably compared to the last two financial years.\n\n|                                                         | 2021 (1) | 2022  | 2023  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Number of initiatives                                   | 12       | 21    | 32    |\n| Number of participations (not<br>individual volunteers) | 170      | 438   | 605   |\n| Total number of hours                                   | 403      | 2,210 | 3,344 |\n\n(1) In 2021, and with the aim of ensuring the safety of all participants, Enagás encouraged virtual volunteering activities and those carried out individually by professionals.\n\nThe company carries out a satisfaction survey of the professionals who participate in social initiatives in order to take maximum care of the volunteer experience, and to find out their satisfaction and assessment of the achievement of the targets of each action. The average result of the surveys carried out by the 203 initiatives reflects high satisfaction, with a rating of 4.8 out of 5.\n\n#### **Volunteering typology**\n\nIn 2023, our volunteering included environmental activities carried out to promote the protection and reclamation of natural spaces, initiatives related to the promotion of the social inclusion of people with disabilities, training workshops to boost the employability of women in vulnerable situations, participation in social sports tournaments to promote social projects for the benefit of people at risk of social exclusion, campaigns to collect toys and food for vulnerable families and digitisation workshops for seniors.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-138-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/138/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts'.\n\n# 3.9 Human rights\n\nBy acting on each material topic, Enagás ensures that human rights are upheld where applicable to the context and activities of the company. [GRI 3-3]\n\n## Respect for human rights\n\n[GRI 2-23, GRI 2-25]\n\nEnagás, following the roadmap set out by the United Nations through the Sustainable Development Goals, establishes its commitments to ensure compliance with human rights in its Human Rights Policy. These commitments are developed in the Enagás' Code of Ethics and the corporate policies that comprise it, aligning them with, inter alia:\n\n- United Nations International Charter of Human Rights.\n- The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration as well as the fundamental conventions (freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation) and the conventions concerning indigenous and tribal peoples.\n- OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n- The European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nEnagás provides an online training programme for all professionals so that they can learn the company's methods for ensuring compliance with human rights.\n\nConsult the **[Human Rights Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Human%20Rights%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n### Identification of rights and risk assessment\n\nHuman rights management is addressed using a continuous improvement approach aligned with our Sustainable Management Model. Enagás has a global system in place to identify human rights violation risks and impacts on a regular basis.\n\nThe identification of these violation risks and impacts is carried out for different points of the company's value chain both current (Enagás activities with management control, affiliates without management control and supply chain and customers) and potential (analysis of new business opportunities), taking into account international standards as applicable for each location and activity<sup>43</sup>,\n\ncommunication and consultation with interest groups, as well as consultation with external human rights experts. The human rights identified include labour rights, safety, the environment, ethics and integrity, as well as fundamental rights.\n\nThe evaluation of the identified violation risks is carried out through the following assessments:\n\n- Assessment of country-specific risks.\n- Corporate Risk Map (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter).\n- Safety risk assessments in posts and facilities (see the '[Health and](#page-93-0)  [safety](#page-93-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Environmental impact assessments / environmental risk assessments (see the '[Natural capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Supply chain assessments (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)' section in this chapter).\n\nIn the assessments carried out in 2023, Enagás considers the level of violation risk to be low across the boards due to the measures that the company has implemented as part of its Sustainable Management Model. Thus, Enagás has human rights risk prevention and mitigation plans in all the geographical areas in which the company operates (see the '[Geographies](#page-15-0)' section in the '[Our](#page-10-0)  [business model](#page-10-0)' chapter). These plans include the following main measures for each of the main issues identified and target the identified vulnerable groups<sup>44</sup> . These measures have been set out according to the company's capacity to influence the different points of its value chain.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the different areas of the company to establish, within their management scope (people, supply chain, local communities, etc.), action plans, objectives and monitoring indicators to ensure compliance with the commitments established in the policy and to mitigate the risks and negative impacts identified. They are also responsible for periodically evaluating possible changes in risks and impacts.\n\nDuring the 2023 assessments - as in the assessments of the previous two years (100% of the assets covered in the last three years) - Enagás did not find any human rights violations, so no remediation actions were required.\n\n<sup>43</sup> The World Bank, UNICEF, The Economist Intelligence Unit, IPIECA, The Danish Institute for Human Rights, etc.\n\n<sup>44</sup> Within the framework of the risk assessments that Enagás carries out each year, vulnerable groups have been identified among the stakeholders (professionals, local communities and suppliers). In these cases, action is focused.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/139/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the Enagas logo on the right.\n\nIn addition to human rights violation risks, Enagás, in an integrated manner with the company's risk assessment processes, identifies and assesses the risk level of each of the risks associated with human rights (for more information on ESG risks and their integration in the company's global risk model, see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)[' chapter](#page-152-0)). These identified risks relate to human rights related to labour practices and to society and local communities:\n\n- Work practices: operational and technological risks and criminal liability.\n- Society and local communities: strategic, business, compliance and model risks.\n\n#### Human rights due diligence assessment at affiliates<sup>45</sup> [GRI 411-1, GRI S11.17.3, GRI S11.17.4]\n\nEnagás annually reviews a human rights risk assessment for the company's affiliates. All the companies have commitments to human rights included in their codes of ethics or specific policies, though in some cases, it is necessary to continue making progress to reinforce these commitments by making them public and providing training to their professionals.\n\nIn general, there is also an advanced level of management regarding the handling of communications and complaints. Due to the importance of this area, Enagás is reinforcing the importance of continuing with this type of action.\n\nOne of the areas in which a higher country risk was identified in several companies is professional relations and working conditions. In this area, it has been determined that the level of management is generally advanced, through room for improvement was found at some companies in terms of formalising procedures related to working hours, breaks and vacations. Likewise, the area of public and private security, which also presents a higher country risk at practically all the companies, stands out for its high level of management in all of them. In the area of community relations, there is an advanced level of management at all the companies, though room for improvement was found at some companies in terms of formalising procedures for managing queries and complaints.\n\nEnagás is currently reviewing its Due Diligence Processes in relation to third parties, focusing on the protection of Human Rights and the Environment, in line with the proposed new European Directive on this issue.\n\n[GRI 2-23, GRI 2-25, GRI 3-3]\n\n| Human rights assessed                                                                   | Assessment result     | Measures to reduce the level of risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LABOUR PRACTICES                                                                        |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The right to decent work<br>and the rejection of forced,<br>compulsory and child labour | Low risk of violation | Enagás guarantees stability and quality of employment, a commitment that is<br>reflected in its Human Capital Management Policy.

The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a sans-serif font, with the \"e\" in lowercase and the rest of the letters in lowercase. The word is in a dark blue color. Above the word is a green circle that is open at the bottom, forming a semi-circle. The semi-circle is positioned so that it appears to be encircling the word \"enagas\".\n\n<sup>54</sup> The significant increase in the remuneration of the CEO is due to the fact that, after his appointment in February 2022, in financial year 2022, only his annual base salary was considered together with the actual remuneration he received in that year. In the calculations for 2023, these amounts plus his corresponding variable remuneration have been considered.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/187/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The table below indicates the pages of this report in which this information is contained.\n\n| GC               | Human rights

accounting regulations, as well as another series of measures prepared in accordance with the reporting standards established and developed in-house, known as Alternative Performance Measures (APMs).\n\nThese APMs are considered to be adjusted versions of the figures presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU), which is the accounting framework applicable to the Enagás Group's consolidated financial statements, and should therefore be considered by the reader as additional to, but not a substitute for, these standards.\n\nThe APMs are important for financial information users because they are the measures used by the Enagás management to assess the Group's financial performance, cash flows and financial position for making operational and strategic decisions. These APMs are consistent with the main indicators used by the investment and analyst community in the capital markets.\n\nIn this regard, and in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), in force since July 3, 2016, regarding the transparency of Alternative Performance Measures, below Enagás provides information on those APMs set forth in the management information for Q4 of the 2023 financial year that it considers to be significant. Furthermore, in order to comply with ESMA guidelines on direct reference to previously published documents with details of APMs for previous periods, we include a link where this information can be found: [https://www.enagas.es/en/investor](https://www.enagas.es/en/investor-relations/financial-information/alternative-performance-measures-apm/)[relations/financial-information/alternative-performance](https://www.enagas.es/en/investor-relations/financial-information/alternative-performance-measures-apm/)[measures-apm/](https://www.enagas.es/en/investor-relations/financial-information/alternative-performance-measures-apm/)\n\n## 1. Alternative Performance Measures related to the Income Statement\n\n### EBITDA\n\n**EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) is an indicator that measures the company's operating profit before deducting interest, taxes, impairment and depreciation. By dispensing with financial and tax amounts, as well as accounting expenses that do not involve cash outflows, it is used by management to evaluate results over time, enabling comparison with other companies in the sector.\n\nEBITDA is calculated as operating profit, increased by depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses, if any, and other items that do not represent cash inflows or outflows from Enagás' operations (such as capital gains or losses on disposals, provisions, etc.).\n\nThe reconciliation based on the operating profit shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at December 31, 2023 is shown below:\n\n|                        | Q4 2023   |\n|------------------------|-----------|\n| Operating income       | 919.6     |\n| Income from Affiliates | 199.5 (*) |\n| Operating expenses     | -338.8    |\n| EBITDA                 | 780.3     |\n\n(\\*) For management purposes, the concept of 'Income from Affiliates' presented as part of operating income, in the amount of 199.5 million euros, does not include the effect of the amortisation of the PPAs, amounting to 52.1 million euros, which is considered to be a higher amortisation expense and therefore excluded from EBITDA. Considering the above two items together, the amount would be 147.3 million euros.\n\n#### Adjusted EBITDA\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** is an indicator that measures the company's operating profit before the deduction of interest, taxes, impairment and amortization, and includes both dividends received and interest on subordinated debt collected from associates that are included in the financial statements of the Enagás Group using the equity method.\n\nThis indicator is used by Management to calculate the leverage ratios described in the section 'Alternative Performance Measures related to the Balance Sheet and leverage ratios', allowing comparison with other companies in the sector. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 of the 2023 financial year, which is subsequently used in the leverage ratios, is shown below:\n\n|                             | Q4 2023      |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|\n| EBITDA                      | 780.3        |\n| Dividends (*)               | 192.5        |\n| Income from affiliates (**) | -199.5       |\n| <b>ADJUSTED EBITDA</b>      | <b>773.3</b> |\n\n(\\*) This relates mainly to dividends received from companies accounted for using the equity method. It also includes interest on subordinated debt collected from companies accounted for by the equity method.\n\n(\\*\\*) As the dividends received from affiliates are considered, the results of these companies must be excluded, which is included in EBITDA as described in the previous section. \n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/206/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for the Spanish energy company Enagás. The logo consists of the company name \"enagas\" in a lowercase sans-serif font, with the \"e\" and \"a\" in green and the \"n\", \"g\", and \"s\" in blue. Above the company name is a green circle with a blue arc underneath, visually representing a stylized gas flame or energy symbol.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n#### EBIT\n\n**EBIT** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is an indicator that measures a company's operating income before the deduction of interest and taxes. As with the previous indicator, it is used by Management to evaluate results over time, allowing comparison with other companies in the sector.\n\nEBIT is calculated as EBITDA, less depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, if any, and other items that do not represent cash inflows or outflows from Enagás' operations (such as capital gains or losses on disposals, provisions, etc.).\n\nReported EBIT for Q4 2023 amounted to 456.9 million euros. This amount matches the operating profit at that date.\n\n## 2. Alternative Performance Measures related to the Balance Sheet and Leverage Ratios\n\n#### Net Debt\n\n**Net financial debt** is the main indicator used by Management to measure the Group's debt level. It is comprised of gross debt less cash in hand.\n\nTo calculate the gross debt, the balance sheet items \"Debts with credit institutions\", \"Debentures and other marketable securities\" valued at amortised cost and in relation to item \"Other financial liabilities\" are added, and only the amount arising from the application of IFRS16 and loans other than to credit institutions as well are included.\n\nThe cash amount is obtained from 'Cash and cash equivalents' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe reconciliation between the APM and the figures corresponding to the consolidated balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2023, are shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                                            | Q4 2023  |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                  | 838.5    |\n| Debts with credit institutions             | -1,460.6 |\n| Debentures and other marketable securities | -2,345.4 |\n| Other financial liabilities (*)            | -379.8   |\n| Net debt                                   | -3,347.4 |\n\n (\\*) The amount included under this item relating to the recognition of financial liabilities due to the application of IFRS16 amounts to 379 million euros and the debt granted by bodies other than credit institutions amounts to 0.8 million euros.\n\n#### Ratios linked to Net Debt\n\nManagement uses two ratios to analyse the leverage and the Group's ability to meet its financial obligations over time, enabling comparison with other companies in the sector.\n\nThe leverage ratio is calculated as Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA, as shown below:\n\n|                            | Q4 2023 |\n|----------------------------|---------|\n| Net debt                   | 3,347.4 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA            | 773.3   |\n| Net Debt/EBITDA (adjusted) | 4.3x    |\n\nThe ratio linked to the capacity to generate cash flows over net debt is calculated as FFO for the last twelve months (LTM) / Net Debt, as shown below:\n\n|                  | Q4 2023 |\n|------------------|---------|\n| Adjusted FFO (*) | 627.3   |\n| Net debt         | 3,347.4 |\n| FFO/Net Debt     | 18.7%   |\n\n(\\*) This amount is explained below in the section on Alternative Performance Measures related to Cash Flow and Investments. This item does not include 67.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in GNLQ in 2022 as it is not generated by the Group's ordinary operations, as well as 4.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in Morelos.\n\n#### Gross financial cost\n\nGross financial cost is the measure of the effective interest rate of the financial debt. This indicator is used by management to analyse its evolution over time, the impact of interest rates and its position in relation to the market.\n\nThe gross financial costs are determined by dividing gross financial expenses by the average gross debt multiplied by the number of effective days in the year (360 days) divided by the natural days of the period (365 days), where gross financial expenses correspond to interest on financial debt and hedges (Interest on debt in the Consolidated Income Statement). Further, average gross debt is calculated as the daily average of nominal amounts of gross debt.\n\nThe reconciliation between the APM and the figures corresponding to the consolidated balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, are shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                              | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 |\n|------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Gross financial expenses (*) | 95.1    | 116.4   |\n| Average gross debt           | 5,328.4 | 4,393.5 |\n| Gross financial cost         | 1.8%    | 2.6%    |\n\n(\\*) The amount included under this heading corresponds to the interest associated with the debt included in the Financial Result of the Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/207/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in gray font on the left side of the image.

Alternative Performance Measures related to Cash Flow and Investments\n\n#### Funds from Operations (FFO)\n\n**FFO** is the main cash generation indicator analysed by Enagás' management, as it measures both the cash generated by the domestic regulated and non-regulated business, as well as the cash generated for the Group from its international business, either through dividends from affiliates or interest payments on subordinated debt granted to these companies, after deducting both tax payments and interest related to the Group's financial debt.\n\nIt is calculated as:\n\n**FFO = EBITDA** discounting the results of affiliates +/- tax collection/ payment +/- interest collection/payment + dividends received from affiliates + interest on subordinated debt collected from affiliates.\n\nThe reconciliation between this APM and the amounts observable in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023 is shown below:\n\n|                                         | Q4 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|\n| Operating profit                        | 456.9   |\n| Amortisation allowances (*) (***)       | 323.4   |\n| EBITDA                                  | 780.3   |\n| Tax collection / (payment) (****)       | -151.4  |\n| Collection / (payment) of interest (**) | -70.2   |\n| Dividends (**)                          | 192.5   |\n| Other adjustments                       | 3.7     |\n| Income from Affiliates (*)              | -199.5  |\n| FFO                                     | 555.3   |\n| Tax collection / (payment) (****)       | 555.3   |\n| Adjusted FFO                            | 627.3   |\n\n(\\*) For management purposes, 'Amortisation allowances' includes, in addition to the depreciation and amortisation allowances for fixed assets, the effect of the amortisation of the PPAs, amounting to 52.1 million euros at December 31, 2023. (\\*\\*) For management purposes, interest on subordinated debt collected from affiliates is included under 'Dividends'.\n\n(\\*\\*\\*) Including impairment losses and gains or losses from the disposal of fixed assets recorded in the year.\n\n(\\*\\*\\*\\*) This item does not include the 67.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in GNLQ in 2022 as it is not generated by the Group's ordinary operations, as well as 4.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in Morelos.\n\n### Operating cash flow (OCF)\n\n**Operating Cash Flow** measures the capacity to generate operating cash after changes in working capital. It is calculated on the basis of FFO and includes the change in working capital.\n\n**OCF** amounted to 761.1 million euros in Q4 2023. The reconciliation between this APM and the figures seen in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023, is shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                                     | Q4 2023 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| FFO                                 | 555.3   |\n| Change in operating working capital | 205.7   |\n| OPERATING CASH FLOW (OCF)           | 761.1   |\n\n#### Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\n**Free cash flow** measures cash generation from operating and investing activities and is also considered by Enagás to be an essential APM as it is the indicator used to evaluate the funds available both to pay dividends to shareholders and to service debt.\n\nReported **FCF** for Q4 2023 amounted to 586.9 million euros. The reconciliation between this APM and the figures seen in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023, is shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                             | Q4 2023 |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| OPERATING CASH FLOW (OCF)   | 761.1   |\n| Payments for investments    | -368.2  |\n| Proceeds from disposals (*) | 194.1   |\n| Free Cash Flow (FCF)        | 586.9   |\n\n(\\*) For management purposes, divestment proceeds of 194.1 million euros include the following items from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement as at December 31, 2023: (i) the heading \"Proceeds from divestments\" for 94.1 million euros and (ii) the cash flows associated with the transaction with Reganosa for the sale of the 25% stake in Energy Musel Hub, which is included under the heading \"Other proceeds from financing activities\" for 99.9 million euros.\n\n#### Discretional Cash Flow (DCF)\n\n**Discretional cash flow** is an APM used by management to manage existing funding needs. It is defined as free cash flow (FCF) less dividends paid to shareholders and certain exchange differences related to net debt.\n\nReported DCF for Q4 2023 amounted to 117.5 million euros. The reconciliation between this APM and the figures seen in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023, is shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                                    | Q4 2023 |\n|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Free Cash Flow (FCF)               | 586.9   |\n| Dividend payments                  | -451.8  |\n| Effect of exchange rate variations | -17.7   |\n| Discretionary Cash Flow (DCF)      | 117.5   |\n\n### Available funds/liquidity\n\nThis indicator is used by management to measure the group's financial capacity to meet any short-term liquidity needs\n\nCorresponds to the amount of \"Cash and cash equivalents\" plus the amount of credit lines which have not been drawn down.\n\nThe reconciliation between the APM and the figures corresponding to the consolidated balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, are shown below (in million euros):\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/208/Picture/5 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Alternative Performance Measures in the Non-Financial Information Statement\n\nThe Consolidated Management Report includes the non-financial information statement, in line with the requirements of Directive 2014/95/UE on non-financial information and diversity, as well as with associated Spanish legislation (Law 11/2018). This law specifies that, when providing non-financial information, those companies that are required to, must rely on national frameworks, EU frameworks or recognised international frameworks, such as the GRI's Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards).\n\nFor this reason, the Enagás Group's Consolidated Management Report is prepared in accordance with GRI Standards. In line with the requirement of content 201-1 'Direct economic value generated and distributed', the following is reported:\n\n- Economic value generated: net turnover and other operating income\n- Economic value distributed: suppliers, society (investment in social action and taxes), employees (personnel expenses) and capital providers (dividends paid to shareholders and financial result).\n- Economic value retained: difference between \"economic value generated\" and \"economic value distributed\".\n\nInformation on the creation and distribution of economic value provides a basic indication of how the company has generated wealth for shareholders. A number of other components of economic value generated and distributed also reflect the economic profile of the company, which can be useful for normalising other performance-related figures.\n\nBelow is the reconciliation with the Profit and Loss accounts and items in the consolidated Balance Sheet shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\n|                                                 | Reference to the 2023 Consolidated Annual Accounts                                                                                                                                    |  | Q4<br>2022 | Q4<br>2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|------------|------------|\n| Economic value generated (EVG)                  | Net turnover and other operating revenues in 'Note 2.1'                                                                                                                               |  | 970.3      | 919.6      |\n| Economic value distributed (EVD)                |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 924.2      | 905.8      |\n| Suppliers                                       | External services, other current administrative expenses and other external expenses from 'Note 2.1.c'.                                                                               |  | 220.6      | 186.7      |\n| Society (investment in social action and taxes) |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 165.0      | 94.9       |\n| Investment in social action                     | Amount allocated to social investment in the 'Local communities' section of the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter of the Consolidated Management Report |  | 1.9        | 1.7        |\n| Tax                                             | Taxes in 'Note 2.1.c' and Corporate taxes in 'Note 4.2.c' of the Consolidated Annual Accounts                                                                                         |  | 163.1      | 93.2       |\n| Professionals (personnel expenses)              | Personnel expenses of 'Note 2.1.b' of the Consolidated Annual Accounts                                                                                                                |  | 140.4      | 137.1      |\n| Capital providers                               |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 398.2      | 487.2      |\n| Dividends paid to shareholders                  | Dividends from equity attributable to the Parent Company in the Consolidated Statement of Equity Changes                                                                              |  | 446.4      | 451.4      |\n| Financial result                                | Financial result of the Consolidated Income Statement at the end of the fiscal year                                                                                                   |  | -48.2      | 35.8       |\n| Economic value retained (EVR)                   |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 46.1       | 13.9       |\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-209-0\"></span>**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/209/Picture/5 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enaga.

These matters were\naddressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in\nforming our audit opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n*Recovery of financial assets related to Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A.*\n\n2\n\nDescription On January 24, 2017, the Directorate General for Hydrocarbons of the Ministry for\nEnergy and Mines terminated the \"Improvements to the National Energy Security and\nDevelopment of the South Peruvian Pipeline\" concession agreement and on\nDecember 4, 2017, the National Institute for the Defense of Competition and\nIntellectual Property requested that Gasoducto del Sur Peruano, S.A. file for\nbankruptcy, as explained in Note 3.3.a to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Enagás Group holds financial assets amounting to 275.3 million US dollars\nrelating to the investment in Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. and accounts receivable\npertaining to executed guarantees totaling 226.8 million US dollars, interest of 1.9\nmillion US dollars, as well as various invoices for professional services rendered\namounting to 7.6 million US dollars. These items represent recorded assets at\nDecember 31, 2023 of 456.8 million euros (Note 3.3.a to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements).\n\nDue to the termination of the concession contract, the Enagás Group entered into an\nongoing dispute with the Peruvian Government related to the recovery of the\ninvestment. On July 2, 2018, a request was filed with the ICSID (International Centre\nfor Settlement of Investment Disputes) to initiate arbitration against the Peruvian\nState regarding its investment in Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. Subsequently, Enagás'\nclaim memorial was submitted to the ICSID, as were the corresponding responses and\nreplies by both the Peruvian government and Enagás. The pre-trial hearing was held\nin September 2022, and the written conclusions were presented in November 2022.\nIssuance of the arbitration award is estimated in the first half of 2024.\n\nGiven the significance of the amounts involved and the uncertainty regarding the final\noutcome of the resolution of complex, long-term processes of this type from a legal\nand economic standpoint, we have determined this to be a key audit matter since,\nprimarily, the Group's legal advisors believe that the estimates made by Enagás'\ndirectors may vary in the future.\n\nOur\nresponse\n\nOur audit procedures in this regard included, among other, the following:\n\n- Understanding the Enagás Group's process for assessing the recoverability of\nthese assets and reviewing the design and operating effectiveness and\nimplementation of key controls.\n- Evaluating compliance with the terms and conditions of the contracts and\n\n- \n- \n- \n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nber 31, 2023 amounts to 2,590 million euros and contain significant\ngoodwill.

Thus, during these years, including 2023, the going concern principle has continued to be fully applied in the preparation of these consolidated annual accounts.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the impact of rising market interest rates, which affects multiple aspects of financial reporting, such as future cash flow forecasts and present value calculations. With regard to the liquidity situation, as indicated in Note 3.7, the Group has a solid liquidity situation and liquid assets of 3,309,004 thousands of euros at December 31, 2023 (3,793,773 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022), thus maintaining the liquidity strategy and the credit and exchange rate risk policies. During the 2023 financial year, as in the 2022 financial year, there have been no impairment of financial assets or non-financial assets, as well as no significant extraordinary expenses corresponding to this situation or provisions or contingent liabilities that have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Enagás Group as of December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **a) Materiality criteria**\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Annual Accounts do not include the information or disclosures which the Group did not consider of material significance or important relative to the concept of materiality as defined in the conceptual framework of IFRS, taking into account the Consolidated Annual Accounts as a whole.\n\n#### **b) Comparison of information**\n\nThe information included in these consolidated notes relating to 2022 is presented solely and exclusively for purposes of comparison with the information relating to 2023.\n\n## 1.3 Consolidation principles\n\nThe Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the interim financial statements of the Parent Company, Enagás, S.A. and its subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, and joint operations at December 31, 2023.\n\nSubsidiaries are considered to be those entities with respect to which the Enagás Group fulfils the following criteria:\n\n- The capacity to use its interest to influence the amount of revenue to be obtained from said subsidiary.\n- The Group has power over the affiliate, in so far as a company has rights which permit it to direct relevant activities, understood as those which significantly affect the revenue generated by the subsidiary.\n- It maintains exposure or the right to variable revenue arising from its involvement in the subsidiary.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated using the full consolidation method.\n\nThe share of minority shareholders in the equity and profit of consolidated subsidiaries of the Enagás Group is recognised in \"Minority interests (External partners)\" under \"Equity\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and \"Profit/(loss) attributable to minority interests\" in the Consolidated Income Statement, respectively. Subsidiaries are consolidated starting on the acquisition date, i.e., the date on which the Group obtains control, and they continue to be consolidated until such control is lost.\n\nWhen the minority shareholders' interest in the subsidiary includes a put option whereby it does not substantially assume the risks and rewards of such interest, it is not recorded as \"Minority interests (External Partners)\" but as a financial liability.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as those of the Parent. With respect to the joint agreements, that is, those by virtue of which the Enagás Group maintains joint control with one or more other partners, a distinction is made between joint operations and joint ventures. Joint control is understood as control shared by virtue of a contractual agreement which requires unanimous consent from all involved parties for decision-making regarding relevant activities.\n\nThus, joint operations are considered to be those in which, based on a contractual arrangement, a company enjoys the rights to assets and assumes obligations with respect to liabilities. The interest held in joint operations is consolidated using the proportionate consolidation method.\n\nIn addition, joint ventures are considered to be those in which, based on a contractual arrangement, a company exercises rights with respect to the net assets of the joint venture. Shareholdings in joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method. In those cases in which the Enagás Group acquires control over companies previously considered as joint ventures, a new estimate is made for the fair value of the interest held previously in equity at the acquisition date, recognising income or losses in the Consolidated Income Statement for the reporting period.\n\nFurthermore, associates are considered to be those entities over which the Enagás Group holds significant influence, that is, the power to intervene in decision-making regarding financial policies and operational matters, without attaining full control or joint control. The interest held in associates is consolidated using the equity method.\n\nIf appropriate, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures, and joint operations in order to unify their accounting policies with those of the Enagás Group.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/229/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is the word \"enaga\" in blue with a green and blue circle around it.\n\n| Consolidation method/Company                          | Functional currency |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Axent Infraestructuras de<br>Telecomunicaciones, S.A. | Euro                |\n| Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH                             | Euro                |\n| Hanseatic Energy Hub Operations<br>GmbH               | Euro                |\n\n(1) For these companies the Enagás Group recognises interest corresponding to minority interests under \"Minority interests (External partners)\" in Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023.\n\n- (2) Reclassified to Non-Current Assets Held for Sale at year-end 2023.\n- (3) For this company, the Enagás Group recognises the share corresponding to external partners under \"Other financial liabilities\" ([Note 1.5](#page-19-0)).\n- (4) Liquidated on December 27, 2023 without effect at consolidated level.\n\n#### b) Consolidation process\n\nConsolidation of the Enagás Group was carried out in accordance with the following process:\n\n- i. Transactions between companies included in the consolidation scope. All balances, transactions, and results between companies consolidated under the full consolidation method were eliminated upon consolidation. For joint operations, the balances, transactions and results of operations with other Group companies were eliminated in the proportion at which they were consolidated. With respect to gains and losses generated through operations among Group companies and companies consolidated under the equity method, the percentage of interest held by the Group in the latter was eliminated.\n- ii. Harmonisation of criteria. For affiliates which apply different accounting and measurement criteria to those of the Group, the consolidation process included the corresponding adjustments, provided the effect was significant, with a view to presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements based on harmonised measurement standards.\n- iii. Translation of Financial Statements denominated in foreign currency. The translation to euros of the Financial Statements of the aforementioned companies in the Enagás Group consolidation process was carried out in accordance with the following procedures:\n- Assets and liabilities of each corresponding balance sheet denominated in foreign currency are translated at the spot rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n- Income and expense items making up each income statement heading are translated at the average exchange rate for the year in which the related transactions are carried out.\n- The historical exchange rate for Equity is maintained.\n- Exchange gains (losses) arising as a result of net assets are recognised as a separate component of equity under \"Adjustments for changes in value\" and in the income statement under \"Translation differences.\"\n\nWhen disposing of a company whose functional currency is not the euro; or when disposals are carried out as a result of losing control; or result from business combinations with respect to previously held interest, translation differences recognised as a component of equity relating to said investment are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as soon as the effect arising from said disposal is recognised.\n\n#### a) Consolidation methods\n\n| Consolidation method/Company                                 | Functional currency |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Full consolidation                                           |                     |\n| Enagás Transporte, S.A.U.                                    | Euro                |\n| Enagás GTS, S.A.U.                                           | Euro                |\n| Enagás Internacional, S.L.U.                                 | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Financiaciones, S.A.U.                                | Euro                |\n| Enagás U.S.A., L.L.C.                                        | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Perú, S.A.C.                                          | US dollar           |\n| Enagás México, S.A. de C.V.                                  | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Emprende, S.L.U.                                      | Euro                |\n| Enagás Chile, SpA.                                           | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Transporte del Norte, S.L.

Elimination of dividends. Internal dividends are considered to be those a Group company recognises as income for the year and that have been distributed by another Group company.\n\nDuring the consolidation process, dividends received by subsidiaries and joint operations are eliminated by considering them to be reserves of the recipient company, which consequently recognises them under \"Reserves\". In the case of minority interests in companies consolidated using the full consolidation method, the amount of the dividend corresponding to said minority interests is eliminated from the consolidated equity heading \"Minority interests (External partners)\".\n\nv. Equity method. The investment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted by the share corresponding to the investor of the changes in net assets of the affiliate. In addition, dividends received are accounted for as a lower amount under \"Investments accounted for using the equity method\".\n\nAlso, when the associate or joint venture is acquired, any difference between the cost of the investment and the share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associate or joint venture is accounted for as follows:\n\n- The capital gain related to these companies or joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment. This capital gain cannot be amortised.\n- Any excess of the share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income to determine the share of profit or loss of the associate or joint venture in the period in which the investment is acquired.\n\nThe consolidated profit for the year includes participation in the results of the affiliates under \"Results of investments accounted for using the equity method\" in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statement. If the participation in losses of an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds participation in said entities, the loss will no longer be recognised under additional losses. Once interest in an entity is reduced to zero, the additional losses will be maintained and a liability will only be recognised to the extent the corresponding entity incurred legal or implicit obligations or made a payment on behalf of an associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity will once again recognise its interest only after its participation in said profits equals its participation in unrecognised losses.\n\n## 1.4 Estimates and accounting judgements made\n\nIn the Group's Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2023, estimates and judgements were occasionally made by the Senior Management of the Group and of the consolidated companies, subsequently ratified by the Directors, in order to quantify certain assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and commitments reported herein. Basically:\n\n#### Estimates\n\n- The useful life of PP&E assets [\\(Note 2.4\\)](#page-42-0).\n- Provisions for dismantling/abandonment costs, other provisions and contingent liabilities [\\(Note 2.9](#page-49-0)).\n- The measurement of investments accounted for using the equity method, and non-financial assets to determine the possible existence of impairment losses ([Notes 1.6](#page-21-0) and [2.7\\)](#page-44-0).\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-231-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\nImage /page/231/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas. The logo features the word \"enagas\" in a sans-serif font, with the letters in a teal color. Above the word, there is a green circle that is open at the bottom, creating a curved line above the text.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n- The fair value of financial instruments [\\(Notes 3.3](#page-53-0) and [.6\\)](#page-61-0).\n- Impairment losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost [\\(Notes 2.2](#page-31-0) and [3.3](#page-53-0)).\n- The calculation of income tax and deferred tax assetss ([Note 4.2](#page-100-0)).\n- The fair value of equity instruments granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (ILP) (Note 3.1.c).\n- Assumptions on the calculation of the term of lease contracts in application of IFRS 16 (Note 2.4.b).\n- **•** Determination of the expected loss associated with receivables [\\(Note 2.2\\)](#page-31-0).\n\n#### Judgements\n\n• The recognition of investments accounted for using the equity method [\\(Note 1.6](#page-21-0)).\n\n• Compliance with conditions for classifying assets and liabilities as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale ([Note 2.6](#page-43-0)).\n\nAlthough these estimates were made on the basis of the best information available at December 31, 2023, future events may require these estimates to be modified prospectively in the coming years (upwards or downwards). In accordance with IAS 8, this would be done prospectively, recognising the effects of any change of estimate in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## 1.5 Changes in the consolidation scope\n\nThe following are the changes in the consolidation scope of the Enagás Group:\n\n|                                                                      | Amount (thousands) |          | Stake percentage |                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Entity                                                               | In local currency  | In euros | At<br>31.12.2023 | At<br>31.12.2022 | Description/Type of control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Entries into the scope                                               |                    |          |                  |                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Musel Energy Hub, S.L.                                               | 395,544            | 395,544  | 100.0%           | —%               | Addition to the scope of consolidation by incorporation<br>of the company, which Enagás consolidates globally.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Hanseatic Energy Hub<br>GmbH                                         | 2,122              | 2,122    | 10.0%            | —%               | Addition to the scope of consolidation due to the<br>acquisition of 10% of this company.

Its corporate purpose is the regasification, natural gas storage and the provision of logistical capacity services carried out by the El Musel regasification plant. These are to be carried out by means of or through the corresponding gas infrastructures or facilities, either its own or those of third parties, as well as the performance of ancillary activities or activities linked to the foregoing. The effective start of this activity took place on July 28 following receipt of the Final Commissioning Certificate, as explained in [Note 2.4](#page-42-0).\n\nIn relation to MEH, on February 28, 2023 the Enagás Group, through Enagás Transporte, signed an agreement with Reganosa for the sale of a 25% stake in MEH for an estimated 99.9 million euros, as well as the acquisition by Enagás Transporte of Reganosa's gas pipeline network for 54 million euros. This transaction was subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions precedent which were met in full on September 28, 2023, the effective date of the transaction being September 29, 2023. The Musel terminal business was also spun off on this date, with the assets and liabilities associated with the Musel terminal being transferred to MEH, with no impact on the consolidated income statement.\n\nUnder this agreement, a sales option is granted to Reganosa, under which Reganosa has the right to sell, and Enagás Transporte the obligation to buy, 25% of MEH up to a maximum term. Based on this option, the interest transferred has been recorded under financial liabilities, maintaining the application of the full consolidation method for the assets and liabilities of MEH at 100% [\\(Note 3.3\\)](#page-53-0).\n\nNone of this information related to MEH had any impact on the consolidated income statement.\n\n### Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH (\"HEH\") and Hanseatic Energy Hub Operations GmbH (\"HEH Operations\")\n\nOn September 26, 2023, the acquisition of 10% of Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH (\"HEH\") was completed, which will help ensure security of supply and drive decarbonisation in Germany. The consortium will be located in Stade (Germany), where a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit and an onshore terminal for liquefied gases also be prepared to operate with green ammonia will be located.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\nO&M work for this project will be carried out.\n\n[Our

The rights and obligations associated with a financial guarantee will be considered as financial assets and financial liabilities. For subsequent valuation, a contract will be recognised as the greater amount of a) the amount resulting from standards relating to provisions (IAS 37) or b) accumulated amortisation of the initial measurement and possible accrued income.** \n\n| Commitments and<br>guarantees              | Group and<br>related<br>companies | Third<br>parties | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|---------|\n| 2023                                       |                                   |                  |         |\n| Debt guarantees                            | 645,000                           | 10,750           | 655,750 |\n| Guarantees and sureties<br>granted - Other | 5,702                             | 279,236          | 284,938 |\n| Investment commitments                     | —                                 | 185,101          | 185,101 |\n| 2022                                       |                                   |                  |         |\n| Debt guarantees                            | 557,000                           | —                | 557,000 |\n| Guarantees and sureties<br>granted - Other | 17,754                            | 142,869          | 160,623 |\n| Investment commitments                     | —                                 | 89,725           | 89,725  |\n\n#### a) Debt guarantees\n\n#### **TAP**\n\nThe \"Guarantees on debt of related parties\" heading includes the corporate guarantee granted by Enagás S.A. for financial institutions acquired in the Financing Agreement of November 30, 2018 in the company TAP, through which the following items are basically guaranteed:\n\n- Principal and interest of the Financing Agreement provided by TAP at any time;\n- Market value of the hedging instrument over the interest rate of the Financing Contract.\n\nTAP reached the \"Financial Completion Date\" on March 31, 2021, a milestone that allowed the partners to replace the guarantees provided on the company's debt during the construction phase of the infrastructure with a mechanism for shareholder support for the repayment of the TAP loan (Debt Payment Undertaking), which will be in effect until its maturity, and which would be activated in the event of certain extraordinary events.\n\nThis support mechanism has been granted jointly by each of TAP's shareholders, so that Enagás would only be liable, in a hypothetical case, for the amount corresponding to it in accordance with its stake in TAP's share capital. In 2023 Enagás has increased its stake in TAP from 16% to 20%.\n\n**• An investment commitment corresponds to that obligation contracted with a related party which can give rise to outflows of funds or other resources in the future. The following is included among these: commitments not recognised in connection with contributing funds or resources as a consequence of incorporation agreements, capital intensive projects carried out by a joint venture, commitments not recognised in connection with providing loans or other financial support to the joint venture, or commitments not recognised in connection with acquiring a stake, regardless of whether a specific future event occurs or not.**\n\nThis support mechanism during the operating period is contractually limited by a cap in force throughout the life of the financing arrangement, so that the amounts claimed from Enagás may never exceed a total amount of 903,322 thousands of euros, regardless of the market value of the derivative or any other contingency.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 the amount guaranteed by Enagás, S.A. in favour of TAP creditors amounts to 645,000 thousands of euros (557,000 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022), already taking into account the increase in the stake mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n#### **Scale Gas**\n\nIn July 2023, the Enagás Group, through its company Scale Gas Solutions, S.L.U., subscribed a guarantee to cover its 50% share in the financial debt formalised in the affiliate Scale Gas Med Shipping, S.L., in the amount of 11,895 thousands of dollars (10,750 thousands of euros). This guarantee will remain in force until the expiry of the financing contract, which is initially estimated for July 2030.\n\n#### b) Guarantees and sureties granted - Other\n\nThe following items are mainly included:\n\n#### **Group and related companies**\n\n- Guarantee of access to the electricity transmission grid, granted by Enagás Renovable, S.L.U. amounting to 5,450 thousands of euros (5,040 thousands of euros in 2022).\n- Guarantees granted to the Comisión Federal de la Electricidad (\"CFE\") for the service contract related to the Soto La Marina Compressor Station in the amount of 116 thousands of euros (December 31, 2022: 121 thousands of euros). The guarantee also granted to the CFE associated with the Gasoducto de Morelos project, which amounted to 9,378 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022, was rendered ineffective in 2023.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/235/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enaga.

Above the word \"enaga\" is a curved line in a light green color, forming an arc over the letters.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n• Guarantees and sureties granted to Group companies at December 31, 2022 included financial guarantees granted to third parties by Llewo Mobility, S.L., in the amount of 172 thousands of euros, counter-guaranteed by Enagás, S.A., and a corporate guarantee granted to a financial institution to support a credit facility arranged by the same company in February 2022, in the amount of 3,043 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022. In 2023, the Enagás Group met the financial obligations deriving from the guarantees and sureties granted to its affiliate Llewo Mobility, S.L. At December 2023 both the guarantee and the surety were cancelled.\n\n#### **Third parties**\n\nThe following items, mainly, are included:\n\n- Technical guarantees granted by financial entities to third parties in the amount of 194,044 thousands of euros (116,158 thousands of euros in 2022) to cover certain responsibilities which may arise during the execution of the contracts constituting the activity of the Enagás Group.\n- In addition, there is an insurance policy with as bid bond for the port concession in Colombia for the Buenaventura project amounting to 1,360 thousands of euros (1,412 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n- Guarantees and sureties granted by Enagás, S.A. totalling 23,900 thousands of euros to cover technical and operational risks related to the projects of the Group company Efficiency for LNG Applications, S.L.\n- A guarantee granted by a financial institution to third parties in the amount of 730 thousands of euros to support the application for an advance payment due to a subsidy granted by the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE).\n- As indicated in Note 3.3.a related to the investment in Peru by GSP, a bank guarantee letter in the amount of 59,100 thousands of euros (65,500 thousands of dollars) has been provided in connection with the measures of Law No. 30737 indicated in that note.\n\nNo guarantees had been granted with respect to tender processes at December 31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022.\n\n#### c) Investment commitments\n\nThe following items are included:\n\n- The Enagás Group has firm investment commitments in Economic Interest Groupings (EIG) amounting to 22,268 thousands of euros, to be disbursed during 2024 and later years (10,345 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n- The Enagás Group has investment commitments for its shareholdings in two investment funds amounting to approximately 51,096 thousands of euros (57,974 thousands of euros in 2022): (i) KLIMA Energy Transition Fund, which seeks investment opportunities through the acquisition of minority stakes in companies with high growth potential in energy transition sectors such as green hydrogen, biogas, energy efficiency, batteries, sustainable transport or digitalisation of electricity grids; and (ii) Clean H2 Infra Fund, which aims to develop the green hydrogen infrastructure sector and have a\n\npositive impact on the use and development of hydrogen transmission networks.\n\n- In the last quarter of 2023, the Enagás Group, through its affiliate Scale Gas Solutions, S.L.U., signed two contracts for the construction and long-term chartering of a ship for bunkering liquefied natural gas and alternative fuels, the geographical scope of which covers both Spain and Europe. The investment commitments associated with this project amount to 61,737 thousands of euros (68,315 thousands of dollars).\n- The Enagás Group, in relation to the Stade project, has investment commitments estimated at an additional 45,000 thousands of euros until the date of its construction, scheduled for 2027. This commitment corresponds to the disbursements expected to be made by the Group until the start-up of this project, taking into account the forecast for the contracting of long-term debt. The infrastructure projects of the Enagás Group are carried out through long-term contracts in which the Group-related project companies participate, where each project specifies the external debt required for their funding, without recourse to the shareholders or with limited recourse to the guarantees granted.\n\nThe Directors consider that no additional significant liabilities will arise in connection with the transactions disclosed in this note other than those already recognised in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## 1.10 New accounting standards\n\n### a) Standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union in force for the current financial year\n\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of these Consolidated Annual Accounts, other than those applied in the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2022, as they came into force on January 1, 2023 are the following: Amendments to IAS 1 and Practice Statement 2 Disclosures on Accounting Policies; Amendment to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates; Amendment to IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction and International Tax Reform - Pillar Two. None of the standards, interpretations or amendments that are applicable for the first time this year have had a material impact on the Group's accounting policies.\n\n#### Amendment to IAS 12 \"Pillar Two\"\n\n#### **New international taxation standard (Pillar Two)**\n\nPillar Two rules shall apply to the Enagás Group. Pillar Two legislation is currently being processed in Spain. According to the provisions of the Preliminary Draft Law published on December 19, 2023, the rule, once approved, will enter into force, in general, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2024, so, as of December 31, 2023, the Group has no impact related to the rules of Pillar Two on its current tax expense for the year 2023.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/236/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a green circle that is open at the bottom, forming a curved shape above the text.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nFrom the financial year 2024 the group will have to pay a supplementary tax that will tax the profits obtained in any jurisdiction in which it operates in which the effective tax rate, calculated at the jurisdictional level, is lower than the minimum rate of 15%.\n\nFurthermore, the group applies the exception to recognise and disclose information on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided for in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.\n\n#### **Adaptation to Pillar Two**\n\nThe Enagás Group has made an explicit commitment to apply the OECD Pillar Two guidelines. It is aligned with the principles and actions advocated by the OECD and is working on analysing the impact of the new Pillar Two standard to establish a compliance, control and management system to enable it to adapt to the regulation in a timely manner.\n\nAlthough a preliminary analysis has been performed for the Group, which will have to be updated in accordance with the Pillar Two standard in Spain taking into account the existing regulatory framework, an estimated calculation has been made of the minimum complementary tax derived from the application of the Pillar Two standard and, as a result of the aforementioned analysis, all Group entities have an effective tax rate that exceeds 15%. Therefore, according to the estimate made, the new global minimum tax should have no impact on the Enagás Group in 2024.\n\nThe Spanish Pillar Two standard is still under development, as indicated above, so that the estimate does not take into account the possible effects of possible developments of the reference standard or administrative guide at the domestic level.\n\n### b) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB but not effective for the current year\n\nThe Group has not applied in advance the standards, interpretations and amendments to the standards approved by the European Union that have not entered into force at the date of these Consolidated Annual Accounts. Although the Group is currently analysing its impact, based on the analyses carried out to date, the Group does not expect the initial application to have a material impact on its Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\n| Standards                            | Content                                                                                                         | Mandatory<br>application for<br>periods |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Amendments<br>to IAS 1               | Classification of Liabilities as<br>Current or Non-Current, and of<br>Non-Current Liabilities with<br>Covenants | January 1, 2024                         |\n| Amendments<br>to IFRS 16             | Measurement of the lease liability<br>in a sale with subsequent<br>leaseback                                    | January 1, 2024                         |\n| Amendments<br>to IFRS 7 and<br>IAS 7 | Disclosures in relation to supplier<br>financing arrangements                                                   | January 1, 2024<br>(1)                  |\n\n(1) Standard pending approval for use in the EU.\n\n### Amendment to IAS 1 - Classifying Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n\nThe Group has analysed all contracts relating to its liabilities and has not identified any clauses that could have a significant impact on the classification as current or non-current in accordance with the amendment to IAS 1 at the effective date of the amendment.\n\n### Amendment to IFRS 16 - Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nThe Group does not expect to have a significant impact from the application of this amendment as it has not entered into any sale and leaseback transactions since the entry into force of IFRS 16.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/237/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Operational performance of the group\n\n#### RELEVANT ASPECTS\n\n#### Operating profit\n\n**• Operating profit amounted to 457 million euros.**\n\n#### Trade receivables\n\n**• \"Other receivables - Current\" includes the balance pending settlement corresponding to the remuneration of regulated regasification, transmission and underground storage activities for 174 million euros corresponding to the 2023 financial year (453 million euros at December 31, 2022) [\\(Note 2.2\\)](#page-31-0).**\n\n#### Property, plant, and equipment\n\n**This heading involves, at December 31, 2023, 47% of total assets (44% of total assets at December 31, 2022) [\\(Note 2.4\\)](#page-42-0). The change is mainly due to:**\n\n- **• Additions amounting to 162 million euros, corresponding mainly to the acquisition of Reganosa's gas pipeline network, compressor units, air conditioning equipment and work on the Gaviota and Yela underground storage facilities and the Almendralejo and Zamora compressor stations. It also includes actions for the transmission activity, and adaptations to the regasification plants in Barcelona, Cartagena and Huelva.**\n- **• The provision for amortisation for the period, in the amount of 255 million euros (249 million euros in 2022).**\n\nImage /page/237/Figure/17 description: This bar chart compares additions in 2023 and 2022 for land and buildings, technical facilities and machinery, other facilities, tools, and furniture, and prepayments and work in progress. For land and buildings, additions in 2023 were 14,830, while additions in 2022 were 7,617. For technical facilities and machinery, additions in 2023 were 70,651, while additions in 2022 were 7,597. For other facilities, tools, and furniture, additions in 2023 were 3,403, while additions in 2022 were 3,174. For prepayments and work in progress, additions in 2023 were 74,534, while additions in 2022 were 50,381.\n\n#### Current status of the Castor storage collection rights\n\n- **Regarding the Castor storage facility, on November 8, 2019, the Council of Ministers Agreement was published, ending the hibernation of the Castor underground storage facility and agreeing on its dismantling in phases, assigning the work to Enagás Transporte. Said Agreement confirmed the Group's obligation to continue with all operations necessary for the maintenance and functioning of the facilities referred to in Article 3.2 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 until the final phase of dismantling is completed, a commitment that has been fulfilled up to the date of preparation of these annual accounts. Following the Supreme Court rulings of 2018, which annulled various regulations establishing the conditions for the terms of remuneration for the management of the infrastructure, and given the need to introduce an alternative mechanism to obtain the corresponding remuneration for the aforementioned tasks legally entrusted to the Group and that it currently still performs, on December 18, 2018, the Group, through Enagás Transporte, filed a claim for asset liability with the Ministry of Ecological Transition, which, after being dismissed due to administrative silence, continued before the National Court through the filing the corresponding contentious administrative claim on October 3, 2019. In 2022, the Contentious Administrative Chamber of the National High Court filed a question of jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, which was resolved in November 2023, determining the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to resolve the aforementioned appeal, which was in the ruling phase at the date of preparation of these consolidated annual accounts.**\n- **• Thus, the damages lawsuit consists of continuing in the jurisdiction of the claim that has already been filed by the Company to recover the amounts deducted or that have been refunded and those not received, in accordance with the legal conclusions of external and internal advisors. Based on the above, the account receivable for the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., to be paid for the Castor underground storage administration and dismantling, is maintained in the balance sheet, the conclusion being that there is no negative impact on the Group's financial statements for the financial year ([Note 2.2\\)](#page-31-0).**\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-238-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/238/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font.

They are calculated annually on the basis of Enagás GTS, S.A.U.'s remuneration methodology, currently in force for the 2021-2023 and 2024-2026 regulatory periods. Only the revenues from the regulatory account and guarantees of origin are calculated on the basis of the substantiated cost. The monthly attribution of this income to the Income Statement is almost entirely carried out on a straight-line basis.**\n- **• Income arising from regasification, storage, and transmission activities in Spain is calculated based on a regulated remuneration system (Appendix III). Remuneration is made up of several terms that aim to remunerate investment, operation and maintenance costs and other items related to improved productivity and efficiency. The return on investment is the sum of amortisation and financial remuneration, calculated by applying the annual net value of the investment and the financial remuneration rate set for each regulatory period.**\n\n**The remuneration for productivity and efficiency gains includes the term of the continuity of supply remuneration set in the 2014 regulatory reform. As of 2021, this term will be calculated on the basis of the value established for 2020, adjusted by coefficients that no longer depend on fluctuations in demand.** \n\n**Once the regulatory useful life of the facilities has elapsed, and in those cases in which the asset remains operational, the operating and maintenance costs are established as fixed remuneration, increased by a coefficient based on the number of years by which the facility exceeds the regulatory useful life, not accruing any amounts as investment remuneration.**\n\n- **• On January 1, 2021, the new regulatory and remuneration framework came into force with the publication of Circulars 9/2019 of December 12, 2019 and 8/2020 of December 23, 2020 and Royal Decree 1184/2020 of December 29, 2020. The main items of this regulatory reform are set out in Appendix III.**\n- **• The Group's deferred income mainly corresponds to the accrual of amounts received for connecting the basic network infrastructure of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. and Enagás Transporte del Norte, S.L. with networks of distribution companies, secondary transmission companies, gas shippers, and qualified customers. Said income is recognised based on the useful life of the assigned facilities.**\n\n**Based on the types of contractual agreements supporting this type of income, it has been determined that there is an implicit financing component which, under the new regulatory requirements, must be recognised as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.**\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-239-0\"></span>\n\n|      | Annual Report |\n|------|---------------|\n| 2023 |               |\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/239/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font.

They are subsequently measured at amortised cost and related interest accrued at the corresponding effective interest rate is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.**\n- **• Receivables which do not bear explicit interest are recognised at their face value whenever the effect of not discounting the related cash flows is not significant. Subsequent measurement in this instance is still carried out at face value.**\n- **• The Group derecognises financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are transferred, which implies transferring substantially all the risks and rewards inherent in ownership of the financial asset; this is the case in firm asset sales, sales of financial assets with an agreement to repurchase them at their fair value, and securitisations in which the Group neither retains subordinated financing, grants any form of guarantee nor assumes any other type of risk.**\n- **• In contrast, the Group does not derecognise financial assets, but rather recognises a financial liability at an amount equal to the consideration received, in the transfer of financial assets in which it retains substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, such as discounted bills, recourse factoring, disposals of financial assets under repurchase agreements at fixed prices or at the sales price plus interest, and securitisations of financial assets in which the Group retains subordinate liability or grants other types of guarantees which would substantially absorb all possible losses.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• An impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost arises when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover all the corresponding amounts in accordance with the original terms established. The impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement and is determined as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.**\n- **• If, in subsequent periods, the value of the financial asset measured at amortised cost recovers, then the impairment loss is reversed. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds the carrying amount had the impairment not been recognised. The reversal is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.**\n- **• From January 1, 2018, with the application of IFRS 9, the Group recognises an impairment loss for expected credit losses on financial assets.**\n- **• The Group assess the expected credit losses of a financial instrument in a way that reflects:**\n- **a) an amount weighted based on probability and not biased, determined by evaluating a series of possible outcomes;**\n- **b) the temporal value of money; and**\n\n**c) reasonable and well-founded information available on the date of information, without cost or disproportionate effort, on past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.**\n\n**Under the new standard, an entity will measure the value correction for losses of a financial instrument in an amount equal to the expected credit losses during the life of the asset, if the risk of that financial instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition.**\n\n**Conversely, that is, if the credit risk of a financial instrument has not increased significantly since the initial recognition, an entity will measure the value correction for losses at an amount equal to the expected credit losses in the next 12 months.**\n\n**The gain or loss resulting from impairment of value, the amount of the expected credit losses (or reversals) by which it is required that the value adjustment for losses be adjusted on the posting date to reflect the amount to be recognised under this standard will be recorded in the profit for the period.**\n\n**In the case of the Enagás Group, practically all financial assets present a low credit risk at the date of posting, and their exposure to events that generate credit losses during the next 12 months is therefore calculated.**\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/242/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enaga.

This receivable has been reclassified to long-term during 2023, as it is estimated that a judgement will be passed and enforced in more than 12 months (see details below).\n- The amount corresponding to facilities pending recognition is recorded in the long term as the Directors estimate that they will be recognised in a time horizon of more than one year and will result in a lower future collection.\n\n#### **Financial investment in the Gascan project**\n\nIn relation to the situation of the regasification assets of the Gascan project in the Canary Islands, on February 21, 2022, the Spanish High Court of Justice was notified of the ruling rejecting the contentiousadministrative appeal against the rejection by silence of the application for new administrative authorisation of the LNG regasification plant project in the Canary Islands (GASCAN).\n\nOnce the aforementioned ruling became final, on July 6, 2022, a claim for asset liability was submitted to the Council of Ministers, with the aim of implementing an alternative mechanism to recover the costs incurred in said project, considering, based on the legal conclusions, that the recovery of the assets associated with the project is highly probable.\n\nSince the submission of this claim, the assets and liabilities associated with the project were reclassified as long-term receivables and an initial amount of 18,655 thousands of euros were recognised, as well as the default interest.\n\nThis led to an entry in the income statement in the amount of 3,605 thousands of euros in the year 2022, under the heading \"Profit from fixed assets\".\n\nAt December 31, 2023 the receivable amounts to 19,536 thousands of euros (December 31, 2022: 18,929 thousands of euros).\n\n#### **Situation of Castor Storage Facility**\n\nfunctions at the Castor storage facility, which it was legally obliged to do in accordance with the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of As explained in Note 9.1 to the 2014 Annual Accounts of Enagás Transporte S.A.U. on October 4 and also in the 2014 Consolidated Annual Accounts o, 2014 the Official State Gazette published Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 of October 3, by virtue of which urgent measures were adopted in connection with the gas system and title to the nuclear power plants, with a view to guaranteeing the security of people, goods, and the environment with respect to the Castor natural gas underground storage facility, which establishes, among other matters, the following:\n\n- The termination of the operating concession for the Castor underground storage facility, granted by Royal Decree-Law 855/2008, of May 16.\n- The hibernation of the facilities associated with said concession.\n- The appointment of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. for administration of said facilities, for the sole purpose of carrying out the necessary measures for maintenance and operability during the hibernation period, prioritising the goal of guaranteeing the security of the facilities for persons, goods, and the environment, while ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. Likewise, the decision included the stipulation that the maintenance and operational costs be paid to Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. with a charge to income from tolls and royalties of the gas system.\n- The recognition of the investment made for the storage facility by the titleholder of the concession which was extinguished with 1,350,729 thousands of euros, and the establishment of a payment obligation for said amount by Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to the titleholder of the extinguished concession. As a result of assuming the payment obligation, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. enjoys the right to collect access tolls and royalties from the gas system's monthly invoicing for 30 years, for the amount paid to the titleholder of the extinguished concession plus the financial remuneration which the Royal Decree-Law expressly recognises. Likewise, this Royal Decree-Law contains the necessary measures to guarantee full effectiveness of this collection right, that said right could be freely available to Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. or its third party titleholders, and could consequently be totally or partially ceded, transferred, discounted, pledged, or taxed in favour of any third parties, including securitisation funds or other special purpose vehicles or companies, either domestic or international. The cession of the collection right will be effective with respect to the gas system, which will pay the new titleholder the corresponding amounts.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/243/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a logo with the word \"enac\" in blue, with a green circle above the word and a blue curved line below the word.\n\nIn light of the above, on October 4, 2014, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. signed an agreement with various financial entities by virtue of which it ceded the collection right charged to the gas system awarded by the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law, with said entities assuming the payment obligation imposed on Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. In this manner, on November 11, 2014, said financial entities made a payment of 1,350,729 thousands of euros to the titleholder of the extinguished concession.\n\nFurthermore, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. transferred the aforementioned contractual obligations and rights inherent to ownership of the financial asset to said financial entities, thus derecognising it from the balance sheet as the Directors of the Group consider that all associated risks and benefits have been transferred.\n\nOn December 21, 2017 the Constitutional Court handed down sentence No. 152/2017 declaring various provisions of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 as unconstitutional and null and void due to formal errors. Specifically, (i) acknowledgement of the investment made by the renouncing concessionaire and costs accrued up to the date of said norm becoming effective, and thus the consideration in the amount of 1,350,729 thousands of euros, as well as (ii) recognition of the correlated collection right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. with respect to the gas system for the amount of consideration cited, considering that in both cases the reasons given for the urgency were not justified and therefore said measures should be excluded from the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Constitutional Court did declare the following as constitutional and valid: (i) adoption of the decision to hibernate the underground storage facility; (ii) the declaration of the extinction of the concession; and (iii) the appointment of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. for administration of the facilities to the extent the hibernation is prolonged; as well as (iv) recognition of the right to obtain remuneration for the maintenance and operability costs for Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., including any costs incurred for the administration and other related work which said Royal Decree-Law established as a requirement.\n\nIn accordance with the analysis carried out by the Company's external legal advisors, the purchase-sale contract for the collection rights signed by Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. with the financial entities represents the transfer of rights and obligations to the financial entities and in no case does it enable the buyers (or their possible transferees) the possibility of claiming reimbursement for the price received or payment of any other amounts from the seller. Thus, in no case can adverse effects arise in connection with the financing of the operation for the Company due to the sentence of the Constitutional Court, as Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. is not titleholder to the collection right which was annulled nor is it obliged to pay the titleholder of the extinguished concession.\n\nIn addition, in relation to the above, the Supreme Court issued a ruling on October 27, 2020 partially upholding the contentiousadministrative appeal filed by the financial institutions against the alleged rejection by the Council of Ministers of the claim for liability of the Legislature for the partial unconstitutionality of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014, recognising the right of these appellant banks to compensation, by way of liability of the Legislature, of the total debt recognised in their favour, in the amount of 1,350,729,000 euros plus the corresponding legal interest accrued.\n\nLikewise, in accordance with the analysis carried out and the conclusions drawn by the Company's legal advisors and external legal advisors, the aforementioned sentence of the Constitutional Court does not give rise to any negative effect on the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to obtain remuneration for the administration and operations necessary for maintenance and operability of the infrastructure, as the Royal Decree-Law was not affected in such a manner by the declaration of unconstitutionality. Similarly, on the basis of these same conclusions, it is not believed that there has been any negative effect from the process that targets the liability of the Legislator State to financial institutions, since all the risks and benefits of the financial asset have been contractually transferred to the latter and the Supreme Court has also issued a final ruling in their favour.\n\nDuring 2023, no judicial or regulatory pronouncements have taken place in relation to the various rulings of previous years referring to the declaration of unconstitutionality of certain articles of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014, beyond those associated with the ordinary procedural actions of the proceedings that remain in progress.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it should be noted that since 2014 Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. has assumed and been performing management Article 3 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014, which imposed on it the assumption of the administration of the facilities and of the ownership of all the rights and obligations associated with them during the entire period up to the end of the hibernation period through an agreement of the Council of Ministers referred to in Article 1.2 of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law 13/2014.\n\nIn relation to the Castor storage facility, on November 8, 2019, the Council of Ministers published an agreement ending the hibernation of the Castor underground storage facilities and agreeing to dismantle them in phases, assigning the work to Enagás Transporte and including all the operations required for the maintenance and operation of the facilities referred to in Article 3.2 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 until the last phase of dismantling is completed.\n\nWith all of the above, in practice, the adoption of the aforementioned Agreement has not meant that Enagás Transporte has ceased to attend to the tasks it had been carrying out to guarantee the safety of people, property and the environment but, on the contrary, it has confirmed its obligation to continue to carry out all of the operations required for the maintenance and operation of the facilities referred to in Article 3.2 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 until the last phase of dismantling is completed.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-244-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/244/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font.\n\nAnd given that, due to carrying out these tasks, formerly as a storage administrator, and now as a dismantling manager, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., has so far been assuming the costs derived from the operations maintenance and operations imposed, as well as those for the full assumption of the administration and dismantling of the storage; and given that, in addition, the right of this company to obtain remuneration for the functions entrusted by Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 and developed in relation to Castor storage remains in force, since it does not derive from Article 6, annulled by the Constitutional Court, but is expressly recognised in Article 3.2 of the former, which subsists, it is considered that the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to receive the remuneration for the costs incurred is beyond any doubt, with only the specific terms in which this right is specified remaining in doubt, since Article 6 has been annulled.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and as it is necessary to implement an alternative mechanism to receive the remuneration for said tasks, legally entrusted to Enagás Transporte and which the company is still currently carrying out, on December 21, 2018, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. filed a claim for damages with the Ministry for Ecological Transition, requesting (i) the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to obtain compensation, for the damages sustained as a result of the administration tasks of the facilities, plus the pertinent interests, (ii) payment of the amounts corresponding to the remuneration for the costs assumed by Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., up to the moment when the resolution is issued, plus the pertinent interests, and (iii) the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to obtain compensation for the damages that may be caused to it as a consequence of the tasks of administering the facilities until such time as the Council of Ministers adopted an agreement that would put an end to the storage hibernation situation.\n\nThe aforementioned claim for liability filed on December 21, 2018 was rejected by a presumptive resolution of the Ministry for Ecological Transition. On October 3, 2019 action was pursued before the National High Court through the filing of the corresponding contentious-administrative appeal against the aforementioned presumptive resolution in order to recover all amounts corresponding to the tasks entrusted, which Enagás has continued to provide to date. With regard to this contentious-administrative appeal, in 2022 the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court filed a question of jurisdiction in the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court. It was resolved in November 2023, confirming the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to resolve the aforementioned appeal. At the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated accounts, the judgement of this court has not yet been delivered.\n\nAccording to the legal conclusions of the external and internal advisors, it is considered that this damages lawsuit is the mechanism initiated by the Company for recovering both the amounts deducted from the remuneration corresponding to financial year 2017, the amounts not paid referring to financial years 2018 and the following, and the amounts that have been refunded as a result of the review actions by the CNMC in relation to the settlements corresponding to 2014, 2015 and 2016, included in the final approved settlements of the 2015 and 2016 years, as well as their possible interests. Based on the above, the account receivable for the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to be paid for the performance of the works, the management and the dismantling of the Castor underground storage is maintained in the balance sheet, the conclusion being upheld that there is no negative impact on the\n\nGroup's financial statements as a result of the judgements of the Constitutional Court or the Supreme Court mentioned above. The amount is recorded as long-term as it is not possible to ensure a collection period of less than twelve months in accordance with the different actions.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the amount recorded as Group revenues during 2014 to 2023 relating to the activities and work associated with the Castor storage facility infrastructure by the Enagás Group that are pending collection amounts to 105,720 thousands of euros (94,283 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n### b) Trade and other current receivables Trade and other current receivables\n\nIn the \"Other receivables\" heading, under current assets, the Enagás Group mainly records the outstanding balance corresponding to the remuneration of regulated regasification, transmission and underground storage activities at the end of financial years 2023 and 2022, in the amount of 174,378 thousands of euros and 452,695 thousands of euros, respectively. This heading will include shortterm deficit of the Underground Storage business for the 2022 gas year amounting to 7,112 thousands of euros.\n\nThe deficit associated with the Local Networks activity for the 2023 and 2022 gas years, in the amount of 12,632 thousands of euros, has been recorded as long term as it is considered that it will be recovered in over 12 months.\n\nIt should be noted that, as various gas activities have resulted in surpluses (Trunk Transmission, Underground Storage and Regasification activities in gas year 2023 and Trunk Transmission and Regasification activities in gas year 2022), the corresponding amount has been reclassified to long-term and short-term liabilities based on the best estimate, in the amounts of 133,739 thousands of euros and 200,377 thousands of euros, respectively.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-245-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/245/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color.

In 2023 and 2022, no financial expenses were capitalised for this item.**\n- **• Personnel expenses directly related to work in progress, lowering personnel expenses in the amount of 4,237 thousands of euros at December 31, 2023 (4,447 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022) (Note 2.1.b).**\n- **• The book value of these assets includes an estimate of the current value of the costs to the Group for the dismantling tasks, credited to the \"Long-term provisions\" heading (Note 2.9.a) of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. This provision is subject to periodic review, in order to monitor possible changes in any of the hypotheses used to estimate decommissioning costs, in this case assuming the corresponding change in book value, which would be made prospectively, as has been previously indicated in Note 2.9.a to the Consolidated Annual Accounts.**\n- **• Non-extractable gas required for exploitation of underground natural gas storage (cushion gas) is recognised under PP&E, depreciated over the specific prevailing useful life (20 years) or over the leasing period if less.**\n- **• Natural gas required for minimum levels in gas pipelines and minimum operating levels for regasification plants, (also called \"heel gas\") is recognised as PP&E that cannot be amortised given that it is not available for sale as indicated under current regulations. It is measured at the purchase price as indicated in Order ITC/3993/2006 an Order IET/2736/2015.**\n- **• The restatement of assets recognised under PP&E in accordance with Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 of June 7, on balance sheet restatements, has an effect of 3,135 thousands of euros on amortisation charges in 2023 (3,271 thousands of euros in 2022).**\n- **• On January 1, 2021, the new regulatory and remuneration framework came into force with the publication of Circulars 9/2019 of December 12, 2019 and 8/2020 of December 23, 2020 and Royal Decree 1184/2020 of December 29, 2020. ([Appendix III](#page-303-0)).**\n\n**Grants**\n\n**• The official grants relating to the assets recognised under PP&E lower the acquisition cost of said assets and are taken to the income statement over the foreseen useful lives of the corresponding assets, decreasing the related amortisation.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• PP&E items are amortised using the straight-line method, applying annual amortisation rates that reflect the estimated useful lives of the corresponding assets.**\n- **• The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of the assets do not exceed the recoverable amounts which result from calculating discounted future cash flows generated by said assets based on foreseen remuneration under current regulations.**\n- **• For lease assets arising from the application of IFRS 16, the average term considered in each of the leases has been determined on the basis of both the economic substance and the contractually agreed duration as well as the assumptions on the extension/early termination of the contracts.**\n- **• Depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis in accordance with the following useful lives:**\n\n|                                                | Annual rate | Useful life (years) |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Buildings                                      | 2% - 5%     | 50 - 20             |\n| Technical facilities (transmission<br>network) | 2,5% - 5%   | 40 - 20             |\n| Tanks                                          | 5%          | 20                  |\n| Underground Storage Facilities                 | 5% - 10%    | 20 - 10             |\n| Cushion gas                                    | 5%          | 20                  |\n| Other technical facilities and<br>machinery    | 2,5% - 12%  | 40 - 8,33           |\n| Equipment and tools                            | 30%         | 3,33                |\n| Furniture and fixtures                         | 10%         | 10                  |\n| Information technology<br>equipment            | 25%         | 4                   |\n| Transport equipment                            | 16%         | 6,25                |\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n**Decreases,** \n\n**Increases or** \n\nImage /page/247/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Port of El Musel (Gijón)**\n\nIn relation to the situation of the regasification plant at the Port of El Musel (Gijón), on February 3, 2023, the CNMC notified the company of the Resolution establishing a special temporary economic regime for this infrastructure, and on February 17, 2023, the terminal received approval from the CNMC of the special economic regime for its logistics use.\n\nSubsequently, on June 7, 2023, the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO) granted Administrative Authorisation to the El Musel LNG terminal by Ministerial Order TED/578/2023, establishing the technical conditions for the provision of LNG logistics services at the plant.\n\nThe logistics services offered by this infrastructure, which are provided on the basis of unregulated access, are the unloading and loading of ships and storage, which were allocated in favour of Endesa as part of the \"open season\" process.\n\nIn addition, the Terminal will offer regulated access services, such as the regasification capacity strictly necessary for the efficient management of boil-off gas as well as tanker truck loading.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Ministerial Order, on July 28 the Commissioning Certificate was approved by the Industry and Energy Department of the Government Delegation in the Principality of Asturias, in accordance with the terms established in article 85 of Royal Decree 1434/2002, at which time both the provision of the aforementioned logistics services and the economic regime applicable to the terminal established by the Resolution of the Regulatory Supervision Chamber of the CNMC, dated February 3, 2023, commenced, thus initiating the corresponding depreciation of the property, plant and equipment corresponding to the terminal.\n\n{250}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/250/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color.\n\n## 2.5 Intangible assets\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n<span id=\"page-250-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n**Goodwill and business combinations**\n\n- **• The acquisition of control of a subsidiary by the parent constitutes a business combination, which is recognised using the acquisition method.**\n- **• Goodwill or negative goodwill arising on the combination is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which meet the relevant recognition criteria and the cost of the business combination, all measured at the acquisition date.**\n- **• Goodwill that arises upon acquisition of companies whose functional currency is not the euro is recognised in the functional currency of the acquired company, translating to euros at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.**\n- **• Goodwill is not amortised and is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment losses. Goodwill impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent periods.**\n\n**Other intangible assets**\n\n**• Development costs are capitalised by amortising on a straight-line basis over the corresponding useful life, provided they are specifically itemised by project, their amounts can be clearly established, and technical success and economic and commercial feasibility of the project are reasonably assured.**\n\n**The Group recognises all research expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement, including those development costs for which technical and commercial viability cannot be established. The amount recognised in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statement in connection with research expenses totals 885 thousands of euros in 2022 (549 thousands of euros in 2022).**\n\n- **• Concessions can only be included under assets when acquired for consideration separately by the Company and corresponding to concessions that can be transferred, or in the amount of expenses incurred to acquire them directly from the corresponding State or Public Authority. Should circumstances involving non-compliance with stipulated conditions arise which lead to the loss of rights related to a concession, the corresponding carrying amount for the concession will be written down in order to cancel the net value. These concessions are amortised on the basis of their useful lives.**\n- **• Acquisition and development costs incurred with respect to basic IT systems used for management are recognised with a charge to \"Intangible assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Maintenance costs of IT systems are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year in which they are incurred. They are measured at the amount disbursed for ownership or right-of-use of the IT programs, as well as their production cost if they are developed by the Group.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND

Fully amortised elements\n\nFully amortised intangible assets recognised by the Enagás Group and still in use at 2023 and 2022 year-end are detailed as follows:\n\nImage /page/252/Figure/3 description: This bar chart compares data from 2023 and 2022 across three categories: Development, IT applications, and Other intangible assets. In Development, the value for 2023 is 4,841, while for 2022, it is 3,811. For IT applications, the value in 2023 is 222,144, and in 2022, it is 213,379. Lastly, in Other intangible assets, both 2023 and 2022 have a value of 9,997.\n\n### 2.6 Non-current assets held for sale\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n- **• An entity classifies a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.**\n- **• For the classification, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, which is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, with the period being extended if the delay is caused by events and circumstances beyond the company's control and there is sufficient evidence of commitment to the sale plan and a reasonable price is negotiated than Management can consider acceptable.**\n- **• An entity shall measure non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n**Classification in this category involves the application of judgement to determine whether the asset (or disposal group) meets the above requirements by performing a detailed analysis of the particular facts and circumstances of each transaction.** \n\nOn April 24, 2023, Enagás Internacional, S.L.U. effectively closed the transaction whereby Enagás Internacional, S.L.U. transferred its shareholdings in Gasoducto de Morelos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Morelos O&M, S.A.P.I. de C.V. under the agreement of sale to MIP V International AIV, L.P. (a wholly owned subsidiary, indirectly, of the Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V, L.P. fund managed by Macquarie Asset Management). The agreement was signed in 2021 for 190 million dollars (100%), resulting in an after-tax capital gain for the Enagás Group of 42.2 million euros.\n\nAs it has not represented a line of business, it has not been included in the income statement as a discontinued operation.\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/253/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

At the closing of this period, the Enagás Group considers residual values based on the cash flows of the last period with a growth rate equal to zero.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n**Determination of impairment losses on non-current assets other than financial assets is based on fulfilment of a series of hypotheses which are described below in this note and are revised annually. The Group identifies its operating segments based on internal reports relating to the companies comprising the Group which are regularly reviewed, discussed, and evaluated in the decision-making process, as indicated in** Note 4.7**.**\n\n**To the extent that assets grouped within a segment are at the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified, the segment is identified as a cash generating unit (CGU).** \n\n**The CGUs identified by the Enagás Group in 2023 are shown below:**\n\n- **• Infrastructure activity in Spain (includes transmission, regasification, and storage).**\n- **• Technical Management of the System.**\n\n**In addition, as explained in Note 1.6, for investments accounted for by the equity method, each associate or joint venture is considered as a CGU.**\n\n**The goodwill presented in the balance sheet is allocated to the Infrastructure Activity CGU in Spain.**\n\n**To estimate value in use, the Enagás Group prepares forecasts regarding future cash flows after taxes based on the most recent budget approved by the Directors. The best estimates available for income, costs, investment and dividends (in the case of investments accounted for using the equity method) relating to CGUs are used for said forecasts, making use of past experience, sector forecasts, and future expectations, in accordance with the prevailing regulatory framework and corresponding contracts.**\n\n**With regard to infrastructure activities, in continuation of the impairment methodology applied in previous years, the best estimate of revenue items is used, calculated on the basis of the changes in the parameters taken into account in the current remuneration framework. This criterion is in line with that used in the economic and financial projections included in the strategic update of the Enagás Group. Therefore, in order to determine the residual value, in application of standard market methodological practices, it is assumed that the flows of the last year analysed will be normalised (taking as a reference base the projection of the main variables of the current remuneration framework at both the revenue level - financial/ amortisation/REVU/OPEX - and the expense level - OPEX and amortisation) without applying any adjustment and assuming a growth rate equal to zero.**\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/254/Picture/7 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a partial circle, with the top portion in green and the bottom portion in blue. The circle appears to be incomplete, with a gap at the bottom.\n\n**The last period considered for projections is the one corresponding to the year in which the regulatory useful life ends, based on the age of the facilities at the time.** \n\n**With respect to the activities corresponding to Technical Management of the System, residual values were calculated based on the cash flows of the last financial year, using a zero growth rate and no normalisation adjustments. This is due to the fact that, as indicated in** [Appendix III](#page-152-0)**, revenue corresponding to this activity is meant to settle the obligations of Enagás GTS, S.A.U. as Technical Manager of the System. This is calculated according to the applicable remuneration methodology for the 2021-2023 and 2024-2026 regulatory periods (see Note 2.1). For the last period, the same criteria were applied as those used for infrastructure activity, under the understanding that while the gas infrastructure is operational and there is demand for gas, technical management of the gas system will continue.** \n\n**As mentioned in Note 2.1 and developed in** [Appendix III](#page-152-0)**, on January 1, 2021, the new regulatory and remuneration framework came into force with the publication of Circulars 9/2019 of December 12, 2019 and 8/2020 of December 23, 2020 and Royal Decree 1184/2020 of December 29, 2020.**\n\n**The modifications in the remuneration model incorporated in these have been taken into account in the calculation of the projected flows from January 1, 2021.**\n\n**The Directors consider that their projections are reliable and that past experience, taken together with the nature of the business, make it possible to predict cash flows for the periods under consideration.**\n\n**The most representative hypotheses used in the projections, based on business forecasts and past experience, are the following:**\n\n- **• Regulated remuneration was estimated in accordance with the remuneration approved by CNMC Circulars and RD 1184/2020 for the years in which it is available, while for subsequent years the same updating mechanisms established by law have been used and a better estimate has been made for the costs paid based on audited costs.**\n- **• Investment: the best available information on investment plans for assets and maintenance of infrastructures and systems has been used, based on the one hand on the history of investment in maintenance and systems and, on the other, in new projects that are highly likely to be executed in accordance with the work in progress being developed with the Ministry and the CNMC.**\n- **• Operating and maintenance costs were estimated considering the prevailing operation and maintenance contracts, as well as remaining estimated costs based on sector knowledge and past experience. The projections made were consistent with the growth expected as a result of the investment plan.**\n- **• Other revenue and costs were projected based on sector knowledge, past experience, consistent with the growth expected as a result of the investment plan.**\n- **• Future dividends have been projected based on the company's knowledge, past experience and activity in free cash flows.**\n- **• In addition, lease liabilities have not been taken into account in the value in use of the CGU or in its carrying amount.**\n- **• In order to calculate present value, projected future cash flows are discounted at an after-tax rate which reflects the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) corresponding to the business and the geographical area in which the business is carried out. For its calculation, the time value of money is taken into consideration together with the riskfree rate and risk premiums generally used by analysts of the business and geographic area in question. The risk-free rate corresponds to the sovereign bonds issued by each country in the corresponding market, with sufficient depth and solvency. However, associated country risk is also taken into consideration for each geographical area. The risk premium of the asset corresponds to the risks specific to the asset, calculated taking into consideration the estimated betas in accordance with the selection of comparable businesses dedicating themselves to a similar main activity.**\n- **• In addition, lease liabilities have not been taken into account in the value in use of the CGU or in its carrying amount. The after-tax discount rate for regulated activities in Spain will be between 5.1% and 7.0% in 2023 (between 3.8% and 5.8% in 2022), while the pre-tax rate will be between 6.7% and 9.3% in 2023 (between 4.6% and 6.5% in 2022).**\n- **• Considering that all the CGUs have been operating normally during 2023, the sensitivity analysis of the discount rate has been performed using a range of +0.5% and -0.5%. No significant associated risks have arisen from this analysis. Thus, the Group management considers that, within the specified ranges, there would be no changes in the impairment calculation.**\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-255-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/255/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Consolidated Annual Accounts, but rather are disclosed, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is considered remote.**\n- **• Provisions, which are quantified taking into consideration the best available evidence on implications of obligating events and that are re-estimated at each balance sheet date, are used to cover the specific obligations for which they were originally recognised and are partially or fully reversed when said obligations decrease or cease to exist.**\n- **• The compensation to be received from a third party when an obligation is settled is recognised as an asset, provided it is certain that reimbursement will be received, unless there is a legal relationship whereby a portion of risk has been externalised as a result of which the Group is not liable, in which case, reimbursement will be taken into consideration in estimating the amount of any provisions.**\n\n**The policy followed with respect to the recognition of provisions for risks and expenses is to recognise the estimated amount required to settle probable or certain liabilities arising from litigation underway, pending indemnities or liabilities, sureties and similar guarantees. They are recognised upon emergence of the liability or obligation determining the indemnity or payment.**\n\n- **• At year-end 2023 and 2022, several legal proceedings were underway against business groups in connection with matters relating to the normal course of their activities. The Group's legal advisors and Directors consider that the final outcome of these proceedings and claims will not have a significant effect on its future Consolidated Annual Accounts.**\n- **• Dismantling provisions are subject to periodic review, in order to monitor possible changes in any of the assumptions used, assuming in that case the corresponding change in book value, applied prospectively.**\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report |\n|---------------|\n| 2023          |\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/256/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

([Note](#page-279-0)  [4.2](#page-279-0))\n\nThe Directors of the Company consider that the provisions recognised in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet for litigation and arbitration risk as well as other risks described in this note are adequate and, in this respect, they do not expect any additional liabilities to arise other than those already recorded. Given the nature of the risks covered by these provisions, it is not possible to determine a reasonably reliable schedule of payment dates, if any.\n\n#### b) Contingent liabilities\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Enagás Groups has a continge[n](#page-262-0)t liability amounting to 2 million euros further to those in[di](#page-279-0)cated in [Note 3.3.a](#page-262-0) in relation to the GSP project in Peru, as well as in [Note 4.2](#page-279-0)[.](#page-279-0)\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-257-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/257/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image.

During 2023, the Group maintains cash-flow hedges and net investment hedges.**\n\n#### Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. (\"GSP\")\n\n- **• In relation to the situation of the investment in GSP, as a result of the termination of the concession contract on January 24, 2017, the dispute between the Peruvian State and Enagás regarding the application of the investment recovery mechanism established in the GSP Concession contract continues. In this regard, an international arbitration was initiated in 2018 under the Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (hereinafter, APPRI) Spain-Peru, as detailed in Note 3.3.a submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter ICSID). This proceeding continues to take its regular course, and once hearings have been held and briefs filed in the second half of 2022, the award is expected.

This acquisition took place within the framework of the \"Temporary Treasury Share Buy-Back Scheme\", whose exclusive aim was to meet the obligations of delivering shares to the Executive Director and members of the Enagás Group management team under the current remuneration scheme according to the terms and conditions of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan (ILP) and the Remuneration Policy approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. The shares were purchased in compliance with the conditions set out in Article 5 of Regulation EC/2273/2003 and subject to the terms authorised at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. Management of the Temporary Treasury Share Buy-Back Scheme was entrusted to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), which carried out the transaction on behalf of Enagás, S.A. independently and without exercising influence on the process ([Note 4.4](#page-285-0)).\n\nDuring the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the following movements in treasury shares have taken place:\n\n| No. of shares as | No. of shares | No. of shares  | Nº acciones al |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| at January 1,    | acquired new  | implemented    | 31 de          |\n| 2023             | target        | for the target | diciembre 2023 |\n| 821,375          | —             | (97,796)       | 723,579        |\n\n#### d) Reserves\n\nThe Corporate Enterprises Act stipulates that 10% of profit for the year must be transferred to the legal reserve until it represents at least 20% of share capital. At 2023 and 2022 year-end, the legal reserve was fully allocated and totalled 78,597 thousands of euros.\n\nThe legal reserve can be used to increase capital by the amount exceeding 10% of the new capital after the increase. Except for this purpose, until the legal reserve exceeds the limit of 20% of capital, it can only be used to compensate losses provided there are no other reserves available.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n260\n\n#### <span id=\"page-259-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)

that can be attributed to shareholders who have no control over the subsidiary.**\n- **• Such control is transferred when ownership of the shares gives the holder the risks and rewards associated with ownership and access to the returns associated with its interest.**\n- **• They are recognised under equity as a line item separate from the equity attributable to the parent.**\n- **• In business combinations, minority interests are measured at fair value or the proportional part of net assets acquired.**\n- **• Changes in the percentage of ownership interest held by the parent in the subsidiary which do not represent a loss of control are recognised as equity transactions.**\n- **• The amount corresponding to minority interests is calculated for the whole Enagás Group based on the carrying amounts of the companies in which minority interests is held.**\n\nImage /page/259/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logo of Enagás, a Spanish natural gas transmission system

Subsequent measurement in this instance is still carried out at face value.**\n\n#### Financial assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income\n\n**• Equity instruments are measured by default at fair value through profit or loss, but there is an option at initial recognition to present changes in fair value in profit/loss. This decision is irrevocable and is made for each asset individually.** \n\n#### Fair value measurement\n\n- **• In accordance with IFRS 13, for purposes of financial disclosure, the measurement of fair value is classified as Level 1, 2, or 3, based on the degree that the inputs applied are observable and their importance in measuring fair value in its totality, as described below:**\n\t- **Level 1 Inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for instruments of an identical nature traded in active markets.**\n\t- **Level 2 Inputs are based on valuation models for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data.**\n- **Level 3 Inputs are not generally observable and generally reflect estimates regarding market movements for determining the price of the asset or liability.**\n\n#### Trade and other payables\n\n**• Trade and other payables that do not accrue explicit interest are measured at their face value when the effect of financial discounting is not significant.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n**• In accordance with the requirements established under IFRS 9, the Group regularly calculates the effect of the expected loss on financial assets.

(7.59%) and the funds Klima Energy Transition Fund, F.C.R. and Clean H2 Infra Fund. The change compared to 2022 is mainly due to the change in the fair value of these investments, as well as additional investments made by the Enagás Group during 2023.\n\n#### **Loans**\n\nThis mainly includes loans granted to group companies consolidated using the equity method and therefore not eliminated in the consolidation process.\n\nThe detail of current and non-current loans to Group companies is detailed in Note 4.3.\n\n#### **Other**\n\n\"Other non-current financial assets\" include an amount of 2,250 thousands of euros (6,505 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022) corresponding to the investment made by the Group in Economic Interest Groupings (EIG) whose activity is the leasing of assets managed by another entity unrelated to the Group and which retains both the majority of profits as well as the risks related to the activities, with the Group only availing itself of the regulated tax incentives in Spanish legislation. The Group attributes the carryforward tax losses generated by these EIGs against shares and taking into account the debt registered with the Tax Authorities, recognising the corresponding financial income.\n\nIn addition, receivables from the termination of the GSP concession contract are included. At December 31, 2023, the total amount to be recovered amounted to 456,779 thousands of euros (473,999 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022) relating to both the recovery of the financial investment and the credit rights associated with the recovery of the guarantees executed against the Enagás Group as a result of the termination of the concession contract in GSP, the amount being updated and considering June 30, 2024 as the date for obtaining a favourable award.\n\n#### **Gasoducto Sur Peruano (\"GSP\")**\n\nIn relation to the investment in Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. (hereinafter \"GSP\") as indicated in the Consolidated Annual Accounts of the Enagás Group for 2016, on January 24, 2017 the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons of the Peruvian Government's Ministry of Energy and Mines (hereinafter the \"State of Peru\") sent an official letter to GSP stating \"the termination of the concession agreement owing to causes attributable to the concession holder\", in accordance with the terms of Clause 6.7 of the \"Improvements to the Energy Security of the Country and the Development of the Gasoducto Sur Peruano\" (hereinafter \"the Project\") concession agreement, because the financial close had not been evidenced within the period established in the agreement (January 23, 2017), and proceeded to the immediate enforcement of the totality of the guarantee for full compliance given by GSP (262.5 million dollars), to ensure fulfilment of the obligations relating to the concession, which in the case of Enagás generated a payment of 65.6 million dollars. Also in January 2017, they paid GSP bank financing sureties to Enagás amounting to 162 million dollars, including both principal and interest pending payment. In December 2017, the process for delivering the Concession Assets held by GSP was substantially completed with the Peruvian State assuming control over them.\n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nAs a result of the termination of the concession contract, in accordance with the opinion of external and internal legal advisors, the Peruvian State had the obligation to apply Clause 20 of the Concession Contract, calculating the Net Carrying Amount (hereinafter NCA) of the Concession Assets, calling up to a maximum of three auctions to award the Concession, with the auction result being to pay GSP the NCA. With the amount that GSP would have received for the NCA of the Concession Assets, it would have proceeded to settle its obligations to third parties and, if appropriate, reimburse the capital contributions made by its shareholders.\n\nAs a result of inaction by the State of Peru in relation to the aforementioned procedure, on December 19, 2017, Enagás notified the Peruvian State about the existence of a dispute relating to the investment in GSP with a view to reaching an amicable agreement on the terms of Article 9.1 of the Agreement for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of APPRI in Spanish signed by the Republic of Peru and the Kingdom of Spain. This notification represented the beginning of the six-month period for direct contact prior to initiating international arbitration in which the APPRI acts as the mechanism for recovering the investment in GSP. Once the required six months of direct contact between Enagás and the Peruvian State had elapsed without it being possible to reach an amicable settlement of this dispute, on July 2, 2018, Enagás filed an application for the initiation of arbitration against the Peruvian State regarding its investment in GSP with the ICSID.\n\nThrough this arbitration procedure, it is expected that the Peruvian State will reimburse Enagás for its investment in GSP, this being the mechanism by which the financial assets recorded in the balance sheet would be recovered. Thus, it is expected that the Arbitration Court hearing the arbitration procedure in the ICSID will uphold the arguments of Enagás, issuing an award recognising that the Peruvian State has not protected Enagás' investment under the APPRI and, therefore, it must compensate it by paying it the value of that investment.\n\nWith respect to this ICSID arbitration procedure, the Arbitration Court was constituted on July 18, 2019, and Legal Resolution No. 1 was issued on September 24, 2019, establishing the procedural rules that govern the arbitration procedure until the award is handed down.\n\nIn accordance with this Resolution, Enagás filed its claim on January 20, 2020, and the Peruvian State replied on July 17, 2020. Subsequently, the documentary exhibition phase took place in which the parties requested each other to provide documents that each of them considered relevant. This was followed by the presentation of the reply by Enagás on May 31, 2021 and the rejoinder by the Peruvian State on October 20, 2021, with Enagás finally presenting its rejoinder on preliminary objections on January 17, 2022. The hearing phase continued in September 2022, with written submissions in November 2022. According to the indications of the Court, it is at an advanced stage and is expected to be issued during the first half of 2024.\n\nAlso with regard to the ICSID, on January 21, 2020, Odebrecht filed a request to initiate arbitration against the Republic of Peru to recover its investment in GSP.\n\nRegarding the Enagás' statement of claim, the main argument maintained by Enagás is that, if the Peruvian State had complied with its obligation under the Concession Contract, it would have calculated the NCA and organised the three auctions, which it was obliged to do, to award the Concession, and the proceeds of the auction would have been delivered to GSP, which would have applied the amount delivered to pay its creditors and return the capital to its shareholders. Enagás' claim is based on the fact that the Peruvian State must pay 100% of the NCA to GSP, since on January 24, 2018, one year has passed since the end of the concession contract and in that time there have been no calls for auctions. The absence of an auction means that the legal advisors of Enagás believe that it should be considered that GSP would have received 100% of the NCA because it was deprived of the possibility of receiving it when not even the first auction was convened. Therefore, starting from the NCA considered, a certain payments waterfall would have been applied.\n\nEnagás considers that, taking into account the NCA of the Concession Assets determined by an independent expert, and also taking into account the payment waterfall as per the terms of the insolvency legislation, as well as the contracts between Enagás and the members and creditors of GSP relating to subordination and credit agreements, if the State had satisfied its obligations, and thus paid GSP the amount obtained in the auction, Enagás would have recovered its investment.\n\nWith respect to the amount of the NCA, there have been no variations other than the evolution of the exchange rate for certain items in Peruvian soles, maintaining at December 31, 2023 the valuation performed by a firm of independent appraisers hired by Enagás for a total updated value of the NCA of 1,959 million dollars (1,953 million dollars at December 31, 2022).\n\nTaking into account this updated NCA, if the payment waterfall were to be applied to it as per the terms of the insolvency laws, the subordination and the assignment of credit agreements entered into by Enagás and its partners in GSP, Enagás would recover the total value of its investment claim with the ICSID in the amount of 511 million dollars.\n\nIn relation to the aforementioned contracts for the subordination of rights and assignment of credits, their effectiveness and form of application has been successively called into question by Enagás' partners in GSP through different arbitration proceedings, with the Peruvian legal advisors considering these agreements to be fully valid and enforceable. Likewise, the INDECOPI authority has recognised the full effectiveness of the aforementioned agreements in GSP's bankruptcy process. In relation to the arbitration proceeding still in process filed by Negocios de Gas, subsidiary from Aenza (formerly Graña y Montero) questioning the legitimacy of Enagás to claim its credits against GSP, on July 13, 2021, Negocios de Gas communicated to the Court its withdrawal of the claim, thus requesting the end of the arbitration proceeding without the issuance of an award.\n\n{264}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/264/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is a logo with the word \"enac\" inside of a circle.\n\nAs regards the arbitration proceedings against the State of Peru, based on the conclusions determined by Enagás' external and internal legal advisors, the recoverability of the totality of the Enagás investment in GSP, consisting of receivables in relation to the aforementioned enforced guarantees to the total of 226.8 million dollars, interests of 1.8 million dollars, various invoices for professional services rendered to the amount of 7.6 million dollars and the share capital contributed to GSP for the amount of 275.3 million dollars, is considered likely.\n\nRegarding the duration of the recovery periods, taking into account the time required to resolve a dispute of this complexity through international arbitration, as well as the timeframes indicated in the aforementioned ICSID Resolution No. 1 and the review of the planned proceedings, and the indications of the Court itself, it is considered that June 30, 2024 is the estimated date for obtaining an award in favour of Enagás.\n\nBased on this, the amounts outlined in the preceding paragraph are recorded at their updated value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 for a total amount of 456,779 thousands of euros (473,999 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n#### **Other related matters**\n\n On March 12, 2018, Law No. 30737 was published \"guaranteeing immediate payment to the Peruvian State to repair civil damage caused by corruption and related crimes\". On May 9, 2018, Supreme Decree 096-2018-EF was published, enacting the regulations of the aforementioned Law.\n\nIn accordance with Article 9 of Law No. 30737, legal persons and legal entities in the form of partnerships, consortiums and joint ventures who may have benefited from the awarding of contracts, or subsequent to it, jointly with persons who have been convicted or who may have acknowledged having committed crimes against the public administration, asset laundering or related crimes, or their equivalents against the State of Peru, in Peru or abroad are classified as Category 2, and therefore fall within its scope of application.\n\nIn June 2019, the Peruvian Judiciary approved the Effective Partnership Agreement reached between the Odebrecht Group and the Peruvian Public Prosecutor's Office, and the GSP project was not included as one of the projects affected by corruption-related events. Subsequently, on October 15, 2019, Enagás Internacional received notification from the Peruvian Public Prosecutor's Office informing it of the existence of an extension of this effective partnership agreement with Odebrecht, in which it would be acknowledging that it had made illegal payments - according to the Public Prosecutor's Office - with respect to the GSP project, although there are still no facts known or consistent or proven links between GSP and corruption in the awarding of the project.\n\nWith regard to other processes of effective collaboration with other third parties, in the second quarter of 2022, the judicial approval of those relating to José and Hernando Graña took place, with the remaining ones pending approval. From the information contained in the tax record, there is no consistent or proven element linking GSP to corruption in the awarding of the project.\n\nIn this regard, no new facts were presented in the arbitration before ICSID, neither in the statement of defence nor in the rejoinder, nor in the hearings held, which demonstrably and irrefutably link the GSP to corruption.\n\nNotwithstanding the above comments on the extension of the initial Effective Collaboration Agreement signed by Odebrecht and the Public Prosecutor of Peru, there have been no significant developments regarding the actions of the Public Prosecutor of Peru on the investigation of Odebrecht's activities in Peru and other investigations carried out by the Special Team of the Peruvian Prosecutor's Office for alleged crimes that could somehow be related to the awarding of the project. In this regard, two investigations are known to be in progress:\n\n- The first one signed with Folder 321-2014, related to aggravated collusion between a former Odebrecht employee and a public official, whose control and clean-up phase has been resumed on June 28, 2019, after the Supreme Court rejected the request of the Ad Hoc Attorney's Office of Peru to include one of Odebrecht's subsidiaries as a civil third party. At this stage it is expected that a decision on the opening of the oral proceedings will be taken. Based on the opinions of Enagás external legal advisors for the Peruvian criminal code, the possibility of sentencing Odebrecht's former employee is considered to be remote. In this same case, the preparatory investigative court has declared the incorporation of GSP as a liable third party as wrongful.\n- In relation to the second investigation opened, sealed with Folder 12-2017, being that those under investigation include two employees of Enagás and Enagás Internacional, S.L.U., on February 27, 2020, it was decided to move to the preliminary investigation stage. Based on the opinion of our external legal advisors in Peruvian criminal law, it is maintained that to date there is no indication that the investigations could be detrimental to Enagás.\n\nIn relation to this second file, on December 30, 2020, the Peruvian Public Prosecutor's Office requested its incorporation as a civil plaintiff in the criminal proceedings in order to request the payment of a possible reparation in the aforementioned proceedings once a final judgement has been handed down, as well as in order to request possible precautionary measures that seek to ensure the eventual reparation. The initial request was rejected on formal grounds on June 4, 2021. On November 23, 2021, the Attorney's Office submitted a new request for 1,107 million dollars for the GSP project. After the two previous initial applications were rejected on formal grounds, the last application was admitted on March 28, 2023 and thus the Public Prosecutor's Office was constituted as a civil plaintiff, with Enagás Internacional, S.L.U. being incorporated as a civilly liable third party on August 2, 2023. Both proceedings have been contested and have not yet been decided.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/265/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color. The words are stacked on top of each other.\n\nThe amount will be determined in detail by the criminal judge in charge once the final sentence has been handed down. According to both external and internal lawyers, the amount requested has not been duly supported nor does it comply with the possible civil liability that could be claimed on the basis of the offences referred to in the indictment. An objective reference for the calculation is the one established by Law No. 30737, which assures payment of civil compensation to the Peruvian State. Considering the very\n\npreliminary stage of the criminal process, taking into account the elements of knowledge available to date and based on the conclusions of the specialist local lawyers, it is considered that the probability of the imposition of this compensation in any case does not exceed 50% (possible), and therefore it is not appropriate to register any provision, as it is considered a contingent liability. Likewise, in the event that it could eventually be declared wellfounded, and the amount of the compensation could not be reliably estimated, the reference amount to be considered would be between 0 and 242 million dollars.\n\nMoreover, with regard to civil compensation, even without evidence of a criminal conviction or a confession of the commission of crimes, as required under Article 9 of Law No. 30737, on June 28, 2018, the State of Peru classified Enagás Internacional on the \"List of Contracts and Subjects of Category 2 indicating the legal person or legal entity included under Section II of Law No. 30737\" in relation to the concession contract awarded to GSP. The application of the mentioned standard involves different measures to contribute to the payment of potential civil compensation, such as setting up an escrow account, reporting information, limiting transfers to other countries or preparing a compliance programme.\n\nThe total amount of the escrow account that would correspond to Enagás, estimated as 50% of the entire average equity that corresponds to its participation in GSP confirmed with the Ministry of Justice, amounts to 65.5 million dollars, Enagás having delivered a bank guarantee letter for this amount in August 2023 [\\(Note 1.9\\)](#page-25-0).\n\nIn addition, the Peruvian State has also affirmed that the measure prohibiting companies included in Category 2 from making transfers outside of Peru, pursuant to Law No. 30737, is applicable. Based on the conclusions of Enagás' external and internal legal advisors, it is maintained that this measure would be applicable to the investment in GSP and should not restrict the dividends received from TGP (amounting to 461.2 million dollars), also considering that this investment is protected by the Legal Stability Agreements in force in Peru, a regulation whose prevalence and application has been formally requested to the Peruvian state.\n\nIn order to put into practice the application of these Legal Stability Agreements, direct negotiations with the Peruvian State were initiated on February 24, 2021, followed by the submission by Enagás of a request for international arbitration under the Spanish-Peruvian APPRI on December 23, 2021. In addition, Enagás Internacional has pledged its TGP shares in favour of Enagás Financiaciones, S.A.U. and Enagás, S.A. to guarantee the payment of its present or future obligations and debts.\n\nWith respect to this ICSID arbitration procedure, the Arbitration Court was constituted on December 5, 2022, and Legal Resolution No. 1 was issued on January 26, 2023, establishing the procedural rules that govern the arbitration procedure until the award is handed down. On June 1, 2023, Enagás' statement of claim was filed with ICSID, followed by the statement of defence filed by the Peruvian State on October 6, 2023.\n\nIn view of the above, it is still maintained that these regulations do not have a negative effect on the recovery of accounts receivable through the international arbitration process indicated above recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2023.\n\nBased on all of the above, the directors of Enagás, in line with the opinion of their external and internal legal advisors, and of an independent expert and independent expert accountant, consider these facts to have no bearing on the estimation for recovery of the investment in the stake in GSP and the previously mentioned receivables to the amount of 456,779 thousands of euros (473,999 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n#### **Impairment losses on assets**\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the impact resulting from analysis of the expected loss in accordance with IFRS 9 for the financial assets of the Enagás Group described in this section amounts to 308 thousands of euros (433 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\n[model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/266/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image.

liabilities are initially measured at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.**\n- **• Subsequently, financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, except for derivative financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value.**\n- **• Financial liabilities are derecognised when the related contractual obligations are cancelled or expired. The Group also derecognises financial liabilities when there is a material change in cash flows or debt terms and conditions.**\n- **• Options on minority interests, when the agreement does not transfer the risks and rewards to the holder of the shares, result in the recognition of a financial liability. The changes in fair value of the financial liability are accounted for in the Consolidated Income Statement**\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-269-0\"></span>[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/269/Picture/5 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color.

All derivative financial instruments are measured, both initially and subsequently, at fair value. The differences in fair value are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except in the case of specific treatment under hedge accounting.**\n- **• The measurement and recognition criteria for derivative financial instruments in keeping with the different types of hedge accounting are as follows:**\n\t- **Cash flow hedges**\n\n**Hedges for exposure to changes in cash flows that: (i) are attributed to a specific risk associated with an asset or liability recognised for accounting purposes, with a highly likely expected transaction or with a firm commitment if the hedged risk is an exchange rate and (ii) may affect profit for the period. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised under Equity, and the gains and losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The accumulated amounts under Equity are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods in which the hedged items affect the Consolidated Income Statement.**\n\n◦ **Net investment hedging in a foreign operation**\n\n**These instruments hedge the foreign currency risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.**\n\n**The hedges for net investments in transactions carried out abroad are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges, though the valuation changes in these transactions are accounted for as translation differences under [\"Adjustments for changes in value\"](#page-221-0) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.**\n\n**These translation differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement when the gain or loss on disposal of the hedged item occurs.**\n\n**• In order for these derivative financial instruments to be classified as hedges they are initially designated as such, and the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged items is documented, together with the risk management objective and the hedge strategy for the various hedged transactions. In addition, the Group verifies initially and then periodically throughout the life of the hedge (and at least at the end of each reporting period) that the hedging relationship is effective, i.e., that it is prospectively foreseeable that the changes in fair value or in the cash flows from the hedged item (attributable to hedged risk) are almost entirely offset by those of hedging instrument.**\n\n**Any remaining loss or gain from the hedging instrument will represent an ineffectiveness of the hedge to be recognised in income of the period.**\n\n- **• Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or when it is sold, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting (after taking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable). At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in Equity will be transferred to the income statement to the extent that the expected future cash flows covered will affect profit or loss for the year.**\n- **• In accordance with IFRS 13, for purposes of presenting financial information, the measurements of fair value are classified as Level 1, 2, or 3, as indicated in [Note 3.3.](#page-261-0)**\n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/273/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image.

As required by IFRS 9, an eligible hedged item and hedging instrument have to be designated. By this means, the exchange fluctuations of the investment in foreign currency are associated with the fluctuations due to the debt obtained to finance the acquisition, which is also in that currency (Note 3.7), in such a way that there is no impact on the income statement.\n\nWith respect to net investment hedging in foreign operations, the breakdown by period in which the related cash flows will arise is as follows:\n\n| 2023        | 2024    | 2025    | 2026    | 2027    | 2028                 | Total    |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------------------|----------|\n| Derivatives | (4,518) | (4,164) | (3,969) | (3,787) | 6,355                | (10,083) |\n| 2022        | 2023    | 2024    | 2025    | 2026    | 2027 and later years | Total    |\n| Derivatives | (4,790) | (4,396) | (4,198) | (4,026) | (6,262)              | (23,672) |\n\n## 3.7 Financial and capital risk management\n\nThe Enagás Group is exposed to various risks intrinsic to the sector, the market in which it operates and the activities it performs, which, should they materialise, could prevent it from achieving its objectives and executing its strategies successfully.\n\nThe Company has established a risk control and management model based on the principle of due control, aimed at ensuring the achievement of its objectives in line with the Company's risk tolerance level and the risk appetite approved by the governing bodies, and with a risk profile periodically assessed for all its risks. The particularities of the model are set out in section IV. Risk management of the Company's Management Report.\n\nThe main risks of a financial and tax nature to which the Group is exposed are as follows:\n\n#### **Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk relates to the possible losses arising from the nonpayment of monetary or quantifiable obligations of a counterparty to which the Enagás Group has granted net credit which is pending settlement or collection.\n\nCredit risk in connection with trade receivables arising from its commercial activity is historically very limited as the Group operates in a regulated environment [\\(Note 1.1](#page-227-0)). However, regulations have been developed establishing standards for managing guarantees in the Spanish gas system and which oblige shippers to provide guarantees for: (i) contracting capacity in infrastructure with regulated third-party access and international connections, (ii) settlement of imbalances; and (iii) participation in the organised gas market.\n\nThe Enagás Group is also exposed to the risk of its counterparties not complying with obligations in connection with financial derivatives and placement of surplus cash balances. In order to mitigate this risk, these transactions are carried out in a diversified manner with highly solvent entities.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nInterest rate fluctuations affect the fair value of those assets and liabilities that accrue interest at fixed rates, and the future cash flows from assets and liabilities that accrue interest at floating rates.\n\nThe objective of interest rate risk management is to create a balanced debt structure that minimises financial costs over a multiyear period while also reducing volatility in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nBased on the Enagás Group's estimates and debt structure targets, hedges are put in place using derivatives that reduce these risks ([Note 3.6\\)](#page-118-0).\n\n#### **Exchange rate risk**\n\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect positions held with regard to debt denominated in foreign currency, certain payments for services and the purchase of capital goods in foreign currency, income and expenses relating to companies whose functional currency is not the euro and the effect of converting the financial statements of those companies whose currency is not the euro during the consolidation process. With a view to mitigating said risk, the Group can avail itself of financing obtained in US dollars, as well as contracting derivative financial instruments which are subsequently designated as hedging instruments ([Note 3.6\\)](#page-118-0). In addition, the Enagás Group tries to balance the cash flows of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency in each of its companies.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\nImage /page/275/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

For this purpose, different management measures are taken such as maintenance of credit facilities ensuring flexibility, sufficient amounts and sufficient maturities, diversified sourcing for financing needs via access to different markets and geographical areas, as well as the diversification of maturities in debt issued.\n\nThe financial debt of the Group at December 31, 2023 has an average maturity of 3.9 years (4.4 years at December 31, 2023) ([Note 3.4\\)](#page-268-0).\n\n#### **Tax risk**\n\nThe Enagás Group is exposed to possible modifications in tax regulatory frameworks and uncertainty relating to different possible interpretations of prevailing tax legislation, potentially leading to negative effects on results.\n\nThe Enagás Group has a Board-approved tax strategy, which includes the policies governing compliance with its tax obligations, attempting to avoid risks and tax inefficiencies\n\n#### **Other risks**\n\nThe Enagás Group is exposed to cross-cutting risks that do not correspond to a single risk category but may be correlated with several of them, namely risks related to the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, social and governance (ESG).\n\nIn the context of ESG risks, Enagás is exposed to certain risks arising from climate change. These risks are managed and assessed in an integrated manner within the risk management model described in the Management Report. Risks are identified and quantified which arise from factors such as political and regulatory measures to promote the use of renewable energy, natural disasters or adverse weather conditions, the volume of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, the use and technological development of renewable gases, and reputational risks (for more details on climate change risks, see chapter '[Climate](#page-53-0)  [Action and Energy Efficiency](#page-53-0)' of the [Management Report](#page-2-0)).\n\nThe impact of climate-related risks and how management assesses these risks to incorporate them into the judgements, estimates and uncertaintie[s](#page-290-0) that affect the consolidated financial statements are described in [Note 4.6.a.](#page-290-0)\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of the business and its risks, and despite having a reputational risk control and management system that responds to the best international recommendations and practices, it is not possible to guarantee that some risk may exist that is not identified in the risk inventory of the Enagás Group.\n\nIn addition, the internationalisation process carried out by the Enagás Group in recent years means that a part of its operations are carried out by companies over which it does not exercise control and which perform their activities within different regulatory frameworks and with different business dynamics, so that potential risks may arise relating to financial investment.\n\nAlso, there are uncertainties related to the deployment of renewable gases and the company's future role in the energy sector.\n\n#### a) Quantitative information\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nThe percentage of debt at fixed interest rates at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, amounted to more than 80%. Taking into account these percentages of financial debt at fixed rates, and after performing a sensitivity analysis to changes in market interest rates, the Group considers that, according to its estimates, the impact on results of such variations on financial costs relating to variable rate debt could be as follows:\n\n|                              | Interest rate change |         |        |         |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|---------|--------|---------|\n|                              | 2023                 |         | 2022   |         |\n|                              | 25 bps               | -10 bps | 25 bps | -10 bps |\n| Change in<br>financial costs | 206                  | (82)    | 591    | (236)   |\n\nIn addition, the aforementioned changes would not produce any significant changes in the Company's equity position in connection with contracted derivatives.\n\n#### **Exchange rate risk**\n\nThe currency that generates the greatest exposure to exchange rate changes within the Enagás Group is the US dollar.\n\nThe exposure of the Group to changes in the US dollar/euro exchange rate is mainly determined by the effect of translating the financial statements of the companies whose functional currency is the US dollar. In addition, there are Group companies whose functional currency is the Peruvian nuevo sol and pound sterling, although their effect is not significant.\n\nThe sensitivity of profit/(loss) for the year and equity to exchange rate risk, via appreciation or depreciation of exchange rates and based on said equity held by the Enagás Group at December 31, 2023, is shown below:\n\n|                      | Thousands of euros<br>Appreciation/(Depreciation) of the euro<br>against the dollar |         |        |          |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|----------|\n|                      |                                                                                     |         |        |          |\n|                      | 2023                                                                                | 2022    |        |          |\n|                      | 5,00%                                                                               | -5,00%  | 5,00%  | -5,00%   |\n| Effect on net profit | 4,073                                                                               | (4,073) | 3,028  | (3,028)  |\n| Effect on equity     | 5,552                                                                               | (5,552) | 11,422 | (11,422) |\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/276/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The ratio is defined as the result of dividing consolidated net financial debt by net consolidated assets (understood as the sum of net financial debt and consolidated own funds).\n\nThe Group's financial leverage, calculated as the ratio of net financial debt and total financial net debt plus own funds at December 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows:\n\n|                               | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net financial debt (Note 3.4) | 2,725,082 | 3,468,905 |\n| Shareholders' equity          | 2,968,155 | 3,076,477 |\n| Financial leverage            | 47.9%     | 53.0%     |\n\nOn December 15, 2023, the credit rating agency Fitch Ratings maintained Enagás' outlook at stable, and placed Enagás' rating at BBB. On December 4, 2023, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Enagás' credit rating at BBB, with a stable outlook.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-277-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/277/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" and the logo for ENA.\n\n## 3.8 Cash flows\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n**• Under the Cash and other cash equivalents heading of the Consolidated Balance Sheet the Group recognises cash in hand, sight deposits, and other highly liquid short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.**\n\n#### a) Cash and cash equivalents\n\n|                                    | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n|------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Treasury                           | 366,757    | 562,474    |\n| Other cash and cash<br>equivalents | 471,726    | 796,810    |\n| Total                              | 838,483    | 1,359,284  |\n\nDeposits that are readily convertible into cash are recorded under the heading \"Other liquid assets\".\n\nGenerally, the banked cash accrues interest at rates similar to daily market rates. The deposits maturing in the short-term are easily convertible into cash, and accrue interest at the going market rates. There are no signi[fi](#page-262-0)cant restrictions on cash drawdown other than those indicated in [Note 3.3.a](#page-262-0) in relation to the GSP project in Peru.\n\n### b) Available funds\n\nIn order to guarantee liquidity, the Enagás Group has arranged credit lines which it has not drawn down. Thus, liquidity available to the Enagás Group is broken down as follows:\n\n| Available funds                  | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 838,483    | 1,359,284  |\n| Other available funds (Note 3.4) | 2,470,521  | 2,434,489  |\n| Total available funds            | 3,309,004  | 3,793,773  |\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors of the Parent Company, this situation allows for sufficient funding to meet possible liquidity requirements in the short-term considering its current obligations.\n\n#### c) Reconciliation of movements in liabilities arising from financing activities and cash flows\n\n|                                    |                                            | Debts with credit<br>institutions | Debentures and<br>marketable securities | Total     |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|\n| 12.31.2022                         |                                            | 1,690,600                         | 2,736,574                               | 4,427,174 |\n| Cash flows                         | Issuance and collection                    | 74,756                            | —                                       | 74,756    |\n|                                    | Repayment and<br>redemption                | (275,725)                         | (400,000)                               | (675,725) |\n|                                    | Payment of interest                        | (74,312)                          | (27,437)                                | (101,749) |\n| Without an impact on<br>cash flows | Interest expense                           | 70,448                            | 36,251                                  | 106,699   |\n|                                    | Changes due to exchange<br>rates and other | (24,993)                          | (1)                                     | (24,994)  |\n| 12.31.2023                         |                                            | 1,460,774                         | 2,345,387                               | 3,806,161 |\n\nThe information for the 2022 financial year is detailed below:\n\n|                                    |                                            | Debts with credit<br>institutions | Debentures and<br>marketable securities | Total       |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|\n| 12.31.2021                         |                                            | 1,777,900                         | 3,481,812                               | 5,259,712   |\n| Cash flows                         | Issuance and collection                    | 953,980                           | 1,294,000                               | 2,247,980   |\n|                                    | Repayment and<br>redemption                | (1,235,479)                       | (2,044,000)                             | (3,279,479) |\n|                                    | Payment of interest                        | (25,023)                          | (45,900)                                | (70,923)    |\n| Without an impact on<br>cash flows | Interest expense                           | 34,422                            | 50,695                                  | 85,117      |\n|                                    | Changes due to exchange<br>rates and other | 184,800                           | (33)                                    | 184,767     |\n| 12.31.2022                         |                                            | 1,690,600                         | 2,736,574                               | 4,427,174   |\n\n{278}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-278-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n# 4.

These include the temporary differences, identified as those amounts expected to be payable or recoverable, arising from the difference between the book value of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as any unused tax credits. These amounts are measured by applying the tax rate to the corresponding temporary differences or tax credits at which they are expected to be recovered or settled.**\n- **• Deferred tax assets are only recognised when the Group expects sufficient future taxable profits to recover the deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for those arising from the initial recognition of goodwill.**\n- **• Recognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and the appropriate adjustments are made when there are doubts as to their future recoverability.**\n- **• The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities corresponding to one and the same tax authority, as established in IAS 12.74.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• In accordance with prevailing legislation in Spain, tax returns cannot be considered final until they have been inspected by the tax authorities or until the four-year inspection period has elapsed. However, the four-year period can vary in the case of Group companies subject to other fiscal regulations. The Directors consider that the income tax returns for the aforementioned taxes have been filed correctly and, therefore, even in the event of discrepancies in the interpretation of prevailing tax legislation with respect to the treatment applied, the resulting potential tax liabilities, if any, would not have a material impact on these Consolidated Annual Accounts.**\n- **• The deferred tax assets were recognised in the balance sheet as the Directors believe, based on the best estimate of future profits and reversals of deductible temporary differences, that it is probable that these assets will be recovered.**\n\n#### a) Balances with Tax Authorities\n\n|                                                         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Debit balances                                          |         |         |\n| Deferred tax assets (Note 4.2.f)                        | 79,019  | 72,969  |\n| Income tax and other taxes (1)                          | 10,623  | 453     |\n| Value added tax                                         | 21,928  | 24,238  |\n| Total current assets                                    | 32,551  | 24,691  |\n| Credit balances                                         |         |         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities (Note 4.2.f)                   | 208,809 | 221,720 |\n| Income tax (2)                                          | 5,652   | 70,204  |\n| Value added tax                                         | 919     | 670     |\n| Tax Authorities creditor for withholdings and other (2) | 38,203  | 79,824  |\n| Total current liabilities                               | 44,774  | 150,698 |\n\n(1) Corresponds mainly to the Corporate Income Tax of the 2023 Tax Group, amounting to 10,623 thousands of euros of balances receivable (453 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n(2) The variation is mainly due to the capital gains tax and the retention pending payment and derived from the divestment process in Chile following the sale of GNL Quintero, S.A. in 2022, disbursed in 2023.\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-280-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/280/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green, next to the Enagas logo.\n\nb) Tax returns\n\nEnagás S.A. has been the parent company of the Tax Consolidation Group 493/12 for Corporate Income tax from January 1, 2013, comprising the following subsidiaries at December 31, 2023:\n\n- Enagás Transporte, S.A.U.\n- Enagás GTS, S.A.U.\n- Enagás Internacional, S.L.U.\n- Enagás Financiaciones, S.A.U.\n- Enagás Emprende S.L.U.\n- Infraestructuras del Gas, S.A.\n- Scale Gas Solutions, S.L.\n- Efficiency for LNG Applications, S.L.\n- Enagás Services Solutions, S.L.\n- Sercomgas Gas Solutions, S.L.\n- Enagás Holding USA.

However, the four-year period can vary in the case of Group companies subject to other fiscal regulations.\n\nDuring financial year 2021, Enagás S.A. and Enagás Transporte S.A.U. were notified that the Central Economic Administrative Court (hereinafter TEAC) had rejected the claims filed in relation to the assessments signed challenging the Corporate Income Tax for the years 2012 to 2015. During 2022, an appeal against the decisions of the Central Economic Administrative Tribunal (TEAC) was filed with the National Court of Appeal, which has not yet been decided at the time of preparing these consolidated annual accounts.\n\n In the event that this appeal were ultimately contrary to the interests of the Group, it would result in a disbursement of approximately 11.7 million euros (not including any late payment interest that may be applicable), giving rise to the recognition of a deferred tax asset of 7.5 million euros and a negative effect on net profit /(loss) of approximately 4.2 million euros. In accordance with what is mentioned in [Note 2.9](#page-255-0), during the 2023 financial year part of the provision for this concept amounting to 5.7 million euros has been made, which includes both fees and interest on late payment.\n\nThe appeal is expected to be resolved in more than one year.\n\nLikewise, at 2023 year-end, the years 2020 to 2023 are pending audit for the taxes applicable to the company, with the exemption of Corporate Income Tax, which is pending audit for the years 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe Directors consider that all taxes mentioned have been duly paid so that even in the event of discrepancies in the interpretation of prevailing tax legislation with respect to the treatment applied to transactions, the resulting potential tax liabilities, if any, would not have a material impact on the accompanying Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\nImage /page/281/Picture/11 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

This expense is recognised over the stipulated period during which employee services are rendered with a credit to \"Other equity instruments\" in the accompanying balance sheet.**\n- **In cash: personnel expenses are determined based on the fair value of the liability at the date recognition requirements are met. Personnel expenses are recognised over the stipulated period during which services are rendered in the stipulated period (Note 2.9) and are entered in \"Long-term provisions\" in the accompanying Balance Sheet, until it is estimated that they will be settled within less than one year, at which time the associated provision is reclassified to the Personnel line under \"Trade and other payables\" on the liability side of the accompanying Balance Sheet. The liability is subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date, up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement.**\n- **The Enagás Group used the Monte Carlo model to evaluate this programme. The fair value of the equity instruments at the granting date is adjusted to include the market conditions relating to this plan. Likewise, the Company takes into account the fact that the dividends accrued during the plan period are not paid to the beneficiaries as they do not become shareholders of the Parent Company until the plan has effectively been settled.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• The Enagás Group estimates fair value of the equity instruments granted on an accrual basis over the corresponding plan period, plus the deferral and loyalty periods of approximately four months for full disbursement. In the 2022 financial year, both the 2019-2021 ILP Plan and the 2022-2024 ILP Plan are considered. 2024.**\n- **• As for that part of the plans payable in shares, the Enagás Group estimates the fair value of the amount payable in cash on an accrual basis over the plan period (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 for the 2019-2021 ILP and January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024 for the 2022-2024 ILP), plus the deferral and loyalty periods of approximately four months for full disbursement.**\n- **• On September 29, 2022, the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) approved its supervisory report on the application of the measures to separate the activities of Enagás GTS, S.A.U., with the following requirements:** \n\t- **The multi-year variable remuneration that may be assigned to Enagás GTS managers must be independent of parameters associated with transmission and other incompatible activities.**\n\t- **The Executive Director of Enagás GTS and other persons responsible for the management of this company who are beneficiaries of long-term variable remuneration shall not receive shares in the share capital of Enagás as payment for such remuneration.**\n- **• In view of the above, it has been necessary to align the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan with the requirements of the CNMC, developing two Plans and their respective Regulations, one for the Enagás Group (with the exception of Enagás GTS, S.A.U. senior managers), and another specific Regulation for Enagás GTS so that senior managers belonging to Enagás GTS will receive their variable remuneration in cash instead of receiving it in Enagás S.A. shares**\n\n| Remuneration received | Salaries | Per diems | Other items | Pension plans | Insurance<br>premiums | Termination<br>benefits |\n|-----------------------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2023                  |          |           |             |               |                       |                         |\n| Board of Directors    | 2,533    | 2,400     | 89          | —             | 73                    | —                       |\n| Senior Management     | 4,330    | —         | 256         | 63            | 74                    | —                       |\n| Total                 | 6,863    | 2,400     | 345         | 63            | 147                   | —                       |\n| 2022                  |          |           |             |               |                       |                         |\n| Board of Directors    | 2,645    | 2,382     | 92          | —             | 44                    | 1,630                   |\n| Senior Management     | 4,412    | —         | 181         | 82            | 37                    | 2,454                   |\n| Total                 | 7,057    | 2,382     | 273         | 82            | 81                    | 4,084                   |\n\n{286}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/286/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is the ENA logo, which consists of the letters \"ena\" in blue font, with a green and blue circle around the letters.\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors for their Board membership and those corresponding to the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer for the exercise of their executive and non-executive functions, respectively, during 2023 were approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024\", having been modified by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022, as Item 8 of the Agenda.\n\nThe Chairman, Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá, was beneficiary of the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on March 29, 2019 as Item 8 of the Agenda. During the 2022 and 2023 financial years, the aforementioned incentive has been settled and a total of 25,061 gross shares have been awarded in 2022 and 27,398 gross shares in 2023, which will not be available until April 2024.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. Item 9 of its Agenda assigned him a total of 96,970 rights relating to shares. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Management Committee) were equally beneficiaries of the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan. In the terms approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, in the settlement of this incentive in the 2023 financial year, 29,239 gross shares and a cash incentive amount of 205 thousands of euros corresponded to them.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Executive Committee) are equally beneficiaries of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan. As approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, the Board has assigned them a total of 145,764 rights relating to shares as well as an incentive in cash amounting to approximately 1,000 thousands of euros. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nThe Group has outsourced its pension commitments with respect to its Senior Managers through a mixed group insurance policy for pension commitments, including benefits in the event of survival, death, and employment disability. The Chairman was part of the group covered by this policy and of the total premium paid for this during 2022, 62 thousands of euros corresponded to him. The Chief Executive Officer does not have a pension commitment instrument, as he does not have an employment relationship with the company, but rather a commercial relationship. The Chief Executive Officer maintains an assimilated individual savings insurance at a cost of 222 thousands of euros.\n\nThe members of the Senior Management also form part of the group insured under the mixed group insurance policy for pension commitments. The total premium paid for the same during the financial year amounts to 698 thousands of euros.\n\nThe aforementioned remuneration, broken down for each member of the Board of Directors, without taking into account insurance premiums, is as follows:\n\n{287}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  **[2023](#page-1-0)** [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n|                                                                             | 2023  | 202   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá (Executive Chairman) (1)                       | 730   | 1,594 |\n| Mr Arturo Gonzalo Aizpiri (Chief Executive Officer) (2) (4)                 | 2,152 | 96    |\n| Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (Proprietary Director) (3) | 160   | 160   |\n| Mr José Blanco López (Independent Director) (3)                             | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms Ana Palacio Vallelersundi (Independent Leading Director) (3)             | 190   | 190   |\n| Mr José Montilla Aguilera (Independent Director) (3)                        | 175   | 175   |\n| Mr Cristóbal José Gallego Castillo (Independent Director) (3)               | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms Eva Patricia Úrbez Sanz (Independent Director) (3)                       | 160   | 160   |\n| Mr Santiago Ferrer Costa (Proprietary Director) (3)                         | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms Natalia Fabra Portela (Independent Director) (3)                         | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms María Teresa Arcos Sánchez (Independent Director) (3)                    | 175   | 175   |\n| Mr David Sandalow (Independent Director) (3) (4)                            | 160   | 114   |\n| Ms Clara García Fernández-Muro (Independent Director) (3) (4)               | 160   | 113   |\n| Ms María Teresa Costa Campi (Independent Director) (3) (4)                  | 160   | 114   |\n| Mr Manuel Gabriel González Ramos (Independent Director) (3) (4)             | 160   | 113   |\n| Mr Ignacio Grangel Vicente (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | —     | 44    |\n| Mr Gonzalo Solana González (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | —     | 44    |\n| Mr Antonio Hernández Mancha (Independent Director) (3) (4)                  | —     | 44    |\n| Ms Isabel Tocino Biscarolasaga (Independent Director) (3) (4)               | —     | 44    |\n| Mr Marcelino Oreja Arburúa (former Chief Executive Officer) (3) (4)         | —     | 43    |\n| Total                                                                       | 5,022 | 5,119 |\n\n(1) The remuneration of the Executive Chairman for the exercise of his executive duties during 2022 was that approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years\" as approved as Item 10 of the Agenda as amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022 under Item 8 of the Agenda to cover his remuneration as non-executive Chairman as from that date.

In this regard, and as previously reported, the aforementioned programme has been 50% settled during the first half of 2023.\n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Enagás, S.A. General Shareholders' Meeting approved the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan (ILP) aimed at the Executive Director, the members of the Executive Committee and the senior management of the Parent Company and its Group. The objective of the Plan is to (i) encourage the sustainable\n\nachievement of the objectives of the Company's Strategic Plan, (ii) give the opportunity to share the creation of value with participants, (iii) foster a sense of belonging to the Company and shared destiny, (iv) be competitive, and (v) align with the requirements of institutional investors, proxy advisors, and best Good Corporate Governance practices and, especially, those resulting from the recommendations of the CNMV's new Good Governance Code.\n\nThe plan consists of an extraordinary mixed multi-year incentive which will permit the beneficiaries to receive, after a certain period of time, a bonus payable in (i) Enagás, S.A. shares and (ii) cash; provided that certain strategic objectives of the Enagás Group are met.\n\n{288}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/288/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color. To the right of the text is a logo with the letter \"e\" inside a circle.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) approved its supervisory report on the application of the measures to separate the activities of Enagás GTS, S.A.U., with the following requirements:\n\n- The multi-year variable remuneration that may be assigned to Enagás GTS managers must be independent of parameters associated with transmission and other incompatible activities.\n- The Executive Director of Enagás GTS and other persons responsible for the management of this company who are beneficiaries of long-term variable remuneration shall not receive shares in the share capital of Enagás as payment for such remuneration.\n\nIn view of the above, it has been necessary to align the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan with the requirements of the CNMC, developing two Incentive Plans and their respective Regulations, one for the Enagás Group (with the exception of Enagás GTS, S.A.U. senior managers), and another specific Regulation for Enagás GTS so that senior managers belonging to Enagás GTS will receive their variable remuneration in cash instead of receiving it in Enagás S.A. shares.\n\nWith respect to the portion payable in shares, a maximum of 679,907 shares are deliverable, all of which will come from the Company's treasury shares. Furthermore, the beneficiaries of the plan are not guaranteed any minimum value for the assigned shares. The cash part of the Plan is limited to an estimated payment of approximately 3.3 million euros should all the objectives be fully met.\n\nThis plan is aimed at persons who, due to their level of responsibility on their position in the Enagás Group, contribute decisively to achieving the Company's objectives. The Plan initially designated 53 beneficiaries, notwithstanding the possibility that new recruitments due to mobility or professional level changes may include new beneficiaries during the measurement period.\n\nThe objectives determined to evaluate the achievement of the Enagás S.A. Long-Term Incentive Plan are as follows:\n\n- Accumulated results corresponding to the Funds for Operations (\"FFO\") of the Enagás Group. This metric shows the financial soundness and net profit growth, which are the cornerstones of the Strategic Plan. This takes into account both the EBITDA of the regulated business and the dividends received from the subsidiaries that are not controlled by Enagás. It is a benchmark indicator for investors. Fulfilling this objective will satisfy the Company forecasts for the distribution of Group, investment and debt amortisation dividends. It accounts for 20% of the total targets.\n- Accumulated cash flows received from international affiliates and other businesses (\"Dividend\"). This shows the focus on international growth and a realistic and profitable investment plan as the cornerstones of the Strategic Plan. It measures the profitability of the international business compared with the annual remuneration objective which measures the year's international investment volume. It accounts for 20% of the total targets.\n- Total shareholder return (\"TSR\"). To ensure appropriate, competitive shareholder remuneration. It takes into account share performance and the dividend policy. This objective comprises\n\ntwo components, each with a relative importance of 12.5% of the total objectives:\n\n- a) Absolute TSR: this is measured as the acquisition of a target share price in 2024. The target price has been established by investing estimated share dividends and is based on profitability and market parameters.\n- b) Relative TSR: this is measured with respect to the Peer Group of fifteen companies.\n- **• The Company's commitment to long-term sustainable value creation (\"Sustainability\").** The target will have five indicators:\n\t- **Decarbonisation:** Reduction of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions in line with the decarbonisation pathway (emissions 2024 vs. emissions 2021). It accounts for 6% of the total targets.\n\t- **Investment in renewable gases:** 2022-2024 investment associated with the adaptation of infrastructure for the transmission of renewable gases and the development of infrastructure dedicated to the transmission and storage of renewable gases. It accounts for 6% of the total targets.\n- **Diversity and inclusion:** Percentage of female members on the Board of Directors. It accounts for 2% of the total targets. .\n- **Percentage of women in managerial and pre-managerial positions.** It accounts for 3% of the total targets.\n- **Percentage of promotions that are women in managerial and pre-managerial positions.** It accounts for 3% of the total targets.\n- **• Digitalisation of the company.** The target will consist of 2 indicators:\n\t- Implementation of the Digital Transformation Strategy and improvement of the associated indicators.\n\t- Strengthening the positioning of Enagás' digital assets in the company's strategic areas.\n\nIt accounts for 15% of the total targets (7.5% for each indicator respectively).\n\nRegarding the measurement period, although it will occur during the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024, its settlement will take place on the following dates:\n\n- a. The beneficiary will receive 50% of the incentive within thirty (30) days following approval of the 2024 Annual Accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting. This 50% will apply to the assets part of the incentive as well as the cash part of the incentive;\n- b. The beneficiary will receive the remaining 50% of the incentive once a period of one year has elapsed from the first payment date.\n\n{289}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-289-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/289/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

ILP Regulation establishes the obligation for the beneficiaries to continue to provide their services to the Enagás Group until the first payment date in order to receive 50% of the incentive, and until the second payment date in order to receive the remaining 50%, the Enagás Group accrues the estimated fair value of the equity instruments granted taking account both of the target measurement period (January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024) and the service conditions established for the period required to consolidate the remuneration.\n\nThe portion of said plan to be settled in Enagás, S.A. shares is considered a share-based transaction payable in equity instruments in accordance with IFRS 2 and, in keeping with said standard, the fair value of services received, as consideration for the equity instruments granted, is included in the Consolidated Income Statement at December 31, 2023, under \"[Personnel expenses\"](#page-221-0) in the amount of 1,439 thousands of euros and a credit to [\"Other equity instruments\"](#page-221-0) in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 (1,279 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe breakdown and fair value of the shares at the granting date of the ILP of the Enagás Group are as follows:\n\n|                                                                    | ILP<br>2022-2024 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Total shares at the concession date (1)                            | 679,907          |\n| Fair value of the equity instruments at the granting<br>date (EUR) | 20.15            |\n| Dividend yield                                                     | 7.94 %           |\n| Expected volatility                                                | 26.15 %          |\n| Discount rate                                                      | 0.48 %           |\n\n(1) This number of shares reflects the maximum number of shares to be delivered under the plan, and includes both the possibility of achieving the maximum degree of fulfilment of objectives established in the plan (125%), as well as the possibility that new hiring, staff mobility, or changes in professional levels, lead to the inclusion of new beneficiaries during the measurement period.\n\nWith respect to that part of the bonus payable in cash, the Enagás Group recognised the rendering of services corresponding to this plan as personnel expenses amounting to 635 thousands of euros with a credit to \"Provisions\" under non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 (573 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022). As in the case of the share-based payment plan component, the Enagás Group accrues the estimated fair value of the cash-settled amount over the term of the plan (from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024) and the service conditions established for the period of time required for the consolidation of the remuneration.\n\nThe objectives set to assess the achievement of the Enagás GTS, S.A.U. Long-Term Incentive Plan are as follows:\n\n- **• The Company's commitment to long-term sustainable value creation**. It accounts for 25% of the total targets.\n- **• Digitisation of the Company**. It accounts for 30% of the total targets.\n- **• Improvement of the GTS income statement**. It accounts for 25% of the total targets.\n- **• Security of supply**.

In order to achieve this, the decarbonisation of the sector and the promotion of the use of hydrogen as a key vector in the transition was established as a priority within its Strategic Plan. Enagás is working to boost domestic production of renewable hydrogen in Spain as well as in the development of new hydrogen connections with France and Portugal.\n\nFor the preparation of these Consolidated Annual Accounts and the disclosures of the Management Report, Management has considered both the impact of these initiatives and the main risks arising from climate change. These risks include regulatory measures to discourage the use of fossil fuels that reduce future gas demand and the risk of increased operating costs due to natural disasters. More detail on Climate Risks and Opportunities is provided in the section \"Management of risks and opportunities arising from climate change\" contained in the Non-Financial Information Statement.\n\nThe main aspects that the Group has considered in incorporating the measures and risks mentioned above are described below:\n\n• Impairment of non-financial assets: In the short and medium term (horizon up to 2030) a limited impact is estimated. Revenues for regasification, storage and transportation assets in Spain are calculated on the basis of a regulated remuneration system, which is made up of different terms aimed at remunerating the investment for the indicated useful lives, operating and maintenance costs, and other items associated with improving productivity and efficiency. As of today, the flows considered for the impairment test are calculated on the basis of this stable regulatory framework and are not affected by demand risk.\n\nFlows arising from future European hydrogen projects for the development and use of new infrastructures, such as H2Med, as well as the eventual adaptation of existing infrastructures, will be taken into account from the definition and approval of the regulatory framework for investment and remuneration, including, if applicable, the utilisation factor to be applied to existing infrastructures. The Group is monitoring the regulatory developments being undertaken at European level in this respect.\n\n• Property, plant and equipment: With regard to possible investments from the new connections, it should be noted that the process is currently still at an initial stage, in which the first pillars of the future Hydrogen Backbone Network are being analysed and planned and, based on the studies on the supply and demand of green hydrogen, it is being determined which plants can be reused or need to be built from scratch. At present, it has not been considered necessary to re-estimate the useful life of gas infrastructures as long as the same current regulatory and remuneration framework continues to apply, in which revenues from regasification, storage and transport activities guarantee the remuneration of the investment. In addition, the progressive plan to replace natural gas turbocompressors (the acquisition cost\n\nranges from 10 to 20 million euros per turbocompressors depending on the power) is being continued.\n\n- Provisions and contingencies: Physical risks caused by natural disasters or adverse weather conditions (floods, landslides, etc.) may cause damage to our infrastructures in Spain and in other countries in which Enagás participates. The need for additional provisions for these items or regulatory changes associated with the remuneration of decommissioning costs is reviewed at regular intervals in order to monitor possible changes in the assumptions used.\n- Impairment of investments accounted for using the equity method. No significant impacts have been identified in the calculation of the recoverable value associated with the risk of a possible fall in demand for natural gas. As far as non-financial assets are concerned, revenue projections for each of the investments have been taken into account for their infrastructure, most of which correspond to long-term stable contracts with offtakers, concessions, regulated revenues, etc.\n\nIn addition, other measures related to the energy transition that continue this year are: the inclusion of sustainability as a target in the variable remuneration of all the Group's professionals, the weight of which has increased in recent years; the Enagás Group incorporates environmental criteria in its relationships with suppliers and contractors, as well as in decision-making when awarding contracts for the provision of services and products. As indicated in Note 3.4, the Group has entered into a sustainable credit line with an interest rate linked to the reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\nDuring 2023, environmental actions were carried out in the amount of 6,752 thousands of euros, recognised as investments under assets in the Balance Sheet (8,012 thousands of euros in 2022). The Company also assumed environmental expenses amounting to 26,686 thousands of euros in 2023, recognised under \"Other operating expenses\" (20,459 thousands of euros in 2022).\n\nThe Group has arranged sufficient civil liability insurance to meet any possible contingencies, compensation and other risks of an environmental nature which it might incur.\n\nThe Group did not benefit from any tax incentives during 2023 as a consequence of activities relating to the environment.\n\n#### b) Greenhouse gas emission rights\n\nSome of the Enagás Group's facilities are included within the scope of Law 1/2005 of March 9, which regulates the commercial regime for greenhouse gas emission rights.\n\n{292}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/292/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image.

The calculation of the allocations subject to public consultation has been carried out by applying the allocation methodology set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331.\n\nOn July 13, 2021, the Council of Ministers approved the final assignation of free greenhouse gas emission rights to institutions subject to the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading regime for the period 2021-2025, among which certain facilities of the Enagás Group are included.\n\nThe rights assigned in 2023 and 2022 were 50,881 emission rights (31,724 emission rights in 2022) measured at 83.18 euros/right and 83.52 euros/right, respectively, the spot price on the first working day of 2023 and 2022 of SENDECO2 (European CO<sup>2</sup> Negotiation System), a company engaged in the purchase and sale of emission rights on its own account and in providing technical and administrative advice on industrial facilities subject to the Trade Directive (EU ETS).\n\nIn addition, in 2023, 274,000 emission allowances were acquired for consideration for a total of 22,393 thousands of euros, distributed as\n\n#### c) Audit fees\n\n\"Other operating expenses\" includes the fees for audit and non-audit services provided by the auditor of the Group, Ernst & Young, S.L., or by a company belonging to the same group or related to the auditor, broken down as follows:\n\nfollows: 75,259 emission allowances in the amount of 6,738 thousands of euros for emissions in 2022 and 198,741 allowances in the amount of 15,655 thousands of euros for emissions in 2023 (in 2021, 204,150 allowances were acquired for consideration in the amount of 16,170 thousands of euros).\n\nThe Enagás Group consumed 215,438 greenhouse gas emission rights during 2023 (283,402 rights during 2022).\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Enagás Group presented the verified emissions reports of 2022 by the accredited entity (SGS) to the corresponding Autonomous Communities, which validated the emissions. In the second quarter of 2022, the Enagás Group delivered greenhouse gas emission allowances equivalent to the verified emissions in 2022 for all the facilities referred to.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Enagás Group did not engage in any negotiations for future contracts relating to greenhouse gas emission rights, nor were there any contingencies relating to penalties or provisional cautionary measures in the terms established by Law 1/2005.\n\n|                                         | 2023                                                            |                                                  | 2022                                                            |                                                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Categories                              | Services rendered by the accounts auditor and related companies | Services provided by other auditors of the Group | Services rendered by the accounts auditor and related companies | Services provided by other auditors of the Group |\n| Audit services (1)                      | 1,081                                                           | 197                                              | 1,090                                                           | 253                                              |\n| Other assurance services (2)            | 427                                                             | —                                                | 336                                                             | —                                                |\n| <b>Total audit and related services</b> | <b>1,508</b>                                                    | <b>197</b>                                       | <b>1,426</b>                                                    | <b>253</b>                                       |\n| <b>Total professional services (3)</b>  | <b>1,508</b>                                                    | <b>197</b>                                       | <b>1,426</b>                                                    | <b>253</b>                                       |\n\n(1) Audit services: This heading includes services rendered for the performance of statutory audits of the Group's annual accounts and the limited review work performed with respect to the Interim and Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the Certification of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) System.\n\n(2) Other audit-related assurance services: This section includes the work relating to the Annual Corporate Governance Report, the review of the non-financial information included in the Management Report, the report on agreed procedures on the ICFR, the Audit Report for the Renewal of the Comfort letter, as well as the issuance of a Report on Agreed Procedures in relation to the regulatory information on costs submitted to the CNMC on June 30, 2023; Preparatory work for the issuance of a possible\n\n(3) Law 22/2015 on the Audit of Accounts establishes that non-audit services provided by the auditor must be less than 70% of the average fees paid for audit services for three consecutive years.

At these facilities, via a physical process which normally makes use of seawater vaporisers, the temperature of the liquefied gas is increased until it is transformed into its gaseous state. The natural gas is injected into the gas pipelines for transmission to the whole peninsula.\n\n**Storage of gas:** The Enagás Group operates the following underground storage facilities: Serrablo (located between Jaca and Sabiñánigo - Huesca), Gaviota (offshore storage, located close to Bermeo - Vizcaya), and Yela (Guadalajara). Likewise, the Company carries out all the operations necessary for the maintenance and operation of the facilities until the last phase of the decommissioning of the Castor storage facility is completed.\n\n#### **Regulated activities - Activity of the Technical Manager of the System**\n\nThe Enagás Group continued carrying out its functions as Technical Manager of the System in 2022 in compliance with Royal Decree 6/2000 of June 23 and Royal Decree 949/2001 of August 3, with a view to guaranteeing supply continuity and safety, as well as the correct coordination among the access points, storage, transmission, and distribution points.\n\n#### **Non-regulated activities**\n\nIncludes all non-regulated activities, as well as transactions related to investments in associates and joint ventures, except those corresponding to BBG, Saggas, MIBGAS and Iniciativas del Gas, S.L.\n\nThe above activities can be carried out by Enagás, S.A. itself or through companies with an identical or analogous corporate purpose in which it holds interest, provided they remain within the scope and limitations established by legislation applicable to the hydrocarbons sector. In accordance with said legislation, the activities related to transmission and technical management of the system which are of a regulated nature must be carried out by two subsidiaries entirely owned by Enagás, S.A. (Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. and Enagás GTS, S.A.U., respectively).\n\nThe structure of this information is designed as if each business line were an independent business, with its own resources, distributed on the basis of the assets assigned to each line in accordance with an internal system of cost allocation by percentages.\n\nThe \"Other activities\" segment also includes the activity relating to hydrogen infrastructures (mainly carried out by Enagás Infraestructuras de Hidrógeno), given that at present it is not sufficiently significant in quantitative terms to constitute a new business segment.

This gas is not reflected in the financial statements as it is gas available for the System and therefore not owned by the Enagás Group.\n\n## 4.9 Subsequent events\n\nFrom December 31, 2023 until the date of preparation of these Consolidated Annual Accounts, the following events have occurred:\n\n- On January 15, 2024, the Enagás Group has successfully completed the issue of 600 million euros in bonds maturing in 2034 and an annual coupon of 3.625%.\n- On January 15, 2024, the credit lines of 400 million dollars and 10 million dollars held by Enagás International and Enagás S.A. respectively were cancelled.\n- On January 29, 2024, the 450 million euro loan with original maturity in January 2025 held by Enagás Financiaciones was repaid early.\n\n{296}------------------------------------------------\n\nidated\nement Our b\nmodel\n\nur business\nmodel\n\nC\nthe\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\nl Risk\nmanagement\n\n<span id=\"page-296-0\"></span>[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/296/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Regulatory framework\n\n## a) Adequacy of powers between the Government and the Regulator: Second regulatory period (2021-2026)\n\nIn 2019, the basis for determining the framework of the gas system applicable during the 2021-2026 regulatory period were established. The process began with the publication in the Official State Gazette (BOE) of Royal Decree-Law 1/2019 on urgent measures to adapt the CNMC's powers, where the basic legislation of the electricity and gas sectors is modified in order to perform a distribution of powers between the Government and the CNMC to adapt them to the requirements of EU law.\n\nIn this distribution of powers, the CNMC receives the transfer of all powers related to:\n\n- Toll and remuneration methodologies in transmission, distribution and LNG plants, as well as the establishment of their values.\n- Remuneration parameters and asset bases.\n- Methodology and remuneration of the Technical Manager of the System, i.e., Enagás GTS, S.A.U.\n- Methodology on the conditions of access and connection to gas infrastructures.\n- Approving the Technical Management of the Gas System Regulations (NGTS) in relation to the balance system, programming, international connections and shrinkage.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ministry for the Ecological Transition (MITECO) will be in charge of:\n\n- Establishing energy policy guidelines (Order TEC/406/2019).\n- Methodology for calculating royalties and remuneration of basic services for access to Underground Storage Facilities and approval of their values.\n- Determining the last resort tariffs (TUR).\n- Structure and methodology of the charges for costs of facilities not associated with the use of these facilities (CNMC rate, deficit annuities, regulated remuneration of Mibgas, S.A., etc.).\n- Approving the Technical Management of the Gas System Regulations related to security of supply, emergency, gas quality and input/output control.\n\nIn order to guarantee the proper functioning of both institutions, a Cooperation Committee is created between the Ministry and the CNMC, a transitional regime is established to ensure an orderly transfer of functions and to avoid affecting the legal security of the parties operating in the sectors, and the bases for the next gas and electricity remuneration period are developed.\n\nThe CNMC, within the scope of its regulatory powers, must take into account the strategic priorities established by the Government, which are embodied in energy policy guidelines adopted by order of the head of MITECO.\n\nIn these energy policy guidelines the government:\n\n- Is committed to regasification plants, promoting their competitiveness with respect to other international plants, favouring international connections and committing to a deep and liquid LNG market\n- Is positioned in favour of biomethane and other renewable gases, with special mention of the injection of hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.\n- Encourages the extension of the operation of those facilities that have exceeded their useful life in terms of remuneration.\n- Discourages investment in new infrastructure except for assets that are necessary to ensure the supply of the whole system or that are strategic for meeting energy policy objectives.\n\nAs regards remuneration, the CNMC published the following circulars to update, for the second regulatory period, the current remuneration model, as well as the system of access tolls for each of the services provided by the facility, taking into account the infrastructures involved in the provision of each service:\n\n- **• Circular 2/2019, of November 12,** establishing the methodology for calculating the financial remuneration rate for power transmission and distribution, and natural gas regasification, transmission and distribution.\n- **• Circular 9/2019, of December 12,** establishing the methodology for the remuneration of regulated natural gas transmission and regasification activities.\n- **• Circular 6/2020 of July 22,** establishing the methodology for the calculation of tolls for the regasification, transmission and distribution of natural gas.\n- **• Circular 8/2020, of December 2,** establishing the unitary benchmark values for investment and operation and maintenance for the 2021-2026 regulatory period and the minimum requirements for audits of investments and costs in natural gas transmission facilities and liquefied natural gas plants.\n- In the operational field, it published the following circulars with the aim of encouraging and facilitating competition, promoting greater use of gas infrastructure, harmonising, simplifying and establishing a transparent and competitive mechanism for the allocation and use of capacity, making the operations of agents more flexible and resolving situations of congestion at regasification plants, as well as contemplating measures to regularise the physical imbalance of LNG at regasification plants and in underground storage:\n- **• Circular 8/2019, of December 12**, establishing the access and capacity allocation mechanisms to be applied in the natural gas system.\n\n{304}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our

of December 15,** of the National Commission on Markets and Competition, amending Circular 8/2019, of December 12, establishing the methodology and conditions for access and capacity allocation in the natural gas system.\n\n## b) Remuneration of LNG transmission, regasification and storage activities in the second regulatory period 2021-2026\n\nIn accordance with the aforementioned adequacy of powers between the Government and the Regulator, the CNMC published, at the end of 2019, Circular 9/2019 establishing the remuneration system for transmission and regasification activities. The methodology opts to maintain the principles established in the current regulatory framework, defined in Law 18/2014, adapting them to current gas market conditions, while establishing an orderly and progressive transition between the two remuneration frameworks.\n\nThe review of the remuneration framework established by this Circular was completed with the approval by the CNMC, on December 2, 2020, of Circular 8/2020, establishing the unit reference values for investment and operation and maintenance for the period 2021-2026, as well as the minimum criteria for audits of investments and costs at natural gas transmission facilities and LNG plants.\n\nThe basic principles maintained in the new remuneration framework are as follows:\n\n- Establish remuneration appropriate to a low-risk activity.\n- Ensure the recovery of the investments made by the titleholders during their useful life.\n- Allow a reasonable return on financial resources invested.\n- Determine the operating costs remuneration system in a way that encourages effective management and improvement of productivity that should be partly passed on to users and consumers.\n- Contribute to the economic and financial sustainability of the natural gas system.\n- Consider the costs necessary for performing the activity by an efficient and well-managed company in accordance with the principle of performing the activity at the lowest cost to the gas system with homogeneous criteria throughout Spain, notwithstanding the specific arrangement provided for island and extra-peninsular territories.\n\nFrom a methodological perspective, the following aspects are maintained in the new framework:\n\n• The regulatory periods run consecutively for a period of six years.\n\n- The remuneration parameters for the regulated activities are set for the entire 6-year regulatory period, taking into account the cyclical nature of the economy, gas demand, the development of costs, efficiency improvements, the economic and financial balance of the system, and the reasonable profitability of these activities.\n- Remuneration continues to be calculated individually for each facility.\n- The net value of the asset is maintained as the basis for calculating the return on investment.\n- Any procedure for automatic adjustment of values and remuneration parameters according to price indices is removed.\n- Depreciation continues to be calculated on a straight-line basis and the useful lives of the assets are maintained.\n- The operating and maintenance costs of facilities that are individually remunerated continue to be calculated on the basis of the unit costs in force established in Circular 8/2020 for the facilities to which these unit reference values apply and on the basis of the audited costs for the individual facilities.\n\nOne of the most significant novelties, although it has practically no material impact, is that in order to allow the temporary coordination of remuneration with the methodology of tolls and royalties, in accordance with the European Commission Regulation the remuneration is now calculated per gas year. The gas year for which the remuneration of the facilities is determined runs from October 1 of year \"n-1\" to September 30 of year \"n\", both inclusive, with the exception of 2021 which started on January 1, 2021.\n\nThe remuneration accrued in one year for gas by each company that owns natural gas transmission facilities and liquefied natural gas plants will be the result of adding up the following remuneration components for each of its facilities:\n\n- Return on investment (RINV) which aims to recover the investments made and to obtain a reasonable return.\n- Remuneration for operation and maintenance of the facility (RO&M).\n- Productivity and efficiency remuneration adjustments (ARPE).\n- Remuneration for facilities in special administrative situations (RSAE).\n- Return on investment in facilities with cross-border impacts resulting from the application of Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No. 347/2013, (RIIT).\n\nEach of these components is presented below:\n\n#### b.1) Return on investment (RINV).\n\nIt is determined for each of the assets in production entitled to individual remuneration and is intended to provide return on investment costs incurred. The return on investment includes remuneration for depreciation and financial remuneration for assets and minimum fill level, which remain practically the same as in the current framework, and, if applicable, remuneration based on the gas transported.\n\nRemuneration for investment costs is comprised of the following:\n\n{305}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/305/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a logo with the letters \"ena\" in a blue font. The logo also includes a green and blue circle around the letters.\n\n**• Value of assets recognised.** The values recognised in the current framework for assets brought into operation are maintained. For facilities commissioned before 2002, the corresponding amounts are calculated based on the carrying amounts of the assets once the accounting restatement of 1996 is taken into account (Royal Decree-Law 7/1996), less grants received for the purpose of financing said assets, applying a restatement coefficient comprised of the adjusted average Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Industrial Price Index (IPRI) to this difference.\n\nFor the new facilities commissioned from 2002, the standard value of each investment as established by the regulator is used, while for those which require expansion, the real cost is used.\n\nTransmission facilities commissioned from 2008 are measured by taking the average of the standard value and real cost.\n\nRegasification facilities commissioned from 2006 are measured at real cost plus 50% of the difference between the standard value and said real cost, up to a maximum of the standard value.\n\nThe new framework does present a novelty for the regasification facilities to be launched from 2020 as they will be valued as transmission facilities. That is, at the average cost between the standard value and the actual cost, without limiting it to the standard cost.\n\nThe resulting value is reduced by the amounts transferred and financed by third parties, 90% of the amounts obtained from the sale of dismantled equipment and the subsidies received (90% if they come from the European Union).\n\nAnother aspect of the new framework, applicable to transmission and regasification facilities, is that the unit investment reference values in force at the time of obtaining authorisation for the facilities will be applicable to new facilities that come into operation from 2021 onwards. Previously, these were the unit values in force when the commissioning certificate was obtained.\n\n**• Remuneration for amortisation of system assets (A).** The value of the resulting amount recognised for the investment is amortised applying a rate corresponding to its useful life, obtaining the related income in this manner.\n\nIn the new framework, the useful lives of the assets in the current framework are maintained, except for the secondary pumps of the regasification plants (which go from 20 to 10 years). In addition, for new facilities, the remuneration for amortisation starts to accrue from the date of commissioning of the facility. This is different from the current framework, as the accrual for transmission facilities started on January 1 of the year following the commissioning. The remuneration is accrued until the facility is depreciated.\n\nDepreciation is calculated for the facilities of the trunk network and regasification plants commissioned prior to January 1, 2021 and for primary transmission pipelines of local influence with administrative authorisation prior to January 1, 2021.\n\n**• Financial remuneration of the amount invested (FR).** It is calculated by applying a financial remuneration rate to the net values of the assets without restatement and accrues until the net value is zero.\n\nFor the second regulatory period, the remuneration rate on the transmission and regasification assets is no longer indexed to the government bonds, and it is calculated on the basis of the average WACC capital cost of the transmission and regasification activity. For the second period (2021-2026), the rate was established in Circular 2/2019 and was set at 5.44%.\n\nThe financial remuneration is calculated for facilities with individualised remuneration with the right to remuneration by amortisation and begins to accrue from the same date as the latter.\n\n- **• Financial remuneration for heel gas and minimum fill (RFNMLL).** The calculation method of the current framework is maintained. The remuneration is calculated by applying the financial remuneration rate to the purchase value of the gas and has no amortisation. It starts to accrue from the later of the date of purchase of the gas and the date of commissioning of the facility until the closure of the facility or the delivery of the gas to the GTS for use as operating gas.\n- **• Remuneration based on the gas transmitted or processed (RGV).** This remuneration is applied to the primary transmission facilities in the local area of influence awarded by competition and to new regasification plants and primary gas pipelines in the area of influence directly authorised after December 31, 2020. The annual remuneration is that which results from multiplying a unit remuneration coefficient by the gas transmitted or processed annually and is accrued from the date of commissioning. In no case may the RGV remuneration, in each gas year, be greater than the amounts invoiced for tolls and royalties.\n\nFor facilities awarded by competition, the unit remuneration (ROC) is that offered by the company awarded the contract, while for facilities awarded directly (RUM), the unit remuneration is the average remuneration calculated as the sum of the amortisation and financial remuneration during the useful life of the project divided by the sum of the annual gas volumes forecasted by the owner of the facility when the economic justification of the project was presented for award. For these facilities, given that the remuneration risk is greater than for the trunk facilities, the financial remuneration rate is increased by a differential provisionally set at 0.39%, resulting in a rate of 5.83%.\n\n{306}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/306/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a blue and green logo.\n\nThe RGV remuneration is accrued until the present value of the sum of the recognised annual remuneration, discounted at the previous remuneration rate, is equal to the present value of the recognised investment.\n\n#### b.2) Remuneration for operation and maintenance of the facilities (RO&M).\n\nFor transmission and regasification assets to which the standard unit costs apply, the remuneration for operation and maintenance is calculated by applying the reference unit costs of operation and maintenance in force, regardless of the date of commissioning of the fixed asset (COMVU).\n\nFor the second regulatory period 2021-2026, the standard unit costs are those published in Circular 8/2020.\n\nFor one-off assets, costs are calculated on the basis of actual audited costs (COMsing).\n\nApart from the above costs, other costs not included in the unit reference values (OCOM) are also recognised and will be recognised on the basis of their audited cost. These costs include:\n\n- Direct and indirect capitalised operating expenses. When the capitalised expenses exceed 250,000 euros, they will be recognised with amortisation and financial remuneration based on their audited investment value, considering a useful life of 2 years. In these cases, the accrual will occur from January 1 of the year following their commissioning. Capitalised expenses below this limit will be recognised as an expense for the year up to the limit established by the CNMC.\n- The acquisition cost of the operating gas for transmission and of the odorant.\n- The cost of electricity supply for LNG plants and for electric motors in compressor stations. In the case of the regasification plants this audited cost replaces the variable remuneration existing in the current framework.\n- The cost increases from January 1, 2021 for municipal fees for public domain occupancy and for port fees for port domain occupancy.\n\n### b.3) Remuneration for adjustments to productivity and efficiency (ARPE).\n\nUnder this item, facilities that are at the end of their useful life (REVU) are remunerated, as are the transitional remuneration for continuity of supply (RCS), the remuneration for efficiency in operating and maintenance costs (RMP) and the remuneration for incentives to shrinkage reduction (IM) and promote gas in maritime and land transport. The items included are the following:\n\n**• Remuneration for extension of useful life for fully depreciated assets (REVU).** Once the regulatory useful life of each fixed asset finalises, if the asset is still in use, the remuneration accrued for said facility corresponding to remuneration for investment, amortisation, and financial remuneration will be nil. In contrast, remuneration for operation and maintenance of the asset \"i\" each year \"n\" will be increased. In this manner, the value recognised will be the amount corresponding to it multiplied by a coefficient for increasing its useful life, μin. This coefficient is gradually increasing,\n\nthe starting value being higher than the current remuneration framework, from 0.15 to 0.3.\n\n- **• Remuneration for continuity of supply (RCS).** A transitional remuneration is established for the RCS during the 2021-2026 regulatory period. The RCS is no longer indexed to the variation in demand or regasification but is calculated on the basis of the RCS recognised in the year 2020, adjusted by the following coefficients for the different gas years of the second regulatory period. ¾ of 95% for 2021, 80% for 2022, 65% for 2023, 50% for 2024, 35% for 2025 and 20% for 2026.\n- **• Remuneration for productivity improvements in operating and maintenance costs in regulatory periods (RMP).** This item intends to allow the carrier to retain part of the operating and maintenance cost efficiencies achieved over the previous regulatory period and is calculated per company, which is currently set at 50%. Under this item, the company is attributed 50% of the reduction in costs in the current regulatory period with respect to the unit costs of the previous regulatory period.\n- **• Shrinkage reduction incentive (IM)**. Until September 30, 2021, the same methodology is applied as at present, while as from October 1, 2021, the new methodology established in Circular 7/2021 of July 28 comes into force.\n- **• Incentive remuneration for the development of natural gas in maritime and land transport (IDS).** This incentive aims to promote the use of natural gas as a fuel in maritime and land transport and is calculated by multiplying the gas invoiced for service stations connected to the transmission network and the LNG invoiced in regasification plants for use as maritime fuel by unit coefficients, which in both cases is 0.50 euros/MWh.\n\n### b.4) Remuneration for facilities in special administrative situations (RSAE).\n\nThis remuneration applies to the Musel regasification terminal, which was suspended when the licence was processed and was in hibernation until it was commissioned in July 2023. This remuneration corresponds to a transitional remuneration made up of the sum of the financial remuneration calculated on the basis of the standard investment value and the actual audited operation and maintenance costs.\n\nIt is also applicable to the Musel regasification terminal, once it is commissioned and has a unique and temporary economic regime for the provision of LNG logistics services, in accordance with article 60.7 of Law 18/2014, as defined by the CNMC in its resolution of February 2, 2023.\n\n{307}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/307/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. Above the word is a curved line that starts as green on the left and transitions to blue on the right. The curved line is positioned to look like a smile or a stylized representation of a pipeline.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nIn addition, due to the transfer of remuneration rights from Enagás Transporte to Musel Energy Hub on September 29, 2023, the publication of the Resolution of December 15, 2023 determines the distribution and adjustments to the remuneration in 2023 and 2024 among the owners involved in the transfer of ownership of the El Musel plant.\n\nThis Resolution transfers to Musel Energy Hub the remuneration currently recognised by Enagás Transporte from the effective date of the transfer.\n\n### b.5) Remuneration for investments with crossborder impacts (RIIT).\n\nThis item is aimed at remunerating any costs that a carrier may incur as a result of the cross-border distribution of investment costs for a project of common European interest, as established in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 17, 2013.\n\nPipelines which affect reverse flow capacities or change the capacity to transport gas across the borders of the Member States concerned by at least 10% compared to the situation prior to the project is put into service may, in the case of natural gas, be considered as a project of common interest as set out in Appendix II to this Regulation. In the case of storage of natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG), they will be considered as a project of common interest when the project is intended for the direct or indirect supply of at least two Member States or for compliance with the infrastructure standard (n-1) at regional level, in accordance with European Regulation 2017/1938 on Security of Supply.\n\n### b.6) Introduction of the principle of financial prudence\n\nFor the purpose of incorporating a principle of financial prudence required of the holders of transmission assets and liquefied natural gas plants, a penalty is established for companies whose ratios are outside the recommended value ranges set forth in the CNMC Communication 1/2019.\n\nAccordingly, a company's annual remuneration in calendar year n could be reduced by up to 1% if the overall ratio defined in that communication, calculated on the basis of the financial statements for year n-2, is less than 0.9. However, this penalty would not be applicable until 2024, based on the 2022 financial statements.\n\n## c) Remuneration for underground storage activity\n\nIn accordance with Royal Decree 1184/2020, of December 29, which establishes the methodologies for calculating charges in the gas system, the regulated remuneration of basic underground storage facilities and the royalties applied for their use, the remuneration of the owners of basic underground storage facilities shall be determined per gas year, prior to the start of the gas year and in accordance with the methodology established in this Royal Decree 1184/2020, of December 29, following a report by the National Commission on Markets and Competition and the agreement of the Government's Delegated Commission for Economic Affairs.\n\nIn general, the remuneration methodology for underground storage is consistent with that established by the CNMC for transmission activities and LNG plants, although there are some differences due to the specific nature of underground storage facilities.\n\nOther differences include the absence of unit reference values for investment and operation and maintenance, as well as the fact that the starting coefficient established for calculating the remuneration for the extension of useful life remains at 15%, compared to 30% for other activities. This difference is justified precisely because the operation and maintenance costs of each underground storage facility are established on the basis of their real audited costs and not on the basis of a reference unit value.\n\nThe annual remuneration of each company will be obtained as the sum of the individual remunerations of all the storage facilities it owns. The titleholders of basic underground storage facilities shall be entitled to the following remuneration:\n\n- Remuneration for investment in facilities with individualised remuneration and in the purchase of gas for use as cushion gas.\n- Provisional remuneration for operation and maintenance costs.\n- Remuneration for life extension.\n- Remuneration for productivity improvements.\n- Transitional remuneration for continuity of supply, in accordance with the second transitional provision.\n- Review, if applicable, of the provisional operation and maintenance remuneration.\n\nAnother novelty of the new remuneration framework is that it establishes a greater level of detail in the definition of the useful life of investments in underground storage facilities. Thus, previously a useful life of 20 years was established for all investments, but now a distinction is made between useful lives of 10 years for research and vehicles, 20 years for facilities, off-shore platforms, vessels, helicopters and cushion gas, 40 years for gas pipelines and 50 years for onshore civil works.\n\nThe remuneration of each holder will be reduced according to the related income obtained, and by application of the penalty for insufficient financial prudence, calculated in accordance with Article 27 of Circular 9/2019, of December 12, of the National Commission on Markets and Competition, which establishes the methodology for determining the remuneration of natural gas transmission facilities and liquefied natural gas plants.\n\n{308}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/308/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in light green on the left, and the word \"enaga\" in blue and green on the right, with the letters inside a green and blue circle.\n\n## d) Income corresponding to Technical Management of the System (GTS)\n\n### Remuneration recognised in the 2021-2023 and 2024-2026 regulatory periods\n\nIn accordance with the adequacy of powers between the Government and the Regulator, the CNMC published, at the beginning of 2020, Circular 1/2020, establishing the methodology for the remuneration of the Technical Manager of the System.\n\nThis establishes a methodology that allows the remuneration of the GTS to be set on the basis of known criteria and parameters, thus giving the remuneration framework the transparency, security and visibility in the medium-term that it lacked.\n\nThe Circular establishes regulatory periods of 3 years for the GTS, as opposed to 6 years for transmission and regasification activities.\n\nThe new remuneration methodology is based on the following principles:\n\n- Obtaining a reasonable return for a low-risk activity.\n- Consideration of the costs incurred by an efficient and wellmanaged company.\n\nThe methodology takes into account that the activity of the GTS requires few assets, basically in software and applications, that its costs correspond mainly to personnel and external services costs, and that its activity is strongly conditioned by European regulations and projects, in a changing and evolving environment, to which it must continuously adapt.\n\nThe remuneration is the sum of a basic remuneration (Bret), an incentive remuneration (RxInc), a remuneration for new obligations (CR and Guarantees of Origin) and a remuneration (D) for the difference, positive or negative, between the amounts received by the technical manager of the system for the application of the quota for the financing of the remuneration and the annual remuneration to be established for year n and for the difference between the estimate of the incentive remuneration term and the amount resulting from the level of compliance with it (the National Commission on Markets and Competition will determine by resolution the level of compliance with the incentives for year n).\n\nThe basic remuneration is made up of:\n\n- Remuneration for OPEX, (BOpex): based on financial and regulatory accounting.\n- Margin on recognised OPEX, (BMarg\\_Opex), set at 5%.\n- Remuneration for depreciation, (BAmort), based on the depreciation of financial and regulatory accounting.\n- Financial remuneration, (BRF) by applying a remuneration rate to the net asset value. The rate is the same as for transmission and regasification activity, 5.44% for the period 2021-2026.\n\nRemuneration for incentives that can be up to +- 5% of the basic remuneration, depending on the incentive mechanism established by the CNMC for each regulatory period. However, for the regulatory period 2021-2023 the limits are set at +/-2%. At the end of 2020, the\n\nCircular establishing these incentives was being processed, and was published in the Official State Gazette in July 2021, effective as of October 1, 2021.\n\nThe remuneration for new obligations is established on the basis of a regulatory account, the balance of which is established for each regulatory period, divided by 3, for each of the years of the regulatory period. For the regulatory period 2021-2023, the regulatory account is 5 million euros.\n\nThus, for the regulatory period 2021-2023, the basic remuneration is set at 25,007 thousands of euros and the remuneration of the regulatory account at 1.667 thousands of euros.\n\nFor the 2024-2026 regulatory period, the remuneration base remains constant, the same as for the 2021-2023 regulatory period, as do the parameters for its calculation. The value is 25,007 thousands of euros.\n\nThe Resolution of March 2, 2023 adjusts the remuneration to the gas year, so that the remuneration corresponding to 2023 covers the period from January 1 to September 30. The remuneration of the GTS for 2023 is 16,038 thousands of euros. It has been calculated considering 14,904 thousands of euros of remuneration for OPEX, a margin of 5% of OPEX (745 thousands of euros), 8,650 thousands of euros of amortisation, 708 thousands of euros of financial remuneration, 1,667 thousands of euros for the annual amount accrued from the regulatory account for new obligations and 500 thousands of euros for the incentive remuneration. A ratio of 9/12 of the full year has been considered. Finally, the differences between the amounts accrued and amounts actually incurred corresponding to previous years have been included, amounting to 4,303 thousands of euros to be refunded.\n\nFor the 2024-2026 regulatory period, the remuneration base remains constant, the same as for the 2021-2023 regulatory period.\n\nAs in the current framework, the remuneration of the GTS will be recovered through the application of a fee, calculated as a percentage of the turnover from tolls and royalties.\n\n## e) Tolls and royalties relating to third party access to the gas system\n\nThe revenues collected from the application of tolls for third party access to gas facilities are exclusively used to support the remuneration of regulated activities for gas supply. As gas system revenues are used to finance all gas system costs, they must be sufficient to meet the full costs of the gas system.\n\nThe tolls and royalties are established so that their setting responds as a whole to the following principles:\n\n- Ensure the recovery of the investments made by the titleholders during their useful life.\n- Allow a reasonable return on financial resources invested.\n\n{309}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/309/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is a logo with the letters \"ena\" in blue and green.\n\n• Determine the operating costs remuneration system in a way that encourages effective management and improvement of productivity that should be partly passed on to users and consumers.\n\nIn addition, tolls and royalties will take into account the costs incurred by the use of the network in a way that optimises the use of infrastructures and can be differentiated by pressure levels, consumption characteristics and duration of contracts.\n\nThe values applicable from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 have been published in the Resolution of May 19, 2022, of the National Commission on Markets and Competition, which establishes the access tolls to the transmission networks, local networks and regasification for the 2023 gas year.\n\nSimilarly, the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge is responsible for setting the remuneration and fees for access to underground storage facilities. From October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the values of the access charges published in the Order TED/929/2022 of September 27, which establishes the gas network charges and the remuneration and charges for underground base storage for the gas year 2023, shall apply.\n\n## f) System of settlement of costs and regulated revenues\n\nUntil September 30, 2021, the billing and collection of the remuneration of regulated activities were subject to the settlement procedure established in Ministerial Order ECO 2692/2002, of October 28, regulating the settlement procedures for the remuneration of regulated activities, charges and fees with specific destinations in the gas sector.\n\nFrom October 1, 2021, the settlement procedures established in Ministerial Order TED/1022/2021, of September 27, regulating the settlement procedures of the regulated activities remunerations, charges and fees with specific destinations of the gas sector, are applicable.\n\nThe update of the settlement procedure was motivated to adapt it to the European Commission Regulation 2017/460 of March 16, 2017, establishing a network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas. This Regulation determines the need for a regulatory account for the transmission activity that reflects the difference between the recognised remuneration and the revenues actually obtained in the tariff period, a principle that, in order to avoid discrimination, must also be applied to other activities.\n\nIt is also necessary to incorporate changes to adjust the calendar for sending information and approving settlements to adapt it to the gas year (from October 1 to September 30 of the following year).\n\nThus, 5 separate settlement procedures are established for the following activities:\n\n- a. Trunk transmission.\n- b. Local networks, which will include distribution, secondary transmission and primary transmission activities of local influence and any other facility determined by the regulations in force.\n- c. Liquefied natural gas plants.\n- d. Basic underground storage facilities.\n- e. Gas system charges. It will include the revenues from application of the unit charges defined in Royal Decree 1184/2020, of December 29, establishing the methodologies for calculating the gas system charges, the regulated remuneration of basic underground storage facilities and the fees applied for their use, and the costs listed in Article 59.4.b) of Law 18/2014, of October 15. Basically, the costs to be recovered through charges are: CNMC fee, differential cost of supply of liquefied or manufactured natural gas in island territories, annuity of the deficit for 2014 and subsequent years (until 2020), demand management measures that are recognised by regulation, the approved remuneration of the natural gas Market Operator and any other cost that is legally established.\n\nIt is understood that annual mismatches between revenues and costs of the gas system occur if the difference between revenues and settlement costs in each of the settlement procedures of a gas year results in a negative amount.\n\nAs from October 1, 2021, with the entry into force of Order TED/1022/2021, the provisional annual mismatches between revenues and costs for the year for each settlement procedure are determined in the provisional settlement 14 of each year. The provisional annual mismatch of each subject, whether positive or negative, will be recognised in the form of a lump sum payment in the first available settlement of the gas year following the provisional settlement 14.\n\nThe final settlement will determine the final annual mismatch between revenues and costs for each obligated party. The difference between the final and provisional deviation, whether positive or negative, will be settled as a one-time payment in the first available settlement of the following gas year.\n\nAdditionally, in accordance with the provisions of Article 61.3 of Law 18/2014 of October 15, 2014, as long as there is an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2014 or mismatches between revenues and expenses of subsequent years pending amortisation, any surplus or deficit in collection under charges shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article, without being able to reduce the amount thereof. Once there are no outstanding deficits and mismatches to be amortised, any deficit/ surplus in the collection of charges will be applied in the calculation of charges for the following year.\n\nLaw 18/2014, of October 15, establishes the principle of economic and financial sustainability in the gas system. In accordance with this principle, revenues from the system will be used exclusively to sustain own remuneration of the regulated activities concerning the supply of gas and, furthermore, the revenues must be sufficient to satisfy all of the costs incurred by the gas system. In addition, in order to ensure economic sufficiency and avoid the appearance of new deficits ex ante, all regulatory measures relating to the gas system which involve an increase in costs for the system or a reduction of income must incorporate an equivalent reduction in other cost items or an equivalent increase in income which ensures equilibrium for the system.\n\nAlso, the previous remuneration framework established a specific methodology for resolving temporary imbalances between revenues and costs of the system, with a series of measures aimed at definitively ending the deficit of the gas system, such as:\n\n{313}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/313/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font.\n\n#### **LULUCF**\n\n**Regulation (EU) 2023/839 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 19, 2023** amending Regulation (EU) 2018/841 as regards scope, simplification of reporting and compliance rules and setting Member States' 2030 targets, and Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 as regards enhanced monitoring, reporting, progress monitoring and review.\n\n#### **Other**\n\n**Communication from the Commission of March 9, 2023** on a Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against Ukraine by Russia.\n\n**Commission Delegated Act (EU) 2023/2450 of July 25, 2023** supplementing Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a list of essential services.\n\n**Commission Communication of November 28, 2023** on \"An EU Action Plan for Grids\".\n\n## 2.

The man is positioned on the left side of the frame, with his body angled slightly towards the viewer. He has a fair complexion and a gentle smile. The suit is a deep blue color, and the tie has a subtle pattern of brown and white. The background is a solid, neutral gray, which helps to highlight the man and his attire.\n\n**2023 has been a big year for Enagás:** intense in terms of the magnitude of the challenges we have faced and in which we have taken truly significant steps for our future growth.\n\nThe global context continues to be highly complex, and geopolitical conflicts like those that continue today in Ukraine, the Middle East and the Red Sea - with their attendant energy consequences - have left their mark on much of the year. Among others, the European Union, countries such as Spain and companies have learned important lessons from the disruptive events of recent years. We know that navigating the new paradigm of uncertainty,\n\nvolatility and the acceleration of major transformations has two keys: anticipation and cooperation.\n\nAfter laying the foundations in 2022 with REPowerEU, Europe has continued to build a truly collective energy policy as one of the fundamental pillars of its strategic autonomy. The EU has adopted very significant measures over the past year at a crucial time for energy. Likewise, Spain's term holding the presidency of the European Council has produced very satisfactory results in this area, such as the agreements for the EU Directive and Regulation on the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package, and the agreement on electricity market reform.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\nImage /page/5/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a simple, sans-serif font. To the right of the text is a stylized logo featuring a green and blue design.\n\n#### A key role in European energy security\n\nSpain has continued to play an essential role in strengthening European security of supply. We were the first country to meet the EU's target of 90% fill levels at underground storage facilities by November. We achieved this six months ahead of schedule; in August, we reached 100%. The EU as a whole managed to fill its storage to 99%, a success that made this winter far more comfortable than the last.\n\nWe will also end 2023 with one more LNG terminal in operation thanks to the start-up of the El Musel terminal in Gijón, which provides 20% of Europe's additional new regasification capacity. Our seven LNG terminals are a major strategic asset for Spain and have allowed us to receive gas from 17 different origins this year. Our country has consolidated its position as the LNG gateway to Europe, and Enagás became the world's leading tanker loading operator in 2023.\n\nOur robust gas pipeline network has also made it easier for Spain to remain in energy solidarity with the rest of the EU: gas exports by pipeline increased by 23.7% in 2023 and, last April, Spain broke the all-time record for natural gas exports to Europe through interconnections with France.\n\n#### A new investment phase centred on renewable hydrogen\n\nAll the knowledge, experience and talent that this company has accumulated over the last 50 years building, operating and maintaining the gas network is being applied to make a future hydrogen network in Spain a reality. In turn, this will form part of a European network.\n\nAs a locally-produced and clean energy carrier, renewable hydrogen strengthens our strategic autonomy and is the key to decarbonisation for Spanish and European industry. The energy transition - let us not forget - is also an opportunity for reindustrialisation.\n\nThe European Commission is betting heavily on green hydrogen, which represents a huge opportunity for Spain; everything is in place for Spain to become the continent's major hydrogen hub. As a company, we are also betting on hydrogen as the future to ensure our sustained growth over time. Developing Spain's gas network was a major challenge and, as has become particularly evident in recent years, a major success. Now, once again, we are facing an intense investment period to make the deployment of renewable hydrogen a reality through projects as massive as the Spanish hydrogen infrastructure project and the H2med corridor.\n\nOur results and milestones for 2023, in which we exceeded all our targets for the seventeenth consecutive year, demonstrate the good work we are doing and are our best guarantee as we tackle the challenges that lie ahead for our sector and Enagás in particular. In 2024, we will continue to work towards becoming a carbon-neutral company by 2040 and contributing to clean, reliable and competitive energy for industries and citizens. Completing the energy trifecta, in short.\n\nEnagás has a truly exceptional team of professionals. Thank you again for your hard work, responsibility and enthusiasm. Many thanks to our magnificent Board of Directors for their involvement and commitment, and to our shareholders for supporting Enagás' future-oriented project and their longterm faith in the company.

His arms are crossed. The background is a solid gray color.\n\n#### **How was 2023 for Enagás?**\n\n2022 was the year of security of supply, and 2023 has indisputably been the year of hydrogen. In just twelve months, we have made progress that lays a firm foundation for the company's future. I would like to highlight three main milestones. The first was that we launched our promised Call for Interest for Spanish hydrogen infrastructure. This attracted enormous interest: 206 companies submitted 650 projects, demonstrating that there is both supply and demand for renewable hydrogen in Spain; these require infrastructure to become a real market.\n\n**'2023 has been a year full of milestones, with a very significant one being the designation of Enagás as the provisional hydrogen network operator'**\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\nImage /page/7/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the \"eni\" logo on the right.\n\nThe other two major milestones are the wonderful news we received as the year drew to a close: the European Commission included on its list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI) both the European H2med corridor and the Spanish hydrogen infrastructure presented by Enagás, opening the door for them to receive European funding. At the same time, through Royal Decree-Law 8/2023, the Spanish government designated us as the provisional hydrogen transmission network operator.\n\nIn parallel to all these advances in hydrogen, we continued to guarantee the perfect operation of the Spanish Gas System, which had 100% availability in 2023. Likewise, we strengthened its role as a key energy hub for Europe's energy sovereignty. In short, we have continued to contribute to the well-being and progress of Spanish society, that of the countries where we operate, and that of those around us.\n\n#### **How is the company preparing for 2024?**\n\nWe are once again facing an intense and exciting year in which we will continue to work towards security of supply and decarbonisation in Spain and Europe. We started the year off with our second Enagás Hydrogen Day; at this very well-received event, we presented the results of the Call for Interest process. This information provided by the sector is the best starting point for the first mission that has been entrusted to us as the provisional HTNO (Hydrogen Transmission Network Operator): to present a hydrogen backbone infrastructure proposal to the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge in April.\n\nIn March, the final list of PCIs will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, and we will be able to apply for European CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) funds for the Spanish infrastructure and H2med studies.\n\nWith the visibility we have now, after all these developments in such a short time, we will update our Strategic Plan during 2024.\n\nWith regard to the GSP arbitration, according to the Arbitration Tribunal, the award terminating the arbitration proceedings will be rendered in the first half of 2024.\n\n## **'As promised, we launched the Call for Interest for Spanish hydrogen infrastructure, which attracted enormous interest and participation from the whole sector'**\n\n#### **What are the main features of the 2023 results?**\n\nThese are very good results; we exceeded all the targets we set ourselves for 2023 and recorded a net profit of 343 million euros.\n\nThese results are mainly explained by two factors. The first is our Efficiency Plan, which has proven to be highly effective in controlling operating and financial expenses and thus minimising the impact of inflation on manageable costs. In particular, we have managed to keep recurring operating expenses at 2022 levels.\n\nThe second factor is the positive evolution and contributions of our affiliates.\n\n#### **How would you sum up the year from a financial perspective?**\n\nWe have continued to strengthen our balance sheet through asset rotation. In this regard, the closing of the sale of our stake in Morelos Pipeline in Mexico had a positive impact, generating a gross capital gain of 46.7 million euros.\n\nWe ended 2023 with an excellent liquidity position of 3.309 billion euros. Our net debt was 3.347 billion euros, 122 million euros less than the previous year. Among other factors, this was thanks to the strong performance of working capital due to the premiums collected from the increased utilisation of LNG terminals in 2023.\n\nWe have a very solid position, with more than 80% of our debt at fixed rates. In addition, the successful issue of 600 million euros in\n\nbonds maturing in 2034 with an annual coupon rate of 3.625% was recently completed in 2024.

To the right of the text is a logo with the letters \"e\" and \"w\" in blue and green.\n\n**How well has the Strategic Plan been implemented?** \n\nWe have exceeded our expectations and progressed faster than planned in implementing the Plan. 2023 was a year of significant steps in our investment plan.\n\nIn Europe, we entered Germany, joining the Hanseatic Energy Hub (HEH) consortium as a 10% industrial partner to develop the Stade LNG terminal, which includes both a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) and a future onshore terminal. We also increased our stake in a strategic infrastructure for the European Union - the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) - to 20%.\n\nIn Spain, we reached an agreement with Reganosa whereby we acquired their network of 130 kilometres of gas pipelines and gave them a 25% stake in the El Musel LNG terminal, which has now started operations and is entering a new phase as the Musel E-Hub LNG terminal.\n\nAnother achievement of the year was the launch by Enagás GTS of the Guarantees of Origin System for renewable gases in Spain.\n\n#### **What is the key to remaining a sustainability leader?**\n\nClear commitments, rigorous measurement and transparent progress reporting year after year. We are committed to being a carbon-neutral company by 2040; to this end, we are following a very ambitious decarbonisation pathway which includes both our direct operations and our value chain. We are making progress and reporting this properly; this means that, for example, the start of 2024 saw us included for the fourth consecutive year on the CDP Climate Change A List. This distinction sets us apart among the world's leading companies in climate action.\n\nWe are on all the major indices, including the global leader, Dow Jones Sustainability, where we have been listed for sixteen consecutive years.\n\nThe key is that our sustainability strategy is at the heart of the business and the company; it concerns and occupies all of us who work here.\n\n#### **What would you highlight from your performance in other ESG areas?**\n\nA clear focus is our commitment to people and the generation of quality employment. We have been recognised for fourteen years as one of the best companies to work for in Spain, certified as a Top Employer company, as well as having the highest level of excellence (A+) as a Family-Responsible Company (EFR). We opened 2024 with the signing of the Group's 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement, a sign of the good understanding between the company and the workers' representatives that shows that at Enagás, we are all pulling in the same direction.\n\nIn these times of profound transformation for our sector, we are more committed than ever to talent and training for the development of the new skills the future needs. Among many other initiatives, we are developing our training school into a Corporate University.\n\nAnother major commitment taken on by Enagás - and by me personally - is to be an increasingly inclusive company. Diversity is key to our present and future strategy. Regarding gender diversity in particular, more than a decade ago, we were one of the first companies to receive the Spanish Ministry of Equality's Gender Equality badge; today, we are world leaders in our sector on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.\n\n## **'Our sustainability strategy is at the heart of the business and the company; it concerns and occupies all of us who work here'**\n\n#### **Is there anything else you would like to highlight about the company's prospects?**\n\nThis is a decisive moment for energy and for the future of Enagás. Decarbonisation, the energy transition and the hydrogen economy are challenges to which we have a lot to contribute, as we have unrivalled experience and the best possible team of professionals.\n\nWe are very pleased with the progress made in 2023 with our Transformation Plan, which we put in place to facilitate the challenges ahead of us through digitalisation, agility and new ways of working. We have also launched transformative initiatives like the Ingenia Energy Challenge, our call to find disruptive projects that contribute to accelerating the energy transition.\n\nThe designation of Enagás as a provisional HTNO by Royal Decree-Law 8/2023 is a huge responsibility and a great opportunity for the company's future growth built around renewable hydrogen. Our goal is always to create maximum value for society and for our shareholders, to whom I am especially grateful for their confidence in the company's vision and management. Rest assured that our top priority is to create sustainable value for you.\n\nMy thanks also go to all Enagás professionals for the great work they are doing and to the members of the Board of Directors for their support and magnificent work.\n\nLastly, I would like to mention that the Enagás Board of Directors has approved this Annual Report, which represents the renewal of our commitment to the ten principles of the Global Compact, and at the same time, reflects our contribution to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n[GRI 2-14, GRI 2-22]\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-3-0)\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/8 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Additionally, Royal Decree-Law 8/2023 of December 27 establishes that Enagás, as the hydrogen transmission network operator (in accordance with the provisions of Article 63 bis of Law 34/1998 of October 7 on the hydrocarbons sector), may operate as the provisional hydrogen transmission network operator. [GRI 2-6]\n\nEnergy infrastructures are a core element in the energy transition towards decarbonisation. Natural gas and renewable gases, mainly renewable hydrogen, will also be very important vectors for decarbonisation, especially in sectors where industrial electrification is difficult.\n\nAt Enagás we provide our experience to offer new energy solutions that contribute to a low-carbon economy: renewable hydrogen and biomethane (see the '[Renewable gases](#page-25-0)' sub-section within '[Our](#page-16-0)  [commitment to the energy transition](#page-16-0)' chapter.\n\n## **Energy infrastructures are a core element in the energy transition towards decarbonisation**\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  **Our business** [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  **model** [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Management](#page-53-0)\n\nKey indicators Appe\n\nAnnual Accounts\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/5 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

It begins with the extraction of natural gas from a gasfield, followed by liquefaction, where the gas is cooled to -160°C to reduce its volume for transmission. LNG is then transported in methane tankers from the country of origin to the destination country via LNG maritime transport. Tanker offloading/loading occurs at the LNG terminal, where LNG is offloaded from the tanker and loaded onto the tanker. The LNG terminal returns the gas to its original gaseous state. Truck loading involves loading LNG onto tank trucks. The diagram also shows the demand for electricity generation. Natural gas transmission involves transmitting natural gas through the high-pressure network. Distribution to customers involves distributing natural gas to end customers for consumption.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a curved line in a light green color, forming a semi-circle shape.\n\n# Strategy\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n## New energy paradigm\n\n## Business context\n\nMore than a year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, 2023 has been characterised by a reduction in energy prices, particularly for natural gas. The average spot price in Europe was around €40/ MWh in 2023, compared to the average price in 2022, which was around €120/MWh.\n\nDespite this price reduction, markets have remained tense and volatile due to situations that have led to one-off reductions in supply, such as labour strikes at liquefaction pants in Australia; geopolitical factors, such as the risk of a prolonged conflict between Israel and Palestine; and the fear of a blockade in the Suez Canal due to the intensification of attacks by Houthi militants in the Red Sea area.\n\nWith regard to the structure of natural gas supplies in the European Union, it should be noted that imports of Russian gas continued to fall during 2023. Specifically, Russia supplied the European Union with a total of 46 bcm of natural gas, of which 27 bcm was supplied by pipeline (17% of total imports) and 20 bcm as LNG (liquefied natural gas) (14% of total LNG imports), representing a 45% decrease compared to total imports in 2022.\n\nIn this context, security of supply in the European Union was guaranteed thanks, to a large extent, to the increase in LNG imports from other origins, such as the United States. In 2023, 45% of the LNG received by the European Union was supplied by the United States, which represents an increase of more than 13% compared to 2022, highlighting the key role of LNG terminals as a guarantor of security of supply.\n\nThis important role for LNG terminals has been corroborated by the signing of more than 90 bcm of new LNG contracts worldwide by 2023, most of them long-term, of which more than 20 bcm are located in the European Union. To this should be added the more than 250 bcm of regasification projects under construction globally, of which 60 bcm are located in the European Union.\n\nThe start-up of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal in the summer of 2023, as part of the Spanish Government's 'More Energy Security' Plan, has strengthened the place of the Spanish Gas System as a key player in guaranteeing security of supply in Europe. This is evidenced by the fact that Spain was the nonproducing country that re-exported the most LNG in the world during 2023, with 22.1 TWh.\n\nOn the other hand, the demand for natural gas in Spain decreased by 11% compared to 2022, mainly due to lower residential and commercial demand because of the effect of more moderate temperatures, as well as lower demand for gas for electricity generation as a result of higher hydropower and renewable generation. However, industrial gas demand showed signs of recovery after last year's energy crisis, with an increase of almost 4%, mainly concentrated in the refining sector and chemical industry. In addition, exports of natural gas from Spain to Europe by pipeline through France - via the Irún and Larrau interconnections - increased by 6.1% to 37.5 TWh, helping boost the security of the European energy supply.\n\n2023 was also marked by the updating of the draft 2030 National Energy and Climate Plans, which have highlighted the key role of natural gas in the decarbonisation and energy transition process, as well as the deployment of renewable gases - in particular, of green hydrogen - as a particularly significant decarbonisation vector in those industrial sectors that are most difficult to electrify and as a common element across the three pillars of energy policy: security of supply, decarbonisation and price. In Spain, the updated draft National Energy and Climate Plan gave a boost to hydrogen development, with the inclusion of a target of 11 GW of installed capacity in electrolysers by 2030. Furthermore, the H2med project is mentioned, which will allow to turn Spain into the first renewable hydrogen hub worldwide. It will include the first axes of the national backbone network that will connect green hydrogen production centres with domestic demand and the two international interconnections with France and Portugal.\n\nWithin this fundamental role for renewable hydrogen in the decarbonisation of the global and European energy system, very significant milestones were reached in 2023 that constitute a boost for hydrogen development and consolidate Spain's role as a key player.\n\n**Enagás will play a key role, in collaboration with other European TSOs, in the integration of the European energy system** \n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/18/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in grey font on the left side of the image. On the right side of the image is a logo with the letters \"en\" in blue and green.\n\n#### Global milestones:\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nBetween November 30 and December 12, the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) took place in Dubai, where the first stocktake of progress on climate action (Global Stocktake, GST) was signed, recognising the role of transition fuels, including natural gas, and their contribution to the energy transition as a key element in ensuring energy security.\n\nAmong the main agreements reached at the summit were the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030; the progressive reduction of coal use that lacks emission mitigation measures; the deployment of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, particularly significant in sectors that are difficult to decarbonise; and the development of carbon capture, transport and storage.\n\n#### European milestones:\n\n- October: presentation in Berlin of the H2med project, with the participation of representatives from the governments and TSOs of Germany, France, Portugal and Spain, who showed their support for the development of H2med as a great green corridor that will connect the Iberian Peninsula with north-western Europe, enabling the transport of renewable hydrogen from production areas to the areas of greatest consumption through the associated national hydrogen backbones.\n- Inclusion of H2med and the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network in the European Commission's list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI) in November, which will be presented to the Council and the European Parliament for approval at the beginning of 2024; this represents an important step forward in the promotion of these projects.\n- Provisional agreement between the European Parliament and the European Council on the European Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Package, which will act as a catalyst for the deployment of renewable and low-carbon gases, including hydrogen, in Europe. All through the lens of ensuring security of supply and energy affordability. This package, among other measures, includes rules for the development of the European hydrogen market and a new governance structure in the form of the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH) to promote dedicated hydrogen infrastructure. It also strengthens the long-term planning of the infrastructure needed for a decarbonised gas sector in Europe.\n\n#### Milestones in Spain:\n\n- Enagás' September launch of the non-binding Call for Interest consultation process for the first axes of the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network. This process closed in November; more than 200 companies participated, showing the enormous interest aroused.\n- Publication of Royal Decree-Law 8/2023, which included the designation of Enagás as the provisional manager of the Hydrogen Backbone network (HTNO) in Spain and entrusted it with the preparation of a proposal for the development of the hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon.\n\n## Regulatory vision to 2030\n\nIn Spain, the 2021-2026 regulatory framework is stable and transparent, and establishes a period of six-years without intermediate revision. This framework supports climate and energy targets by establishing incentives to keep the gas system infrastructure available, and to fulfil the role assigned by the Spanish National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan for natural gas and renewable gases in the energy transition process. This shows that the use of existing gas infrastructure is essential if advances are to be made in energy transition at the lowest cost.\n\nIn 2023, very significant regulatory actions were taken to accelerate the energy transition and highlight the key role of Enagás' infrastructures for Europe's energy security, which will serve to maintain regulatory stability and anticipate the new energy model:\n\n- On the one hand, after having agreed on the final texts of the European Directives and Regulations on the internal markets for natural gas, renewable gases and hydrogen, which will be formally approved during the first half of 2024, the process of transposition into Spanish law will begin. This will be done through an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law, with a maximum of two years to do so.\n- Likewise, through Royal Decree 8/2023 of December 27, which adopts measures to deal with the economic and social consequences of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as to alleviate the effects of the drought:\n\t- Enagás is provisionally designated as the Hydrogen Network Operator (HTNO).\n\t- It is also tasked with presenting a development proposal for hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon.\n- This will lay the foundations for a stable regulatory framework for the new natural gas period as well as for the new renewable gas networks, especially hydrogen, which will begin in 2027, by making the most of the natural gas infrastructures, their subsequent adaptation to hydrogen and the new hydrogen infrastructures. This will make possible:\n- Enagás' transition from interim hydrogen network operator to a certified hydrogen network operator.\n- The completion of hydrogen networks in Spain and their integration with the European market, commissioning Enagás to start work and build hydrogen backbone infrastructure.\n- The ensuring of adequate return on investment and profitability in both natural gas and hydrogen networks.\n- Temporary coexistence of natural gas and hydrogen networks.\n- A framework for the development of research work on saline storages for hydrogen.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nur business\nodel\nOur\nthe\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  **Our commitment to**  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/7 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enagas.

To this end, it has outlined a decarbonisation pathway with emission reduction targets by 2026, 2030 and 2040 aligned with the 1.5ºC temperature increase scenario.\n\n#### Update of Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets (t CO2e)\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/13 description: This image shows a bar chart with the years 2014, 2023, 2026, 2030, and 2040 on the x-axis. The y-axis shows the values 571,033, 294,649, 202,359, 151,160, and 23,162. The bar chart shows a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2040. The values above the bars are -48%, -65%, -74%, and -96%.\n\n(1) Carbon neutrality will be achieved in 2040 with 23,162 tonnes of CO2e offset by nature-based solutions projects (reforestation).\n\nIn 2023, Enagás remained on track to meet its emissions reduction targets, having achieved a 48% reduction compared to 2014.\n\nThe Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction targets include the Global Methane Alliance methane emissions reduction commitment, which will reduce methane emissions from our business by 45% by 2025 and 60% by 2030, compared to 2015 levels.\n\nIn addition, we held to our emissions reduction targets linked to variable remuneration (see the '[Targets linked to variable](#page-21-0)  [remuneration](#page-21-0)' sub-section), including the emissions reduction targets in both the annual Target Management Programme and the Long-Term Incentive Plan. Enagás' target is to reduce its emissions by 5% in 2024, a target included in the annual target management programme and therefore linked to variable remuneration.\n\nIn addition, the company has set the following targets for the reduction of its indirect Scope 3 emissions:\n\n#### Indirect emissions reduction targets (scope 3) (t  $CO\\_2e$ ) (1)\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/20 description: The image is a bar graph showing the values 825,211 in 2021, 723,986 in 2023, 618,908 in 2030, and 412,605 in 2040.

The value in 2040 is 50% less than the value in 2030.\n\n(1) Targets corresponding to 100% of indirect Scope 3 emissions, the most significant of which include emissions derived from natural gas flowing on and off our infrastructure network, emissions from our affiliates and our main suppliers (GHG Protocol categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15).\n\nIn 2023, Enagás reduced its Scope 3 emissions by 12% compared to the base year 2021, thus moving towards the decarbonisation of its value chain and in line with the targets set.\n\nThese targets reinforce the commitments adopted through its adherence to various international climate action initiatives:\n\n- Science Based Targets<sup>3</sup>: we are committed to setting out targets based in science.\n- We Mean Business: we are committed to driving policies towards a low-carbon economy, setting a carbon price and reporting climate change information in corporate publications.\n- Global Methane Alliance: we are committed to reducing methane emissions from our activity by 45% by 2025 and 60% by 2030 with respect to 2015 figures.\n- Methane Guiding Principles: we have signed up to commitments on methane emissions reduction and transparency.\n- Oil & Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP 2.0): we have joined the reporting framework initiative aimed at improving the quantification and reduction of methane emissions.\n\n<sup>3</sup> At the time of writing, SBTi has not yet defined a methodology for the Oil&Gas sector covering Enagás' midstream activities. However, Enagás incorporates SBTi's main recommendations in its target-setting methodology.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**Our commitment to** [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  **the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in blue, with a green arc above it.\n\n## Decarbonisation of our operations\n\nIn order to meet the carbon neutrality and scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets established in the decarbonisation pathway, Enagás is applying the mitigation hierarchy by implementing specific actions that the company has identified and planned as part of its Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan.\n\nIn this regard, Enagás is working on a plan to electrify turbocompressors in compressor stations and underground storage facilities by 2040. This plan is reviewed and updated in line with the operating context (see the '[New energy paradigm](#page-17-0)' section in this chapter and the ['](#page-60-0)[Climate action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section in the '[Environmental, Social and Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter), taking into account the following premises for facility selection:\n\n- Act on the facilities that are going to be more intensive in operation (higher CO<sup>2</sup> emissions).\n- Make the most of the useful remunerative life of the facilities.\n- Match interventions to the need for maintenance development to minimise costs.\n- Act on facilities with restrictions, either due to atmospheric emissions (NO<sup>x</sup> emission limits) or due to operational problems which could compromise their operation.\n- Have H2-ready facilities distributed along the main axes of the Gas System.\n\nThis plan foresees the electrification of 14 turbocompressors in the 2023-2031 period. In 2023, the first two electric engines have been deployed, with more to follow in subsequent years until the plan is completed in 2031.\n\nOnce the maximum technically possible reduction has been achieved at the facility level, with the above measures and those included annually in the Enagás Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan, the subsequent neutralisation and compensation of residual emissions will be addressed. For this, carbon capture and storage solutions are being studied, as well as alternatives to reach carbon neutrality in the points where the previous options are not possible and/or profitable (offsetting - reforestation).\n\n## Decarbonisation of our value chain\n\nTo achieve the scope 3 emission reduction targets, namely 25% reduction by 2030 and 50% reduction by 2040 as compared to 2021, Enagás is working to:\n\n- Essentially, in the adaptation of existing infrastructure and the development of new infrastructure for renewable gases. In addition, through its subsidiary Enagás Renovable, it promotes renewable gas production projects (see subsection '[Renewable](#page-25-0)  [gases](#page-25-0)' in this chapter).\n- Promoting new uses for natural gas in mobility, mainly in maritime and rail transport (see the '[Sustainable Mobility](#page-30-0)' sub-section in this chapter).\n- Collaboration with the company's affiliates (see the '[Affiliates](#page-142-0)' section in the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter), supply chain (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)' section in the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter) and companies and sectoral associations in the field of decarbonisation (see the ['](#page-60-0)[Climate action and energy](#page-60-0)  [efficiency](#page-60-0)' section of the '[Environmental, Social and Governance](#page-53-0)  [\\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).

These axes reinforce Europe's renewable energy and energy efficiency while allowing new infrastructure developments to be driven forward to integrate EU markets.\n\nSpain occupies a privileged position thanks to its geographical location and its consolidated network of infrastructures and international connections. It is poised to become a leading country for the production and export of non-electrical renewable energies (hydrogen and biomethane), indispensable energy carriers that contribute to the development of a circular economy and to the energy transition process, as they enable progress towards a carbonneutral economy.\n\nRenewable hydrogen, which is obtained from electrical renewable energy, is an energy carrier for the future and a key solution for storing renewable energy. It also has multiple applications, as it can be used in all energy sectors (industry, mobility, domesticcommercial and electricity generation).\n\nBiogas obtained from waste is a source of renewable, local and storable energy, with a positive impact on employment and the rural economy. After a process of cleaning and CO2, separation, the biogas transforms into biomethane: a totally renewable gas, of equivalent quality to natural gas, that can be injected into the transmission network.\n\nAt Enagás, we want to actively contribute to the energy transition process, promoting the integration of renewable gases in the Spanish and European Gas System.\n\nSee Enagás' explanatory videos on **[Biogas](https://youtu.be/AMMLKHCJxfM?feature=shared)** and **[Renewable](https://youtu.be/HicKLqqSOvY?feature=shared)  [hydrogen](https://youtu.be/HicKLqqSOvY?feature=shared)**.\n\nImage /page/25/Figure/16 description: The image shows a circular diagram illustrating the concept of a circular economy.

Electrical energy from renewable sources is used to produce hydrogen (H2). The hydrogen can then be used for direct use, injection into pipelines, mobility, power generation, industry, and tertiary/domestic use.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/26/Figure/0 description: This image shows a timeline of renewable hydrogen infrastructures. The timeline starts in January and ends in December. The two most important milestones for renewable hydrogen infrastructure in 2023 are described below. [GRI 201-2, GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2]. January 19: First Enagás Hydrogen Day. January 24: Launch of the Guarantees of Origin platform for renewable gases. June 28: Update of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC). September 14: Launch of the Call for Interest process. October 18: H2med presentation in Berlin. November 28: European Projects of Common Interest (PCI) List: inclusion of H2med. December 8: European H₂ and Decarbonised Gas Regulation agreement. December 27: Royal Decree-Law 8/2023 of December 27: Enagás, interim operator.\n\nIn fact, Enagás is one of the 31 European gas infrastructure operators driving the European Hydrogen Backbone for the development of a dedicated hydrogen transmission infrastructure.\n\nAs a leading TSO in Europe, Enagás can and must be a key player in the decarbonisation process and contribute its experience and knowledge to the adaptation of existing infrastructures and the\n\nEnagás, interim operator of the hydrogen\n\nbackbone network\n\ndevelopment of new ones.\n\n**and Spanish H<sup>2</sup> Infrastructure 2030 H2 and Decarbonised Gas Directive agreement** \n\nIn line with this purpose, in April 2022, Enagás set up the subsidiary 'Enagás Infraestructuras de Hidrógeno' (Enagás Hydrogen Infrastructures), through which the company is spinning off its functions as a natural gas infrastructure operator (TSO) for the possible future management of hydrogen infrastructures. Its objective is the development, construction and operation of infrastructures to meet the need for hydrogen transmission and storage, in line with national and European legislation, plans and roadmaps.\n\nOn December 28, 2023, Royal Decree-Law 8/2023 of December 27 was published in the Official State Gazette (BOE), providing that Enagás, as manager of the natural gas<sup>4</sup> transmission network, may operate as provisional manager of the hydrogen backbone network, enabling it to:\n\n• Submit to the Directorate General of Energy Policy and Mines, within four months, a non-binding proposal for the development of the hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon (April 29).\n\n• Act as representatives in the creation of the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH).\n\nof the hydrogen backbone network\n\n• To be able to exercise the functions of hydrogen backbone development within the sphere of European Projects of Common Interest (PCI), on a provisional basis, through horizontally separate legal entities.\n\nThis provisional regime will apply until the definitive designation of the Hydrogen Network Operators in accordance with the conditions established in the applicable European regulations.\n\n### H2med and the Spanish Backbone Network, included on the European Commission's PCI list\n\nIn November 2023, the European Commission adopted the Delegated Act on Projects of Common Interest (PCI). This includes the H2med corridor, the first axes of the associated Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network and two underground hydrogen storage facilities. Their inclusion on the list of PCIs, which will be submitted to the European Parliament and Council for approval in early 2024, represents an important step forward in the promotion of these projects.\n\nH2med was presented in Alicante at the Euromed summit on December 9, 2022 by the governments of Portugal, Spain and France, with the support of the President of the European\n\n<sup>4</sup> In accordance with the provisions of Article 63 bis of Law 34/1998, of October 7, on the hydrocarbon sector.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**Our commitment to** [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) **the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/27/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enaga\" with a green and blue circular logo on the right.\n\nCommission, Ursula von der Leyen. In January 2023, the support of Germany was added. Following this initial push, the TSOs of Portugal, Spain, France and Germany presented the project at an event in Berlin on October 18, where the support of the governments of these four countries and that of the European Commission was ratified, as well as that of industry and the main sector players in Germany.\n\nThe H2med corridor consists of a connection between Celorico da Beira in Portugal and Zamora in Spain (CelZa) and a maritime\n\nconnection between Barcelona and Marseille (BarMar). With a planned combined investment of around 2.5 billion euros, CelZa will\n\nhave a maximum capacity of 0.75 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen, a length of 248 km and a 24.6 MW compressor station in Zamora. BarMar will have a maximum capacity of 2 million tonnes, a length of 455 km and a 140 MW compressor station in Barcelona.\n\nImage /page/27/Figure/11 description: This image shows a map of the European Vision of Hydrogen Network 2030. The map includes the Spanish hydrogen infrastructure 2030, which is presented to the PCI, and underground storage facilities. The map also includes the following locations: H2Med-CelZa, Portuguese Hydrogen Backbone, DHUNE, MosaHyc, WHHYN, Connection to main demand centers in Germany, HY-FEN, RHYn, HySoW, Hynframed, H2Med-BarMar, and H2ercules Network South.\n\nThe first sections of the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network presented as PCI are the Vía de la Plata axis with its connection to the Puertollano Hydrogen Valley - totalling a planned length of approximately 1,250 km - and the axis that includes the Cantabrian Coast, Ebro Valley and Levante axes, which are around 1,500 km in total and the Guitiriz-Zamora axis. Also included are two underground hydrogen storage facilities in Cantabria and the Basque Country, located in new salt cavities, with a planned capacity of 335 and 240 GWh, respectively.\n\nThe inclusion of the H2med corridor, the Spanish Hydrogen Backbone Network and the two underground hydrogen storage facilities on the list of PCIs - once it passes the European Parliament and Council - will help to advance the fulfilment of the RePowerEU Plan to achieve the European and Spanish objectives of energy independence, industrial competitiveness and decarbonisation.\n\n### **Estimated investments**\n\nThe Spanish hydrogen infrastructure submitted as a PCI would involve a total gross investment of 4.9 billion euros. Spain's total gross investment in H2med will be around 1 billion euros. These investments will be finalised in accordance with the binding planning to be defined by the Spanish Government.\n\n#### **Socio-economic impact of renewable hydrogen infrastructures**\n\nThe construction and subsequent operation of these infrastructures will generate a significant positive impact on the Spanish economy and society.\n\nIn terms of GDP, the construction and operation of H2med and the Spanish Backbone Network would generate an impact of up to 4.8 billion euros. Likewise, construction alone would have an impact on employment equivalent to 3.7% of the net jobs\n\n[GRI 201-2, GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2]\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/28/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light gray font.

This process also included public consultation on ammonia, oxygen and CO2.\n\nThe process, which has been audited and verified by Bureau Veritas, had the support and participation of key actors in the sector, with more than 200 companies (producers, consumers and/or shippers) and 650 registered projects.\n\nThe main objective of the process was to contrast the theoretical analysis carried out at the end of 2022 with real market information, so that the preliminary infrastructure proposal presented at the first Enagás Hydrogen Day could be adapted based on the real needs found.\n\nTaking into account the information received, the identified domestic demand (≈ 1.3 Mt in 2030) would be in line with that indicated on First Enagás Hydrogen Day, far exceeding the 500-600,000 t/y of current grey hydrogen consumption. This indicates new uses for green hydrogen.\n\nMoreover, the production capacity identified (more than double the potential announced on First Enagás Hydrogen Day) is more than sufficient both to meet domestic demand and to enable export by H2med and carriers. Spain is thus positioned as a major producer of green hydrogen with the capacity to export to other countries and with a key role in achieving the European consumption target of 20 million tonnes of hydrogen in 2030 established in REPowerEU, of which 10 million tonnes would be produced in Europe.\n\nThe matching of supply and demand identified in this Call for Interest process confirms the infrastructures proposed in the First Enagás Hydrogen Day and submitted to the European Commission's call for PCIs: the Cantabrian Coast Axis, Ebro Valley Axis, Levante Axis, Vía de la Plata Axis (with its connection to the Puertollano Hydrogen Valley), the Guitiriz-Zamora Axis, and two underground hydrogen storage facilities in Cantabria and the Basque Country.\n\n## **The matching of supply and demand identified in the Call for Interest process backs up the infrastructures submitted to the European Commission's call for PCI proposal**\n\nThe results have also made it possible to identify new areas for demand and production aggregation; these will be assessed based on the real needs found.\n\nLikewise, the key role that storage facilities must play in order to guarantee proper system operation and demand coverage continues to be highlighted. This is why work continues on identifying possible geological structures that allow for the seasonal underground storage of this new energy carrier and on developing a roadmap to ensure that these infrastructures are viable.\n\n#### **Results regarding ammonia and CO<sup>2</sup>**\n\nThe Call For Interest has also noted industry interest in producing more than 5 Mt/y of ammonia (NH3), which implies an approximate consumption of 0.9 Mt/y of hydrogen. In addition, 41 companies have expressed interest in the use of infrastructure to transport about 4 Mt/y of ammonia.\n\nLikewise, the data obtained show that a total of 37 companies are interested in CO2 capture (it is estimated that they are interested in capturing 10.4 Mt/y), and 53 in having infrastructures for its transport and storage.\n\n## Management of the system of guarantees of origin of renewable gases\n\nEnagás GTS, as the responsible entity designated by the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, has launched the new System of Guarantees of Origin of gas from renewable sources. In compliance with the milestones established by the Spanish Government in applicable regulations, the system already allows for the certification of biogas, biomethane and hydrogen produced in Spain as being of renewable origin, providing information on how and where it was produced.\n\nFurthermore, also in compliance with regulatory provisions, Enagás GTS has set up a Committee of Subjects of the Guarantees of Origin System. The aim of this committee is to know and be informed of the functioning and management of the System of Guarantees of Origin, as well as to elaborate and provide a channel for improvement proposals.\n\nIn the first year of operation of the System of Guarantees of Origin, a total of 129 entities - including producers, suppliers and intermediaries - have registered and are now able to issue, transfer and redeem Guarantees of Origin. Likewise, 33 production facilities have completed their registration with the system, 13 of them definitively (already in operation with access to issue Guarantees of Origin) and 20 provisionally (not yet operational).

Below the word \"enagas\" is a stylized blue shape that resembles a flame or a drop of liquid.\n\n## Sustainable mobility\n\n[GRI 203-1, GRI 203-2]\n\nEnagás is committed to decarbonising transport by promoting the use of natural gas and renewable gases in mobility.\n\nNatural gas plays a highly relevant role in ensuring security of supply and competitiveness, while meeting the energy requirements of highly demanding sectors, such as intensive industry or segments that are difficult to electrify, where there are currently no solutions that can meet the requirements of the majority of users. In the field of heavy and maritime transport, natural gas is positioning itself as one of the most sustainable and realistic fuels in the short-term, key to reducing emissions and immediately improving air quality.\n\nThe use of natural gas as a fuel for transport would allow for NOx emissions to be reduced by 80-90%, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions to be reduced by 20-30% and SOX emissions and particles by practically 100% compared to traditional fuels. This makes natural gas a sustainable alternative for mobility and heavy, maritime and rail transport.\n\nIts contribution is particularly important in the case of maritime transport, as it allows vessels to adhere to new environmental regulations set forth by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and European Directive 2016/802.\n\nAs part of its commitment to innovation, Enagás has made technical adaptations to its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals which are now ready to offer new services related to the role of gas as a fuel, such as bunkering (supplying fuel for ships). In addition, we are promoting these new uses through our coordination in projects such as 'CORE LNGas hive' and 'LNGhive2', as well as through our participation in other projects with European CEF funds in the road and railway field, such as the ECO-net and RAILNG projects. .\n\n**Renewable hydrogen is a new energy carrier that offers countless possibilities for energy consumption, storage and mobility**  The European Union allocates around 45 million euros to the CORE LNGas hive and LNGhive2 projects, which Enagás is driving through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which promotes more sustainable and efficient transport.\n\nAmong other projects, the European Commission supports with 20 million euros the development of two new projects for the supply of LNG (liquefied natural gas) to ships (bunkering) in the ports of Barcelona and Algeciras, coordinated by Enagás and developed by its subsidiary Scale Gas. These projects are part of the 'LNGhive2' institutional strategy, managed by Puertos del Estado, aimed at promoting the development of the LNG market as marine fuel and to ensure supply in ports, in compliance with European Directive 2014/94 on alternative fuels.\n\nIn the railway sector, Enagás was one of the companies to participate in the first pilot test in Europe for railway traction using LNG. In addition, as part of the implementation of the Railway Roadmap set out with Renfe, it is working with all segments of rail traction to retrofit diesel vehicles for natural gas in business areas where electrification would be unprofitable.\n\nEnagás, together with Renfe and several partners, is currently working on the 'Dual mode H2 Train' project to introduce fuel cells for rail traction, as well as in the supply chain.\n\nRenewable hydrogen is a new energy carrier that offers countless possibilities for energy consumption, storage and mobility. It is a real, clean and sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources and therefore, using it as a vehicle fuel also helps towards sustainable mobility.\n\nWithin the terrestrial field, the start-up 'Scale Gas' (see the '[Corporate](#page-49-0)  [innovation and technology](#page-49-0)' sub-section in this chapter) is participating in the EU-supported project 'ECO-net', for the construction of 15 LNG supply points integrated into the existing traditional fuel supply network, with the aim of integrating natural gas as another fuel in the energy mix. In addition, in 2021, Scale Gas unveiled the first hydrogen refuelling station in Spain in Madrid. It has a supply capacity of 700 bar and is currently supplying hydrogen to a range of users, including heavy-duty VTC vehicles.

From 2019, the price of the syndicated loan has been linked to meeting the company's CO2 emission reduction targets.\n\nIn 2022, this loan was renewed, for which the emission reduction targets linked to the credit were revised and extended (changes validated through a Second Party Opinion):\n\n- The 2025 targets have been revised in line with the new operating context brought about by the energy crisis (see the '[Climate](#page-60-0)  [action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section in the '[Environmental,](#page-53-0)  [Social and Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).\n- Targets have been added to 2026 and 2027, in line with the objectives of the company's 2030 Strategic Plan (see the '[2030](#page-19-0)  [Strategic Plan](#page-19-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Scope 3 emission reduction targets have been added in line with the targets set by the company for 2030 and 2040 (see the '[Targets and roadmap to decarbonisation](#page-23-0)' section in this chapter).\n\nIn this regard, Enagás has signed the extension of the maturity of this syndicated credit line of 1,550 million euros until 2028 with 12 financial institutions, maintaining its commitment to link the economic conditions to compliance with environmental indicators for the reduction of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, in line with the targets and roadmap to decarbonisation (see the '[Targets and roadmap to](#page-23-0)  [decarbonisation](#page-23-0)' section in this chapter).\n\n## European Sustainable Activities Taxonomy\n\nIn the framework of the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities was developed (Regulation 2020/852 and associated legislation<sup>5</sup>). It aims to establish criteria for determining whether an activity is considered environmentally sustainable for the purpose of determining the degree of environmental sustainability of an investment and to facilitate the use of a common concept of socially sustainable investment by Member States and the European Union.\n\nIn the various associated Delegated Regulations, technical selection criteria have been established to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to contribute substantially to environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, adaptation to climate change, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and control of pollution, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission has published several communications on the interpretation of the legal provisions (FAQs) included in the delegated regulations, which have contributed to the interpretation of the implementing legislation. However, the current regulatory framework is under development, which implies a continuous review of the criteria and methodologies established by the company to respond to the established requirements.\n\n### Eligibility and alignment concepts\n\nAn activity is considered eligible when it has the potential to substantially contribute to the corresponding environmental target, while an activity is considered aligned when it additionally meets the criteria of substantial contribution, do no significant harm (DNSH) and the minimum social safeguards set out in the taxonomy regulation, which ensure that the activity is carried out in compliance with characteristics that ensure a contribution to the environmental targets set by the European Union.\n\n#### Assessment of the eligibility of Enagás' activities\n\nSince 2021, Enagás has been assessing the eligibility of its activities regarding the mitigation and adaptation to climate change objectives, and in line with the reporting requirements, in 2023, Enagás also assessed the eligibility of its activities regarding the other four environmental objectives.\n\nAs a result of this assessment, Enagás has identified eligible activities that have the potential to contribute to two of the environmental objectives covered by the EU Taxonomy:\n\n#### **Climate change mitigation and adaptation**\n\nThey correspond to activities associated with the area of renewable gases: mainly the adaptation of infrastructure to be able to transport these renewable gases, to the construction of hydrogen transport and distribution pipelines and hydrogen storage (see the '[Our](#page-16-0)  [commitment to the energy transition](#page-16-0)' chapter).\n\n**• Activity 4.14 CCM. Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases:** Enagás, an independent European TSO, is an international benchmark in the development and maintenance of gas infrastructures and the operation and management of gas networks. In addition, as of December 2023, Enagás has been appointed as the provisional manager of the Hydrogen Backbone network (HTNO) in Spain. It has been entrusted with the preparation of a proposal for the development of the hydrogen backbone infrastructure with a ten-year horizon.\n\nFor all these reasons, and in line with one of the growth axes of the 2030 Strategic Plan, Enagás is working on the renewal of gas transmission and distribution infrastructures to promote the integration of hydrogen and other low-carbon gases and on the construction of new transmission and distribution networks for hydrogen and other low-carbon gases.\n\n<sup>5</sup> [Regulation \\(EU\\) 2021/2139](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2139), [Delegated Regulation \\(EU\\) 2021/2178,](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2178) [Delegated Regulation \\(EU\\) 2022/1214](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1214), [Delegated Regulation \\(EU\\) 2023/2485](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302485) and [Delegated](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302486)  [Regulation \\(EU\\) 2023/2486](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302486).\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n**Our commitment to** [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  **[the energy transition](#page-16-0)** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/32/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a blue sans-serif font, with a stylized blue and green circular graphic above the text. The graphic appears to be a stylized representation of a gas molecule or a circular flow.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nIn 2023, Enagás modified its eligibility criteria, in line with those used in the 2021 report, to a more conservative approach; instead of considering all concepts associated with projects on the gas transmission network as eligible due to their potential for future reconversion, only concepts associated with projects for the construction of new hydrogen and low-carbon gas transmission infrastructure will be considered eligible, as will the conversion and reconversion of existing infrastructure to be able to transport renewable gases. In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 in the reporting tables. [GRI 2-4]\n\n**• Activity 4.12 CCM. Storage of hydrogen:** Enagás has three underground natural gas storage facilities. In line with one of the growth axes of the 2030 Strategic Plan, Enagás is currently working on the conversion of these infrastructures into hydrogen storage facilities and the construction of new facilities.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás modified its eligibility criteria, in line with those used in the 2021 report, to a more conservative approach; instead of considering all concepts associated with projects on the gas transmission network as eligible due to their potential for future reconversion, only concepts associated with projects for the construction of new hydrogen storage infrastructure will be considered eligible, as will the conversion of existing infrastructure to be able to storage hydrogen. In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomyaligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 in the reporting tables. [GRI 2-4]\n\n- **• Activity 6.15 CCM. Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport:** Enagás' subsidiary ScaleGas has a 700 bar HRS (Hydrogen Refuelling Station) with the capacity to supply hydrogen-powered electric vehicles in Madrid (Spain). This activity is eligible, as the hydrogen refuelling station is considered to be an infrastructure for the circulation of vehicles with zero CO<sup>2</sup> exhaust emissions.\n- **• Activity 4.1 CCM. Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology:** Enagás considers eligible projects aimed at generating electricity through photovoltaic panels for self-consumption at some of its facilities, thus improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n- **• Activity 3.10 CCM. Manufacture of hydrogen:** Enagás considers as eligible the renewable hydrogen manufacture projects for selfconsumption that it develops at some of its facilities, thus enabling the improvement of energy efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n- **• Activity 7.4 CCM. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings):** Enagás considers projects to install charging stations for electric vehicles in its facilities' parking spaces to be eligible.\n\n**• Activity 8.1 CCM. Data processing, hosting and related activities:** Enagás considers projects for the renovation of storage arrays at Enagás' data centres to be eligible.\n\n#### **Transition to a circular economy**\n\n**• Activity 3.3 EC. Demolition and wrecking of buildings and other structures:** Enagás holds that the project to seal off and permanently abandon the Castor underground gas storage wells is eligible, as it forms part of the above-mentioned underground storage dismantling project. All of the above is in accordance with the 'demolition of wells and boreholes' activity included in the description of the activity. Although this infrastructure does not form part of the Enagás Group, the Spanish Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge appointed Enagás Transporte S.A.U. to carry out this activity<sup>6</sup> .\n\nOnce the eligible economic activities were identified, for each of them, the projects implemented during the year were identified.\n\n#### Assessment of the alignment of Enagás' activities\n\nEnagás has assessed the alignment of its activities that contribute to the goal of climate change mitigation. In line with the reporting requirements, in 2024, it will incorporate into this alignment analysis those activities that also contribute to the objective of transitioning to a circular economy.\n\nTo assess alignment, it has been analysed whether eligible projects comply with the criteria of substantial contribution defined in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139: technical selection criteria do not cause significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives and comply with the established minimum social safeguards.\n\nIn order to assess compliance with the requirements set out by the Taxonomy, Enagás has assessed its existing policies, procedures and processes at a corporate level, as well as detailed documentation at project level.\n\nIn assessing the substantial contribution criteria of taxonomy activities aligned with the climate change mitigation objective:\n\n**• In the activities '4.14 CCM.** Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases' and '**4.12 CCM.** Storage of hydrogen', documents such as the technical reports of the projects have been assessed to ensure that the nature of the projects under consideration complies with the nature of the activity itself, which is the main requirement for assessing compliance.\n\n<sup>6</sup> [Resolution of November 6, 2019, of the Secretary of State for Energy, publishing the Agreement of the Council of Ministers of October 31, 2019, which ends the](https://www.boe.es/doue/2022/188/L00001-00045.pdf)  [hibernation of the \"Castor\" underground storage facilities, agreeing to their dismantling and ordering the sealing and definitive abandonment of the wells.](https://www.boe.es/doue/2022/188/L00001-00045.pdf) \n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/33/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the logo for ENA on the right. The ENA logo is a green and blue circle with the letters \"ena\" inside.\n\n- **•** In relation to the projects associated with the **activity '3.10 CCM.**  Manufacture of hydrogen', it should be noted that these consist of hydrogen production for self-consumption. For these projects, the EU Taxonomy regulations requires threshold requirements to ensure greenhouse gas emission reductions. In 2022, the projects were considered taxonomy-aligned because, as they were still in the early stages, requirements had been included in the investment plan to ensure that the design of the hydrogen manufacturing process would meet the thresholds set by the technical criteria to ensure greenhouse gas emission reductions. However, in 2023, these projects are at a more advanced stage; as they have not yet started, it is not possible to verify the fulfilment of the technical criteria. As such, the projects comprising this activity are considered to be non-aligned.\n- **• Activity '4.1 CCM.** Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology' fulfils the criteria, as it is linked to the operation of solar panels to generate electricity for self-consumption.\n- **• The activity '6.15 CCM.** Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport', part of the work of our subsidiary ScaleGas, also meets the criteria, as it is related to enabling hydrogen refuelling stations.\n- **•** Also, **the activity '7.4 CCM**. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings' meets the criteria as well, as it is linked to the installation of charging stations.\n- **•** In relation to the projects of the activity **\"8.1 CCM.** Data processing, hosting and related activities\": it has not been possible to obtain independent third-party verification of whether the project to renovate the storage arrays at Enagás' data centres has applied all pertinent practices to comply with the technical selection criterion of substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. Therefore, the project pertaining to this activity is considered non-aligned.\n\nWith regard to compliance with the criteria of no significant harm to other targets (DNSH), Enagás has an analysis of the physical climate risks of its current infrastructure and has control and management measures in place to mitigate them, thereby complying with the DNSH criterion for the adaptation objective (see the '[Climate action](#page-60-0)  [and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section in the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Managemen](#page-53-0)t' chapter). In relation to other DNSH matters (water and marine resources, circular economy, pollution and biodiversity), although the criteria differ by activity, in general, the company has an ISO 14001-certified environmental management system, takes specific actions in the field of the circular economy, and each project has its own waste management plan, as well as a management model for natural capital and biodiversity. All of this ensures compliance with the requirements of the Taxonomy (see the '[Natural capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section in the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter). In addition, most of the facilities where these projects are taking place have received an Integrated Environmental Authorisation or gone through an Environmental Impact Assessment.\n\nFinally, the taxonomy regulation requires the company to carry out its activities in compliance with Minimum Safeguards in terms of human rights, corruption prevention, proper tax management and respect for fair competition. In this regard, the different mechanisms that the company has in place to ensure compliance with these requirements are described throughout this report (see the '[People](#page-74-0)' '[Ethics and i](#page-118-0)ntegrity' '[Financial and operational excellence](#page-125-0)', and '[Human rights](#page-138-0)' sections in the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).\n\n#### Calculation of key performance indicators\n\nThe identification of the key performance indicators for the projects associated with the taxonomic activities has been carried out after the closure of the annual accounting consolidation. Projects have been identified for accounting purposes by project code, thus eliminating the potential risk of double counting. In the analysis of the Enagás Group's key indicators 'Total (A+B)', transactions between Enagás Group companies have not been considered.\n\nBased on the organisation's existing formal accounting and consolidation procedures, the different economic indicators detailed in the Taxonomy Regulation have been calculated and prepared, taking into account the considerations detailed below.\n\nAs for the denominator, the following information relates to eligibility and alignment.\n\n- **• Turnover:** revenues from regulated and non-regulated activities and other operating revenues of the Enagás Group (See '[Note 2.1.a.](#page-238-0)  [Operating profit, Income](#page-238-0)' of the [Consolidated Annual Accounts](#page-210-0)).\n- **• CapEx:** investments in material and intangible fixed assets of the Enagás Group, discounting the effect of the IFRS16 accounting regulations (sum of the additions of material fixed assets in '[Note](#page-246-0)  [2.4. Property, plant and equipment, Supplementary information](#page-246-0)  [on IFRS16](#page-246-0)' and the additions of intangible fixed assets in '[Note 2.5.](#page-250-0)  [Intangible fixed assets](#page-250-0)', discounting the additions by IFRS16 of '[Note 2.4. Property, plant and equipment, Supplementary](#page-246-0)  [information on IFRS16](#page-246-0)' of the [Consolidated Annual Accounts](#page-210-0)). No business combinations occurred in the two previous years. The variation of more than 150% in CapEx in 2023 compared to the previous year is mainly due to the purchase and sale of Reganosa's gas pipeline network (53.5 million euros) and the acquisition of equipment for current facilities (compressors, climate control equipment, etc.) (23.9 million euros).\n- **• OpEx:** non-capitalised direct costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs and other direct expenses related to the day-to-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment assets by the company or a third party to whom activities are outsourced and that are necessary to ensure the continued effective operation of such assets. Wages and salaries of personnel involved in the maintenance of the facilities related to the identified activities have not been included as it is not possible to separate them at the accounting level.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/34/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a simple, sans-serif font.

All this without taking into account amortisation, depreciation or value adjustments. CapEx is the consolidation of the investments allocated to the projects assessed; it is determined using the company's accounting systems, reflecting the amounts recorded in the investment work orders for the goods and services needed for the projects to achieve their full scope, reducing the figure obtained in the forecast amount for year N-1 and increasing it in the investment forecast for year N, if applicable and provided for.\n- **OpEx:** includes operating expenses associated with economic activities that are taxonomy-aligned, specifically research and development and maintenance expenses. OpEx is the consolidation of operating expenses that meet the criteria set out in applicable regulations, allocated to the projects analysed, and is determined using the company's accounting systems to reflect the amounts recorded in the work orders.\n\nThe criteria applied for each activity are detailed below:\n\n- **Activity 4.14 CCM.

In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 The data reported in 2022 under heading A.2 of not Taxonomy-aligned activities were: Turnover: 57.7% (activity 4.14) and 11.1% (activity 4.12). This change in criteria means that in 2023 no proportion of the financial indicators are not taxonomy-aligned for these two activities.

In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 The data reported in 2022 under heading A.2 of not Taxonomy-aligned activities were: CapEx: 24.5% (activity 4.14) and 18.3% (activity 4.12). This change in criteria means that in 2023 no proportion of the financial indicators are not taxonomy-aligned for these two activities.

In line with this criteria change, the proportion of financial indicators that are Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable activities (not Taxonomy-aligned activities) (A.2) has been recalculated for the year 2022 The data reported in 2022 under heading A.2 of not Taxonomy-aligned activities were: OpEx: 25.1% (activity 4.14) and 16% (activity 4.12). This change in criteria means that in 2023 no proportion of the financial indicators are not taxonomy-aligned for these two activities.\n\n(3) In line with the reporting obligations, in 2023, the alignment with the environmental objectives of sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and control of pollution, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n**Our commitment to** [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) **the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/42/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

This is explained by a significant increase in the Enagás Group's total CapEx (155.4 million euros in 2023 and 58.7 million euros in 2022). This increase in the Group's CapEx is mainly due to the purchase and sale of Reganosa's gas pipeline network (53.5 million euros) and the acquisition of equipment for current facilities (compressors, climate control equipment, etc.) (23.9 million euros).\n\nThe results of the taxonomy analysis reflect the company's potential to contribute to the climate change mitigation objective by transforming its business to align and conform to the taxonomy. In line with the aim of decarbonising the energy system and the company's new strategy, Enagás is investing in assets and projects (CapEx) that enable the transmission and storage of hydrogen through the construction of new infrastructures and the adaptation of existing ones. All this with the aim of generating future income through activities that are taxonomy-aligned. In this respect, according to the financial projections to 2030, 77% of the planned CapEx is aligned with the activities laid out in the taxonomy regulation.\n\n**Enagás is advancing in the development of hydrogen infrastructures and other sustainable activities with a CapEx aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation of 5.7 million euros in 2023, as is 77% of the CapEx planned until 2030**\n\nIn addition, Enagás, through its affiliates over which it has no operational control, has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation through other activities such as:\n\n- **• 'Activity 3.10.** Manufacture of hydrogen' and **'Activity 4.1.**  Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology': Through projects such as Enagás Renovable's Power to Green Hydrogen Mallorca, among others.\n- **• 'Activity 3.1.** Manufacture of renewable energy technologies'. Through start-ups such as DualMetha, Solatom and Trovant.\n\n### Control measures established by Enagás in the framework of the EU Taxonomy Report\n\nIn order to meet all the reporting requirements defined in the Taxonomy Regulation, Enagás has an environmental taxonomy reporting procedure which sets out a methodology for preparing the annual eligibility and alignment exercise through the collection of the necessary information. In this process, and in order to ensure compliance with the disclosure standards, the financial area is mainly involved in extracting the financial information and ensuring its equivalence with the Consolidated Annual Accounts. The infrastructure and sustainability areas are mainly involved in identifying projects and assessing their compliance with the Taxonomy Regulation requirements.\n\nIn addition, the Non-Financial Information Control System covers the reporting cycles for the key performance indicators required by the Taxonomy Regulation that are most relevant to Enagás (CapEx and OpEx). This entails assigning responsibilities in the calculation and reporting of indicators, as well as defining and implementing controls that improve the segregation of duties and reduce the risk of completeness and accuracy of information as well as the risk of non-compliance with regulations.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  the energy transition** [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nAnnual Accounts\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/7 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

We also work on energy efficiency and emissions reduction, promoting, among others, **Targets.** We have set targets for investment in the development of renewable gases and reduction of emissions linked to the variable remuneration of our professionals (see the ['Targets linked to variable](#page-21-0)  **Our contribution commitments and degree of progress**\n\nnatural gas in transport.\n\n[remuneration](#page-21-0)' sub-section in this chapter). We have also set ambitious long-term emission reduction targets that constitute our path towards carbon neutrality in line with the European Union's commitment (see the '[Climate action and energy](#page-60-0)  [efficiency](#page-60-0)' section in the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Management' chapter\\)](#page-53-0).\n\n**Degree of progress and impact.** The energy efficiency measures implemented in recent years enable us to minimise our carbon footprint. We have also contributed to the reduction of third party emissions:\n\n- The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in ships reduces CO<sup>2</sup> emissions by 18%. Within the framework of the LNGasHIVE project (see the ['Sustainable mobility](#page-30-0)' sub-section in this chapter), it is estimated between 2-4 million tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> will be avoided in 2030.\n- The use of natural gas in the rail sector will reduce transport emissions by 20% by recovering traffic from road transport.\n- Enagás also promotes the development of renewable gases, which will contribute to the total decarbonisation of all these uses and increase the economic competitiveness derived from the use of existing infrastructures for hydrogen transmission (see the '[Renewable gases'](#page-25-0) sub-section in this chapter).\n\nImage /page/44/Picture/17 description: The image is a square icon with an orange background.

Its main objective is to drive decarbonisation through technology, digitalisation and innovation. This roadmap, supported by the company's Strategic and Transformation Plans, is led by the Innovation and Corporate Venture Department and is built around five fundamental goals:\n\n- Test and incorporate disruptive technologies and develop new adjacent businesses. To this end, Enagás created the Corporate Entrepreneurship and Open Innovation initiative 'Enagás Emprende', which is structured along the following lines:\n\t- **Corporate entrepreneurship/Venture Building:** development of business projects and ideas based on Enagás' technical, economic and market-related skills.\n\t- **Venture Capital:** investment and support of start-ups, both directly and through investment funds.\n\t- **Open Innovation:** incorporation of projects and technologies supported by capabilities external to Enagás, through origination tools, the entrepreneurial ecosystem, innovation radar and prospecting reports, among other strategies.\n\n'Enagás Emprende' studies and analyses each proposal individually and offers incubation and acceleration programmes tailored to the needs of each project. These can include financial resources, technical pilots, co-development, support in commercial development, or other forms of support.\n\n- Maximise the capture of value from the energy transition investment funds in which Enagás holds a stake, in the form of knowledge and financial returns.\n- Adapt the Enagás Emprende start-up portfolio strategy to the nine priorities of the company's Strategic Plan. This new strategy calls for an update of the investment thesis, geographical focus and target portfolio.\n- Foster public-private collaboration and strategic alliances for the effective development of innovative collaborative projects and optimise their funding pull.\n- Commit to Corporate Innovation and develop innovative and entrepreneurial culture and talent.\n\nEnagás Emprende also promotes and coordinates cross-cutting projects to transform the company in key areas through innovation, such as the Flagship Projects (alliances between several organisations with the aim of promoting new technologies in an area of common interest using open innovation tools and public funding for innovation).\n\n#### 09/2023\n\n**Enagás is once again launching its Ingenia Energy Challenge, an open call for disruptive solutions that contribute to the energy transition.** \n\n**Under the slogan 'Come ride the innovation wave of the energy transition', this year, Enagás is encouraging the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem to participate; the challenge is open to the public, both internal and external. The aim is not only to accelerate technology transfer from universities and laboratories to the market for the reindustrialisation and development of relevant areas, but also to add a new award to boost the visibility of women entrepreneurs.** \n\nImage /page/49/Figure/23 description: The image is a circular diagram illustrating areas of interest.

Both bodies meet at least twice a year.\n\nAt executive level, the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for managing the company's business, and is responsible for driving the company forward and the ongoing coordination of its activities.\n\nUnder the umbrella of the Chief Executive Officer and as a general rule, the Finance Department is responsible for managing financial matters, while the Energy Transition General Management handles climate and environmental matters, and the People and Transformation General Management, social matters.\n\nSee the **[Sustainability and Good Governance Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Sustainability%20and%20good%20governance%20policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n## Sustainable Management Model\n\nImage /page/54/Figure/15 description: The image shows a diagram of a sustainable management plan. The diagram is divided into three sections: Governance Model, Assessment Tools, and Sustainable Management Plan. The Governance Model section lists the involvement of senior management, including the Sustainability and Appointments Committee, the Sustainability Committee, and working groups. It also mentions setting targets linked to variable remuneration. The Assessment Tools section lists ISO Standards for Quality, Health and Safety, Environment, Energy Efficiency, Waste, and Carbon Footprint. It also mentions sustainability indices and rating agency assessments (DJSI) and commitment and relations with stakeholders. The Sustainable Management Plan section includes environmental aspects, governance aspects, and social dimensions. The diagram also includes the phrases \"Involvement of senior management\", \"Innovation and continuous improvement\", \"Performance report\", and \"Improvements identified\".\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[Management](#page-53-0)**\n\nEnvironmental, Social Risk **[and Governance](#page-53-0)**  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/55/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" stacked on top of each other.\n\n![enagas](https://i.imgur.com/9999999.png)\n\n## Commitment to stakeholders\n\nOur commitment to stakeholders is reflected in the company's Sustainability and Good Governance Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, which includes, among other commitments, the establishment of procedures for relationships, dialogue and participation with the local environment that facilitate Enagás' social acceptance and integration in the communities where it operates (see the ['](#page-133-0)[Local communities](#page-133-0)[' section in this chapter\\) and a](#page-133-0)  [commitment to report regularly, transparently, in a timely and](#page-133-0)  [reliable manner to the various stakeholders.

Every year, internal supervisors at Enagás review these groups and their segmentation, the relationship channels with each of them, according to the company's strategy and organisational model. By this means, the stakeholder relationship model is defined: [GRI 2-29, GRI 3-1, GRI 207-3]\n\n## **Our commitment to stakeholders is reflected in the company's Sustainability and Good Governance

The word \"enaga\" is in blue and green and is surrounded by a blue circle.\n\n## Materiality [GRI 3-1, GRI 3-2]\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nEnagás identifies and prioritises material topics in the company's direct operations, according to the level of importance these have for Enagás and its stakeholders. The perspective adopted is that of \"dual materiality\", i.e., the impact on the value of the company and the impact on the environment of each material topic.\n\nThe materiality analysis is based on the company's activities, the strategy and operating context, as well as on the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. All this with a focus on the short, medium and long term, taking into account both own operations and the value chain, and in a manner consistent with the company's risk analysis.\n\nIn addition, Enagás reinforces this dual materiality perspective with reporting based on the GRI standard, to cover the impact on the environment (impact materiality), and with reporting based on the SASB and TCFD standards, to cover the impact of the environment on the company's financial value (financial materiality). See the '[About our Consolidated Management](#page-169-0)  [Report](#page-169-0)' appendix.\n\n#### **Material topics in the Enagás value chain**\n\nIn line with the 2030 Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Strategy, Enagás updated its material topics in the Governance, Social and Environmental dimensions and their prioritisation in the materiality matrix shown in the following section.\n\nIn this way, the human rights issue is highlighted as a specific material topic, as it is an essential part of sustainability due diligence. This issue was already included in the areas of Ethics and Compliance, People (labour rights), Local communities (rights of communities), Health and Safety and Management of natural capital and biodiversity (right to use natural resources) (see the '[Human](#page-138-0)  [rights](#page-138-0)' section in this chapter).\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/15 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white outline of an energy efficiency label inside.

In the center of the circle is a white outline of a leaf. The leaf is stylized with a single vertical line forming the stem and a curved line on the left side representing the leaf's vein or edge.\n\n**People Safety and health Natural capital and biodiversity management**\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/23 description: The image contains two circular icons. The first icon on the left is a blue circle with a white outline of a building with columns, and the text \"Good Governance\" is written below it.

The handshake is the primary focus, with the hands overlapping slightly to indicate agreement or partnership. The blue circle provides a clean, contrasting background that makes the white handshake stand out.\n\n**compliance**\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/26 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white icon of a medal inside. The medal has a round center and two ribbons hanging down from the bottom.\n\n**Financial and operational excellence**\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/28 description: The image shows a blue circle with two white speech bubbles inside. The larger speech bubble is on the left and slightly overlaps the smaller speech bubble on the right. The speech bubbles are outlined in white.\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/29 description: The image shows a blue circle with a white line drawing of a family inside. The family consists of two adults and a child. The adults are on either side of the child, and they are all facing forward. The adults are taller than the child, and they have different hairstyles. The child is in the middle of the adults, and they are shorter than the adults. The family is standing close together, and they appear to be happy.\n\n**Local communities Human rights**\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n\n#### Enagás material topic [GRI 3-1, GRI 3-2]\n\n| Enagás material topic                                    | GRI 11 sectoral standard material topic: Oil and Gas Sector 2021                                                                                             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Good Governance                                          |                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Human rights People                                      | • Labour practices<br>• Non-discrimination and equal opportunity<br>• Forced labour and modern slavery<br>• Freedom of association and collective bargaining |\n| Human rights Ethics and integrity                        | • Anti-competitive behaviour<br>• Anti-corruption<br>• Payments to governments<br>• Public Policy                                                            |\n| Financial and operational excellence                     | • Closure and rehabilitation<br>• Asset integrity and critical incident management<br>• Economic impacts                                                     |\n| Human rights<br>Health and safety                        | • Occupational health and safety                                                                                                                             |\n| Human rights Natural capital and biodiversity management | • Atmospheric emissions<br>• Biodiversity<br>• Waste<br>• Water and effluents                                                                                |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency                     | • GHG emissions<br>• Climate adaptation, resilience and transition                                                                                           |\n| Human rights<br>Local communities                        | • Local communities<br>• Land and resource rights<br>• Rights of indigenous peoples<br>• Conflict and security                                               |\n\nEnagás ensures the company's sustainability by managing these aspects in its value chain, viz., both in its direct operations and in the operations of third parties with whom it has relationships: suppliers and affiliates.\n\n#### Direct operations Supply chain Affiliates\n\nImage /page/57/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

This update takes into account dual materiality, i.e., the impact on the value of the company and the impact on the environment of each material topic. This is the case of the update carried out as a result of the 2030 Strategic Plan and the Sustainability Strategy, which took into account the relevance that investors, through the main\n\nsustainability indices and rating agencies, and the regulator, through sustainability regulations, give to the different aspects of environmental, social and governance issues. The result is the variation in the prioritisation of the following material topics as follows:\n\n- Decarbonisation as the focus of the strategic plan and the increased need to accelerate decarbonisation imply an increased importance both for stakeholders and for Enagás.\n- People are considered a fundamental axis for achieving the objectives set out in the new strategy. Therefore, the importance of the material topic of \"people\" has been increased for Enagás.\n- The importance for stakeholders and, to a lesser extent, for Enagás, of the due diligence in the value chain (affiliates and supply chain) is increased.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) Environmental, Social Risk **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/58/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left side of the image.

The level of importance for stakeholders would be equivalent to that of climate action, although somewhat lower, and for Enagás it would be at a level equivalent to that of value chain issues. [GRI 3-1, GRI 3-2]\n- Updating of the relevant issues for each of the material topics on the basis of the feedback received from our stakeholders through the channels indicated above. The result of this update can be\n\nseen in the topics included in the following sub-sections of this chapter corresponding to material topics. An example of a revision is the publication in 2021 of the GRI sector standard GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021. This allowed us to confirm that the relevant issues were those that the company had been reporting and additional issues have been included to complement what has already been reported (see the '[GRI Content Index](#page-185-0)', section in the '[Appendices](#page-168-0)' chapter). [GRI 3-1]\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/10 description: The image shows a materiality matrix for Enagás. The matrix has two axes: \"Level of Importance to Enagás\" on the y-axis and \"Level of Importance\" on the x-axis. The top right quadrant of the matrix contains several icons, including people, a building, a stethoscope, a leaf, a handshake, a puzzle piece, and a recycling symbol. An arrow points from this quadrant to another matrix. In the second matrix, the top right quadrant contains icons of people and a building, while the bottom right quadrant contains icons of a lightbulb and a recycling symbol.\n\n#### Enagás materiality matrix [GRI 3-2]\n\nDirect operations Value chain\n\nImage /page/58/Picture/13 description: The image is a green circle with a white outline of a building with a triangular roof supported by three columns.

This system covers the company's areas of sustainability (environmental, social and governance) through the most representative indicators of material topics.\n\nSince its implementation, Enagás carries out a yearly review with a focus on continuous improvement of this internal control system, increasing its scope and improving the traceability of the associated databases. Furthermore, each year this internal control system for non-financial information is externally reviewed by EY through an agreed-upon procedures report.\n\nIn 2023, the scope of the internal control system over non-financial reporting included the following indicators:\n\n| Material topic                              | Indicators                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Good Governance                             | The Council's abilities and experience assessment process                                                                                                                             |\n| Good Governance                             | Board remuneration                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Good Governance                             | Executive Committee remuneration                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Ethics and integrity                        | Communications received via the whistleblowing line                                                                                                                                   |\n| Ethics and integrity                        | Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions                                                                                                                                               |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (categories 4, 9 and 11 according to GHG Protocol)                                                                                                   |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Energy consumption (self-consumption of natural gas)                                                                                                                                  |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Taxonomic CapEx of activities significantly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives (eligible and aligned activity and eligible and non-aligned activity) |\n| Climate action and energy efficiency        | Taxonomic OpEx of activities contributing significantly to climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives (eligible and aligned activity and eligible and non-aligned activity)  |\n| Natural capital and biodiversity management | Biodiversity (area restored/revegetated)                                                                                                                                              |\n| Natural capital and biodiversity management | Volume of waste generated and managed                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Natural capital and biodiversity management | Water capture, consumption and discharge                                                                                                                                              |\n| People                                      | Diversity -

The Board of Directors is informed on a quarterly basis about the risk control processes, where climate change risks and opportunities are integrated. The Sustainability and Appointments Committee, through the Sustainability Committee, approves and monitors the CO2 emissions reduction targets linked to variable remuneration as well as initiatives that help achieve said reduction that are included in the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit and Compliance Committee supervises the efficiency of risk control and management systems and assesses the possible impact of climate change.\n\nThe Executive Committee establishes the overall risk management strategy and global limits for the company, and also reviews the level of risk exposure and corrective actions.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee is made up of the company's main General Managements, including the Energy Transition General Management. This General Management presides over the functions of Sustainability and Climate Action, Strategy and National and International Regulation, areas that provide the input for the definition of the decarbonisation strategy, as well as the identification of risks and opportunities derived from climate change.\n\nThe Health and Safety, Environment and Quality Committee periodically assesses and manages issues related to climate change associated with business processes, impact assessment studies and the evaluation of environmental aspects.\n\nThere are also various working groups reporting to these committees, such as the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Group, responsible for drafting and monitoring the Energy Efficiency Plan and setting the company's emissions reduction targets, among other matters.\n\nIn terms of risk management, business units are responsible for risk identification and measurement, the risk function controls and manages risks and the Internal Audit function supervises the effectiveness of the established controls to mitigate these risks (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter).\n\nConsult the **[Climate Action Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Climate-action-policy-2022.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n**At Enagás there is a governance structure led by the Board of Directors that supervises the company's climate change performance** \n\n## Management of risks and opportunities arising from climate change\n\n#### [GRI 201-2]\n\nAt Enagás, the processes for identifying and assessing climate risks are integrated into the corporate risk control and management model, which is aimed at ensuring that the company's targets are met in a predictable manner and with a medium total risk profile. This model makes it possible to identify and quantify the risks likely to affect the company's performance, including those arising from climate change. These risks are framed within the company's risk taxonomy (basically, physical risks are 'operational and technological' risks and transition risks are 'strategic and business' risks). Quantifying these risks allows them to be integrated into company strategy and targets to be set in order to minimise risks and maximise opportunities.\n\n#### Risk assessment methodology\n\nEnagás follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in its management of climate risks and has a methodology for their identification, prioritisation and economic quantification. In accordance with the classification provided by the TCFD standard, physical risks (extreme weather events, sea level rise) and transitional risks (regulatory, technological, market and reputational) are identified and assessed.\n\nThe assessment methodology allows to analyse the probability of occurrence, the time horizon and the impact under different temperature scenarios. As for the assessment time horizons, the short term is taken to run to 2026, aligned with the company's projections and regulatory period. The medium term runs to 2030, aligned with the company's Strategic Plan and the PNIEC, and the long term runs to 2050, aligned with European decarbonisation objectives and the PNIEC.\n\nMeasuring climate change-derived risks means estimating possible prospective climate and business scenarios that could eventually have a negative impact on the company's interests. 'Standard' methodologies are used for measurement according to the risk typology:\n\n- Physical risks at the company's facilities are assessed through stochastic methods, using standard climate models (XDI tool, AEMET models) to evaluate exposure to climate factors (river and coastal flooding, fires, earth movements, extreme winds, earthquakes, etc.), performing sensitivity analyses and stress tests on the most significant RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios from the sixth report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for the 2050 time horizon. Expert assessments are also available to evaluate the need for additional adaptation and prevention measures.\n- Transition risks (technological, regulatory, market, reputational) are assessed using deterministic methods, taking as a base scenario the company's projections and its strategic plan. Sensitivity analyses are performed on this based on the scenarios (STEPS, APS\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **and Governance**  [management](#page-152-0) **[Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/62/Picture/5 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts'.\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

record of the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge.\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/5 description: The image shows a logo with a circular design in light blue. The text \"REDUZCO\" is written along the top left curve, \"COMPENSO\" along the top right curve, and \"CALCULO\" along the bottom left curve. In the center of the circle is the number \"2022\" in a bold font. Below the circle is the number \"2\" in a larger, bold font. At the bottom of the image is a small rectangular section with the Spanish coat of arms on the left and text on the right, which includes the words \"GOBIERNO DE ESPAÑA\" and \"MINISTERIO PARA LA TRANSICIÓN ECOLÓGICA Y EL RETO DEMOGRÁFICO\".\n\nEnagás, from 2014 to 2023, has reduced more than 48% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions thanks to the measures included in its Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan. It should be noted that from the end of 2021, there were very significant changes in the context of the operation of the Spanish Gas System that have had an impact on the company's carbon footprint during 2022 (see the '[New energy](#page-17-0)  [paradigm](#page-17-0)' section in the Strategy chapter). The main changes that have remained in force in 2023 are highlighted below, together with their effects on energy consumption and therefore emissions:\n\n• The cessation of imports from November 2021 from Algeria through the Maghreb pipeline to Europe implied a change in the configuration of the Gas System. The usual entry through Tarifa, which meant flow ran from south to north (the configuration for which the gas network was designed), was replaced by other entry points, mainly through LNG terminals and Almeria, with the flow direction becoming east to west, a more inefficient direction in terms of energy consumption needs and therefore emissions.\n\n• The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began in February 2022, has led to a strengthening of interconnections, increasing exports to France in line with the More Energy Security Plan, as well as the application of the requirements for filling underground storage facilities (Royal Decree-Law 6/2022 of March 29 and EU Regulation 2022/1032)<sup>10</sup> .\n\nDespite the energy efficiency measures implemented by Enagás, these milestones led to an increase in the company's emissions volume in 2022. During 2023, emissions were reduced by 23.5% compared to 2022 due to:\n\n- A drop in demand (-11%) that entailed a lower volume of inflows to the system (-15%) through the Cartagena LNG terminal and through Almeria, mitigating the impact of the closure of the Maghreb pipeline. This has reduced the energy consumption needs of the compressor stations in these areas.\n- A mitigation of the effect of the Russia-Ukraine conflict through a greater role for LNG terminals at the European level as a result of the conflict, highlighting the incorporation of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal into the Gas System as a logistics terminal at the service of the Member States. The start of regasification at this terminal has also reduced south-north transport via the Silver Route, which means less use of the stations associated with the area and therefore less energy consumption and associated emissions.\n\n<sup>10</sup> Royal Decree-Law 6/2022, of March 29, increased the minimum security stock holding obligations for natural gas shippers and direct consumers in the market from 20 to 27.5 days of firm consumption. In addition, on June 29, 2022, the European Union adopted Regulation EU 2022/1032 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 29 2022 amending Regulations (EU) 2017/1938 and (EC) No 715/2009 with regard to gas storage, imposing an obligation on Member States to reach a filling level of 80% of underground storage facilities by November 1, 2022, and 90% by the same date in 2023.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

There is a -3% change due to energy efficiency, followed by a -15% change due to lower demand and inflows (lower impact of Maghreb pipeline closure), and a -6% change due to a greater role for LNG Terminals (mitigation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict), resulting in a value of 294,649 in 2023.\n\nIncreased emissions due to changes in the operating environment\n\nEmission reductions resulting from the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan\n\n## **In a new operating context, Enagás maintains its emission reduction targets for 2026, 2030 and 2040**\n\n#### Scopes 1 and 2  $CO$ <sup>2</sup> emissions (tonnes of  $CO\\_2e$ )<sup>11</sup> [GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2]\n\n|            | 2021    | 2022    | 2023    |\n|------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Scope 1(1) | 263,571 | 385,410 | 294,649 |\n| Scope 2(2) | 0       | 0       | 0       |\n| Scopes 1+2 | 263,571 | 385,410 | 294,649 |\n\n(1) Corresponds to the gross value of direct greenhouse gas emissions.

It does not include concepts related to the level of use of gas infrastructures, which is the parameter to which environmental impacts are related.\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/9 description: The image shows the title \"Scope 1 and 2 emissions by type of facility in 2023\" followed by the text \"[GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2]\".\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/10 description: The image is a pie chart with the following data:\nCompressor stations: 73.8%\nUnderground storage facilities: 12.5%\nRegulation and metering stations: 6.3%\nGas pipeline: 4.5%\n2.2%\n0.8%\n\nGas pipeline LNG terminal Offices, transport depots and vehicle fleet\n\n#### Scope 1 and 2 emissions by source in 2023 [GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2]\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/13 description: This image is a donut chart with the following percentages: 72.0%, 10.3%, 6.4%, 5.1%, 3.6%, and 2.6%.\n\nTurbo-compressors\n\n- Venting in normal operations/incident\n- Process boilers\n- Fugitive emissions\n- Others Compressor seal vents\n\nAt a facility level, 73.8% of emissions are concentrated at compressor stations, followed by underground storage facilities, which account for 12.5%. In terms of emission sources, 72% of the total emission footprint (Scope 1 and 2) is generated by the self-consumption of natural gas in turbocompressors at compressor stations and underground storage facilities. In this regard, Enagás has an ambitious turbocompressor electrification plan to progressively replace natural gas compressors with electric compressors, thereby reducing emissions and helping to achieve the targets set out in the decarbonisation pathway (see the '[Decarbonisation and carbon neutrality](#page-23-0)' chapter).\n\n<sup>12</sup> To calculate the intensity indicator, the adjusted net profit has been used without considering the result of investments accounted for by the equity method. In 2023, the net profit after tax was 342.5 million euros.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |  |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|--|\n| 2023          |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                |            |                                 |  |\n\n#### Infrastructure activity data [GRI 302-2]\n\n|                                   |                                                            | Unit | 2022    | 2023    | 2023 vs. 2022 (%) |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| LNG terminals                     | Regasified gas, tank and ship loading at LNG terminals     | GWh  | 171,640 | 138,870 | -19%              |\n| Compressor stations               | Compressed gas at Compressor stations                      | GWh  | 346,451 | 260,424 | -25%              |\n| Underground storage<br>facilities | Total net injection underground storage facilities         | GWh  | 14,130  | 7,009   | -50%              |\n|                                   | Total gross withdrawal from underground storage facilities | GWh  | 3,901   | 8,194   | +110%             |\n\n#### Scope 1 and 2 emissions by gas type in 2023\n\n[GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2]\n\nemissions\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/5 description: This image is a pie chart showing the composition of something. CO2 makes up 81.0%, CH4 makes up 18.8%, and HFCs makes up 0.2%.\n\n#### Change in methane emissions (tonnes of  $CH$ <sup>4</sup>)\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/7 description: The image is a bar graph comparing fugitive and venting emissions from 2015 to 2023. The y-axis represents the amount of emissions, and the x-axis represents the year. In 2015, the total emissions were 3,440. In 2019, the total emissions were 2,461. In 2020, the total emissions were 2,291. In 2021, the total emissions were 1,097. In 2022, the total emissions were 2,413. In 2023, the total emissions were 1,985. There is a blue arrow going from left to right with the text '-42%'.\n\n81% of Enagás' carbon footprint (scopes 1 and 2) corresponds to  $CO$ <sup>2</sup> emissions, generated mainly during the combustion of natural gas in stationary sources, i.e. turbocompressors, boilers, flares, etc.\n\nMethane emissions, which account for 18.8% of the footprint (scopes 1 and 2), are mainly due to natural gas venting (73%) and fugitive emissions (27%). Venting may occur as a result of operation and maintenance, operating safety, pneumatic valves and analysis equipment such as chromatographs. For their part, fugitive emissions correspond to uncontrolled gas leaks in the equipment\n\n(flanges, connectors, etc.). The latter have decreased by 7% compared to the previous year. With regard to gas losses, in 2023 they represented 0.010% and 0.033% in transmission and storage activities respectively.\n\nGlobally, emissions of this gas ( $CH$ <sup>4</sup>) have decreased by 18% compared to 2022, mainly due to:\n\n- Improved data recording on venting at LNG terminals and underground storage facilities and during transmission thanks to the development of a computer application that improves data collection and consolidation.\n- Improvements in the quantification methodology, incorporating the guidelines that are being developed at the international level.\n- Improvements to incident detection, quantification and reporting.\n\nEnagás' adherence to the methane emissions reporting framework of the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP2.0), together with significant efforts to reduce the uncertainty of this data, entail a constant review of our quantification methodology. In this regard, the Enagás Implementation Plan for maintaining the Gold Standard involves the review of all our methane sources and, therefore, the possibility of incorporating possible new sources in the coming years. In addition, various measurements have been carried out with new technologies that allow data reconciliation. This comprehensive review may be extended until 2024, by which time Enagás expects to achieve the highest data quality in line with OGMP commitments and deadlines (see the '[Methane emissions reduction](#page-70-0)' sub-section in this section).\n\n#### EU Emissions Trading System\n\n70% of emissions included in the Carbon Footprint (scopes 1 and 2) are included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).\n\nIn 2023, 50,881 emission allowances were received through free allocation and 274,000 emission allowances were purchased to cover the period's emission rights needs. [GRI 201-2]\n\n## Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan\n\nAt Enagás, energy efficiency plays a key role in emissions reduction and considerable efforts have been made in this regard. In recent years, starting in 2014, we reduced by 48% our  $CO$ <sup>2</sup> emissions thanks to the implementation of energy efficiency measures, in which we have invested around 96 million euros since 2008. [GRI 201-2]\n\nDuring the 2015-2023 period, the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan has enabled the avoidance of 1,002,990 tonnes of CO2e.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n**Annual Report** [Consolidated](#page-3-0) [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/68/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts' on the left side of the image.\n\nThese emissions include the accumulated emissions prevented as a result of the measures of the Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan implemented from 2015 to 2023.\n\nWe are working to ensure the continuous improvement of the energy efficiency of our infrastructures. As such, we have an\n\nenergy management system certified according to the ISO 50001 standard that allows us to identify opportunities to improve the energy performance of our facilities and to evaluate progress in the reduction of energy consumption.

origin over total electricity consumption from the grid was 100% in all facilities. In other words, all electricity consumed by Enagás has a zero emission factor.\n\nIn 2023, own electricity generation from renewable, clean or efficient sources reached 21 GWh, representing 9.1% of total electricity consumption. Part of the energy generated is delivered to the national grid and another part is consumed at Enagás' own facilities. The energy sent back to the grid (11.7 GWh) helps reduce 3,212 tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup> for third parties, contributes to reducing the national electricity mix factor and reinforces the principles of the circular economy, whereby Enagás' surplus electricity is used by third parties, thereby reducing their carbon footprint (see the '[Circular economy'](#page-106-0), sub-section in the '[Natural and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section).\n\n#### Energy consumption by source (GWh/y) [GRI 302-1]\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/11 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the consumption of natural gas, diesel, petrol, and electricity in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

These measures include:\n\n- Detection, quantification and repair of fugitive emission points covering all our facilities, which enabled us to avoid the emission of 10,155 tonnes of CO2e in 2023.\n- Implementation of a vented gas recovery system at the Lumbier Compressor Station, which will lead to reductions of approximately 3,500 tonnes of CO2e per year.\n- Continued replacement of pneumatic actuators with electric actuators in the transmission network, which has prevented the emission of almost 210 tonnes of CO2e into the atmosphere.\n- Continued recovery of part of the compressor venting from the LNG terminals, which has prevented the emission of approximately 112 tonnes of CO2e.\n\nIn addition, the company continues to make progress in reducing the uncertainty of methane emissions data under the OGMP2.0 (Oil and Gas Methane Partnership) initiative, to which it adheres. This is an initiative for the reporting of methane emissions in line with the European Union Methane Emission Reduction Strategy. In 2023 Enagás obtained the \"Gold Standard\" seal, which recognises the company's commitment to reducing methane emissions, as well as the company's plan to improve the reliability of methane data both for the assets over which Enagás has operational control and for its affiliates.\n\n#### 10/2023\n\nImage /page/70/Picture/16 description: The image shows the logo for the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0. The logo consists of a stylized globe on the left and the letters \"GMP\" on the right. The text \"Oil And Gas Methane Partnership 2.0\" is below the globe.\n\n **The International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) has recognised Enagás with the highest rating, 'Gold Standard', for the third consecutive year, highlighting its methane emissions plan as one of the most robust and detailed in the framework of 'The Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0' (OGMP 2.0).** \n\nIn this area, Enagás has carried out several actions applying continuous technological improvement, among which the following are noteworthy:\n\n- Measurements with different top-down technologies (DIAL, Differential Absorption Lidar, from a truck and the GASTRAQ methodology from a drone) for subsequent reconciliation with Enagás inventory data. These measurements allow Enagás to compare localised emissions with bottom-up inspections, draw lessons learned in order to continue making further progress on mitigating these emissions in the framework of the OGMP2.0 reporting.\n- Development and continuous improvement of a digital application to record venting and fugitive emissions in the\n\ntransmission network. In 2023, this application allowed for the more detailed monitoring of venting at LNG terminals and underground storage facilities and during transmission and to obtain the information broken down in accordance with the OGMP2.0 reporting framework.\n\n- Leadership in the research project promoted by GERG (European Gas Research Group). Enagás coordinated and led a pioneering global innovation project to provide guidelines on how reconciliation should be carried out at source and site level. After testing the performance of 12 cutting-edge technologies (nine top-down and three bottom-up), in order to assess their accuracy and reliability for methane emissions quantification, a first reconciliation pilot project was carried out, including testing of technologies at a site and source level at an operating compressor station in Belgium and a subsequent reconciliation analysis. Recommendations for operators are currently being finalised.\n- In 2023, Enagás and SATLANTIS continued the calibration tests of high-precision optics in two compressor stations, which will be inserted in a constellation of space microsatellites, called GEISAT (Greenhouse Gases), to detect and quantify methane emissions on Earth.\n\n#### 09/2023\n\n**The journal Atmospheric Measurement Techniques has published an article with the results of a European project led by the company within the GERG (European Gas Research Group) for the quantification and subsequent mitigation of methane emissions.** \n\n**This project aimed to identify how to improve the knowledge and use of new technologies to quantify and reduce methane emissions in midstream infrastructures.** \n\nThe company also maintained its high level of collaboration with regulators and international organisations, with the following actions being of particular note in 2023: [GRI S11.2.4]\n\n- Participation in CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) working groups to develop standards applicable to the future European Regulation on methane emissions reduction. Participation in specific LDAR (Leak Detection and Repair), quantification, venting and flaring groups.\n- Active participation in various European Commission consultations on the legislative development roadmap, dealing with the content and monitoring, reporting and verification of methane emissions.\n- Collaboration in the preparation of OGMP technical guidelines via comment submission.\n- Participation in MARCOGAZ technical recommendations: 'Workshop on a regulatory approach on leak detection and repair of methane emissions in the oil and gas sectors', and 'Mitigating methane emissions: the role of the gas sector'.

This compensation was carried out with avoided-deforestation projects in Peru and a reforestation project in Spain.\n\nIn addition, Enagás participates in the largest reforestation project in Spain, Motor Verde, developed by Repsol and Sylvestris, with which it will offset part of its residual emissions in the future.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions [GRI 305-3]\n\nIn addition to its activity chain's impact on emissions, Enagás includes the impact of the gas transported by the company in the natural gas value chain in its Scope 3 emissions. In this regard, it is important to note that the gas that Enagás transports through its infrastructures is not owned by the company; for this reason, the company includes in its Scope 3 emissions only the activities associated with the service it provides to its customers (gas transmission through company infrastructure), without including those associated with the product transported (natural gas), which include activities associated with conventional gas demand (domestic, commercial and institutional), among others.\n\nThe operating context of 2023, marked by the energy crisis (see the '[New energy paradigm](#page-17-0)' section in the Strategy chapter), has not only had an impact on Enagás' Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but also on its Scope 3 emissions. In this regard, there was a decrease in emissions from upstream transmission and distribution, specifically emissions from ships transporting natural gas arriving at Enagás' facilities. In 2023, the number of ship unloadings decreased by 44% compared to 2022, decreasing the associated emissions by 42%. Enagás sold some of its shareholdings in 2022, such as the GNL Quintero LNG terminal in Chile, the Morelos pipeline and Compañía Operadora de Gas del Amazonas (COGA) in Peru.\n\n#### Scope 3 emissions classification in 2023 [GRI 305-3]\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/21 description: This image is a donut chart with six categories.

This is due to the nature of our business, as Enagás does not own or sell natural gas, and therefore we consider distribution companies to be end customers of our services, and their emissions to be the final ones linked to the natural gas we transport.\n\n(2) This category is not applicable to Enagás as we do not operate any upstream or downstream leased assets.\n\n(3) These categories are not applicable to Enagás as our activity is limited to the transmission of natural gas, classified within the midstream segment. Enagás is not the owner of the gas at any stage of the value chain and is not responsible for emissions related to the end-of-life treatment of products or the processing of products for sale. (4) Includes emissions from Enagás' affiliates, specifically the Bahía de Bizkaia Gas (BBG) LNG terminal; Soto la Marina compressor station; Sagunto Regasification LNG terminal (Saggas); LNG terminal from the operator DESFA; Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and TLA Altamira LNG terminal. Does not include Tallgrass Energy emissions due to lack of data.\n\n(5) This category is not applicable to Enagás because the company does not have franchises.\n\n(6) In addition to the emission factors used in the calculation of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, the following emission factors have been considered for the calculation of Scope 3 emissions:\n\n• Maritime transport: DEFRA, Page Fuels, Maritime Oil. 2023. version 1.\n\n• Air transport: Aviation: COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2018/2066 of December 19, 2018, on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 [\\(https://eur-lex.europa.eu/](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R2066) [legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R2066](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R2066)).

The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a blue sans-serif font, with a green circle above it. The circle is not fully closed, with a gap at the bottom.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nEnagás has reviewed the indirect emissions relevance analysis according to the criteria set out by the ISO 14064 standard, namely: volume of emissions in each category with respect to the total, level of influence, access to information, data accuracy and relevance. As a result of the significance analysis, the categories corresponding to upstream transmission and distribution of goods, downstream transmission and distribution, purchased goods, investments and fuel and energy related activities not included in scope 1 and scope 2 have been classified as relevant. It should be noted that, although only five categories were identified as significant, Enagás is aware of the importance of emissions linked to the value chain and reports all categories in a bid for transparency.\n\n#### Reduction of Scope 3 emissions [GRI 305-3]\n\nEnagás addresses the reduction of Scope 3 emissions throughout its value chain, especially those included in the company's carbon footprint, through the following actions:\n\n• Development of renewable gases. Enagás is strengthening its participation in the development of renewable gas projects (renewable hydrogen) that will allow for their progressive incorporation into the energy model (see the '[Renewable Gases](#page-25-0)['](#page-25-0)) sub-section) for the decarbonisation of the entire natural gas value chain.\n\n- Promotion of the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in mobility (maritime transport) (see the '[Sustainable Mobility](#page-30-0)' sub-section).\n- Collaboration with industry and associations on decarbonisation (see the '[Reduction of methane emissions](#page-70-0)' sub-section in this section). Promotion of decarbonisation at Enagás affiliates: emissions reduction and energy efficiency measures are among the critical management standards that Enagás extends to its affiliates (see the ['](#page-142-0)[Affiliates](#page-142-0)['](#page-142-0) section). In addition, a climate action due diligence analysis has been performed on all our affiliates, which has allowed us to verify the progress of the companies in terms of setting emission reduction targets, as well as in terms of calculating and reporting methane emissions and evaluating best practices for reducing methane emissions. Regarding this last point, Enagás will continue to monitor methane emissions through the OGMP2.0 reporting framework (see the '[Reduction of](#page-70-0)  [methane emissions](#page-70-0)' sub-section in this section).\n- Promotion of decarbonisation in the supply chain: Enagás has several platforms for the approval and evaluation of its suppliers' performance. In this way, Enagás evaluates its main suppliers in terms of climate action and identifies working areas aimed at reducing its carbon footprint (see the ['](#page-147-0)[Supply chain](#page-147-0)['](#page-147-0) section).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/74/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enaga\" in blue and green on the right.\n\n# 3.2 People\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nPeople management is a key area for the company, since, as reflected in our Human Capital Management Policy, it enables Enagás to equip itself with the resources required for the deployment of its strategy.\n\n[GRI 3-3]\n\nThe key aspects that we address in our people management model are the structure and sizing of our organisation (workforce), the development of skills and knowledge of professionals, job stability and quality and compliance with labour rights, with special attention to the areas of diversity and inclusion, work-life balance and shared responsibility, and equal opportunity.\n\n## Sustainable Management Plan\n\n#### Main lines in 2023\n\n- Negotiation of the fourth collective bargaining agreement of the Enagás Group.\n- Definition of the action plan derived from the climate survey and launch of surveys for the assessment of work-life balance measures and for the follow-up of the 2022 results.\n- Implementation of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and the Diversity Allies Network.\n- Leadership programme to develop the skills and competences of the management team.\n- Corporate University Project.\n- Specific programme on bias to strengthen the Diversity and Inclusion model.\n\n#### 2024 lines\n\n- Signing of the fourth collective bargaining agreement of the Enagás Group.\n- Continuation of the Leadership Programme for managers to develop the skills of the management team in line with the company's new Strategic Plan and Transformation Plan.\n- Implementation of a new Remuneration Model in line with the company's challenges and targets, as well as ensuring its competitiveness based on best practices and market trends.\n- Launch of the Enagás Corporate University and implementation of associated initiatives.\n- Transparency and equal pay: completion of the analysis process on the premises of the European Directive for the calculation of an adjusted pay gap and definition of an action plan.\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/25 description: A green circle contains the text \"1,354 professionals\" in white.\n\n## 58.1 average training hours per employee (€1,096 investment per employee)\n\n36 internal promotions (33% women)\n\n78.4% of the workforce underwent a performance assessment\n\n41% women in management and premanagement positions\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Annual Report** [Consolidated](#page-3-0) **[2023](#page-1-0)** [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [Our business](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0) [model](#page-10-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)** [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n## Our professionals [GRI 2-7, GRI 2-8]\n\nThe following outlines the distribution of Enagás' 1,354 professionals<sup>13</sup> <sup>14</sup>(1,346.3 FTEs<sup>15</sup>) by country, age group, professional group and gender at year-end.\n\n#### Number of professionals per country at year-end<sup>13</sup>\n\n| Country             | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Spain               | 1,327 | 1,353 | 1,352 |\n| Other countries (1) | 17    | 12    | 2     |\n| Belgium             | 3     | 3     | 2     |\n| Kuwait              | 4     | 4     | 0     |\n| Peru                | 3     | 3     | 0     |\n| Greece              | 2     | 1     | 0     |\n| Mexico              | 3     | 1     | 0     |\n| France              | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n| Chile               | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n| TOTAL               | 1,344 | 1,365 | 1,354 |\n\n(1) 100% of professionals outside Spain have a permanent full-time contract.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2023, 13 professionals were hired through temporary employment agencies (9 in 2022) and 55 interns (45 in 2022) were working at Enagás in Spain.

The company ensures the appropriate transmission of expert knowledge through planned and voluntary departures. In 2023, there were two involuntary departures<sup>16</sup> from the company (two men, one under 35 years of age and the other between 36 and 55 years of age). [GRI 2-7]\n\n## Transformation Plan [GRI 404-2]\n\nIn order to respond to the company's strategic challenges in accordance with the new Strategic Plan, Enagás is promoting a Transformation Plan which, through the development of crosscutting and top management-sponsored initiatives, enables it to drive cultural change and the internal transformation of the company with a focus on people.\n\nAll of this is underpinned by pillars such as talent, diversity, new ways of working and digitalisation, among others.\n\nThis plan focuses on the following areas:\n\n- Roles, profiles and agile resource planning model, as well as competency and capacity development to successfully cope with an environment that demands new skills and knowledge.\n- Strategic management of diverse and inclusive talent, which places the professional at the centre, promotes self-driven growth and learning, and ensures the commitment, engagement and development of key talent.\n- An agile, flexible and more adaptable organisation, with a more cross-cutting, fluid structure, oriented towards adding value and characterised by the adoption of agile values and new ways of working.\n- Digitalisation and efficiency of processes, boosting customer orientation, improving response time and data-driven decision making. Fostering a safety culture in order to evolve towards being a more resilient organisation and ensure business continuity.\n- New spaces and forms of intelligent work that provide greater flexibility in the current hybrid context, leveraging the use of new technological tools and promoting a culture of health that guarantees the physical and emotional well-being of professionals.\n- Cross-cutting actions to respond to the company's strategic challenges with a focus on operational excellence and flexibility, sustainability and evolution resulting from the decarbonisation and energy transition context (hydrogen, other renewable gases, etc.), among others.\n\n<sup>16</sup> In 2022, no involuntary departures took place; in 2021, there was one (a man, professional group 'Operator', aged 36-55).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/80/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase sans-serif font. The \"e\" is green, and the rest of the letters are blue. The word is enclosed in a circle, with the top half of the circle being green and the bottom half being blue.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n All of this is complemented by a Communication and Change Management Programme, which activates the transformation by placing the professional as an active part of the action plan and ensures the success and measurement of the impact on results.\n\nMajor projects being pushed forward in 2023 include: the improvement of key business processes, simplification of reporting, development of leadership and training programmes at a company level, promotion of digitalisation and development of digital products (SL-ATR, Guarantees of Origin), listening actions and improvement of the employee experience, actions within the agile framework, health and safety and resilience change management and the adaptation of spaces around the new hybrid context.\n\nEnagás has Corporate Guidelines on the Right to Digital Switch-Off, which moderate possible effects of permanent connectivity and promote a positive impact on people's productivity and well-being. . [GRI 404-2]\n\n#### See the **[Corporate Guidelines on the Right to Disconnect](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Corporate%20Directives%20Right%20to%20Digital%20SwichOff.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n### Agility and new ways of working\n\nIn addition, Enagás is leading a programme of agility and new ways of working that aims to adopt agile principles throughout the company through specific actions in three areas:\n\n- Evolve towards an organisation with greater transversality, customer orientation and process simplicity.\n- Promote the use of methodologies that seek to adopt collaborative frameworks that foster early value delivery, continuous improvement and innovation.\n- Promote new behaviours and attitudes that foster communication, transversality and agility training for professionals.\n\nIn 2023, from the 'Agility Hub', the company continued its commitment to agility and the adoption of new ways of working at the company, highlighting the launch and execution of the following initiatives:\n\n- Organisational evolution of areas of the company based on structures and management models agile in defining transversal roles with a customer vision, promoting agile project offices and creating permanent product-oriented structures made up of agile cells.\n- Methodological support to teams in the adoption of agility and new ways of working in day-to-day and project work through Communities of Practice and other associated specific actions.\n- Promotion of internal communications to reinforce the dissemination of agile culture (effective meetings, sharing of best practices and internal company testimonials, among others).\n\nAt Enagás, in accordance with the drive for teams to adopt agility and new ways of working, reflection sessions have been implemented on the natural team and project team level, using an agile/scrum philosophy that allows for an 'informal' evaluation at the team performance level. These sessions are characterised by being 'spaces for reflection' in which the teams 'self-evaluate' by identifying areas for improvement that need to be strengthened from both an individual and collective point of view.\n\nIn addition, in order to continue disseminating agility and new ways of working to all Enagás professionals, a training plan on new methodologies was launched for all company workforce (see the '[Training](#page-81-0)' sub-section in this section).\n\n## Awareness of in-house talent [GRI 404-3]\n\nThe company has different evaluation models aimed at getting to know internal talent in order to effectively guide their training and professional development.\n\nThe performance assessment model is based on the corporate skills that make up the Leadership Model for each professional category, thus allowing the identification of strengths and areas for individual development of each professional. There is also a management-byobjectives model to align employees' individual performance and contribution with the company's strategic challenges, via the annual definition of measurable and defined objectives for each professional with regular monitoring by their managers, through the annual variable remuneration of professionals not covered by the collective bargaining agreement. These assessments are carried out annually and serve as a base for promoting continuous improvement and designing personal development plans.\n\nDevelopment Centre sessions are also held; in these, through various techniques and simulation exercises, participants obtain personalised feedback about their potential strengths and areas for development in the performance of different roles and responsibilities. In 2023, in response to the company's organisational needs during the year, 43 professionals (79 in 2022) participated in a talent identification programme and 16 (51 in 2022) received a skillsbased assessment for possible promotion to management positions.\n\nWith the aim of continuing to promote feedback culture at the company and fostering open communication, Enagás has an online platform for all professionals to receive and give feedback to other professionals. This aims to encourage the identification of improvements at work and to recognise achievements.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that in 2023, with the aim of adapting the management team's skills to successfully face the challenges of the Strategic Plan and the Transformation Plan, a Leadership Development Programme has been put in place. This has entailed the identification of critical knowledge and skills to be developed at the company to achieve our strategic challenges. 40 professionals (members of the Executive Committee and company Directors) have participated in a 360º evaluation process (evaluation by their managers, teams and peers and/or internal customers) to provide them with an expanded vision of their strengths and areas for improvement, thus focusing both the individual and collective actions we will take next to boost their development of skills that are critical for Enagás.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social Risk [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of professionals assessed by the number of staff at year-end. The Chief Executive Officer is not included, as he is not covered by the performance assessment.\n\n(2) The data of the performance assessment of the group of professionals included in the collective bargaining agreement refer to the 2022 financial year, as the 2023 evaluation campaign ended after the approval of this report.\n\n## Professional development programmes\n\nThe information obtained from the various assessments of our professionals to date makes it possible to design individualised development plans tailored to the identified needs identified. These are approached from an integral perspective, following the 70:20:10 learning model, based on the fact that for this process to be as effective as possible, we must focus on three complementary areas: experience, exposure and education.\n\nIn relation to the first area of experiential learning, internal rotation programmes are fostered so that new knowledge can be applied to real situations, and participation in transversal projects or temporary assignments can also be taken advantage of. In 2023, there were 144 internal movements (163 in 2022), of which 36 were promotions, 103 horizontal movements and 5 expatriation. 46% of hirings selected internal candidates (43% in 2022). 21 interns also stayed on at the company (31 in 2022).\n\nIn relation to the second area, namely exposure or informal learning, there is the option of carrying out internal and/or external coaching and mentoring programmes. These programmes contribute to the achievement of the company's strategic objectives, and their main benefits are the development and retention of talent, increased satisfaction and motivation of professionals, improved internal communication and teamwork, increased productivity, leadership development and strategic vision, as well as the promotion of female talent and the increased presence of women in positions of responsibility.\n\n• Enagás promotes personalised coaching programmes aimed at working on the capabilities and skills necessary for the performance of each professional, facing times of change or undertaking new roles. In 2023, 29 professionals participated in coaching programmes (six professionals in 2022). In addition, professionals in the company have received training and are\n\ncertified in coaching; they are therefore qualified to carry out internal coaching processes.\n\n• Enagás has continued to strengthen its internal mentoring programme aimed at all the company's professionals, which encourages two-way learning among colleagues. Enagás continued to strengthen its internal mentoring programme, aimed at all company professionals. In 2023, 54 professionals (27 mentees and 27 mentors) participated in the internal mentoring programme, and 46 professionals (31 mentees and 16 mentors) participated in the external mentoring programme. The aim of these external programmes is to encourage and enable professionals to reach senior management positions, to foster their development and to receive advice from more senior professionals from a company other than their own, allowing for a greater exchange of experiences.\n\nFinally, the third area - education - promotes a culture of continuous learning, putting the employee at the centre, empowering them and providing them with the capacity for self-development through training ecosystems where they can access different learning programmes and initiatives.\n\nIn addition, there have been two career models at the company. On the one hand, there is the management career, where you are promoted vertically to positions of greater responsibility and based on team management. On the other hand, there is the technical career, aimed at creating and identifying experts in those areas of knowledge that are critical for Enagás.\n\n### Training [GRI 404-2]\n\nEnagás is committed to training its professionals from when they join the company and throughout their professional career.\n\nTraining begins with the Enagás Welcome Plan, which includes communication and training activities. It includes e-learning training on aspects such as the Code of Ethics, a corporate defence programme, a corruption prevention programme, human rights and equality, among others, which are compulsory for all professionals, and face-to-face training on the Enagás value chain that offers professionals a global vision of the company's business. As a complement to this plan, new recruits participate in a buddy programme; during their Enagás onboarding process, they are accompanied by a colleague who guides and helps them as they take their first steps.\n\nBesides, depending on the type of work the person performs, a training plan has been designed in areas related to operations, maintenance, security and administrative management.\n\nThe company's training is driven by the new Enagás Corporate University, where over 10% of the workforce participate as trainers in different programmes. Beyond classroom and on-the-job training, virtual training, e-learning, mobile training and communities of practice, we also promote the use of experiential technologies, allowing real cases to be simulated and people to learn from experience without putting people's safety at risk or modifying infrastructure operations.\n\nEnagás' commitment to training all its professionals is evidenced by a training penetration rate<sup>17</sup> of 94.9% in 2023 (97.1% in 2022), an\n\n<sup>17</sup>The training penetration rate is the number of professionals who have received at least one training activity during the year out of the total number of employees at year-end.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0) \n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The bottom half of the circle is formed by a curved, dark teal line that extends from the bottom of the \"e\" to the bottom of the \"s\".\n\naverage of 58.1 hours of training per professional (55.1 hours in 2022) and an average investment of 1,096 euros per professional (1,239 euros in 2022).\n\nEnagás assesses the satisfaction of professionals who have received training; this increased in 2023 compared with the previous year, reaching 8.8 out of 10 (8.7 in 2022).\n\n## **Enagás professionals received an average of 58 hours of training in 2023**\n\nAs part of Enagás' strategy to promote the continuous training of our professionals to guarantee success in the performance of their duties, there are customised training schedules for each of the company's profiles and levels. These schedules are set out to generate progressive improvement in our professionals' qualification levels, anticipating their short- and long-term needs, and include corporate, operation and maintenance, environmental and health and safety training. This year, they have been extended to strategic areas, including Agility and\n\nNew Ways of Working, Digital Transformation and Hydrogen. The\n\ntraining associated with these training schedules (training counted as compulsory) represents 19% of the training hours and 14% of the economic investment per professional.\n\nAdditionally, we have programmes based on the skills and behaviours established for each profile associated with our leadership model. We also have training, upskilling and reskilling programmes that provide technical training to new employees, allowing them to take on new roles and participate in new projects and initiatives. [GRI 404-2]\n\nWithin the framework of the Enagás Knowledge Management Model, with the aim of promoting the dissemination and transfer of critical knowledge generated within the company, especially in Infrastructure, the company has continued to work on a series of initiatives, including the promotion of social learning so that professionals can earn and share knowledge through the 'Expert Talk' programme. In this programme, experts and company leaders share their knowledge with the rest of the company's professionals through monthly lectures on relevant topics in the gas sector, and the creation of lessons on different subjects that other professionals can consult. Likewise, in order to minimise knowledge loss, we continue with the critical knowledge transfer plans linked to the relay plans.\n\n#### Hours of training (1) received by professional, by professional group and gender [GRI 404-1]\n\nImage /page/82/Figure/16 description: This image is a bar chart comparing data from 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a sans-serif font, with the \"e\" in lowercase and the rest of the letters in lowercase. Above the word \"enagas\" is a curved line that forms a semi-circle, creating a visual element that resembles a smile or an arc. The color of the word \"enagas\" and the curved line is a shade of teal or light green.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion [GRI 3-3]\n\nEnagás has a Diversity and Inclusion Policy that sets out the commitments and lines of action to position diversity management and inclusion as key elements of its global strategy. This policy promotes equal opportunities as the central axis around which human resources policies should be oriented, with the aim of creating strategic assets and promoting the full personal and professional development of company employees at all times, thus consolidating the right of all professionals to truly equal opportunities and equal treatment. It also includes the integration of diversity in the main human resources processes such as access to employment, personal progress and professional development and promotion, all while guaranteeing a management free of bias associated with differences.\n\nSee our **[Diversity and Inclusion Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Diversity%20and%20Inclusion%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nEnagás promotes a culture that ensures a diverse and inclusive environment, and fosters a working environment in which trust and mutual respect prevail and where integration and recognition of individual merit are hallmarks of the company.\n\nEnagás has designed a Master Plan establishing two bodies to continuously promote Diversity and Inclusion at the company:\n\n- Diversity and Inclusion Committee, whose goal is to involve the company's management and middle management in the Diversity and Inclusion strategy by promoting inclusion in their areas of responsibility, being active and prominent advocates of inclusive practices and leadership. This provides a space for sharing experiences, reflecting, finding synergies and proposing concrete actions to advance with a sustainable, inclusive and egalitarian model of people management. This Committee, which is composed of directors representing all areas of the company, has met twice since June 2023.\n- Diversity and Inclusion Allies Network, to take the pulse of the organisation in terms of Diversity and Inclusion and ensure the implementation of a diversity and inclusion culture on a day-today basis, serving as a link between the Diversity and Inclusion Committee and the rest of the workforce.\n\nThe Enagás diversity allies network met for the first time on October 25. This network involves 90 professionals from all areas of the company who have expressed an interest in promoting an inclusive culture based on the six axes of diversity.\n\nThe Diversity and Inclusion Master Plan was implemented in 2023.\n\nIt also reflects the company's commitment to the promotion of policies and measures to enhance shared responsibility and work-life balance of its professionals. In the same way, and safeguarding freedom of management, Enagás extends this commitment to all its stakeholders, paying special attention to suppliers and contractors as indispensable partners in achieving the company's business objectives (see the ['](#page-147-0)[Supply chain](#page-147-0)['](#page-147-0) section in this chapter).\n\n### Diversity leadership\n\nIn terms of management, Enagás has a specific People and Diversity Department, reporting to the People and Transformation General Manager. This General Manager is a member of the Executive Committee reporting directly to the CEO; his duties include the development and maintenance of Enagás' Diversity and Inclusion strategy.\n\n#### Non-discrimination\n\nEnagás expressly rejects any discrimination based on gender, age, disability, nationality or culture, race, religious beliefs, thought and sexual orientation, or any other personal, family, economic or social condition among its professionals, fostering work environments free of direct and indirect discrimination, harassment or other forms of intolerance at all levels of the organisation.\n\nThe company is determined to create diverse and inclusive work environments, where each and every person feels that they can be themselves and that they are valued, without prejudice, for their work and their talent. In 2023, Enagás launched a specific programme on cognitive biases aimed at Directors and managers to help develop a culture favourable to the diversity and inclusion model that the company seeks. Its goal is to help identify the presence of biases and assess their influence and impact on interpersonal interactions and management, providing team managers with both the necessary tools to be aware of their existence and the measures and actions available to eliminate them. In 2024, this training will be extended to the partner network, and training videos will be distributed to all professionals.\n\nEnagás has a prevention and action protocol for any situation of harassment in the workplace, the aim of which is to set out guidelines for identifying a situation of harassment, whether psychological or moral, sexual, or gender-based, among others, in order to resolve a discriminatory situation, ensuring that the rights of the victims are guaranteed at all times. In this regard, in 2020, Enagás launched an online course on the Code of Ethics aimed at all professionals that addresses this matter.\n\nConsult the **[Prevention and action protocol for any workplace](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/personas/diversidad/Prevention%20and%20action%20protocol%20for%20any%20situation%20of%20harassment%20in%20the%20workplace.pdf)  [harassment situation](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/personas/diversidad/Prevention%20and%20action%20protocol%20for%20any%20situation%20of%20harassment%20in%20the%20workplace.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n#### 2023\n\n**In 2023, Enagás continued its communication campaign #EllasTeLoCuentan (#ShesTellingYou). Through the testimonies of company professionals, this aims to raise the profile of Enagás women's talent and create female role models to help build the number of women in technical and operational jobs. The campaign was launched in February 2022, and in 2023 testimonials by men were added, #EllasTeLoCuentan, con ellos (#ShesTellingYou, with them), to highlight the team cohesion without the gender of any of their members prevailing.** \n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social Risk**  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/84/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts'.\n\nEnagás, aware of the richness that the confluence of different knowledge, skills and experiences brings to the organisation, has set out its Diversity and Inclusion Strategy based on the following pillars: [GRI 3-3]\n\nImage /page/84/Figure/9 description: The image shows six circular icons, each representing a different aspect of diversity and inclusion. The first icon, labeled \"Gender,\" depicts two figures and describes guaranteeing equal treatment and opportunities in hiring, development, and growth for all genders. The second icon, labeled \"Disability,\" features a puzzle piece and discusses moving forward with the full inclusion of people with disabilities in the workforce. The third icon, labeled \"Generational,\" shows three figures and encourages different generations to work together in a favorable environment. The fourth icon, labeled \"Cultural,\" displays a globe and focuses on taking advantage of multiculturalism to improve employee experience. The fifth icon, labeled \"Thinking,\" presents a lightbulb and aims to create a culture where the uniqueness of beliefs, education, skills, and preferences contributes to employee innovation. The sixth icon, labeled \"LGTBIQ+,\" features a heart and aims to make visible, integrate, and normalize LGBTQI+ groups in the professional environment.\n\nThis strategy is supported by a Diversity and Equality Action Plan which aims to ensure equality of opportunity by promoting a diverse, inclusive environment.\n\n## **We have joined the European Diversity Month with testimonials from our company's Executive Committee management team**\n\n#### Gender diversity\n\nIn the area of gender diversity, Enagás guarantees equal treatment and opportunities in the hiring, development and growth of men and women; to promote an environment and conditions in which all people aspire to, and are able to, achieve positions of responsibility.\n\nTo this end, it has an Equality Plan that sets out a framework for action to promote effective equality, equity, merit, personal progress, shared responsibility and work-life balance among all professionals.\n\nEnagás has also joined the commemoration of specific days including International Women's Day, European Equal Pay Day, International Day of Women and Girls in Science, International Women in Engineering Day, Women's Entrepreneurship Day and International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\nConsult the **[2nd Gender Equality Plan](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/es/ficheros/conocenos/personas/diversidad/plan-igualdad.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social Risk**  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/85/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the logo of ENA on the right.\n\n#### **Gender diversity programmes**\n\nEnagás promotes measures aimed at increasing the participation of women in positions of responsibility, such as the 'Women with Talent' development programme, the 'Promociona' project and the\n\n'Progresa' project. The latter ones are being developed in collaboration with the CEOE, and aim to create networking groups based on the sharing of experiences to provide high-potential women with the tools and skills necessary to boost their professional careers and take on positions of high responsibility in the future. It\n\n#### **Other gender diversity indicators**\n\nhas also launched the Management Development Programme 'Women with High Potential', together with the EOI and the\n\nmentoring programme for managers, AED Lead Mentoring. These programmes contribute to the achievement of the company's strategic targets, recognising, promoting and developing female talent and guaranteeing the principle of equal opportunities and non-discrimination. In 2023, 18 women (also 18 in 2022) participated in one of the female management development programmes in which Enagás participates.\n\nOf 127 new recruitments,\n\n46.4% 33.3% 44.4%\n\ne women\n\n#### **Company diversity targets**\n\nEnagás sets gender diversity targets as part of its annual and threeyear company objectives.

Furthermore, the Enagás Collective Bargaining Agreement sets out different salary levels based exclusively upon objective work criteria.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás' minimum wage, established by the Collective Bargaining Agreement, was 1.5 times the national minimum wage in Spain, regardless of gender (1.6 times in 2022) [GRI 202-1].\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n\n#### Evolution of the relationship between base salary of women and men by professional group (1) [GRI 405-2]\n\n|                          |                                             | 2021     | 2022   | 2023   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Managers                 | Chief Executive Officer (2)                 | N.A.     | N.A.   | N.A.   |\n|                          | Other members of the Executive<br>Committee | 0.93 (3) | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n|                          | Other managers                              | 0.91     | 0.95   | 1.00   |\n| Technicians              |                                             | 1.00     | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n| Administrative workforce |                                             | 1.06     | 1.07   | 1.06   |\n| Operational workforce    |                                             | 0.89     | 0.80   | 0.83   |\n| TOTAL                    | Ratio                                       | 0.98     | 1.01   | 1.03   |\n|                          | Percentage (4)                              | 2.12%    | -1.21% | -2.58% |\n\nN.A.

Not applicable\n\n(1) Ratio of average remuneration of women to average remuneration of men. Average remuneration includes: base year salary at December 31, variable remuneration, allowances, payments to long-term savings plans and any other item, such as overtime. Only the transfer allowance is excluded, as it is not considered remuneration as such; it accounts for less than 0.1% of the total amount of remuneration.\n\nThis takes into consideration all professionals in Spain with a permanent or temporary contract, both full-time and part-time, who have remained in the company\n\nthroughout the year (93.7% of the workforce). In the case of part-time workforce, the base salary has been extrapolated to a full-time salary for comparability. For 2022, given the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer in February 2022, the Chief Executive Officer's annual base salary was considered together with the actual remuneration received in the year for comparability purposes.\n\n(2) In 2022, the long-term incentive plans (2019-2021) were settled, significantly increasing the remuneration of the company's professionals. The allocation of these incentive plans was structured according to the professional group's degree of contribution to the established targets. In 2023, the partial settlement of the term incentive plans (2019-2021) for senior management was finalised.\n\n(3) There are no women in this professional group.\n\n(4) Unrepresentative data, as there are less than three professionals in this group for one of the genders. Although there were three women on the Executive Committee in 2022, only two were taken into account for the wage gap calculation, as one of them was not with the company for the whole year.\n\n(5) Figure calculated as the difference between the average remuneration of men and women divided by the average remuneration of men.\n\nIn 2023, the wage gap continued to decrease, but not materially. The wage gap in the year, considering total remuneration, was 0.99 (1.29% difference between men's and women's base salary).\n\nWhen analysing the pay gap by occupational group, the difference in the 'Other Executive Committee members' group is due to differences in management seniority among the members of this group, which leads to differences in other remuneration without an identifiable pay gap in base salary among this occupational group (1.00).\n\nThe difference in the professional group \"Other executives\" (1.03) has decreased in recent years, in line with the development and promotion of female talent (women managers and pre-managers). The difference in salary in the professional group of administrative workforce (1.10) is due to the fact that this is a category made up mostly of women (88%), in which some positions have functionrelated bonuses.\n\nSimilarly, the difference in the category of operational workforce (0.79) is explained by a greater presence of men (88.6%) with an average seniority greater than that of women (an average of 14.9 years for men compared to 4.3 years for women). In this regard, Enagás is promoting the incorporation of women in the technical specialist professional group through initiatives such as the search for female profiles in vocational schools.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás has launched a new study on the gender pay gap in anticipation of the transposition into Spanish law of the requirements of the EU Directive.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |  |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|--|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|--|\n\n#### Changes in average remuneration (1) by professional group, age and gender [GRI 2-19, GRI 405-2]\n\n|                          | 2021                                     | 2022<br>(year of settlement of long-term<br>incentive plans) (2) | 2023 (2   |               |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Professional group       |                                          |                                                                  |           |               |\n| Managers                 | Chief Executive Officer (3)              | 1,592,399                                                        | 1,377,688 | 1,879,700 (4) |\n|                          | Other members of the Executive Committee | 561,410                                                          | 595,687   | 641,438       |\n|                          | Other managers                           | 150,128                                                          | 176,791   | 161,048       |\n|                          | Technicians                              | 66,243                                                           | 73,404    | 70,983        |\n| Administrative workforce |                                          | 46,414                                                           | 51,109    | 50,210        |\n| Operational workforce    |                                          | 53,067                                                           | 58,686    | 57,289        |\n| Age range                | <=35 years                               | 51,074                                                           | 55,556    | 53,320        |\n|                          | 36-55 years                              | 76,611                                                           | 83,893    | 80,975        |\n|                          | >55 years                                | 95,912                                                           | 93,164    | 91,534        |\n| Gender                   | Women                                    | 70,493                                                           | 80,573    | 78,195        |\n|                          | Men                                      | 78,451                                                           | 82.116    | 79.217        |\n\n(1) Average remuneration that includes: base year salary at December 31, variable remuneration, allowances, payments to long-term savings plans and any other item, such as overtime.

The company works towards social and labour inclusion through direct hiring (seven people in the workforce at year-end<sup>19</sup>) and indirect job creation for severely disabled profiles, through collaboration agreements with foundations and special employment centres.\n\nThe company also supports corporate volunteering initiatives to promote the social integration of people with disabilities and to raise awareness among Enagás professionals of the needs of this group (see the '[Corporate volunteering programme](#page-136-0)', sub-section in the '[Local communities](#page-133-0)' section in this chapter), as well as training and disability awareness measures.\n\n<sup>18</sup> At the close of the 2023 fiscal year, the distribution of Enagás professionals by age range and gender was: 37 women <30 years of age, 49 men <30 years of age, 256 women between 30 and 50 years of age, 552 men between 30 and 50 years of age, 108 women >55 years of age, 352 men >55 years of age. <sup>19</sup> At the end of the 2022 and 2021 financial years, there were six and seven persons with disabilities, respectively.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/89/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enac\" inside of a green and blue circle on the right.\n\nEnagás commemorates the International Day of Persons with Disabilities; in 2023, the company launched its 'Por la Suma de Capacidades' ('For Total Ability') campaign, a project that aims to raise awareness and increase the visibility of disability situations. As a company committed to diversity, inclusion and the value of all people's talent, Enagás is offering this information to all its professionals to help overcome unfamiliarity and the possible prejudices associated with it.\n\nIn addition, Enagás has taken action to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, such as the progressive elimination of architectural barriers at our facilities and the 'AA' accessibility level of our corporate website.\n\n#### 01/2023\n\n**The Certification Committee of the Bequal Foundation, a nonprofit organisation that recognises organisations that are socially responsible towards people with disabilities, has renewed Enagás' certification in the PLUS category. This certification recognises the company's commitment to people with disabilities as one of the main lines of action included in its Diversity and Inclusion policy.** \n\n#### 10/2023\n\n**The Ministry of Equality, through the Women's Institute, has extended Enagás' equality award for the fourth time, in recognition of the company's excellence in implementing policies for equality between women and men.** \n\nImage /page/89/Picture/13 description: The image shows a logo with a stylized letter 'i'.

There are two periods, summer and non-summer, with a divided or continuous working day, flexible in both cases, to be chosen by the professionals depending on the area of activity to which they are assigned<sup>20</sup>. In addition, Enagás has established a teleworking system that allows it to respond to the current context, in which 91% of professionals whose position is compatible with this type of work voluntarily participate.\n\nEnagás has been certified as an Family-Friendly Company since 2007; it obtained the highest rating (A+ Level) for excellence in work-life balance from the Más Familia Foundation. Work-life balance is a voluntary commitment that Enagás has made to contribute to the professional and personal success of its workforce.\n\nTo this end, the company has more than 125 measures aimed at reconciling the different aspects of people's lives. They support professional and personal development and facilitate a balance between the different dimensions of each person's life, as well as those of their immediate family. Work-life balance becomes a key instrument to guarantee equality of opportunity.\n\nEnagás believes that the Family-Friendly Company model is integrated into the management of the business and is a valuable tool that has also allowed the company to be perceived as an excellent place to work. The Family-Friendly Company model is subject to an external audit, which evaluates, among other aspects, the return on investment of work-life balance and obliges the company to always be in a process of continuous improvement.\n\n<sup>20</sup> Except shift personnel.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/90/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enagas.

This programme consists of four online training sessions that offer professionals the opportunity to learn and answer their education-related questions with different renowned experts.** \n\n### Collective bargaining [GRI 2-30]\n\nIn 2020, the company signed the Enagás Group's third collective bargaining agreement to provide the company with a framework of employment stability over a three-year period in line with the current socio-economic context and the needs and development of the company. This collective bargaining agreement covers, among other matters, the health and safety of all Enagás Group professionals (see the '[Health and safety](#page-93-0)' section in this chapter). In 2023, Enagás began negotiating the Group's 4th collective bargaining agreement, having signed in December the preagreement issued by the Negotiating Committee.\n\nIn addition, Enagás enters into collective bargaining and carries out regular consultations with the workers' legal representation regarding working conditions, remuneration, dispute resolution, internal relations and issues of mutual concern. In 2023, various working group meetings were held with social representatives, including meetings to negotiate the Enagás Group's 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement and the ordinary meetings of the joint committees established in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Equality Plan and the Pension Plan. All of this has resulted in various agreements, notably including the pre-agreement issued by the Negotiating Committee for the Enagás Group's 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement and the system of misconduct and penalties applicable to the Enagás Group.\n\nFor professionals not included in the Enagás Group's collective bargaining agreement, the regulations governing working conditions in general are those outlined in the Spanish Workers' Statute. However, those conditions of the Enagás Group collective bargaining agreement that improve on those established in the Workers' Statute are applicable to 100% of the workforce.\n\n#### Percentage of professionals covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement by professional group at year-end(1)\n\n|                          | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Technicians              | 25.4%  | 26.2%  | 27.8%  |\n| Administrative workforce | 84.5%  | 84.5%  | 86.0%  |\n| Operational workforce    | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n| Total                    | 48.4%  | 50.8%  | 51.6%  |\n\n(1) These data refer to professionals in Spain.\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/21 description: The image shows a blue icon of a computer mouse with a cursor hovering over it.

These surveys are carried out regularly every two years.\n\nThat year, participation by our professionals increased compared to the previous survey, reaching 77% (73% in 2020). Overall professional satisfaction stood at 72% (82% in 2020) and the sustainable engagement index at 82% (91% in 2020), the latter remaining in line with external benchmarks.\n\nAs conclusions of the results of the climate survey, 94% of professionals consider Enagás a good place to work, and most of them understand how their work contributes to the business objectives. In addition, the categories of 'stakeholder orientation', 'sustainable engagement' and 'internal relations' are highly rated. The categories 'inclusion and diversity', 'well-being' and 'stakeholder orientation' are the most stable categories compared to the previous survey.\n\nIn 2023, to continued with the Global Listening Strategy, the following actions were taken:\n\n- Establishment of action plans derived from the areas for improvement found through the climate survey.\n- Launch of a brief survey to monitor the organisation's climate; by randomly selecting a representative sample of the company (50% of the workforce), this survey aimed to gather the views of Enagás persons in order to continue identifying opportunities for\n\nimprovement and deepen the degree of knowledge of the professionals on the projects implemented by the company. The initiative, in line with the Enagás Transformation Plan, aims to strengthen the commitment and development of people in order to continue growing as a company.\n\nThis survey had a 68% participation rate and showed improvement in most categories compared to 2022, with a sustainable commitment of 85% (three points higher than 2022).\n\n• Launch of a specific survey on social benefits and work-life balance measures aimed at all professionals; this had a 64% participation rate. The purpose of this survey was to give Enagás professionals the opportunity to share their thoughts on a series of measures provided by Enagás to support co-responsibility and facilitate work-life balance. This survey also allowed us to find out what impact these measures and social benefits had on the employee value proposition. 73% of professionals believe that the work-life balance measures offered by Enagás have a high impact on its employee value proposition. 85% of Enagás professionals positively value work-life balance measures/social benefits as an additional part of their salary.\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/17 description: The image is a red logo for \"Top Employer Spain 2024\".

This system, which is subject to internal audits and external certification, covers 100% of the professionals and contractors (more than 3,850 people in 2023) who carry out work on Enagás infrastructures. [GRI 403-1, GRI 403-7, GRI 403-8]\n\nEnagás also has a Road Traffic Safety Management System certified in accordance with ISO 39001. In this area, the company has a Mobility and Road Safety Plan, guidelines in this area and a protocol for vehicle use. There is also a Sustainable and Safe Fleet Management Manual and a Guide to Good Road Safety Practices for fleet management.\n\nEnagás promotes safety throughout its supply chain and requires ISO 45001 certification in its approval process for suppliers of certain families of products or services (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)' section in this chapter). Additionally, in order to guarantee the coordination of business activities and the coordination of health and safety on building projects, the company has the Enagás Contractor Access System (SACE) to manage the safety of its suppliers, contractors and the whole subcontracting chain. This system offers contractors the operating safety procedures applicable to the possible risks involved in the works they perform. [GRI 403-7]\n\nProfessionals and contractors have access to various channels through which they can participate in and consult the operation, implementation and assessment of the management system. These include the bulletin board, forms, meetings, internal memos, informational pamphlets, posters and/or electronic communications, as well as any other method that can be documented and guarantees receipt by the intended recipient. Additionally, there are cross-company and cascading communication channels that also cover health and safety issues. Enagás also has a chatbot (virtual assistant) to answer the most frequently asked health and safety questions (see the 'Commitment to stakeholders' section in the '[Sustainable Management Mode](#page-54-0)l' section in this chapter). [GRI 403-4]\n\nEnagás has various employee representative bodies where they may exercise their participation and consultation rights. Different committees comprise health and safety officers and management representatives. The Health and Safety Committees<sup>24</sup> meet every three months, while the Group and Enagás Transporte SAU Intercentre Health and Safety Committees meet with a frequency set out in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. A chatbot and an email account for suggestions and questions are also available to all professionals. [GRI 403-4]\n\n#### Awareness-raising [GRI 403-5]\n\nIn 2023, a total of 12,206 hours of health and safety training were provided (13,955 hours in 2022); 60% of employees received training (69% in 2022).\n\nHealth and Safety training is a key part of any preventative action to improve worker awareness and protection from the hazards that may be present in daily operations. This is why Enagás has designed a training schedule for all different job profiles at the company that sets out the specific training activities needed for each risk group. In 2023, these activities notably included training regarding work with dangerous goods, explosive atmospheres, storage of chemical products, hygiene and ergonomics, first aid and road safety, among others.\n\n#### 06/2023\n\n**For World Road Safety Day, which is commemorated every year on June 10, Enagás organised various initiatives to raise awareness among its professionals so that they exercise the greatest caution behind the wheel** \n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, more than 70 informational messages were sent to all Enagás personnel through the corporate mailbox with info bites promoting health programmes (the Steppers challenge, vaccines, etc.), offering talks on a range of topics (sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, etc.), and more [GRI 403-4, GRI 403-6]\n\nIn 2023, Enagás carried on the \"Guide Project\" campaign to guide employees towards a culture of health and safety through the acquisition of knowledge and good habits that enable people to maintain their well-being in the professional and personal spheres. The actions launched within the framework of this project include an awareness-raising campaign on best safety practices promoted by the members of the Executive Committee, as well as informative videos on hydrogen safety challenges, what to do in case of a safety incident and work with electrical hazards.\n\nEnagás is also providing training to all its contractors through the SACE platform. This training is complemented to the face-to-face chats at infrastructure facilities where particularly hazardous work may be carried out. In 2023, 5,480 hours of training (5,656 hours in 2022) were delivered through the SACE platform to 2,742 contractors from 732 contractor companies.\n\nSee the **[Health and Safety](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**[,](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf) **[Environment and Quality Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**, as well as the Prevention of Major Accidents Policy and the **[Corporate Road Safety Guidelines](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Directrices%20Corporativas%20Seguridad%20Vial%20en.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n<sup>24</sup> Health and Safety Committees are established, as per regulation, for centres with more than 50 workers, in those centres with less than 50 employees at which there is a Prevention Delegate, health and safety meetings are held on a regular basis.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/5 description: The image shows the Enagas logo.

In the latter case, the methodology is associated with a special operational instruction that makes it possible to quantify the magnitude of the existing risks and to define their correction priority.\n- Procedures for the assessment of industrial risks based on different methodologies, such as HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study), a risk and operability assessment technique that permits the identification of potential and operational risks produced by system deviations from design conditions; SIL (Safety Integrity Level), a technique for assessing safety levels by assigning the required safety integrity level to each instrumented safety function and verifying that it meets the safety requirements of that level; 'What If', a technique for easily identifying potential hazards, assessing the significance of hazards and the adequacy of existing safeguards; risk analysis methodology for facilities under the SEVESO Directive, a methodology for assessing explosion risk which enables the assessment of both the existence and likelihood of the formation of an explosive atmosphere and the\n\nexistence and likelihood of activation for all possible sources of ignition.\n\nFor routine work, in addition to the general risk assessment, specific risk assessments are available for newly implemented maintenance ranges or operating instructions.\n\n• Safety inspections (planned observations, safety visits and safety walks) and work permits are other procedures that make up the Enagás management system, in which hazards are identified and risks evaluated.\n\nThese risk assessments are reviewed when there is a change that requires it or every five years, according to the associated procedures. These assessments are carried out by competent technicians according to national regulations, and the process is verified through internal and external health and safety audits.\n\nThe most representative risks of our activity are those related to work in classified areas (areas where there is a potential for explosion and/ or fire due to the presence of gases, vapours or dusts in the atmosphere) and those associated with driving.\n\nFollowing any risk assessment, corrective actions are established to mitigate the relevant identified risks, and the effectiveness of the action is subsequently evaluated. These results are reviewed by management and may lead to improvements in the management system.\n\nThe specific assessment for road safety and the mobility plan were also revised in 2023.\n\nThe review of psychosocial risk assessments planned for 2023-2025 has also begun. This fiscal year, 600 professionals were assessed using both quantitative and qualitative data, the latter involving more than 100 individual interviews. Preliminary results to date show favourable results in areas such as worker interest and compensation, psychological demands and autonomy. In 2024 and 2025, the psychosocial assessment of the rest of our professionals will continue, as will the establishment and implementation of corrective actions to manage the identified areas with the greatest room for improvement.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/97/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in gray font on the left side of the image.

There are various channels for establishing these communications, such as Health and Safety Committees and meetings, workers' representatives, an electronic suggestion mailbox available to all professionals, and coordination meetings with contractors, through the prevention service or through those directly responsible, and a specific mailbox enabled on the SACE platform for contractors and suppliers. Along these lines, continuous sensitivity-raising and awareness-raising campaigns are carried out with the aim of promoting a culture of risk observation and hazard warnings where necessary.\n\nIf a situation involving an imminent, major risk is identified, professionals are obligated to stop working, remain in a safe location and notify their direct supervisor of the situation.\n\nEnagás has a procedure for action, notification, investigation and statistical analysis of all incidents.\n\nIf the following circumstances arise, a specialised investigation using a cause analysis methodology is carried out, which generates a specific register:\n\n- Incidents with a risk score above a specific level, established according to the method included in the procedure.\n- By request of the Intercentre Health and Safety Committee and/or the Health and Safety Committee of the facility, the chain of command or the Prevention Service.\n- Major or fatal accidents.\n- Major accidents according to RD 840/2015.\n\nFollowing the investigation, a report is produced including the causes of the incident, the potential risk assessment, the corrective actions identified, the persons responsible for carrying out and monitoring the corrective measures (including those that affect the risk assessment review or changes to the management system), as well as resources and timelines, following the procedure for managing corrective actions.\n\nThe criteria used for recording and consolidating reported accident data is based on the OSHA standard.\n\nSee the **[Health and Safety](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**[,](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf) **[Environment and Quality Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Safety-health-environment-and-quality-policy.pdf)**, the **[General Policy on the Integrated Security of Strategic](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)  [Infrastructures](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)** and the Prevention of Major Accidents Policy on the corporate website.\n\n[GRI 403-2, GRI 403-9]\n\n## Resilience: crisis management, business continuity and emergencies\n\nEnagás is moving towards a resilient management model, promoting improvements in different areas such as crisis management, business continuity management and accident and emergency management. This model makes it possible to increase the company's capacity to adapt to a changing environment, reducing the time required to act and recover from the possible appearance of a disruptive situation.\n\nEnagás periodically updates its Crisis Management Standard, adapting it to new risks, policies and emerging businesses, establishing various action committees to control incidents depending on the degree of severity and consequences of each scenario. As part of its Global Security Plan, the company organises annual crisis management drills, which enable it to train its professionals at both the technical and highest executive level. Likewise, to facilitate its response capacity, Enagás has maps of both corporate and local stakeholders so that, in the event of a hypothetical crisis situation, both the key people and the communication channels are identified, enabling efficient management.\n\nDuring the year 2023, we continued to promote business continuity, establishing different actions within the company's Transformation Plan that will enable it to achieve improvements in this area.\n\nEnagás also periodically reviews its emergency and self-protection plans and establishes emergency collaboration agreements with the authorities in each Autonomous Community through the signing of agreements in order to achieve a rapid, effective response in the event of a possible crisis situation.\n\nEmergency plans are sent to the relevant public administrations so that they can be taken into account in external emergency plans and in for any communication of information of public interest that may be required.\n\n**Enagás is moving towards a resilient management model, promoting improvements in different areas such as crisis management, business continuity management and accident and emergency management** \n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/98/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left side of the image.

This policy is implemented at the company through internal procedures and controls.\n\n## See the **[Cybersecurity Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Cibersecurity%20policy.pdf)** on our corporate website.\n\nThe Enagás information security management model is applicable to cybersecurity, based on international and national regulations and the continued assessment of cyber risk. This provides, through all means within its reach and in proportion to the threats detected, the resources required so that the organisation has an environment that is aligned with business targets and the cybersecurity targets established. The Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for supervising the company's cybersecurity, and therefore periodically reports to this Committee on the established cyber risk indicators and other relevant matters. [GRI 2-13]\n\nEnagás also has a Cybersecurity Committee chaired by a member of the Executive Committee, which reports quarterly to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Executive Committee on the actions taken to mitigate risk.\n\nIn 2022, Enagás approved its 2022-2024 Strategic Cybersecurity Plan, which establishes the policies to be followed to help ensure a secure, reliable cyberspace, using a 360º approach. For this reason, in 2023, the company has continued to carry out different informative and training actions that contributed to greater awareness and involvement among all professionals, aimed at improving professionals' detection and reaction skills.\n\nEnagás has a cybersecurity management model with segregation of duties between government and operation, as well as a Cybersecurity Master Plan with a three-year scope that is reviewed annually. This plan has been updated in accordance with the requirements of Royal Decree 43/2021; it has designated a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) with the relevant administrative body.\n\nThis Master Plan, based on the results of the risk analysis, is focused on improving the resilience of Enagás' information systems. It also facilitates secure teleworking without affecting the company's normal operations, works on digitalisation-related inertia and the growing migration to cloud solutions.\n\n#### 12/2023\n\n**Enagás has launched a Cyber Awareness platform to make cybersecurity content even more familiar to our professionals. Through this mandatory training space, Enagás professionals are trained to protect their digital lives, both professionally and personally.** \n\n## **In 2023, Enagás launched a Cyber Awareness platform to make cybersecurity content even more familiar to our professionals**\n\nEnagás has a reporting procedure that professionals can follow if they encounter any suspicious situation. Additionally, Enagás carries out periodic phishing simulation exercises to assess its professionals' awareness levels and tailor training measures as needed.\n\nCurrently, Enagás has renewed the ISO 27001:2013 certification for its logistics and commercial systems, gas pipeline control systems and industrial control systems for each type of infrastructure that it operates. In 2023 and 2024, Enagás is updating its management system to the new version of the ISO 27001:2022 standard.\n\nEnagás has implemented procedures to prevent incidents in its technological infrastructure; likewise, it has implemented continuity plans to guarantee the continuity of normal systems operation in the event of changes and incidents and to guarantee rapid recovery. These plans are tested on an ongoing basis throughout the year.\n\nEnagás also takes a series of other actions to ensure the soundness of its information security management systems and IT infrastructures, such as the simulation of cyber-attacks and vulnerability analysis by third parties, audits of the control environment of the information systems that support important processes during the audit of the company's accounts, and so on.\n\nEnagás also manages cyber risks in the life cycle of its suppliers. This enables it to enhance cybers[ec](#page-147-0)urity measures in industrial information systems (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)['](#page-147-0) section in this chapter).\n\nAs enhanced protection for the critical infrastructures operated by Enagás, a General Policy on the Integrated Security of Strategic Infrastructures has been defined in which the processes of physical and logical security have been combined for compliance with Law 8/2011 governing the Protection of Critical Infrastructure (LPIC) and Royal Decree-Law 12/2018 on the security of network and information systems (NIS). Enagás is working towards the full adoption of the requirements of EU Directive 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, as well as the Good Cybersecurity Governance Code published by the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).\n\nSee the\nInfrastructure\n\nSee the **[General Policy on the Integrated Security of Strategic](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)  [Infrastructures](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica%20de%20seguridad%20integral%20en%20infraestructuras%20estrategicas%20EN.pdf)** on our corporate website.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/99/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the logo for \"enagas\" on the right.

    |\n\nWith regard to natural capital dependencies, Enagás depends on the ecosystems in which its infrastructures are located, so that alterations to these - such as earth movements, flooding, etc., caused by extreme temperature phenomena - constitute a physical risk.\n\nOn an environmental aspect level, energy consumption (natural gas and electricity) is key to carrying out our work and is therefore our main natural capital dependency, alongside the land on which our infrastructures are located. They are also the source of our main environmental impact, greenhouse gas emissions. Within the framework of its ISO 50001-certified energy management system, Enagás analyses the most significant energy consumption in terms\n\nof facilities and equipment, as well as their dependence on the main variables, enabling us to establish and prioritise the energy efficiency initiatives with the greatest impact (see the ['](#page-60-0)[Climate action and](#page-60-0)  [energy efficiency](#page-60-0)['](#page-60-0) section).\n\nConstruction projects generate the company's main impacts on biodiversity. During these projects, Enagás carries out activities for the protection and conservation of flora and fauna species, in accordance with the impact mitigation hierarchy, aimed at preserving ecosystems and their biodiversity. Such activities start with on-site reconnaissance before any work commences in order to check for the presence or absence of species along the route.

These projects restored 100% of the affected land, returning it to its previous state as soon as possible after its alteration. This minimises the risk of erosion and helps re-establish the land's natural watershed, as well as the state of affected habitats and the landscape. In 2023, as a result of construction projects, 133,582  $m^2$  have been disturbed, of which 127,003  $m^2$  have been restored and 52,586  $m^2$  have been revegetated<sup>30</sup>. In addition, 31,301  $m^2$  corresponding to an area disturbed in 2022 have been revegetated in 2023. In 2024, Enagás will continue to work towards the reclamation of the remaining surface area.

For this reason, the company has joined the new Pact for Biodiversity and Natural Capital with the highest level of commitment. This initiative is backed by the Spanish Business and Biodiversity Initiative (IEEB), which is coordinated by the Biodiversity Foundation of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO).** \n\n## **Enagás' biodiversity strategy establishes the objective of no net loss of biodiversity by 2040 and net positive impact on nature by 2050**\n\n### Applying the LEAP process of the TNFD framework to infrastructure operation\n\nIn order to make progress towards meeting our positive impact on nature targets, work was carried out during 2023 on the implementation of the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) process from the TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures) framework. The results obtained are detailed in the following sections.\n\nEnagás is, in turn, using this LEAP process as a base, especially in the location and evaluation phases. This allows it to start valuing the potential natural capital impacts associated with the development of the identified business opportunities starting from a project's v[e](#page-60-0)ry [e](#page-60-0)arly phases (see section on climate risks and opportunities in the '[Climate action and efficiency energy](#page-60-0)['](#page-60-0) section in this chapter).\n\n#### **Sensitive locations**\n\nKnowing in which protected areas we work, as well as the species that live in the areas of influence of our facilities, is fundamental to being able to manage our activities properly, assessing the possible effects in order to prevent impacts and adopt mitigation measures or undertake recovery and conservation projects.\n\nOur infrastructures are mainly located in terrestrial (41%) and freshwater (32%) biomes<sup>31</sup> Of the terrestrial ecosystems, 50% of the installations are located in cultivated areas and temperate forests. Of the freshwater biomes, around 60% are located in man-made ecosystems and wetlands.\n\nTaking into account the different parameters associated with geographic information layers (GIS)<sup>32</sup>, we identified that a high percentage of installations are located in sensitive areas, especially in places with high biodiversity intactness and water stress.\n\n<sup>30</sup> In 2022, 536,619  $m^2$  of the 1,679,201  $m^2$  disturbed were restored.\n\n<sup>31</sup> Source: UICN Global Ecosystem Typology.\n\n<sup>32</sup> Ecosystem integrity: the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) GIS layer is used to show the presence of protected natural areas. Biodiversity importance: the GIS Biodiversity Inactness Index (BII) layer is used to show the presence of areas rich in biodiversity where there are high risks associated with the loss or deterioration of nature. Water stress: the Overall Water Risk (OWR) layer is used to show water-stressed areas, both in terms of water quantity and quality.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/103/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Of the facilities located within critical biodiversity protection areas, the Gaviota and Serrablo underground storage facilities stand out, both of which have a specific biodiversity management plan covering the entire surface area of both facilities (0.11  $km^2$ ). [GRI 304-1]\n\nEnagás conducts biodiversity impact assessments at all of its aboveground facilities (800 operating facilities, which occupy a surface area of 3.5  $km^2$ ), as well as at construction projects carried out at the facilities and in pipeline areas. The entire surface area is assessed for this on a regular basis (installations and construction projects).\n\nEnagás has also identified the endangered species included on the IUCN Red List with habitats in the areas where it operates in order to prevent effects on them. The following table shows the number of IUCN Red List species identified around Enagás' facilities, without this signifying any impact or threat derived from the company's activity.

Therefore, after identifying and assessing the impacts and dependencies during operation, based on the five drivers of biodiversity loss identified by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), we conclude that 56% of the pipelines are classified as priority because they are located in protected areas.\n\n#### **Impacts and dependencies on priority locations and monitoring metrics** [GRI304-2]\n\nThe following table shows the impacts and dependencies identified in priority locations during infrastructure operation, as well as the monitoring metrics identified, both in terms of the state of nature (assessment of the variations in ecosystem conditions generated by Enagás via its activity) and ecosystem services (assessment of changes in the provision of environmental goods and services in places where the company operates).\n\n#### Impacts and dependencies associated with operations\n\n|

company's materiality analysis and risk assessment processes,\n\n### Type of risk\n\nidentifies and assesses the risk level of each of the risks associated with nature and biodiversity with a scope based on the location of its infrastructure (for more information on ESG risks and their integration in the company's global risk model, see the '[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)' chapter). Thus, the physical risks identified are associated with dependence on ecosystems; the regulatory and reputational risks identified are associated with impacts on ecosystems, and some of them are associated with specific environmental aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions or protected species, as shown in the table below.\n\nThe scope of this analysis is limited to areas where our own operations are conducted, as well as adjacent areas. To carry out this analysis, Enagás has taken the TNFD framework as a base.

It also has an industrial liability policy that covers compensation payments to third parties arising from sudden, accidental and unforeseen pollution or contamination with a limit of 300 million euros per claim. [GRI 3-3]\n\n#### Environmental management\n\nEnagás undertakes its environmental commitments (as outlined in the Health and Safety, Environment and Quality Policy) via its environmental management system. 100% of Enagás activity is ISO 14001 certified.\n\nFurthermore, the Serrablo and Yela underground storage facilities and the Huelva and Barcelona LNG terminals are EMAS certified.\n\nIn line with the ISO 14001 standard, Enagás analyses environmental impacts through assessments of environmental aspects for construction, operation and maintenance activities. Environmental monitoring is carried out through audits, environmental surveillance programmes, assessments of legal compliance at all facilities and monitoring of environmental indicators and improvement plans.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/105/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enaga\" with a green and blue logo on the right.\n\nWhat is more, for infrastructure construction projects, and based on their type and on applicable regulations, environmental impact studies are carried out which include both the impacts themselves and the measures taken to mitigate them. All of this involves establishing consultation processes with stakeholders (see the ['](#page-133-0)[Local](#page-133-0)  [communities](#page-133-0)['](#page-133-0) section).\n\nAll of this enables us to identify the natural capital assets in which we have the greatest impact at facility level and to therefore prioritise environmental actions based on them.\n\n### Natural capital management\n\nEnagás has conducted an assessment of natural capital based on an analysis of environmental materiality at infrastructure level. In certain cases, a more detailed assessment is conducted to analyse the ecosystem services of the environment. This is the case of the Landscape Integration Study that was carried out prior to the construction of the Euskadour Compressor Station and which resulted in the identification of revegetation and recovery measures for soils, vegetation and water courses, with more than 900 species planted. [GRI 3-3]\n\n#### **Natural capital valuation study at the Euskadour Compressor Station** [GRI 304-2]\n\nEnagás has carried out a study to value and monetise environmental impacts at the facility. The project consisted of the following activities and conclusions:\n\n- Identification of the ecosystem services present in the environment and their indicators: mainly regulating services and, to a lesser extent, supply and cultural services.\n- Quantification of the variation of these services at three points in time: during construction, after the implementation of recovery and compensation measures, and after the permit period (25 years). It was found that the impact of construction on the ecosystem services provided by the environment was low thanks to the design and construction criteria used (as established in the Enagás Corporate Biodiversity Guidelines). In addition, measures implemented after construction and in the operating phase have resulted in a significant impact reduction, 64%, in regulating services, a percentage that will increase to 70% by the end of the period due to the effect of the measures.\n- Monetisation of residual debt, with a result of 1,457.55 euros and 1,234.38 euros at the beginning and end of the concession period, respectively.\n- Proposed compensation actions to neutralise this debt, which have been included in the company's biodiversity plan.\n\n#### **Collaborative projects and nature-based solutions**\n\nSince 2016, Enagás has been working on collaborative projects with different stakeholders (environmental companies, other companies, Public Administrations and farmers) to carry out vegetation control through the pasturing of range livestock (horses) along gas pipelines. [GRI 304-3]\n\nThe results obtained over the years have demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of the use of livestock, for example in the growth of plant cover resulting from the animals' activity.\n\nThis is the case for gas pipeline sections located in the province of Huesca, attached to the Caspe Transmission Centre and the Sabiñánigo Transmission Centre, and the sections located in the Alto Bernesga Biosphere Reserve (León). In these sections, regular grazing is used as the most sustainable solution for vegetation control, due to its high positive impact on the environment and the community:\n\n- Fertilisation and soil disturbance by livestock has a favourable effect on flora and fauna, increasing biodiversity. For this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is assessing its classification as a nature-based solution.\n- It means giving visibility to the ability of the livestock sector to provide ecosystem services.\n\nDuring 2023, the assessment of the natural capital impact of these actions began, with the aim of learning about differential biodiversity rates in areas with livestock activity compared to areas without it.\n\nTo this end, several samplings were carried out during the year to measure the following parameters:\n\n- Richness of plant biodiversity (herbaceous (including floristic richness), shrub and tree species) and arthropod biodiversity.\n- Visual vegetation cover.\n- Arthropod abundance.\n\nPrevious results obtained after sampling were favourable, reinforcing the positive effect of livestock on the biodiversity of the grazed area.\n\n#### **2023**\n\n**Enagás maintains a collaboration agreement with the environmental company Agrovidar and Red Eléctrica to replace the usual pruning and felling methods for biomass control with the use of extensive livestock pasturing. Two female farmers and their herds of cattle and horses will maintain 17 hectares of the Alto Bernesga biosphere reserve through which a Red Eléctrica and an Enagás line run.** \n\n**Regular grazing was shown to be the most sustainable alternative to regular logging and pruning because of its high positive impact on the environment and the community.** \n\n**The project is open to other companies, public entities, livestock farms and shepherd schools to replicate it in natural areas affected by infrastructures.** \n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nCircular Economy [GRI 306-2] At Enagás, we have signed the 'Circular Economy Pact', committing ourselves to promoting the transition towards a circular economy. To this end, we are working along the following lines: Actions aimed at process circularity: [GRI 306-2] Energy use and reducing the carbon footprint of our own and third-party production processes • Enagás' Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan, which has enabled us to reduce our carbon footprint by 48% compared to 2014 (see the ['Climate action and energy efficiency'](#page-60-0) section). • Electricity generation projects for our own and third-party consumption, using renewable energies, cleaner technologies and more efficient processes, through which we generated 9.1% of the electricity consumed in 2023 (see the ['Climate action and energy efficiency'](#page-60-0) section). • A project to make use of the residual cold produced by liquefied natural gas (LNG), making it possible for the residual cold produced in the regasification process of the LNG terminals to be used in thirdparty air conditioning installations or industrial processes, producing energy savings in energy costs and a reduction in the carbon footprint. Use of renewable energy • Integration of renewable gases into the Spanish and European Gas System through infrastructures, the promotion of a future hydrogen network in Europe and the creation of a market for renewable gases (see section '[Renewable gases](#page-25-0)' in the '[Decarbonisation and carbon neutrality'](#page-23-0) section of the '[Our](#page-16-0)  [commitment to the energy transition'](#page-16-0) chapter). • Hydrogen generation projects at LNG terminals for own consumption (see the '[Innovation and](#page-49-0)  [corporate venture'](#page-49-0) section in the '[Our commitment to the energy transition'](#page-16-0) chapter). • 100% of electricity consumption from guaranteed renewable energy beginning in 2021 (see the ['Climate action and energy efficiency'](#page-60-0) section). Life cycle optimisation for products and facilities. Recovery and extension of the useful life of auxiliary substances and incorporation of eco-design principles • Methanol water treatment plant at the Serrablo underground storage facility, which in 2023 recovered 8,366 litres of methanol. • Extension of the useful life of oils and lubricants used in the equipment of its facilities by cleaning and filtering these products. • Recycling of triethylene glycol (TEG) used in the gas drying process at underground storage facilities by subjecting it to a distillation process that optimises the life cycle of this product. • Incorporation of eco-design criteria in construction projects. • Use of the gas pipeline network route to install fibre optics. • Implementation of mechanical weeding in fields to replace water-diluted herbicides. [Report](#page-3-0)\n\nWater saving and efficiency • Rainwater capture systems in facilities used for fire suppression and irrigation. • Replacement of lawns with native vegetation at facilities for more responsible water use, which will allow us to reduce water consumption by up to 80% at two of the facilities with the highest consumption. Ecological remediation and ecosystem restoration • Biodiversity Strategy: adopt nature-based solutions to preserve, restore and manage ecosystems and species, contributing to climate change mitigation, resilience and adaptation with benefits for nature. • Reclamation and revegetation at 100% of infrastructure development projects with impacts on biodiversity. • Vegetation control through extensive livestock management along pipelines. Waste recovery and recycling • Waste recovery and recycling treatments required of waste managers, enabling us to recover 91.6% of waste in 2023. • Methanol water treatment plant at the Serrablo underground storage facility, which in 2023 treated 75,754 litres of this waste, recovering the methanol. The resulting water was injected back into the storage facility. Product reuse • Signing of a collaboration agreement with Oroel to research the development of new personal protective clothing from material already in use in order to give them a second useful life. • In 2023, disused furniture, outdated corporate material and more than 450 pairs of safety footwear were donated for further re-use. In addition, gifts left over from the General Shareholders' Meeting 2023 were donated. Raising awareness on the importance of moving towards a circular economy • Introduction of the concept of circular economy in environmental training courses. • Awareness-raising campaigns for contractors and Enagás professionals about separating and managing waste. • Awareness-raising campaigns on responsible consumption, highlighting campaigns to reduce water and energy consumption.\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/3 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light gray font.

Above the word \"enaga\" is a curved green line.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n#### Consumption of auxiliary materials\n\nEnagás does not consume raw materials in its production process; only ancillary materials are used. Enagás is committed to promoting the circular economy through the efficient use of these materials, reducing consumption, pollution, waste generation and its impact on the environment while encouraging innovation.\n\n#### Consumption of main auxiliary materials\n\n| Auxiliary material                | 2021        | 2022        | 2023    |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| Tetrahydrothiophene (THT) (kg)    | 432,202     | 440,839     | 391,783 |\n| Sodium hypochlorite (kg)          | 541,812 (1) | 523,882 (1) | 554,282 |\n| Chlorine dioxide (kg)             | 26,940      | 45,695      | 9,946   |\n| Methanol (litres)                 | 589,247     | 265,030     | 431,894 |\n| Triethylene glycol (TEG) (litres) | 9,369       | 2,050       | 3,127   |\n\n(1) Data recalculated to include the consumption of the Castor underground storage facility. [GRI 2-4]\n\nIn 2023, there was an increase in methanol consumption (63% compared to 2022) and in triethylene glycol consumption (53% compared to 2022). These products are used in the gas extraction process in underground storage facilities, and their variation is directly related to the increase in extraction activity (which increased more than 110% compared to 2022). The sum of the consumption of chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite, substances used as biocides in LNG terminals, did not change significantly compared to the previous year.\n\n## Waste generation and management\n\n[GRI 3-3, GRI 306-1]\n\nThe waste generated by Enagás is mostly associated with the maintenance of facilities and equipment, and is mainly liquid waste.\n\nEnagás has implemented a system of segregation, management, storage and delivery to authorised managers of\n\nhazardous and non-hazardous waste who manage the waste outside the company's facilities. However, in 2023, 2.56% of waste was treated in-house at Enagás (75,754 litres of water with methanol treated in the methanol regeneration unit of the Serrablo underground storage).\n\nIn 2023, Enagás obtained the 'Zero Waste' certification from AENOR<sup>33</sup>, which recognises the company's progress in maximising the volume of waste recycled or recovered, as well as minimising the waste generated. Therefore, in its various contracts with waste managers, the company has set out the treatments to be applied to each waste product in line with applicable legislation and its commitments, which include the target of treating (recycling/ recovering) a percentage equal to or greater than 90% of all hazardous and non-hazardous waste. In addition, Enagás has a plan with actions aimed at increasing the percentage of waste recovery at infrastructure facilities as well as concrete actions and objectives to minimise waste generation. These improvement actions are identified in the quarterly and annual monitoring that Enagás carries out of all waste at its facilities, as well as during the waste environmental aspect assessment. Enagás provides all the necessary resources, both material and human, to ensure they are carried out.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás implemented a waste management platform that guarantees better traceability of the treatment of the waste generated, greater control of management documentation in accordance with the requirements of each autonomous community and optimal communication with government.\n\nFor years, Enagás has been implementing measures to reduce waste generation and improve waste treatment, as well as holding regular campaigns to raise awareness of this issue. [GRI 306-2, GRI 306-4, GRI 306-5]\n\n## **Enagás has recycled/recovered 91.6% of all waste generated**\n\nImage /page/107/Figure/22 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the amount of recovery/recycling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2021, the amount of non-hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,121, and the amount that was disposed of was 123. In 2021, the amount of hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 3,892, and the amount that was disposed of was 62. In 2022, the amount of non-hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,304, and the amount that was disposed of was 180. In 2022, the amount of hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 928, and the amount that was disposed of was 51. In 2023, the amount of non-hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,503, and the amount that was disposed of was 128. In 2023, the amount of hazardous waste that was recovered/recycled was 1,207, and the amount that was disposed of was 121. The total amounts for each category are also displayed above each bar.\n\nWaste generated and managed by type of waste (tonnes) [GRI 306-3, GRI 306-4, GRI 306-5]\n\n(1) Data recalculated to include the waste generated at the Castor underground storage facility.

The waste that has been disposed of is of various types, many of which are difficult to recover (asbestos, aqueous cleaning liquids and aqueous waste containing hydrocarbons). Enagás continues to work with waste managers to increase this percentage as much as possible.\n\nIn 2023, the hazardous waste generated increased by 36% compared to the previous year due to the increase in waste water with methanol (liquid industrial waste), which represents more than 60% of Enagás' hazardous waste. This waste is generated in underground storage facilities during the extraction period. Therefore, this waste is generated proportionally to the storage extraction activity, depending also\n\non the amount of water contained in the wells. In 2023, extraction activity increased more than 110% compared to the previous year; consequently, the amount of this waste has increased. In 2023, the volume of waste water containing hydrocarbons also increased significantly due to a specific incident that occurred during the startup of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal. A quantity of oil was spilt, which, although initially relatively little, became a larger volume due to heavy rainfall in the area.\n\nOn the other hand, the volume of non-hazardous waste generated increased by 10% compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in septic tank sludge (non-industrial liquid waste). 100% of this waste has been recycled/recovered.\n\n#### Waste generated and managed by waste typology and waste destination (t)\n\n[GRI 306-3, GRI 306-4, GRI 306-5]\n\n| Type of waste | Waste destination    |                                        | 2021     | 2022     | 2023     |\n|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Non-hazardous | Recovery / recycling | Preparation for re-use                 | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Recycling                              | 1,068.10 | 1,285.05 | 1,391.53 |\n|               |                      | Other recovery operations(1)           | 52.50    | 19.14    | 111.91   |\n|               |                      | Total recovery/recycling               | 1,120.60 | 1,304.19 | 1,503.44 |\n|               | Disposal             | Incineration (with energy recovery)    | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Incineration (without energy recovery) | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Transfer to a landfill                 | 25.07    | 28.53    | 22.13    |\n|               |                      | Other disposal operations(1)           | 98.28    | 151.87   | 105.63   |\n|               |                      | Total elimination                      | 123.35   | 180.40   | 127.76   |\n| Total waste   |                      |                                        | 1,243.95 | 1,484.59 | 1,631.20 |\n| Hazardous     | Recovery / recycling | Preparation for re-use                 | 0.42     | 0.09     | 0.01     |\n|               |                      | Recycling(1)                           | 3,855.96 | 893.57   | 1,120.75 |\n|               |                      | Other recovery operations(1)           | 36.15    | 34.64    | 86.21    |\n|               |                      | Total recovery/recycling               | 3,892.53 | 928.30   | 1,206.97 |\n|               | Disposal             | Incineration (with energy recovery)    | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     |\n|               |                      | Incineration (without energy recovery) | 0.80     | 0.49     | 1.80     |\n|               |                      | Transfer to a landfill                 | 6.62     | 4.91     | 15.64    |\n|               |                      | Other disposal operations              | 54.72    | 45.73    | 102.93   |\n|               |                      | Total elimination                      | 62.14    | 51.13    | 120.37   |\n| Total waste   |                      |                                        | 3,954.67 | 979.43   | 1,327.34 |\n\n(1) Data for 2021 and 2022 have been recalculated to include the waste generated at the Castor underground storage facility.

In 2023, 98%<sup>35</sup> was recovered thanks to these corrective measures, and there was therefore no environmental impact.\n\n## Water management[GRI 3-3, GRI 303-1]\n\nAt Enagás, we do not consume water in our production processes. The company has therefore not stated significant aspects linked to water shortages in the yearly assessments that are conducted in line with the environmental management model.\n\nThe main withdrawal of water that Enagás carries out is that of seawater for use in floodwater vaporisers or at LNG terminals. The volume of water taken is directly proportional to the quantity of gas regasified. This seawater accounts for 99.9% of the total water withdrawn and is returned in such a way that its nature is maintained (the decrease in temperature is minimal and does not\n\n#### )\n\nImage /page/109/Figure/17 description: This image shows a bar graph titled \"Seawater withdrawn and returned to its source (hm3)\". The x-axis shows the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The y-axis shows the amount of seawater withdrawn and returned to its source in hm3. The graph shows the amount of seawater withdrawn and returned to its source for four different LNG terminals: Barcelona LNG terminal, Cartagena LNG terminal, Huelva LNG terminal, and El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal. In 2021, the amount of seawater withdrawn and returned to its source for Barcelona LNG terminal was 67.0 hm3, for Cartagena LNG terminal was 54.8 hm3, for Huelva LNG terminal was 95.3 hm3, and for El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal was 0.0 hm3. In 2022, the amount of seawater withdrawn and returned to its source for Barcelona LNG terminal was 103.2 hm3, for Cartagena LNG terminal was 82.8 hm3, for Huelva LNG terminal was 120.7 hm3, and for El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal was 0.0 hm3. In 2023, the amount of seawater withdrawn and returned to its source for Barcelona LNG terminal was 89.2 hm3, for Cartagena LNG terminal was 58.1 hm3, for Huelva LNG terminal was 96.7 hm3, and for El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal was 26.5 hm3. The image also shows the limits for each LNG terminal: Barcelona LNG terminal limit is 490.5 hm3, Cartagena LNG terminal limit is 297.8 hm3, Huelva LNG terminal limit is 170 hm3, and El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal limit is 213.7 hm3.\n\n\\*Legal extraction limit established for each LNG terminal.\n\nIn 2023, seawater extracted at LNG terminals has decreased by 12% compared to 2022, in line with the lower level of regasification activity at these facilities, which was 19% lower than in 2022.\n\n110\n\n<sup>34</sup> The following accidental spills occurred in 2022: five fuel spills (60.7 litres in total), one chemical spill (2 litres in total) and nine oil spills (751 litres in total). <sup>35</sup> It has not been possible to decontaminate or treat 12 litres of oil due to the nature of the spill.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n\n#### Water drawn from other sources (m<sup>3</sup>)<sup>(1)</sup> [\\[GRI 303-3\\]](#page-59-0)\n\nImage /page/110/Figure/2 description: The image is a bar chart comparing the amount of water from different sources in 2021, 2022, and 2023. The water sources are surface water, groundwater, and water from the municipal network. In 2021, the amount of surface water is 1,710, the amount of groundwater is 11,830, and the amount of water from the municipal network is 66,041. In 2022, the amount of surface water is 1,243, the amount of groundwater is 7,888, and the amount of water from the municipal network is 59,547. In 2023, the amount of surface water is 3,428, the amount of groundwater is 6,530, and the amount of water from the municipal network is 89,465.\n\n(1) Data for 2021 and 2022 have been recalculated to include water withdrawn at the Castor underground storage facility. [GRI 2-4]\n\nIn 2023, water drawn from the municipal network increased due to the start-up of the El Musel E-Hub LNG terminal (whose consumption increased by 120% compared to 2022) and minor leaks and incidents at several facilities, all of which have been resolved. This has prevented the achievement of the 5% municipal water reduction target set for 2023. Enagás also draws water from other sources, mainly for sanitary use, irrigation and fire-fighting equipment. Of the 99,423 m<sup>3</sup> of municipal water used in 2023 for these applications, 18,398 m<sup>3</sup> have been discharged. This water is mainly discharged into the sewage system and septic tanks, in the latter case complying with all the limit values established by the relevant authorities. As a result, no improvements in wastewater quality have been identified. [GRI 303-4]\n\nWater consumption in 2023 was 101,136 m<sup>3</sup> (including the 9,254 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater captured at the Barcelona LNG terminal for desalination)<sup>36</sup>, a figure that represents only 0.04% of the total water withdrawn. [GRI 303-5]\n\nEnagás also has fire suppression water tanks at its facilities, with an estimated volume of stored water of 10,857 m<sup>3</sup>. At the Denia and Lumbier compressor stations, these basins are filled using recycled rainwater.\n\n### **Enagás' main water intake is seawater, which is fully returned in the state which it was withdrawn**\n\nEnagás has been implementing measures to reduce water consumption for years, as well as holding regular campaigns to raise awareness of this issue, including the implementation in 2023 of mechanical weeding in fields to replace water-diluted pesticide application at two facilities (its extension to other applicable facilities is being assessed), as well as the continuation of measures to reduce consumption in the event of drought at the Barcelona LNG terminal. Each year, Enagás carries out individualised monitoring of quarterly consumption trends at its facilities in order to identify improvements in water efficiency. On the basis of this monitoring, Enagás has set targets to reduce water consumption at facilities that exceed the average consumption of the last three years. Together, this means that 2024's overall target will reduce domestic water consumption by 2% compared to 2023. [GRI 3-3, GRI 303-1, GRI 303-2]\n\n### Air pollution [GRI 3-3, GRI 305-7]\n\nThe main non-greenhouse gases emitted at our facilities are CO, SOX, NOX, PM10 particles and Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC). These emissions are produced by the consumption of natural gas and diesel by various pieces of equipment and, therefore, are directly related to CO2 emissions. Energy efficiency measures and CO2 emission reduction targets (see the '[Climate action and energy](#page-60-0) [efficiency](#page-60-0)' section) are directly related to the reduction of these atmospheric emissions.\n\n#### Non-GHG emissions (tonnes) (1)(2)\n\nImage /page/110/Figure/13 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the levels of different pollutants in the air from 2021 to 2023. The pollutants are CO, NOx, SOx, PM10, and NMVOC. In 2021, the levels were: CO: 35, NOx: 217, SOx: 3, PM10: 3, NMVOC: 8. In 2022, the levels were: CO: 44, NOx: 329, SOx: 4, PM10: 3, NMVOC: 11. In 2023, the levels were: CO: 41, NOx: 249, SOx: 4, PM10: 5, NMVOC: 10.\n\n(1) Enagás does not emit the following compounds: Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). The source of the emission factors used for the calculation of these emissions is the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2023, by the European Environment Agency.\n\n(2) The data for 2021 and 2022 have been recalculated to include emissions from the Castor underground storage facility. [GRI 2-4]\n\nIn 2023, the decrease in non-greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year is directly related to the decrease in natural gas consumption (see the '[Climate action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' section), which has enabled Enagás to meet its 2023 target of reducing NOx emissions by 5% compared to 2022.\n\n<sup>36</sup> Of the 79,581 m<sup>3</sup> withdrawn in 2021 for these uses, 14,365 m<sup>3</sup> were discharged, meaning that water consumption totalled 69,770 m<sup>3</sup> (an amount that includes the 4,554 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater pumped at the Barcelona LNG terminal for desalination). Of the 68,678 m<sup>3</sup> withdrawn in 2022 for these uses, 16,602 m<sup>3</sup> were discharged, meaning that water consumption totalled 52,076 m<sup>3</sup> (an amount that includes the 1,350 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater pumped at the Barcelona LNG terminal for desalination).\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/111/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated\" and \"Annual Accounts\" stacked on top of each other.\n\nBy 2024, Enagás has set a target of reducing its NOx emissions by 5% compared to 2023, which it will achieve mainly through its Emissions Reduction and Energy Efficiency Plan. This will enable the company to achieve its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2040 and meet its emissions reduction targets.\n\nEnagás carries out regulatory and voluntary atmospheric checks (selfchecks) at all its combustion sites. The control actions are as follows:\n\n- Periodic regulatory inspections (conducted by an authorised inspection organisation (AIO).\n- Annual TESTO check carried out with their own resources (Analysing team and Enagás employees).\n\nBoth the regulatory inspections and the internal TESTO checks are planned annually for every facility as part of the 'Atmospheric Monitoring Programme'.\n\nNoise at Enagás' facilities is produced by the operation of regulators, turbines, vaporisers and pumps among others. Regular environmental noise measurements are carried out at all facilities, where legally required, around their perimeter to ensure that noise levels remain within the limits established in applicable legislation. In those cases where deviations are found, corrective actions are implemented (acoustic screens, silencers, soundproofing, etc.).\n\nWith regard to light pollution, Enagás has also reduced night-time lighting at its facilities by switching off the lighting at night, with the exception of LNG terminals, where minimum perimeter lighting is maintained.

This is all in accordance with the Conflict of Interest Policy, the provisions of current corporate and regulatory regulations and the Enagás Corporate Governance System, with the ultimate aim of avoiding potential conflicts of interest and ensuring full transparency in this regard. For more details on these mechanisms, see the '[Annual Corporate Governance Report](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)', section D.6.\n\n## See the **[Conflict of Interest Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Policy%20of%20Conflicts%20of%20Interest%202023.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nEvery year, an assessment of the Board is performed with the participation of an independent external expert. This assessment is performed objectively and from a best-practice viewpoint by means of questionnaires completed by all members of the Board. The conclusions of this phase are checked in interviews with the same Directors. The aim is to sustain and bolster the performance of the Board of Directors. For more details on the results of the assessment carried out during 2023, see the '[Annual Corporate Governance](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)  [Repor](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)t', sections C.1.17 and C.1.18.\n\nAs a result of the assessment, it was concluded that the Board of Directors performs its duties in accordance with best corporate governance practices.

The Remuneration Committee proposes the remuneration criteria, within the limits set forth in the Articles of Association and pursuant to the decisions taken at the General Shareholders' Meeting. The Committee also monitors the transparency of remuneration. Thus, in 2021, the General Shareholders' Meeting approved the new Directors' Remuneration Policy 2022-2024. This is largely a continuation of previous policies, maintaining their fundamental premises around the criteria of independence, stakeholder involvement (the remuneration report is put to a consultative vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting) and internal and external advice, incorporating best practices. The new Directors' Remuneration Policy 2025-2027 will be approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting in 2024.\n\n#### Remuneration of the Board of Directors in 2023 [GRI 2-19, GRI 2-20]\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors for their Board membership and those corresponding to the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer for the exercise of their executive and non-executive functions, respectively, during 2023 were approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024\", and was modified by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022, as Item 8 of the Agenda.\n\nThe Chairman, Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá, was beneficiary of the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on March 29, 2019 as Item 8 of the Agenda. During the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years, the aforementioned incentive was settled; a total of 25,061 gross shares were awarded in 2022 and 27,398 gross shares in 2023 (valued at 502 thousand euros), which will not vest until April 2024.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022 as item 9 of the Agenda, assigning him a total of 96,970 rights relating to shares. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Management Committee) are equally beneficiaries of the 2019-2021 Long-Term\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/117/Picture/5 description: The image contains the text \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a gray, sans-serif font.

In the terms approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, in the settlement of this incentive in the 2023 financial year, 29,239 gross shares and a cash incentive amount of 205 thousands of euros corresponded to them.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Executive Committee) are equally beneficiaries of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan. As approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, the Board has assigned them a total of 145,764 rights relating to shares as well as an incentive in cash amounting to approximately 1,000 thousands of euros. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nThe Group has outsourced its pension commitments with respect to its Senior Managers through a mixed group insurance policy for\n\npension commitments, including benefits in the event of survival, death, and employment disability. The Chairman was part of the group covered by this policy and of the total premium paid for this during 2022, 62 thousands of euros corresponded to him. The Chief Executive Officer does not have a pension commitment instrument, as he does not have an employment relationship with the company, but rather a commercial relationship. The Chief Executive Officer maintains an assimilated individual savings insurance at a cost of 222 thousands of euros.\n\nThe members of the Senior Management also form part of the group insured under the mixed group insurance policy for pension commitments. The total premium paid for the same during the financial year amounts to 698 thousands of euros.\n\nThe aforementioned remuneration, broken down for each member of the Board of Directors, without taking into account insurance premiums, is as follows:\n\n#### Remuneration of the Board of Directors (thousands of euros)[GRI 2-19]\n\n| Director                                                                    | 2023 (5) | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá (Chairman) (1)                                 | 730      | 1,594 |\n| Mr Arturo Gonzalo Aizpiri (Chief Executive Officer) (3) (4) (5)             | 2,152    | 969   |\n| Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (Proprietary Director) (4) | 160      | 160   |\n| Mr José Blanco López (Independent Director) (4)                             | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms Ana Palacio Vallelersundi (Independent Leading Director) (4)             | 190      | 190   |\n| Mr José Montilla Aguilera (Independent Director) (3) (4)                    | 175      | 175   |\n| Mr Cristóbal José Gallego Castillo (Independent Director) (4)               | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms Eva Patricia Úrbez Sanz (Independent Director) (4)                       | 160      | 160   |\n| Mr Santiago Ferrer Costa (Proprietary Director) (4)                         | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms Natalia Fabra Portela (Independent Director) (3) (4)                     | 160      | 160   |\n| Ms María Teresa Arcos Sánchez (Independent Director) (3) (4)                | 175      | 170   |\n| Mr David Sandalow (Independent Director) (3) (4)                            | 160      | 114   |\n| Ms Clara García Fernández- Muro (Independent Director) (3) (4)              | 160      | 113   |\n| Ms María Teresa Costa Campi (Independent Director) (3) (4)                  | 160      | 114   |\n| Mr Manuel Gabriel González Ramos (Independent Director) (3) (4)             | 160      | 113   |\n| Mr Ignacio Grangel Vicente (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | 0        | 44    |\n| Mr Gonzalo Solana González (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | 0        | 44    |\n| Mr Antonio Hernández Mancha (Independent Director) (3)(4)                   | 0        | 44    |\n| Ms Isabel Tocino Biscarolasaga (Independent Director) (3) (4)               | 0        | 44    |\n| Mr Marcelino Oreja Arburúa (former Chief Executive Officer) (2) (3)         | 0        | 431   |\n| Total                                                                       | 5,022    | 5,119 |\n\n(1) The remuneration of the Executive Chairman for the exercise of his executive duties during 2022 was approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years\" as approved as Item 10 of the Agenda as amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022 under Item 8 of the Agenda to cover his remuneration as non-executive Chairman as from that date. In 2023, the Chairman obtained fixed remuneration of 600 thousands of euros. He also obtained remuneration for Board membership amounting to 130 thousands of euros, totalling 730 thousands of euros, and a individual savings insurance at a cost of 62 thousands of euros.\n\n(2) The remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 financial year was approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years\", approved as Item 10 of the Agenda and modified by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022, as Item 8 of the Agenda. During financial year 2023, he obtained fixed remuneration of 1,000 thousands of euros and has accrued a variable remuneration of 583 thousands of euros. In addition, he obtained remuneration in the amount of 130 thousands of euros for Board membership, as well as other remuneration in kind amounting to 89 thousands of euros (the changes in remuneration in kind with respect to previous years are exclusively a result of measurement differences without there having been any additional items included in the remuneration), in addition, the company has implemented a 2022-2024 ILP of which the current Chief Executive Officer is beneficiary and whose settlement will take place as from 2025, under the terms explained in this report. During 2023 the Chief Executive Officer has accrued 350 thousand euros for this concept, totalling 2,152 thousand euros. In addition, he was also the beneficiary of a life insurance policy with a premium of 73 thousands of euros for the year. The Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. Item 9 of its Agenda states that the meeting assigned him a total of 96,970 performance shares or rights relating to shares. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's targets will be generated within thirty (30) days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025. In addition, the CEO maintains an individual savings insurance at a cost of 222 thousands of euros.\n\n(3) The remuneration for these Directors relating to Board and committee membership was approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting on March 31, 2022 as part of the proposal to modify the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023, and 2024 financial years\".\n\n(4) On February 21, 2022 the Board of Directors co-opted Mr Arturo Gonzalo Aizpiri as Executive Director to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the former Chief Executive Officer, Mr Marcelino Oreja Arburúa, on that date. On March 31, 2022, Mr Antonio Hernández Mancha, Mr Gonzalo Solana González, Mr Ignacio Grangel Vicente and Ms Isabel Tocino Biscarolasaga stepped down from their posts, while Mr David Sandalow, Mr Manuel González Ramos, Ms Clara García Fernández-Muro and Ms María Teresa Costa Campi were appointed as new Directors.\n\n(5) The average remuneration of Directors in 2023, broken down by sex, amounted to 343 thousands of euros for men and 168 thousands of euros for women. The difference in remuneration is due to the fact that the Chairman and the CEO are men (remuneration averaged 162 thousands of euros for men, excluding the Chairman and the CEO).\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-118-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n**[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/118/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in gray font.

[GRI 2-23, GRI 2-24, GRI 2-25]\n\nIn 2023, Enagás updated its Code of Ethics to incorporate best practices and ethical standards, highlighting the following aspects:\n\n- Adaptation of the Code of Ethics to the challenges posed by the development of the company's 2022-2030 Strategic Plan.\n- Adaptation of the Whistleblowing Line (Ethics Channel) to regulations which require that communications through it can be anonymous and will be handled confidentially; Enagás was already in compliance with this regulation.\n- Reinforcement of the message of the separation of Enagás' activities in the different areas in which it operates.\n- Inclusion of a section on sanctions, whereby Enagás reflects its firm commitment to comply with national and international sanctions and embargo regulations, as well as other regulations related to financial and commercial sanctions, and any others that may be applicable to us.\n\nIn line with this update, in 2024, all Enagás professionals will be asked to confirm via signature that they have read, are familiar with and understand the content of the new Enagás Group Code of Ethics (98% of professionals signed this declaration for the previous version).\n\nThe Enagás Group's Code of Ethics is developed through policies, guidelines, standards and procedures. As for the corporate policy management model, the Board of Directors is responsible for approving said policies, while the organisational units involved in the different matters are responsible for ensuring the implementation of the various commitments and their integration into internal procedures. [GRI 2-12. GRI 2-13, GRI 2-24]\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás updated its Code of Ethics to incorporate best practices and ethical standards**\n\nEnagás has the following procedures in place associated with the Code of Ethics:\n\n• Procedure for the functioning of the Ethical Compliance Committee. The Committee, functionally and directly dependent on the Board of Directors' Audit and Compliance Committee, has competencies relating to the Code of Ethics.\n\n- Procedure for managing the offering and acceptance of gifts, which states that professionals who offer or receive gifts are obligated to report them. This procedure establishes as a general rule that payments in kind - or any other benefit that, due to its value, properties or circumstances, is more than purely symbolic may not be made, offered or received.\n- Procedure for management of consultations and reporting regarding irregularities or breaches of the Ethics and Compliance Model in order to encourage compliance with the Code of Ethics and the regulations that govern its implementation. For this purpose, the company enables Enagás employees and the company's suppliers, contractors and those who collaborate with it or act on its behalf, including business partners, to resolve any doubts or to report any irregularities or breaches through one of the following channels or any other means the company may set up in the future (Whistleblowing Line), informing the party who made the report of the status of their report at all times.

In this area, although Enagás already had an Whistleblowing Line, it adapted it in 2023 to the new regulations, allowing communications to be anonymous and to be handled confidentially (they may not be disclosed to the reported party or to any third party without the consent of the informant, thus guaranteeing the confidentiality of the informant's identity).\n\nSee the **[Internal Reporting System Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Internal%20Reporting%20System%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nsolidated\nual Accounts\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nThe procedure for handling notifications and queries regarding irregularities or breaches of the Ethics and Compliance Model sets out the stages for handling received messages:\n\n- Receipt of report: all reports are received by the Secretary and the Chairman of the Ethical Compliance Committee simultaneously.\n- Prior analysis of the report and study of the information provided: the Secretary and Chairman of the Ethical Compliance Committee shall assess whether the report is to be accepted or rejected.\n- Deliberation on notification and information to the reporter: the Secretary and Chairman of the Ethics Compliance Committee shall respond to the reporter within the legally established time frame on the decision taken on the report.\n- Analysis and assessment of the message: carried out by the Ethical Compliance Committee, together with the Enagás managements or bodies that it considers appropriate in each case. It may be supported by third parties.\n- Resolution and notification: The Ethical Compliance Committee will take the relevant decisions regarding the notified case. The Secretary and/or Chairman of the committee will communicate the conclusions to the reporter.\n\nEnagás is committed to resolving all reports received. In 2023, the average time for handling notifications submitted to the Whistleblowing Line, from the time the reporter sends the report to the time the reporter is notified of the agreed resolution and the conclusions and actions reached, was less than 50 days.\n\nAny non-compliance with the Code of Ethics and with the regulations that implement it shall be analysed by the Ethical Compliance Committee. When it is found that a person has contravened the Code of Ethics, the Ethical Compliance Committee, together with the People and Transformation General Management, will propose the corresponding disciplinary measures based on the regulations in force and the applicable labour framework.\n\nIn 2023, seven notifications were received (three communications in 2022) through the different modalities of the Whistleblowing Line: [GRI 205-3]\n\n- Five messages about labour matters:\n- A message relating to a case of possible workplace harassment; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, it was concluded that although no workplace harassment took place, there were acts of disrespect and professional discredit. The People and Transformation General Management issued a written warning to the person to whom the message pertained and ordered a follow-up of the requested attitude change, warning that if no change was seen, punitive measures would be taken.\n- A message concerning a case of possible workplace harassment and false accusations; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, it was concluded that although no workplace harassment took place, there were false accusations towards another employee, and a written reprimand was issued by the People and Transformation General Management to the person to whom the message pertained.\n- A message concerning a case of possible discrimination and access to private correspondence; after due assessment and the launch of\n\nan information-gathering investigation, this complaint was dismissed as spurious.\n\n- A message concerning a case of possible inappropriate treatment of an employee; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, this complaint was dismissed due to a lack of evidence supporting the reported facts.\n- A message to the Legal Services and Compliance Department from the Business Development and Affiliates General Management regarding potential wrongdoing by an employee of one of our affiliates. The compliance officer of the affiliate was notified in order to manage the report in accordance with their own whistleblowing procedure, as it was an affiliate over which the Enagás Group did not hold effective control, in accordance with the provisions of our Code of Ethics; the report was dismissed due to a lack of evidence provided.\n- A message concerning a case of a regulatory infringement by a contractor of an affiliate; after due assessment and the launch of an information-gathering investigation, this complaint was dismissed as spurious.\n\nThe commitments to responsible business conduct set out in the Code of Ethics are translated into specific policies and corporate guidelines. These policies, which are approved at the highest Company level, by the Board of Directors, apply to all employees, executives and administrators of all companies that make up the Enagás Group, including those affiliates over which it holds effective control, within the limits set out under applicable regulations. For those affiliates in which the Enagás Group does not hold effective control, the company shall encourage principles and guidelines that are consistent with those set out in these policies. With regard to third parties with which Enagás maintains business relations (regular suppliers and national or international business partners), Enagás shall promote principles and guidelines consistent with its Code of Ethics and its Policies, so that third parties have a framework of ethics and integrity aligned with that existing at Enagás.\n\nAs a result of the Whistleblowing Line messages described above, two labour-related infractions of the Code of Ethics were identified in 2023: one infraction for lack of respect and professional discrediting and another for false accusations (no infraction in 2022 and 2021). Both infractions were dealt with and appropriate action was taken, which consisted of issuing a warning to the persons responsible for the infractions.\n\n## Compliance Management System\n\n#### [GRI 2-23, GRI 2-24, GRI 2-25]\n\nThe Enagás Compliance Management System is overseen by a specific functional area, which is supported by synergistic functions and other corporate support areas including the participation of local compliance officers located in certain countries where Enagás operates.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company entrusts the exercise of the Compliance Function to the Ethical Compliance Committee (ECC), a chartered, high-level body with autonomous initiative and control powers of an executive and decision-oriented nature. The Committee has a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), as its executive unit.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/121/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the word \"enaga\" in blue on the right, with a green and blue circle around it.\n\nThe Head of the Compliance Function (the Legal Advice and Compliance Director), who is a member of the Ethical Compliance Committee, reports organically to the General Secretariat and functionally to the Board of Directors through the Audit and Compliance Committee, with which they communicate and report on their activities, thus becoming a high-level Enagás committee.\n\nThe Compliance Function is autonomous, carrying out its tasks in accordance with the Compliance Policy and the standards and procedures that implement it. It is endowed with the utmost independence, so that its judgement and its way of proceeding are not conditioned by issues that prevent or hinder it from freely carrying out its essential tasks in order to achieve Compliance objectives. [GRI 2-13]\n\nThe appointment and eventual dismissal of the Head of Legal Counsel and Compliance shall be carried out through Enagás' existing procedures for such purposes, also requiring the approval of the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Enagás Compliance Management System is built around the Compliance Policy and the rules and procedures that implement it.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás updated its Compliance Policy to emphasise the independence of the Compliance Function, which proactively and autonomously oversees the proper functioning and effectiveness of its Compliance Management System and the effectiveness of its controls, without prejudice to the supervisory responsibilities corresponding to other entities and divisions within the company. The addition of the foundational elements that show the independence of the Compliance Function and the suitability of the members of the Ethical Compliance Committee and the Head of the Compliance Function are particularly notable.\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás updated its Compliance Policy to emphasise the independence of the Compliance Function**\n\nThe Compliance Function is in charge of managing the Compliance System in accordance with the provisions of the Policy and the General Compliance Standard, also identifying those responsible for other synergistic areas or areas that may regulate matters subject to monitoring on its part, in order to coordinate with these managers the prevention, detection and management of any non-compliance risks associated with their activities. The Compliance Function also assumes other responsibilities related to the System, including but not limited to training and raising awareness in compliance matters and the management of non-compliance risks.\n\nThe Management System also sets out a double reporting line for the Compliance Function: one through the corporate areas and the other managed by Compliance Officers at the different subsidiaries in countries in which they have been appointed. The Compliance Function thus coordinates compliance risks globally, avoiding information losses and inconsistencies.\n\nThe General Compliance Standard establishes a sanctions procedure to implement the most important aspects of external due diligence at Enagás with regard to the rules on embargoes and sanctions imposed by international bodies that may be imposed on third parties with which Enagás has a relationship. [GRI 2-23, GRI 2-24, GRI 2-25]\n\nSee the **[Compliance Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Compliance-Policy-Enagas.pdf)** on our corporate website.\n\n## Corporate Defence\n\nAs part of in the Compliance Management System, Enagás has a Corporate Defence Programme. It acts as the core of the company's criminal compliance, notwithstanding the existence of policies, procedures and controls that illustrate its content and contribute to preventing crimes being committed by any person who is part of Enagás as well as, in their respective areas of relation, by contractors, suppliers, business partners and any third party that collaborates with or acts on their behalf.\n\nThis programme is based on the company's Corporate Defence Policy, which includes commitments on crime prevention that reflect the company's resolute opposition to the commission of any criminal offences and its will to combat such acts, in line with the company's principle of \"zero tolerance\" towards the commission of crimes.\n\nThe Corporate Defence Programme in Spain includes the following elements:\n\n- Criminal risks, taking into account the activities carried out by the company and its exposure to the commission of different crimes. These include Money Laundering, establishing specific controls to prevent and detect possible acts that could cause this risk to become a reality.\n- Roles and responsibilities defined by a governance structure aligned with Art. 31 bis 2.1 and 2 of the Spanish Criminal Code. In this respect, the role of the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has been defined as the Crime Prevention Body.\n- Map of criminal risks and activities exposed to those risks.\n\nWithin this map, Enagás has taken into account some particularly important risks and included them in the Bribery and Corruption Risk in a broad sense (such as bribery, corruption in business and money laundering), so as to ensure special vigilance and control of activities that could lead to conducts related to these crimes, without falling under the specific criminal type. In this regard, Enagás has updated its risk map in 2023, adapting it to the regulatory changes that have modified the Spanish Criminal Code and expanded the catalogue of offences attributable to legal entities.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Annual Report** [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [model](#page-10-0)\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social**  [Risk](#page-152-0)  **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n- Inventory of controls, both general and specific, that help prevent potential crimes from being committed at Enagás.\n- Disciplinary system articulated around compliance with the Code of Ethics which ensures compliance with the model via disciplinary measures.\n\nIn addition to its Corporate Defence Programme, in line with the Spanish Criminal Code, Enagás has specific Corporate Defence Programmes for Mexico and Peru, adapted to each country's local regulations governing the liability of legal entities for the commission of crimes.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás engaged in monitoring for the compliance programmes of its affiliates, contributing to their promotion and participation in various meetings and working groups, as well as monitoring the development of its whistleblowing lines as a fundamental tool in the fight against crime prevention.\n\nSee the **[Corporate Defence Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Corporate%20Defense%20Policy%2020220321.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n## Anti-fraud, Corruption and Bribery\n\nEnagás has an Anti-Fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy in place which reflects the company's vehement opposition to the committing of illicit or unlawful acts and its firm will to combat and prevent them, for the purpose of fulfilling its zero tolerance principles. It is the Board of Directors that approves the Anti-Fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy, and therefore 100% of the Board members are informed about the commitments set out in the Policy and the rules and procedures that implement it. [GRI 205-2]\n\nAll activities have been analysed for potential corruption risks and the company has put in place a framework of controls in order to prevent and mitigate them. In particular, the risk of corruption in relations with public officials or other third parties with which Enagás has dealings. In this context, Enagás has established clear guidelines for action: to accurately record all payments to third parties and not to accept or make inappropriate payments, such as facilitation payments, payments in kind or commissions, or advantages or privileges of any kind for unethical purposes. These measures also contribute to the prevention of potentially more serious acts, such as money laundering. Of course, in order to avoid any appearance of money laundering, both the offer and the acceptance of payments in cash or equivalent are expressly prohibited. Enagás pays special attention to suspicious payments from third parties, such as payments by bearer cheques, payments in currencies other than agreed currencies, payments from persons or entities domiciled in tax havens, payments from entities where it is not possible to identify the parties or the final beneficiaries, among others.\n\nEnagás also collaborates with the authorities if they require help to investigate possible cases in the markets in which Enagás operates. It also provides the information they may request in a transparent manner. [GRI 205-1]\n\nThe Enagás Corruption Prevention Programme is based on the ISO 37001 standard on anti-bribery management systems, and is laid out in the Enagás Anti-Fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy, and the internal regulations which implement it.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás has externally certified its Corruption Prevention Programme based on ISO 37001, the anti-bribery management system standard.\n\nAn anti-corruption risk reassessment was also carried out in 2023, reviewing the corruption risk events that may affect the different areas of the company, as well as the controls in place to prevent the materialisation of such risks.\n\nFurthermore, the established anti-corruption principles have been extended to our suppliers by expressly communicating the Anti-Fraud, Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy to them.\n\nFinally, the Compliance Function has strengthened the information on the system provided to senior management for review and to the Governing Body for oversight.\n\n## **The Corruption Prevention Programme has been externally certified under ISO 37001**\n\nSee the **[Anti-fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Politica-contra-el-fraude-la-corrupcion-y-el-soborno-ENG.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nIn 2023, no cases of corruption were identified in the company, as in the previous two years. [GRI 205-3]\n\n## Antitrust\n\nAs part of the Company's Compliance Management System, Enagás has implemented an Antitrust Programme whose purpose is not only to avoid or reduce any possible administrative sanctions in this issue, but also to promote a corporate culture of ethics and compliance that respects the regulations that defend free competition.\n\nThe pillars of the Antitrust Programme are:\n\n- The Antitrust Policy establishes the bases and mechanisms to promote a culture of business ethics that is conscious and respectful of the principles of free competition, and sets out the essential guidelines for corporate and employee behaviour in this regard.\n- The Antitrust General Standard describes in a structured manner the elements that Enagás has established for the prevention, detection and management of risks, in order to comply with the provisions of antitrust regulation and to achieve the company's strategic and operational goals and objectives where Compliance is concerned.\n\nImage /page/122/Picture/29 description: The image contains the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase sans-serif font.

The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. The \"e\" is blue, and the rest of the letters are a darker blue. Above the word \"enagas\" is a green arc.\n\nThis Standard is aligned with the recommendations in this area of the National Commission on Markets and Competition. To this end, the main purpose of the Standard is to structure an environment of prevention, detection and early management of antitrust risks, as well as to reduce any undesired effects in the event that they do materialise, contributing to the creation of a culture of ethics and respect for the law among all professionals in all applicable areas, so that all can reflect it in their daily conduct.\n\n### See the **[Antitrust Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Antitrust%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás approved a guide to best practices in antitrust matters. This has been made available to all professionals; it enables them to prevent, detect and react in a timely manner to conduct likely to be anticompetitive or generate liability for the company in its relations with other economic operators and/or affect its reputation. In addition, antitrust training courses have been held for those employees considered to be at a higher risk in this area.\n\nIn addition, an Action Protocol has also been approved and made available to all professionals to guarantee the independence of our work to develop hydrogen and other renewable gas transport infrastructures from the activity of the affiliate Enagás Renovable, S.A.\n\n## Responsible tax practice\n\n[GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2, GRI 207-3]\n\nEnagás adopts a focus of responsible tax practice based on prudence and aligned with the recommendations set out in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nThe Responsible Tax Practice Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, sets out the strategy and principles that must guide the conduct of all employees, senior managers and directors of Enagás, as well as third parties with whom the company has relationships.\n\nEnagás adheres to the Code of Good Tax Practices, and presents a Fiscal Transparency Report in line with the company's commitment to tax transparency. The Board of Directors reviews and approves this report on an annual basis.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with the public reporting commitments set out in the Fiscal Policy, the company publishes in this report the total tax contribution and the taxes paid in the different jurisdictions where the company operated through affiliates (see the ['](#page-125-0)[Financial](#page-125-0)  [and operational excellence](#page-125-0)['](#page-125-0) section in this chapter).\n\nWith regard to tax havens, and in accordance with the Tax Policy, Enagás does not use opaque structures in order to reduce its tax burden, nor does it carry out artificial operations not linked to its business activity to reduce taxation. Likewise, it will not make investments in or through territories classified as tax havens according to current Spanish tax regulations in order to reduce its tax burden. The Enagás Group does not currently have a presence or carry out any activities in territories classified as tax havens in accordance with current Spanish legislation.\n\n## **Enagás adopts a focus of responsible tax practice based on prudence and aligned with the recommendations set out in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises**\n\nAs for audits of applicable taxation, at the end of 2023, audits were pending for the years 2020 to 2023 for the taxes applicable to the Group, with the exception of Corporate Income Tax, which is pending audit for the years 2019 to 2023. During financial year 2021, Enagás, S.A. and Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. were notified that the Central Economic Administrative Court (TEAC) had rejected the claims filed in relation to the assessments signed challenging the Corporate Income Tax for the years 2012 to 2015. A contentious-administrative appeal was filed in 2022 against these findings of the TEAC before the National Court. However, it is not expected that any liabilities will arise that will significantly affect the Enagás Group's equity situation.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás, S.A. recorded a provision of 5.6 million euros (this amount includes the fee and interest on arrears) that has its origin in the disputed tax assessments due to the non-acceptance of part of the deduction for technological innovation (TI) applied in the 2012-2015 fiscal years. This risk has been considered likely due to the publication of several rulings by the National High Court, in which the High Court changes the criterion for the classification of software and therefore generally accepts the thesis of the Tax Authority 's IT team with regard to the classification of software for the purposes of applying the deduction for technological innovation.\n\nImage /page/123/Picture/21 description: The image shows a blue mouse icon next to the text \"See the Fiscal Policy on the corporate website.\"\n\n## European Transparency Register\n\n[GRI 2-28, GRI S11.2.4]\n\nThe company is enrolled in the European Transparency Register, to which it periodically reports information on its activities and resources in order to contribute to the improvement and progress of European Union legislative and regulatory frameworks, especially in those developments that have a direct or indirect impact on the gas transmission and storage business, liquefied natural gas, renewable gases and the Spanish and European gas industry in general.

This gives the country great capacity for storage, transmission and operational flexibility.\n\nGiven this situation, and after more than fifty years of experience in developing, maintaining and operating LNG terminals and transmission pipelines, Enagás positions itself as one of the most reputable transmission companies in Europe in terms of facility efficiency. Our terminals are now recognised as among the most efficient in Europe, with availability of over 99%.\n\nAt Enagás, we make our facilities available to customers and provide traditional LNG logistics services such as tanker unloading, regasification, transferring LNG to tankers and truck loading, as well as new small-scale and bunkering services. For the latter, we are adapting our terminals, implementing the latest technologies that will position the Spanish Gas System as a 'logistics hub' for Europe in the gas market. With respect to small scale operations, a total of 70 operations were carried out at our terminals during 2023, an increase of more than 71% compared to the number of operations carried out in 2022. It is worth mentioning the increase in bunkering activity during 2023, with 1.3 TWh loaded for use as marine fuel (3.3 times the amount loaded in 2022), with Barcelona being the terminal with the highest volume loaded (86%) thanks to the start of simultaneous operations at the large scale and small scale docks. ◦ Extraction **[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n#### The Spanish Gas System\n\nEnagás was certified as an independent network operator (TSO: Transmission System Operator) by the European Commission in 2012, securing its positioning as a European sector leader. It also works as the Technical Manager of the System from the publication of the Hydrocarbons Law. This means it is responsible for the operation and technical management of the Basic Network and the secondary transmission network, guaranteeing the continuity and security of the natural gas supply as well as proper coordination between marketers, the operators of access points, storage facilities, and transmission and distribution networks.\n\nEnagás has been carrying out the majority of its activities in Spain since its founding in 1969. It has built up a meshed network of more than 11,000 km of high-pressure gas pipelines, facilitating access to gas from almost every point on the Iberian Peninsula. Enagás holds stakes in six of the seven LNG terminals in the Iberian Peninsula (four wholly-owned terminals and two part-owned), and has three underground storage facilities. As the main transmission company, Enagás has developed the main infrastructure facilities of the Spanish Gas System, making it a leader in security and diversification of supply and consolidating its presence on the international stage.\n\nSee the **[Annual Report on the Spanish Gas System](https://www.enagas.es/en/press-room/publications/spanish-gas-system-report/)** on our corporate website.\n\n#### LNG terminals\n\nEnagás is one of the companies with the most LNG terminals in the world. We are pioneers in the development, maintenance and operation of this type of infrastructure, and our knowledge and experience have made us international leaders in the sector.\n\nOur terminals have a unique logistical position: their placement between the Atlantic, Cantabrian and Mediterranean catchment areas favours sea transmission and the diversification of LNG sources and destinations. In addition, as regards emissions, Spain is the entry point for a possible ECA (Emission Control Area), an area that could be declared particularly vulnerable to pollution, and where the growth of the small-scale market could be a solution.\n\nAt Enagás, we offer a vetting service for the assessment and inspection of methane tankers operating in our facilities, both in the large and small-scale sectors.\n\n#### At the forefront of technology and efficiency\n\n- 100% commercial availability at all LNG terminals.\n- Load rate higher than 3,500 m<sup>3</sup> /h in all our LNG terminals.\n- Zero operational losses from boil-off during tanker loading operations.\n- Low coefficient of shrinkage in operations.\n- Maximum flexibility in the allocation and adjustment of slots for tanker offloading and loading.\n- Terminals ready to receive the largest LNG tanker ships in the world Q-Max with up to 266,000 m<sup>3</sup>of LNG<sup>42</sup> .\n\n#### Commercial services in Spain [GRI 2-6]\n\nAt Enagás, we are working to provide our customers with logistics services, which we provide in accordance with current regulations. The Third-Party Network Access (ATR) services that we provide at our facilities are fundamentally classified as:\n\n- **• Individual services:**\n- Tanker unloading\n- Regasification\n- LNG storage\n- Truck loading\n- LNG terminal-to-tanker bunkering\n- LNG ship-to-ship transfer\n- Ship cooling\n- Virtual liquefaction\n- Entry to the Virtual Balancing Point\n- Departure from the Virtual Balancing Point\n- Departure from the Virtual Balancing Point to a consumer\n- Natural gas storage in basic underground storage facilities\n- Injection\n- \n\n<sup>130</sup> <sup>42</sup> Except for the Huelva terminal, which can only moor vessels of up to 180,000 m<sup>3</sup> of LNG.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sale of these services is carried out through a framework access contract and through standard capacity products, i.e. through the signing of annual, quarterly, monthly, daily or intraday contracts.\n\n- **• Bundled services**\n- Vessel unloading, LNG storage and regasification.\n- Vessel unloading, LNG storage, regasification and flow on to the Virtual Balancing Point.\n- LNG storage and regasification.\n- LNG storage, regasification and flow on to the Virtual Balancing Point.\n- Vessel unloading, LNG storage and LNG loading from LNG terminal to vessels.\n- Underground natural gas storage, injection and extraction.\n\n#### Find out more about **[commercial services](https://www.enagas.es/en/energy-transition/gas-network/lng-natural-gas-services/)** in Spain on our corporate website.\n\nAs Enagás' activity is carried out in an environment covered by the regulation, this and its implementation form the basis of our plans moving forward. It should be noted that in recent years the last pieces of regulation required to establish the regulatory framework that has made it possible to complete the new management and commercialisation model for the Spanish Gas System.\n\nIn 2023, commercial availability was at 100% and technical availability was at 99.24% (in 2022, 100% and 99.72 %, respectively). This year,\n\nEnagás terminals unloaded a gas volume of 139 TWh (172 TWh in 2022); regasification amounted to 121 TWh (150 TWh in 2022).

Provisional data, as responses are still being received at the time of completion of this report.\n\n(2) The satisfaction target set for 2022 and 2023 was 8.3.\n\n(3) Survey conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) established in the Incentives Circular (Circular 6/2021, June 30). The remuneration received by the Technical System Manager is linked to the participation rate of customers in the survey.\n\n(4) The number of responses out of the total represents 56% of the total turnover in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás resolved 100% of the 177 formal complaints it received from customers (127 in 2022). These complaints were received in connection with Enagás' activity as Technical Manager of the System (GTS). Their quantity falls within normal bounds given its processes and nature, as well as the regulatory changes of the last few years. Enagás also has a specific tool for the management of queries and incidents was implemented to automate the process and provide traceability.\n\nIn terms of managing customer's information privacy, Enagás has a Privacy Policy and complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this regard, Enagás uses its customers' data exclusively for the purposes for which they have been collected and with the prior consent of the interested parties. In 2023, Enagás did not receive any complaints related to privacy or loss of customers' personal data (nor did it receive any complaints in this area in 2022 and 2021).\n\nSee the **[Information Privacy Policy](https://www.enagas.es/en/legal-notice/)** on the corporate website.\n\n[GRI 2-6]\n\n#### Asset management: business continuity and resilience [GRI 3-3]\n\nEnagás has basic principles and guidelines for action in the face of possible threats and adverse situations that give it an increasingly solid structure for managing a crisis.\n\nCrisis management, emergencies and business continuity are areas promoted within the framework of the company's Transformation Plan as areas aimed at strengthening resilience.\n\nThe company has worked on the development of a Business Continuity Plan for the Infrastructure Management Department, which will continue to be implemented throughout 2024. In this regard, it will also focus on revising the specific Technical Manager of the System Plan.\n\nWithin the framework of crisis management, Enagás carries out operational drills and crisis management drills, enabling the company to practise how to act in the event of an accident and thus reduce its reaction times.\n\nIn addition, to reinforce the culture of resilience at our organisation, Enagás draws up lessons learned from both internal and external events that are distributed internally.\n\nIn 2023, Enagás obtained ISO 55001 certification in asset management. This accreditation represents recognition under an international standard for the company's infrastructure asset management model in accordance with the practices identified during the audit process.\n\nAmong the most significant aspects of the standard are a holistic vision of the asset's life cycle, consolidated management of operational risk, alignment of the model with the Strategic Asset Management Plan and the use of technical methodologies to support decision-making. All this is within a framework that guarantees total asset cost and the availability and quality of customer service.\n\nThese management practices are aligned with the company's goals under the principle of continuous process improvement and the integration of new ways of working, with a clear commitment to innovation and digitalisation, all in line with industrial safety and ESG criteria.\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás obtained ISO 55001 certification in asset management**\n\nThis accreditation represents a success after 10 years of work to establish and implement an asset management model, framed within the company's Integrated Safety, Environment and Quality Management System.\n\n#### Pipeline integrity\n\nEnagás carries out inspection and maintenance work to ensure the integrity of its gas infrastructures, making sure they remain in proper condition. The company sets out integrity plans each year based on the risk involved in the activities to be carried out in the gas pipelines. These activities include:\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Internal inspections with smart tools to find potential anomalies in gas pipelines. During 2023, more than 11.0% of Enagás' gas pipeline network was inspected internally (9.3% in 2022).\n- Indirect external inspections to locate defects in the anti-corrosive coating of gas pipelines.\n- Excavations (test pits) for the direct evaluation of anomalies identified through inspections (internal and/or external indirect).\n- Complementary safety activities to detect incidents within the gas pipeline right-of-way (observation by car, observation by foot, aerial observation and leak detection). In 2023, more than 82,000 km of gas pipelines were monitored (more than 89,500 km in 2022).\n\nAs a result of the inspection and maintenance work, in 2023, a bypass of a section of the pipeline in the Pajares area was built as a mitigation measure for the physical risks identified.\n\n#### Closure and rehabilitation\n\n[GRI 3-3, GRI S11.7.4, GRI S11.7.5, GRI S11.7.6]\n\nEnagás facilities have a useful life set out during their design and construction. Enagás makes investments and technical improvements to extend the useful life of its assets while maintaining the required levels of safety, quality, environmental protection and efficiency. However, Enagás establishes decommissioning and rehabilitation plans that consider possible impacts on the environment and local communities once the assets' useful life has ended, taking into account the different stakeholders and involving local communities. Enagás has recorded financial provisions for the dismantling of all its LNG terminals and underground storage facilities, amounting to more than 231,000 euros.\n\nAlthough the useful life of the underground storage facilities has not yet been reached, these infrastructures already have detailed closure and rehabilitation plans as required by the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\nIn the case of pipelines, decommissioning plans are regularly updated in line with annual maintenance plans.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, no Enagás facilities were closed down.\n\n#### Continuous improvement programmes\n\nThe company continues to boost operational excellence through different programmes and initiatives that, leveraging new methodologies such as Lean-Kaizen and Design Thinking, among others, identify innovative solutions focused on efficiency and process improvement, thus generating disruptive results in the short term.\n\nIn this line and in order to face new challenges, in the area of infrastructures, the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Continuous Improvement has continued with the aim of identifying and prioritising cross-cutting initiatives with an impact on strategic drivers of continuous improvement, which encourage the development of people and the use of new methodologies and which promote the culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence.\n\nIn 2023, we have continued to promote the identification of improvement initiatives by professionals through the different existing channels at a company level: cross-cutting improvement groups, the continuous improvement mailbox, roadshows, the Ingenia Energy Challenge programme, and more. In an outstanding initiative this year, the Technical Manager of the System provided a solution to the 'Security of Supply' challenge by developing different team sessions using the Design Thinking methodology.\n\nWithin the Continuous Improvement Programme, the \"Daily Kaizen\" continued being promoted. The programme focuses on people and on strengthening team communication and collaboration. Teams are equipped with lean tools in order to generate autonomous teams, thus allowing for a sustainable cultural change over time (Kanban boards, 5S, standards and problem solving).\n\nIn addition, and with a view to facing new challenges for the company, cross-cutting Kaizen projects are being launched to provide innovative solutions focused on the efficiency of specific processes.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-133-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/133/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for the company Enagas.

On the basis of this assessment, local stakeholders are identified, and impacts are assessed in line with the corporate framework for our commitment to stakeholders (see the 'Commitment to stakeholders ' section of the [Sustainable](#page-54-0)  [Management Model](#page-54-0)).\n\nThis enables stakeholder maps to be created for the management of crises and emergencies affecting infrastructure, in which key collectives, communication channels and relevant issues are identified (see the '[Health and safety](#page-93-0)' section).\n\nFurthermore, the needs analysis of the area enabled the identification of key collectives and associations (vulnerable groups, NGOs, local councils, etc.) which are an important source of information for understanding the local context and for the establishment of partnerships (see the 'Social action' sub-section in this section).\n\n#### Information and consultation processes\n\nEnagás conducts environmental impact studies (which also assess social aspects) for construction projects and assesses environmental aspects for infrastructure operation and maintenance projects. Environmental impact studies are open to public information and are also subject to processes of consultation in which stakeholders may voice their opinion and even propose modifications to a project. Facilities that hold EMAS certification (see the '[Natural](#page-100-0)  [capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section in this chapter) publish an annual report (LNG terminals at Barcelona and Cartagena, underground storage facilities at Yela and Serrablo).\n\nIn the case of gas pipeline construction projects, the route design already takes into account criteria for minimising the impact on local plant and animal wildlife, and for avoiding the occupation of private property. Where the latter is concerned, a regulated procedure is applicable in Spain which includes public information and consultation with the entities affected, which also guarantees transparency in the construction of infrastructure and equal treatment before the law. [GRI 413-2]\n\nIn matters related to infrastructure safety, Enagás develops internal emergency plans, which include information on stored chemical substances, human and material resources, scenarios, emergency plans, liability, etc. These plans are registered with the local government authorities, which are responsible for communicating them to the community and creating an associated action plan.\n\nEnagás also holds information sessions in local areas for the purpose of explaining details of projects that are being executed locally, and safety and environment-related issues, among others.\n\n#### Communication channels with local communities\n\nImage /page/134/Picture/21 description: The image shows a stylized logo. It features a central circle with a keyhole shape in the middle, colored in yellow. Surrounding the circle are three sets of concentric arcs in blue, emanating outwards from the center.

Enagás is committed to allocating around 60% of its contributions to initiatives related to this target. In addition, the company will allocate 20% of its total contributions to actions focused on education, culture, health and aid to vulnerable groups in areas where it operates.\n\n## **Enagás' social investment is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals**\n\nIn terms of geographical scope, at least 15% of contributions will be allocated to local communities in which Enagás has infrastructure facilities and projects.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023                                                                                                                                                                      | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators                             | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| The company's goal is also to allocate at least 0.4% of its current net<br>profit to social action contributions.                                                                          |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                                            |            |                                 |\n| Through dialogue and collaboration with stakeholders, we maximise<br>the positive social impact of our initiatives, whether through<br>volunteering, sponsorships, patronage or donations. |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                                            |            |                                 |\n| See the Social Action Strategy on our corporate website.                                                                                                                                   |                                      |                       |                                            |                                                       |                    |                                            |            |                                 |\n| Needs analysis<br>in operating<br>regions                                                                                                                                                  |                                      |                       | Partnerships<br>with<br>associations       |                                                       |                    | Analysis<br>and<br>initiative<br>selection |            |                                 |\n| Stakeholder dialogue                                                                                                                                                                       |                                      |                       | Collaboration initiatives                  |                                                       |                    | Social impact                              |            |                                 |\n\nIn 2023, the total amount of this social investment reached 1.7 million euros, distributed as follows:\n\n|                                                           | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Amount allocated for social<br>investment (million euros) | 1.81 | 1.94 | 1.70 |\n\n#### Types of contributions\n\nImage /page/135/Figure/4 description: This image is a pie chart showing the breakdown of expenses. 73.4% is sponsorships, patronage and donations, 15.5% is management expenses, and 11.0% is time spent by professionals during the workday. 0.1% is not labeled.\n\nTime spent by professionals during the workday on volunteering\n\nDonations in kind\n\nThe amount allocated to sponsorships, patronage and monetary donations was 1,246,608 euros (see the '[Sponsorships, patronage](#page-136-0)  [and donations](#page-136-0)' sub-section of this section), while general management expenses (cost of professionals dedicated to the management of social investment and cost of the volunteer programme) amounted to 262,916 euros.

Some of our professionals have\n\nalso donated the money for the traditional Christmas hampers to the Theodora Foundation, reaching a total of 2,313 euros.\n\n#### Corporate volunteering programme [GRI 413-1]\n\nEnagás professionals participate in the company's Corporate Volunteering programme, giving up their time and bringing their skills and talent. There are two forms of cooperation:\n\n- **• On-site corporate volunteering directly managed by Enagás:**  activities carried out in collaboration with associations and thirdsector organisations, supervised by the company. These on-site corporate volunteering initiatives are carried out during working hours and respond to the needs of the local communities in which Enagás is present. The company, in line with its commitment to equal opportunity and non-discrimination, guarantees that participation in volunteering activities will not lead to work-related discrimination.\n- **• On-site and virtual volunteering platform**: the company connects with volunteering opportunities through different associations and third-sector organisations by means of the corporate volunteering portal, a platform that strengthens and extends the existing programme. It encompasses special days organised by the company as well as over 1,200 national and international collaboration opportunities, both face-to-face and virtual, put forward by NGOs.\n\n#### 11/2023\n\n**From November 13 to 17, Enagás organised its first Volunteering Week, an initiative that came to a successful conclusion thanks to the participation of the 218 professionals who participated in at least one of the 13 scheduled activities, in collaboration with different non-profit organisations.** \n\n**Through these activities - which focused mainly on care for the environment and inclusive sport, as well as spending time and interacting with vulnerable groups - our professionals have been able to grow more familiar with other realities and share experiences that have contributed to their general awareness, skills development and personal growth.**\n\nEnagás commits to:\n\n- Carrying out at least 10 corporate volunteering initiatives per year, aligned with the scenarios envisaged in the Social Action Strategy and Agenda 2030.\n- Encouraging middle management, executives and specific profiles to volunteer so that they can contribute their experience and knowledge to help support disadvantaged groups, as well as encouraging Enagás professionals to participate in activities within the Social Action Strategy framework (seasonal solidarity campaigns and specific programmes to help children and combat gender-based violence, among others).\n- Reinforcing, through volunteer initiatives, the commitments set out in the various axes of diversity approved in the Enagás Diversity and Inclusion Policy.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/137/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enaga.

These workshops were carried out in collaboration with the Randstad and the José María de Llanos Foundations.**\n\nIn 2023, Enagás has encouraged more face-to-face and collective activities, and the number of activities and participation therein has increased considerably compared to the last two financial years.\n\n|                                                         | 2021 (1) | 2022  | 2023  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Number of initiatives                                   | 12       | 21    | 32    |\n| Number of participations (not<br>individual volunteers) | 170      | 438   | 605   |\n| Total number of hours                                   | 403      | 2,210 | 3,344 |\n\n(1) In 2021, and with the aim of ensuring the safety of all participants, Enagás encouraged virtual volunteering activities and those carried out individually by professionals.\n\nThe company carries out a satisfaction survey of the professionals who participate in social initiatives in order to take maximum care of the volunteer experience, and to find out their satisfaction and assessment of the achievement of the targets of each action. The average result of the surveys carried out by the 203 initiatives reflects high satisfaction, with a rating of 4.8 out of 5.\n\n#### **Volunteering typology**\n\nIn 2023, our volunteering included environmental activities carried out to promote the protection and reclamation of natural spaces, initiatives related to the promotion of the social inclusion of people with disabilities, training workshops to boost the employability of women in vulnerable situations, participation in social sports tournaments to promote social projects for the benefit of people at risk of social exclusion, campaigns to collect toys and food for vulnerable families and digitisation workshops for seniors.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-138-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/138/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text 'Consolidated Annual Accounts'.\n\n# 3.9 Human rights\n\nBy acting on each material topic, Enagás ensures that human rights are upheld where applicable to the context and activities of the company. [GRI 3-3]\n\n## Respect for human rights\n\n[GRI 2-23, GRI 2-25]\n\nEnagás, following the roadmap set out by the United Nations through the Sustainable Development Goals, establishes its commitments to ensure compliance with human rights in its Human Rights Policy. These commitments are developed in the Enagás' Code of Ethics and the corporate policies that comprise it, aligning them with, inter alia:\n\n- United Nations International Charter of Human Rights.\n- The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration as well as the fundamental conventions (freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation) and the conventions concerning indigenous and tribal peoples.\n- OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n- The European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nEnagás provides an online training programme for all professionals so that they can learn the company's methods for ensuring compliance with human rights.\n\nConsult the **[Human Rights Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Human%20Rights%20Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n### Identification of rights and risk assessment\n\nHuman rights management is addressed using a continuous improvement approach aligned with our Sustainable Management Model. Enagás has a global system in place to identify human rights violation risks and impacts on a regular basis.\n\nThe identification of these violation risks and impacts is carried out for different points of the company's value chain both current (Enagás activities with management control, affiliates without management control and supply chain and customers) and potential (analysis of new business opportunities), taking into account international standards as applicable for each location and activity<sup>43</sup>,\n\ncommunication and consultation with interest groups, as well as consultation with external human rights experts. The human rights identified include labour rights, safety, the environment, ethics and integrity, as well as fundamental rights.\n\nThe evaluation of the identified violation risks is carried out through the following assessments:\n\n- Assessment of country-specific risks.\n- Corporate Risk Map (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter).\n- Safety risk assessments in posts and facilities (see the '[Health and](#page-93-0)  [safety](#page-93-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Environmental impact assessments / environmental risk assessments (see the '[Natural capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Supply chain assessments (see the '[Supply chain](#page-147-0)' section in this chapter).\n\nIn the assessments carried out in 2023, Enagás considers the level of violation risk to be low across the boards due to the measures that the company has implemented as part of its Sustainable Management Model. Thus, Enagás has human rights risk prevention and mitigation plans in all the geographical areas in which the company operates (see the '[Geographies](#page-15-0)' section in the '[Our](#page-10-0)  [business model](#page-10-0)' chapter). These plans include the following main measures for each of the main issues identified and target the identified vulnerable groups<sup>44</sup> . These measures have been set out according to the company's capacity to influence the different points of its value chain.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the different areas of the company to establish, within their management scope (people, supply chain, local communities, etc.), action plans, objectives and monitoring indicators to ensure compliance with the commitments established in the policy and to mitigate the risks and negative impacts identified. They are also responsible for periodically evaluating possible changes in risks and impacts.\n\nDuring the 2023 assessments - as in the assessments of the previous two years (100% of the assets covered in the last three years) - Enagás did not find any human rights violations, so no remediation actions were required.\n\n<sup>43</sup> The World Bank, UNICEF, The Economist Intelligence Unit, IPIECA, The Danish Institute for Human Rights, etc.\n\n<sup>44</sup> Within the framework of the risk assessments that Enagás carries out each year, vulnerable groups have been identified among the stakeholders (professionals, local communities and suppliers). In these cases, action is focused.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/139/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the Enagas logo on the right.\n\nIn addition to human rights violation risks, Enagás, in an integrated manner with the company's risk assessment processes, identifies and assesses the risk level of each of the risks associated with human rights (for more information on ESG risks and their integration in the company's global risk model, see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)[' chapter](#page-152-0)). These identified risks relate to human rights related to labour practices and to society and local communities:\n\n- Work practices: operational and technological risks and criminal liability.\n- Society and local communities: strategic, business, compliance and model risks.\n\n#### Human rights due diligence assessment at affiliates<sup>45</sup> [GRI 411-1, GRI S11.17.3, GRI S11.17.4]\n\nEnagás annually reviews a human rights risk assessment for the company's affiliates. All the companies have commitments to human rights included in their codes of ethics or specific policies, though in some cases, it is necessary to continue making progress to reinforce these commitments by making them public and providing training to their professionals.\n\nIn general, there is also an advanced level of management regarding the handling of communications and complaints. Due to the importance of this area, Enagás is reinforcing the importance of continuing with this type of action.\n\nOne of the areas in which a higher country risk was identified in several companies is professional relations and working conditions. In this area, it has been determined that the level of management is generally advanced, through room for improvement was found at some companies in terms of formalising procedures related to working hours, breaks and vacations. Likewise, the area of public and private security, which also presents a higher country risk at practically all the companies, stands out for its high level of management in all of them. In the area of community relations, there is an advanced level of management at all the companies, though room for improvement was found at some companies in terms of formalising procedures for managing queries and complaints.\n\nEnagás is currently reviewing its Due Diligence Processes in relation to third parties, focusing on the protection of Human Rights and the Environment, in line with the proposed new European Directive on this issue.\n\n[GRI 2-23, GRI 2-25, GRI 3-3]\n\n| Human rights assessed                                                                   | Assessment result     | Measures to reduce the level of risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LABOUR PRACTICES                                                                        |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| The right to decent work<br>and the rejection of forced,<br>compulsory and child labour | Low risk of violation | Enagás guarantees stability and quality of employment, a commitment that is<br>reflected in its Human Capital Management Policy.

The Shareholders' Agreements regulate, among other things, decisions that require joint decision-making by shareholders. Enagás' influence and decision-making is exercised through leadership on Boards of Directors and other governing bodies (e.g. Remuneration Committee, etc.), appointing directors with extensive experience in the sector and the country.\n\nHowever, Enagás has developed a management model for these companies that seeks to guarantee compliance with the business plans and their long-term sustainability, contributing Enagás' experience, knowledge and best practices as an industrial partner, while at the same time allowing affiliates to contribute to Enagás' growth, ensuring the objectives communicated to the market.\n\nEnagás has an internal management team in each affiliate, as well as the support of specific working groups for the corporate and business areas in their areas of expertise. In addition, Enagás guarantees the suitability of the managers of the affiliates for their positions by analysing and evaluating their profiles, as well as by appointing specialised profiles from the company to key positions in the affiliates (seconded personnel).\n\n#### Critical management standards\n\nEnagás actively manages its relations with partners and managers of affiliates in order to mitigate the risks associated with their management. In this regard, Enagás, in its ESG risk assessment,\n\nhas identified risks classified according to the Enagás taxonomy as reputational, strategic and business, criminal liability and compliance and model risks (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter).\n\nThe company has set out critical management standards, based on its material topics, which it extends to its affiliates according to their level of influence, and monitors them by setting out a plan of objectives for each affiliate to be implemented over a five-year horizon.\n\nCritical management standards are transferred through working groups led by the specific managers of each affiliate, involving members of the General Management of Enagás who co-lead matters falling under their remit. These working groups are instrumental in aligning positions and ensuring the operability of the Board of Directors of the affiliate, where the decisions taken by consensus will be concluded in the groups.\n\nEnagás has an Internal Monitoring Committee, established at the management level, which supervises the critical decisions of affiliates and reports quarterly on key matters to the Enagás Board of Directors.\n\n**Enagás has defined critical management standards based on its material topics; it requires its affiliates to comply with these standards in order to ensure that they are managed sustainably**\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nCritical management standards\n\nFinancial and operational\nexcellence\n\nFinancial excellence:\n- Financial and cash planning and\n management\n- Insurance\n- Management control\n- Taxation\n- Financial reporting\n- Accounting and administration\n\nOperational excellence:\n- Quality management system\n- Operational efficiency\n- Prioritisation of assets\n- Maintenance management system\n- Operation\n- Warehouse management\n- Customer service\n- Affiliate programming management\n- Measurement\n- Distribution and balances\n\nPeople\n\n- Remuneration policy\n- Contractual relations and trade union\nrights\n- Negotiation and representation\n- Human Resources Policy\n- Human resource development\n(training and recruitment)\n- Workplace climate\n\nHealth and safety\n\n- Asset protection\n- Health and safety management system\n- Emergency plan\n- Risk analysis\n- Health monitoring\n- Cybersecurity\n\nLocal communities\n\n- Stakeholder management model\n- Local development actions\n\nGood Governance\n\n- Procedure rules\n- Board of Directors Remuneration\nPolicy\n- Company governance (agreements,\nworking groups, etc.)\n\nNatural capital and\nbiodiversity management\n\n- Environmental management system\n- Conducting environmental impact\nassessments\n\nEthics and\ncompliance\n\n- Code of conduct\n- Corporate Defence Programme\n- Whistleblowing channel\n\nClimate action and energy\nefficiency\n\n- Energy efficiency measures and\nemissions reduction\n\nOther management\nstandards\n\n- Risk Map: identification and\nmonitoring of risks\n- Internal control (general control and\nprocess control)\n- Internal audit\n\nHuman rights\n\n- Human rights due diligence\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n**Supply chain**\n\n[Annual Report](#page-1-0)\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0) \n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)**\n\n**Environmental, Social** [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/145/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the Enagas logo on the right. The Enagas logo is a green and blue circle with the word \"enagas\" inside.\n\n### Internal control in affiliates\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nEnagás, together with its business partners, is conducting internal audits of its affiliates in order to verify the solidity of internal controls associated with the processes at greatest risk for fraud, corruption and bribery, and is establishing control activities to strengthen these processes wherever necessary. It also monitors the established local internal audit plans, focusing in 2024 on the most relevant issues, such as the management of payments, the procurement process and the management of the recruitment and payroll processes. The aim is to ensure that the main risks of the affiliate are covered by internal audits.\n\nDuring 2023, we continued with the continuous process of complying with the audit plans approved by the different committees to ensure maximum coverage of the processes with the highest risk. Examples include partner audits to assess the existence of an adequate internal control framework, in relation to cash cycles, derivatives and debt management at the SAGGAS LNG terminal, tax cycles, personnel and the Corporate Governance process at the Soto de La Marina Compressor Station, or physical and logical security and the performance of an SCD penetration test at the BBG LNG terminal. In turn, the affiliates have their own internal audit plans, agreed with the partners, which focus on the main risks such as cybersecurity, physical security, resilience, etc.\n\n- For further

The company currently works with 1,706 approved suppliers (1,523 in 2022), which are classified in families according to the products or services they offer:\n\n- Suppliers of works and services: IT & communication suppliers, engineering, etc. In 2023, 2,518 persons belonging to 512 service providers carried out work at Enagás facilities (in 2022, 2,820 persons belonging to 529 service providers). [GRI 2-8]\n- Suppliers of supplies: electrical equipment suppliers, piping manufacturers, rotary machine manufacturers, manufacturers of instrumentation and control devices, among others.\n\nCritical suppliers are considered to be those belonging to families of products or services whose failure or malfunction would have a high economic impact, or those that are of high criticality for the business (critical components or services) that have a low number of suppliers (difficulty of substitution). Enagás has 265 approved critical suppliers (233 in 2022), comprising 15.5% of all approved suppliers (15.3% in 2022) and 26.5% of purchases made (35.3% in 2022). We have also identified more than 77 critical indirect suppliers (72 in 2022).\n\nIn 2023, work began with 84 new suppliers (92 in 2022), of which 100% have undergone an approval process and meet the established social and environmental criteria. The company has also stopped working with 49 suppliers (53 in 2022) for not complying with Enagás' approval criteria. In no cases were these in relation to social or environmental criteria<sup>46</sup>.

In the last satisfaction survey carried out in 2022, the main results were a positive NPS (Net Promoter Score), indicating that suppliers were satisfied with the different purchasing processes and that they considered transparency to be one of the strong points of the Enagás purchasing process. [GRI 2-29]\n\n## Supply chain risk management\n\nEnagás has identified the areas of supply chain management in which there may be risks to the business and to our stakeholders (risks identified in its ESG risk assessment, classified according to Enagás' taxonomy as reputational, strategic and business, criminal liability, compliance and model, and operational and technological (see the '[Risk management](#page-152-0)' chapter). These areas, which cover both economic, ethical, environmental and social aspects, form the basis for the assessments we perform on our suppliers in the different procurement processes. The areas analysed are:\n\n<sup>46</sup> Of the suppliers identified as having significant negative environmental and/or social impacts, no relationships with the same have been terminated as a result of social or environmental criteria (0%).\n\n<sup>47</sup> Local purchases are considered to be purchases made domestically in Spain.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) **Management [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)** \n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/149/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left and the ENA logo on the right.\n\n- Product and/or service quality.\n- Financial situation, civil liability, economic dependence on Enagás.\n- Health and safety.\n- Ethics and compliance: criminal risks, ethical compliance, legal compliance, responsible tax practice.\n- Human rights: labour rights (diversity, work-life balance, gender equality), respect for the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights compliance in the supply chain (see the '[Human rights](#page-138-0)' section in this chapter).\n- Environment: emission intensity, environmental impact (resource consumption, waste generation, noise emissions, gas emissions, etc.), environmental safety (discharges, spills, pollution, etc.).\n\nTo ensure that sustainability targets are met in supply chain management, procurement management professionals receive regular training in this area.\n\nThe Board of Directors, through the Sustainability and Appointments Committee, is the body with the highest level of responsibility for sustainable supply chain management. [GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2]\n\n#### Approval process\n\nEnagás has a supplier management model that takes into account the inherent risks for each supplier according to their nature. Enagás therefore establishes approval requirements depending on the level of risk in the economic, ethical, compliance, social and environmental aspects of the family of products and services to which each supplier belongs.\n\nThe requirements established in the supplier approval process are:\n\n#### **• For all suppliers:**\n\n- Capacity and resources to meet the quality, ethics and compliance, financial, labour, environmental, safety and technical requirements established by Enagás; as well as the long-term maintenance of these requirements within the satisfactory levels defined by Enagás.\n- Acceptance of the Enagás Code of Ethics.\n\nThe company's Code of Ethics establishes Enagás' ethical culture and is applicable in its corresponding areas of relation with the company, for contractors, suppliers and for those who collaborate with Enagás or act on its behalf. This Code incorporates guidelines for behaviour in the areas of integrity, transparency, safety, respect for people and diversity, and the environment, among others.\n\nAll Enagás suppliers and contractors are bound by the Code and expressly confirm their commitment to be familiar with it, comply with it and enforce it through acceptance of the general contracting conditions.\n\n#### See the **[Ethical principles and guidelines for suppliers](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/proveedores/Ethical-Principles-Guidelines-for-Suppliers-Enagas-Group.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\n- Respect the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n- Compliance with the quotas set out in the Spanish Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act<sup>48</sup>.\n\n.\n\n- Implementation of a Gender Equality Plan<sup>47</sup>\n- **• For suppliers of specific families of products or services:** \n\t- Quality, environmental and/or occupational risk prevention certification requirements for suppliers (required from 86.8%, 30.0% and 52.7% of Enagás suppliers, respectively).\n\t- Policies or measures to promote work-life balance of professionals or Family-Responsible Company certificate.\n\n#### Supplier assessment\n\n- **• To identify suppliers:** a systematic public information analysis of potential suppliers is carried out to assess their sustainability risks based on the inherent risk level of the country, the sector and other similar companies. This is done by taking into account public financial information and consulting on human rights, ESG, ethics and compliance matters via reputational analysis platforms.\n- **• During the approval process:** Enagás evaluates its suppliers in the areas of human rights, ethics, social and environmental matters in line with the company's material issues through a questionnaire and documentary review. In 2023, Enagás updated this questionnaire in order to produce an ESG score that is taken into account during the approval process and in subsequent supplier assessments. The company will also evaluate, through pilot tests, its use in procurement, so that ESG performance will be one of the decision variables when selecting suppliers.\n- **• During the execution of the contract:** Enagás evaluates its suppliers in the aforementioned areas through different evaluation methodologies, taking into account criteria such as criticality, sustainability risks (environmental, social and governance) and turnover, among others.\n- **• After the end of the contract:** once the main and critical contracts are finalised, a quality assessment of the supplier and the associated contract is carried out.\n\n<sup>48</sup> Requisite set for companies with a workforce greater than that indicated by the applicable laws.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/1 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

For this reason, the company has joined the Global Compact's 'Sustainable Supplier' training programme as one of the driving forces.** \n\n**Through this initiative, some of Enagás' small and medium-sized suppliers - and those of other large companies - will receive training in sustainability matters based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact and the SDG. In the campaign launched in 2023, 509 of Enagás' small and medium-sized suppliers were invited.**\n\n## **In 2023, Enagás was part of the Global Compact's 'Sustainable Supplier' training programme**\n\n[GRI 308-2, GRI 414-2]\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-152-0\"></span>Image /page/152/Picture/0 description: The image is a document cover page.

This model is perfect for adapting to the complexity of a globalised competitive environment and a complex economic backdrop. This model is based on five aspects:\n\n1. The consideration of a risk taxonomy, which sets out standard typologies of risks according to their nature. The taxonomy comprises the following categories: Strategic and Business, Operational and Technological, Financial and Tax and Credit and Counterparty. There are other cross-domain types of risk: Reputational, Compliance and Criminal Liability.\n\nThe Enagás Group is also exposed to cross-domain risks that do not correspond to a single risk category, but rather may be correlated with multiple. These are the risks related to the three ESG pillars of sustainability: environmental, social and governance.\n\nThe taxonomy defined is taken as a reference point for the identification of the risk inventory to which society is exposed. It should also be noted that the methodologies used for risk measurement differ depending on each type.\n\n2. The segregation and independence of the functions of risk control and management at the company, in three 'lines of defence':\n\n- On the one hand, the business units that are responsible for the risks they take on when conducting their ordinary business activities, and are therefore responsible for identifying and measuring them.\n- Moreover, there is a risk area responsible for: (i) ensuring that the risk control and management system functions properly, (ii) active participation in the development of the risk strategy and definitions of impacts on their management, and (iii) ensuring that the control and management systems adequately mitigate risks.\n- Lastly the internal audit function is responsible for monitoring the efficiency of controls in relation to identified risks.\n\nImage /page/153/Figure/16 description: The image shows a pyramid diagram illustrating different types of risks. The pyramid is divided into several layers, each representing a specific risk category. From top to bottom, the layers are labeled as follows: \"Environment, social and governance\", \"Compliance\", \"Reputational\", \"Credit and Counterparty\", \"Financial and Tax\", \"Operational and Technological\", \"Strategic and Business\", and \"Criminal Liability\".\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report<br>2023 | Consolidated<br>Management<br>Report | Our business<br>model | Our commitment to<br>the energy transition | Environmental, Social<br>and Governance<br>Management | Risk<br>management | Key indicators | Appendices | Consolidated<br>Annual Accounts |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------------|\n\n#### Internal risk control and management framework\n\n|                                      | 1st line of defence - Business units                                  | 2nd line of defence - Risk area                                                                              | 3rd line of defence - Internal audit                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance                           |                                                                       | Define the regulatory framework and<br>governance.                                                           |                                                                             |\n|                                      | Identify the risks they assume in their<br>ordinary activity.         | Define a taxonomy of risks and advise the<br>business units on identifying risks.                            |                                                                             |\n|                                      | Assess and measure risks following the                                | Establish the risk measurement<br>methodologies and the risk consolidation<br>and reporting system.          |                                                                             |\n| Risk profile                         | established measurement methodologies,<br>assuming and managing them. | Validate the measurements made by the<br>business units.                                                     |                                                                             |\n|                                      | Define risk control and management<br>measures.                       | Ensure that management controls and<br>measures are aligned with the company's<br>strategy.                  | Verify and monitor the risk function and<br>established control activities. |\n|                                      | Define actions to correct failure to comply<br>with risk limits.      | Provide a global and homogeneous vision<br>of risks, reporting to Senior Management<br>and Governing Bodies. |                                                                             |\n|                                      |                                                                       | Inform the Governing Bodies of the risk<br>appetite and its associated limit structure.                      |                                                                             |\n| Risk appetite                        |                                                                       | Validate measures and strategies for<br>correcting any non-compliance.                                       |                                                                             |\n| Coordination<br>with second<br>lines |                                                                       | Ongoing coordination with Insurance,<br>Cybersecurity and Health and Safety areas                            |                                                                             |\n\n### **Enagás is also exposed to risks of a cross-domain nature, which are risks related to the three ESG sustainability pillars**\n\n1.

Other responsibilities with respect to risks are delegated in the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\n#### **Audit and Compliance Committee**\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee mainly monitors the efficiency of the risk control and management systems and evaluates the risks to the company (identification, measurement and establishment of measures for their management).\n\n#### **Executive Committee**\n\nThe Executive Committee establishes the overall strategy for risks, the limits of global risk for the company, and reviews the level of exposure to risk and the corrective actions, should there be any non-compliance.\n\n2. Establishing a risk appetite framework which defines the risk levels considered acceptable and that is in line with established business objectives and the market environment in which the company's activities are carried out.\n\n> There is also a scorecard of key risk indicators (KRIs) with their associated limits for the company's main processes and risks. These delimit the risk appetite that the Group wishes to assume in its quest for profitability and value.\n\n3. The transparency of information supplied to third parties, to guarantee its reliability and accuracy.\n\n#### See the **[Risk Control and Management Policy](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/conocenos/etica-integridad/Risk-Control-and-Management-Policy.pdf)** on the corporate website.\n\nThe Model complies with international best practice standards in terms of risk control and management, primarily referring to ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard and 2nd COSO<sup>49</sup> Report: ERM (Enterprise Risks Management). It is also fully aligned with the national regulatory framework in this area (requirements of the Spanish Corporate Enterprises Act and the recommendations of the CNMV's Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and Technical Guide 3/2017 on Audit Committees for Public Interest Entities).

The risk area carries out this analysis on an independent, transversal (covering all types of risks) and homogeneous basis (following the same methodologies as in the global risk measurement).\n\nAn external audit/assessment of the company's Risk Control and Management Function will be carried out in 2024. Furthermore, within the framework of ISO 55001 - Asset Management Certification, ISO 14001 - Environmental Management Systems (EMS) Certification and ISO 37001 - Anti-Bribery Management Systems\n\nCertification, regular external audits are carried out on the Risk Control and Management Model.\n\n## **The Risk Map includes the main risks to which the Enagás Group is exposed, including those associated with climate change**\n\nThe Enagás risk map is shown below, detailing the risks to which the Enagás Group is exposed, represented in aggregate (in accordance with level 2 of the company's risk taxonomy).\n\nThis map includes aggregate Sustainability (ESG) risks, defined as the effects of non-compliance with commitments and objectives in the company's material topics. Enagás has identified and assessed these risks based on the company's materiality analysis (see the '[Sustainable Management Model](#page-54-0)' section in the '[Environmental,](#page-53-0)  [Social and Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter). The result is risks with ESG factors or impacts for each of the material topics. Details of those arising from the material topics of Climate Action and Natural Capital are published in this report (see the '[Climate](#page-60-0)  [action and energy efficiency](#page-60-0)' and '[Natural capital and biodiversity](#page-100-0)  [management](#page-100-0)' sections of the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter, respectively). The typology of risks identified in the areas of human rights, supply chain and affiliates is also indicated (see the '[Human rights](#page-138-0)', ['Supply chain](#page-147-0)' and '[Affiliates](#page-142-0)' sections in the '[Environmental, Social and](#page-53-0)  [Governance \\(ESG\\) Management](#page-53-0)' chapter).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n**[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)**\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. The letters are in a dark teal color. Above the word \"enagas\" is a curved line in a light green color, forming a semi-circle shape over the word.\n\nThe main emerging risks also appear, related to uncertainty about issues such as 'the role of natural gas in the future energy mix', 'the technological and regulatory deployment of hydrogen' and 'data governance'. The first two risks are assessed as having a low probability of materialisation and a high impact/exposure, hence a 'Significant' risk level. 'Data governance' has a moderate probability of materialisation and a low impact/exposure for the company, therefore, its risk level is 'Acceptable'. Some of these risks stem from climate change, among other factors.

The matrix is divided into zones labeled 'Critical', 'Significant', 'Tolerable', and 'Acceptable'. Numbered points are scattered across the matrix, each representing a different risk. A legend lists the risks associated with each number: 1. Role of natural gas in the future energy mix, 2. Technological and regulatory deployment of hydrogen, 3. Geopolitical risks, 4. Global environment (inflation), 5. Sustainability (ESG), 6. Regulatory and remuneration, 7. Legal, 8. Affiliates - International business, 9. Industrial risks in infrastructure operation, 10. Cybersecurity (industrial and corporate systems), 11. Data governance (decision making, AI), 12. Non-availability of gas at source, 13. Suppliers and counterparties, 14. Unintentional failures or errors in corporate processes, 15. Worsening of the company's financing conditions, 16. Financial (interest rate, exchange rate and liquidity), 17. Tax risks, 18. Direct reputational risks, 19. Compliance risks, and 20. Criminal liability risks. The point for risk 11 is shown as a square, and is labeled as an 'Emerging risk'.\n\n**20.** Criminal liability risks\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Type of risk

(parent company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) is prepared annually and includes the non-financial information statement that was prepared by the Board of Directors on February 19, 2024, complying with the requirements of: [GRI 2-14]\n\n- a. Directive 2014/95/EU on non-financial information and diversity, as well as with the associated Spanish legislation (Law 11/2018). See Appendix '[Non-financial and diversity](#page-178-0)  [reporting requirements \\(Law 11/2018\\) and the EU](#page-178-0)  [Taxonomy for sustainable activities Regulation](#page-178-0)'.\n- b. Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments and its delegated acts, which establish the obligation to disclose information on how and to what extent the company's activities are associated with economic activities that are considered environmentally sustainable. See Appendix '[Non-financial and diversity reporting requirements \\(Law](#page-178-0)  [11/2018\\) and the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities](#page-178-0)  [Regulation](#page-178-0)'.\n\nThe following standards and principles were used in preparing this 2023 Consolidated Management Report:\n\n- In accordance with the GRI Standards, including the 2021 updated version of the global standards and the sector standard GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector 2021. Enagás, in addition to the GRI Standards content associated with the material topics indicated in this sector standard, identifies other GRI Standards relevant to the company's activity and nature. See Appendix '[GRI content index](#page-185-0)'.\n- The principles of standard AA1000: inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact.\n- The SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) reporting standard for the Oil & Gas - Midstream sector. See Appendix '[SASB](#page-199-0)  [content index](#page-199-0)'.\n- Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures (TCFD). See Appendix ['](#page-201-0)[TCFD content index](#page-201-0)'.\n- The Sustainable Development Goals approved by the United Nations General Assembly, which Enagás integrates in its strategy and are set out in the sub-section 'C[ontribution to the SDG](#page-44-0)'.\n- The Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, as set out in the Appendix ['](#page-203-0)[Global Compact content index](#page-203-0)['.](#page-203-0)\n- Recommendations included in the 'Guide for the preparation of management reports of listed companies' of the CNMV.\n\n#### External verification [GRI 2-5]\n\nThe Non-Financial Information Statement was verified by an independent third party, in this case EY, in order to comply with the requirement of Law 11/2018 for external verification and in line with Enagás' commitment to transparency, reliability and rigour of the information. For the scope of this verification, see the Appendix ['](#page-172-0)[External verification report](#page-172-0)['.](#page-172-0)\n\n## Scope of the financial and non-financial information\n\nThe scope of this report includes the information on 2023 financial year of the Enagás Group (hereinafter 'Enagás'). The following criteria have been applied to the information reported herein:\n\n- The financial information is presented in accordance with the consolidation principles applied in the annual accounts.\n- Non-financial information relates to operations over which Enagás maintains control (companies consolidated in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the full consolidation method). These companies are mainly located in Spain.<sup>52</sup> [GRI 2-2]\n- For further details on the scope of the financial information, refer to the '**[Consolidated Annual Accounts', section 1.3 'Basis of](#page-228-0)  [consolidation](#page-228-0)**'.\n- For further details on the ownership structure of Enagás, see the '**[Annual Corporate Governance Report', section 'A. Ownership](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)  [structure](https://www.enagas.es/content/dam/enagas/en/files/accionistas-e-inversores/gobierno-corporativo/informe-anual-corporativo/IAGC-2023-EN.pdf)**'.\n\n<sup>52</sup> Excluded from the scope are start-ups that have been integrated into the Enagás Group with operational control (Efficiency for LNG Applications S.L., Scale Gas Solutions S.L. and Sercomgas Gas Solutions. See sub-section '[Innovation and Corporate Venture](#page-49-0)') and whose businesses as of 2023 are in the early stages of development. Therefore, their impacts are considered to be of little relevance (for example, in 2023, they accounted for 2.6% of Enagás' workforce). In 2023, the impact of the operations of these start-ups has been assessed, with the conclusion that the degree of maturity of their business and activities is becoming representative. Therefore, from 2024 onwards, these start-ups will be included in the scope of Enagás' non-financial information.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-170-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\nbusiness\nodel\nOur\nthe\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/170/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

For certain new activities included in the climate change mitigation and\nadaptation objectives, undertakings shall disclose for the first time for the year 2023 additional\ninformation on eligible and aligned activities that was already required in 2022 in relation to the\nclimate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. As a result, no comparative information on\neligibility has been included in the accompanying NFS in relation to other environmental objectives\nlisted above or to the new activities included in the climate change mitigation and adaptation\nobjectives. Additionally, to the extent that the information relating to 2022 was not required with the\nsame level of detail as in 2023, the information disclosed in the accompanying NFS is not strictly\ncomparable, either. Furthermore, it should be noted that the directors of ENAGÁS, S.A. have\nincluded information on the criteria that, in their opinion, allow for better compliance with the\naforementioned obligations.

The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a sans-serif font, with the \"e\" in lowercase and the rest of the letters in lowercase. The word is in a dark blue color. Above the word is a green circle that is open at the bottom, forming a semi-circle. The semi-circle is positioned so that it appears to be encircling the word \"enagas\".\n\n<sup>54</sup> The significant increase in the remuneration of the CEO is due to the fact that, after his appointment in February 2022, in financial year 2022, only his annual base salary was considered together with the actual remuneration he received in that year. In the calculations for 2023, these amounts plus his corresponding variable remuneration have been considered.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/187/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The table below indicates the pages of this report in which this information is contained.\n\n| GC               | Human rights

accounting regulations, as well as another series of measures prepared in accordance with the reporting standards established and developed in-house, known as Alternative Performance Measures (APMs).\n\nThese APMs are considered to be adjusted versions of the figures presented in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU), which is the accounting framework applicable to the Enagás Group's consolidated financial statements, and should therefore be considered by the reader as additional to, but not a substitute for, these standards.\n\nThe APMs are important for financial information users because they are the measures used by the Enagás management to assess the Group's financial performance, cash flows and financial position for making operational and strategic decisions. These APMs are consistent with the main indicators used by the investment and analyst community in the capital markets.\n\nIn this regard, and in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), in force since July 3, 2016, regarding the transparency of Alternative Performance Measures, below Enagás provides information on those APMs set forth in the management information for Q4 of the 2023 financial year that it considers to be significant. Furthermore, in order to comply with ESMA guidelines on direct reference to previously published documents with details of APMs for previous periods, we include a link where this information can be found: [https://www.enagas.es/en/investor](https://www.enagas.es/en/investor-relations/financial-information/alternative-performance-measures-apm/)[relations/financial-information/alternative-performance](https://www.enagas.es/en/investor-relations/financial-information/alternative-performance-measures-apm/)[measures-apm/](https://www.enagas.es/en/investor-relations/financial-information/alternative-performance-measures-apm/)\n\n## 1. Alternative Performance Measures related to the Income Statement\n\n### EBITDA\n\n**EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) is an indicator that measures the company's operating profit before deducting interest, taxes, impairment and depreciation. By dispensing with financial and tax amounts, as well as accounting expenses that do not involve cash outflows, it is used by management to evaluate results over time, enabling comparison with other companies in the sector.\n\nEBITDA is calculated as operating profit, increased by depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses, if any, and other items that do not represent cash inflows or outflows from Enagás' operations (such as capital gains or losses on disposals, provisions, etc.).\n\nThe reconciliation based on the operating profit shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at December 31, 2023 is shown below:\n\n|                        | Q4 2023   |\n|------------------------|-----------|\n| Operating income       | 919.6     |\n| Income from Affiliates | 199.5 (*) |\n| Operating expenses     | -338.8    |\n| EBITDA                 | 780.3     |\n\n(\\*) For management purposes, the concept of 'Income from Affiliates' presented as part of operating income, in the amount of 199.5 million euros, does not include the effect of the amortisation of the PPAs, amounting to 52.1 million euros, which is considered to be a higher amortisation expense and therefore excluded from EBITDA. Considering the above two items together, the amount would be 147.3 million euros.\n\n#### Adjusted EBITDA\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** is an indicator that measures the company's operating profit before the deduction of interest, taxes, impairment and amortization, and includes both dividends received and interest on subordinated debt collected from associates that are included in the financial statements of the Enagás Group using the equity method.\n\nThis indicator is used by Management to calculate the leverage ratios described in the section 'Alternative Performance Measures related to the Balance Sheet and leverage ratios', allowing comparison with other companies in the sector. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 of the 2023 financial year, which is subsequently used in the leverage ratios, is shown below:\n\n|                             | Q4 2023      |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|\n| EBITDA                      | 780.3        |\n| Dividends (*)               | 192.5        |\n| Income from affiliates (**) | -199.5       |\n| <b>ADJUSTED EBITDA</b>      | <b>773.3</b> |\n\n(\\*) This relates mainly to dividends received from companies accounted for using the equity method. It also includes interest on subordinated debt collected from companies accounted for by the equity method.\n\n(\\*\\*) As the dividends received from affiliates are considered, the results of these companies must be excluded, which is included in EBITDA as described in the previous section. \n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/206/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for the Spanish energy company Enagás. The logo consists of the company name \"enagas\" in a lowercase sans-serif font, with the \"e\" and \"a\" in green and the \"n\", \"g\", and \"s\" in blue. Above the company name is a green circle with a blue arc underneath, visually representing a stylized gas flame or energy symbol.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n#### EBIT\n\n**EBIT** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is an indicator that measures a company's operating income before the deduction of interest and taxes. As with the previous indicator, it is used by Management to evaluate results over time, allowing comparison with other companies in the sector.\n\nEBIT is calculated as EBITDA, less depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, if any, and other items that do not represent cash inflows or outflows from Enagás' operations (such as capital gains or losses on disposals, provisions, etc.).\n\nReported EBIT for Q4 2023 amounted to 456.9 million euros. This amount matches the operating profit at that date.\n\n## 2. Alternative Performance Measures related to the Balance Sheet and Leverage Ratios\n\n#### Net Debt\n\n**Net financial debt** is the main indicator used by Management to measure the Group's debt level. It is comprised of gross debt less cash in hand.\n\nTo calculate the gross debt, the balance sheet items \"Debts with credit institutions\", \"Debentures and other marketable securities\" valued at amortised cost and in relation to item \"Other financial liabilities\" are added, and only the amount arising from the application of IFRS16 and loans other than to credit institutions as well are included.\n\nThe cash amount is obtained from 'Cash and cash equivalents' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe reconciliation between the APM and the figures corresponding to the consolidated balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2023, are shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                                            | Q4 2023  |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                  | 838.5    |\n| Debts with credit institutions             | -1,460.6 |\n| Debentures and other marketable securities | -2,345.4 |\n| Other financial liabilities (*)            | -379.8   |\n| Net debt                                   | -3,347.4 |\n\n (\\*) The amount included under this item relating to the recognition of financial liabilities due to the application of IFRS16 amounts to 379 million euros and the debt granted by bodies other than credit institutions amounts to 0.8 million euros.\n\n#### Ratios linked to Net Debt\n\nManagement uses two ratios to analyse the leverage and the Group's ability to meet its financial obligations over time, enabling comparison with other companies in the sector.\n\nThe leverage ratio is calculated as Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA, as shown below:\n\n|                            | Q4 2023 |\n|----------------------------|---------|\n| Net debt                   | 3,347.4 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA            | 773.3   |\n| Net Debt/EBITDA (adjusted) | 4.3x    |\n\nThe ratio linked to the capacity to generate cash flows over net debt is calculated as FFO for the last twelve months (LTM) / Net Debt, as shown below:\n\n|                  | Q4 2023 |\n|------------------|---------|\n| Adjusted FFO (*) | 627.3   |\n| Net debt         | 3,347.4 |\n| FFO/Net Debt     | 18.7%   |\n\n(\\*) This amount is explained below in the section on Alternative Performance Measures related to Cash Flow and Investments. This item does not include 67.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in GNLQ in 2022 as it is not generated by the Group's ordinary operations, as well as 4.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in Morelos.\n\n#### Gross financial cost\n\nGross financial cost is the measure of the effective interest rate of the financial debt. This indicator is used by management to analyse its evolution over time, the impact of interest rates and its position in relation to the market.\n\nThe gross financial costs are determined by dividing gross financial expenses by the average gross debt multiplied by the number of effective days in the year (360 days) divided by the natural days of the period (365 days), where gross financial expenses correspond to interest on financial debt and hedges (Interest on debt in the Consolidated Income Statement). Further, average gross debt is calculated as the daily average of nominal amounts of gross debt.\n\nThe reconciliation between the APM and the figures corresponding to the consolidated balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, are shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                              | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 |\n|------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Gross financial expenses (*) | 95.1    | 116.4   |\n| Average gross debt           | 5,328.4 | 4,393.5 |\n| Gross financial cost         | 1.8%    | 2.6%    |\n\n(\\*) The amount included under this heading corresponds to the interest associated with the debt included in the Financial Result of the Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0) \n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/207/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in gray font on the left side of the image.

Alternative Performance Measures related to Cash Flow and Investments\n\n#### Funds from Operations (FFO)\n\n**FFO** is the main cash generation indicator analysed by Enagás' management, as it measures both the cash generated by the domestic regulated and non-regulated business, as well as the cash generated for the Group from its international business, either through dividends from affiliates or interest payments on subordinated debt granted to these companies, after deducting both tax payments and interest related to the Group's financial debt.\n\nIt is calculated as:\n\n**FFO = EBITDA** discounting the results of affiliates +/- tax collection/ payment +/- interest collection/payment + dividends received from affiliates + interest on subordinated debt collected from affiliates.\n\nThe reconciliation between this APM and the amounts observable in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023 is shown below:\n\n|                                         | Q4 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|\n| Operating profit                        | 456.9   |\n| Amortisation allowances (*) (***)       | 323.4   |\n| EBITDA                                  | 780.3   |\n| Tax collection / (payment) (****)       | -151.4  |\n| Collection / (payment) of interest (**) | -70.2   |\n| Dividends (**)                          | 192.5   |\n| Other adjustments                       | 3.7     |\n| Income from Affiliates (*)              | -199.5  |\n| FFO                                     | 555.3   |\n| Tax collection / (payment) (****)       | 555.3   |\n| Adjusted FFO                            | 627.3   |\n\n(\\*) For management purposes, 'Amortisation allowances' includes, in addition to the depreciation and amortisation allowances for fixed assets, the effect of the amortisation of the PPAs, amounting to 52.1 million euros at December 31, 2023. (\\*\\*) For management purposes, interest on subordinated debt collected from affiliates is included under 'Dividends'.\n\n(\\*\\*\\*) Including impairment losses and gains or losses from the disposal of fixed assets recorded in the year.\n\n(\\*\\*\\*\\*) This item does not include the 67.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in GNLQ in 2022 as it is not generated by the Group's ordinary operations, as well as 4.5 million euros associated with the payment of corporate income tax for the divestment in Morelos.\n\n### Operating cash flow (OCF)\n\n**Operating Cash Flow** measures the capacity to generate operating cash after changes in working capital. It is calculated on the basis of FFO and includes the change in working capital.\n\n**OCF** amounted to 761.1 million euros in Q4 2023. The reconciliation between this APM and the figures seen in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023, is shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                                     | Q4 2023 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| FFO                                 | 555.3   |\n| Change in operating working capital | 205.7   |\n| OPERATING CASH FLOW (OCF)           | 761.1   |\n\n#### Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\n**Free cash flow** measures cash generation from operating and investing activities and is also considered by Enagás to be an essential APM as it is the indicator used to evaluate the funds available both to pay dividends to shareholders and to service debt.\n\nReported **FCF** for Q4 2023 amounted to 586.9 million euros. The reconciliation between this APM and the figures seen in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023, is shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                             | Q4 2023 |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| OPERATING CASH FLOW (OCF)   | 761.1   |\n| Payments for investments    | -368.2  |\n| Proceeds from disposals (*) | 194.1   |\n| Free Cash Flow (FCF)        | 586.9   |\n\n(\\*) For management purposes, divestment proceeds of 194.1 million euros include the following items from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement as at December 31, 2023: (i) the heading \"Proceeds from divestments\" for 94.1 million euros and (ii) the cash flows associated with the transaction with Reganosa for the sale of the 25% stake in Energy Musel Hub, which is included under the heading \"Other proceeds from financing activities\" for 99.9 million euros.\n\n#### Discretional Cash Flow (DCF)\n\n**Discretional cash flow** is an APM used by management to manage existing funding needs. It is defined as free cash flow (FCF) less dividends paid to shareholders and certain exchange differences related to net debt.\n\nReported DCF for Q4 2023 amounted to 117.5 million euros. The reconciliation between this APM and the figures seen in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023, is shown below (in million euros):\n\n|                                    | Q4 2023 |\n|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Free Cash Flow (FCF)               | 586.9   |\n| Dividend payments                  | -451.8  |\n| Effect of exchange rate variations | -17.7   |\n| Discretionary Cash Flow (DCF)      | 117.5   |\n\n### Available funds/liquidity\n\nThis indicator is used by management to measure the group's financial capacity to meet any short-term liquidity needs\n\nCorresponds to the amount of \"Cash and cash equivalents\" plus the amount of credit lines which have not been drawn down.\n\nThe reconciliation between the APM and the figures corresponding to the consolidated balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, are shown below (in million euros):\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/208/Picture/5 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Alternative Performance Measures in the Non-Financial Information Statement\n\nThe Consolidated Management Report includes the non-financial information statement, in line with the requirements of Directive 2014/95/UE on non-financial information and diversity, as well as with associated Spanish legislation (Law 11/2018). This law specifies that, when providing non-financial information, those companies that are required to, must rely on national frameworks, EU frameworks or recognised international frameworks, such as the GRI's Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards).\n\nFor this reason, the Enagás Group's Consolidated Management Report is prepared in accordance with GRI Standards. In line with the requirement of content 201-1 'Direct economic value generated and distributed', the following is reported:\n\n- Economic value generated: net turnover and other operating income\n- Economic value distributed: suppliers, society (investment in social action and taxes), employees (personnel expenses) and capital providers (dividends paid to shareholders and financial result).\n- Economic value retained: difference between \"economic value generated\" and \"economic value distributed\".\n\nInformation on the creation and distribution of economic value provides a basic indication of how the company has generated wealth for shareholders. A number of other components of economic value generated and distributed also reflect the economic profile of the company, which can be useful for normalising other performance-related figures.\n\nBelow is the reconciliation with the Profit and Loss accounts and items in the consolidated Balance Sheet shown in the Consolidated Financial Statements as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\n|                                                 | Reference to the 2023 Consolidated Annual Accounts                                                                                                                                    |  | Q4<br>2022 | Q4<br>2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|------------|------------|\n| Economic value generated (EVG)                  | Net turnover and other operating revenues in 'Note 2.1'                                                                                                                               |  | 970.3      | 919.6      |\n| Economic value distributed (EVD)                |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 924.2      | 905.8      |\n| Suppliers                                       | External services, other current administrative expenses and other external expenses from 'Note 2.1.c'.                                                                               |  | 220.6      | 186.7      |\n| Society (investment in social action and taxes) |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 165.0      | 94.9       |\n| Investment in social action                     | Amount allocated to social investment in the 'Local communities' section of the 'Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Management' chapter of the Consolidated Management Report |  | 1.9        | 1.7        |\n| Tax                                             | Taxes in 'Note 2.1.c' and Corporate taxes in 'Note 4.2.c' of the Consolidated Annual Accounts                                                                                         |  | 163.1      | 93.2       |\n| Professionals (personnel expenses)              | Personnel expenses of 'Note 2.1.b' of the Consolidated Annual Accounts                                                                                                                |  | 140.4      | 137.1      |\n| Capital providers                               |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 398.2      | 487.2      |\n| Dividends paid to shareholders                  | Dividends from equity attributable to the Parent Company in the Consolidated Statement of Equity Changes                                                                              |  | 446.4      | 451.4      |\n| Financial result                                | Financial result of the Consolidated Income Statement at the end of the fiscal year                                                                                                   |  | -48.2      | 35.8       |\n| Economic value retained (EVR)                   |                                                                                                                                                                                       |  | 46.1       | 13.9       |\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-209-0\"></span>**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) **[Appendices](#page-168-0)** [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/209/Picture/5 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enaga.

These matters were\naddressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in\nforming our audit opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n*Recovery of financial assets related to Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A.*\n\n2\n\nDescription On January 24, 2017, the Directorate General for Hydrocarbons of the Ministry for\nEnergy and Mines terminated the \"Improvements to the National Energy Security and\nDevelopment of the South Peruvian Pipeline\" concession agreement and on\nDecember 4, 2017, the National Institute for the Defense of Competition and\nIntellectual Property requested that Gasoducto del Sur Peruano, S.A. file for\nbankruptcy, as explained in Note 3.3.a to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Enagás Group holds financial assets amounting to 275.3 million US dollars\nrelating to the investment in Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. and accounts receivable\npertaining to executed guarantees totaling 226.8 million US dollars, interest of 1.9\nmillion US dollars, as well as various invoices for professional services rendered\namounting to 7.6 million US dollars. These items represent recorded assets at\nDecember 31, 2023 of 456.8 million euros (Note 3.3.a to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements).\n\nDue to the termination of the concession contract, the Enagás Group entered into an\nongoing dispute with the Peruvian Government related to the recovery of the\ninvestment. On July 2, 2018, a request was filed with the ICSID (International Centre\nfor Settlement of Investment Disputes) to initiate arbitration against the Peruvian\nState regarding its investment in Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. Subsequently, Enagás'\nclaim memorial was submitted to the ICSID, as were the corresponding responses and\nreplies by both the Peruvian government and Enagás. The pre-trial hearing was held\nin September 2022, and the written conclusions were presented in November 2022.\nIssuance of the arbitration award is estimated in the first half of 2024.\n\nGiven the significance of the amounts involved and the uncertainty regarding the final\noutcome of the resolution of complex, long-term processes of this type from a legal\nand economic standpoint, we have determined this to be a key audit matter since,\nprimarily, the Group's legal advisors believe that the estimates made by Enagás'\ndirectors may vary in the future.\n\nOur\nresponse\n\nOur audit procedures in this regard included, among other, the following:\n\n- Understanding the Enagás Group's process for assessing the recoverability of\nthese assets and reviewing the design and operating effectiveness and\nimplementation of key controls.\n- Evaluating compliance with the terms and conditions of the contracts and\n\n- \n- \n- \n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nber 31, 2023 amounts to 2,590 million euros and contain significant\ngoodwill.

Thus, during these years, including 2023, the going concern principle has continued to be fully applied in the preparation of these consolidated annual accounts.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the impact of rising market interest rates, which affects multiple aspects of financial reporting, such as future cash flow forecasts and present value calculations. With regard to the liquidity situation, as indicated in Note 3.7, the Group has a solid liquidity situation and liquid assets of 3,309,004 thousands of euros at December 31, 2023 (3,793,773 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022), thus maintaining the liquidity strategy and the credit and exchange rate risk policies. During the 2023 financial year, as in the 2022 financial year, there have been no impairment of financial assets or non-financial assets, as well as no significant extraordinary expenses corresponding to this situation or provisions or contingent liabilities that have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Enagás Group as of December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **a) Materiality criteria**\n\nThe accompanying Consolidated Annual Accounts do not include the information or disclosures which the Group did not consider of material significance or important relative to the concept of materiality as defined in the conceptual framework of IFRS, taking into account the Consolidated Annual Accounts as a whole.\n\n#### **b) Comparison of information**\n\nThe information included in these consolidated notes relating to 2022 is presented solely and exclusively for purposes of comparison with the information relating to 2023.\n\n## 1.3 Consolidation principles\n\nThe Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the interim financial statements of the Parent Company, Enagás, S.A. and its subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, and joint operations at December 31, 2023.\n\nSubsidiaries are considered to be those entities with respect to which the Enagás Group fulfils the following criteria:\n\n- The capacity to use its interest to influence the amount of revenue to be obtained from said subsidiary.\n- The Group has power over the affiliate, in so far as a company has rights which permit it to direct relevant activities, understood as those which significantly affect the revenue generated by the subsidiary.\n- It maintains exposure or the right to variable revenue arising from its involvement in the subsidiary.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated using the full consolidation method.\n\nThe share of minority shareholders in the equity and profit of consolidated subsidiaries of the Enagás Group is recognised in \"Minority interests (External partners)\" under \"Equity\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and \"Profit/(loss) attributable to minority interests\" in the Consolidated Income Statement, respectively. Subsidiaries are consolidated starting on the acquisition date, i.e., the date on which the Group obtains control, and they continue to be consolidated until such control is lost.\n\nWhen the minority shareholders' interest in the subsidiary includes a put option whereby it does not substantially assume the risks and rewards of such interest, it is not recorded as \"Minority interests (External Partners)\" but as a financial liability.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as those of the Parent. With respect to the joint agreements, that is, those by virtue of which the Enagás Group maintains joint control with one or more other partners, a distinction is made between joint operations and joint ventures. Joint control is understood as control shared by virtue of a contractual agreement which requires unanimous consent from all involved parties for decision-making regarding relevant activities.\n\nThus, joint operations are considered to be those in which, based on a contractual arrangement, a company enjoys the rights to assets and assumes obligations with respect to liabilities. The interest held in joint operations is consolidated using the proportionate consolidation method.\n\nIn addition, joint ventures are considered to be those in which, based on a contractual arrangement, a company exercises rights with respect to the net assets of the joint venture. Shareholdings in joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method. In those cases in which the Enagás Group acquires control over companies previously considered as joint ventures, a new estimate is made for the fair value of the interest held previously in equity at the acquisition date, recognising income or losses in the Consolidated Income Statement for the reporting period.\n\nFurthermore, associates are considered to be those entities over which the Enagás Group holds significant influence, that is, the power to intervene in decision-making regarding financial policies and operational matters, without attaining full control or joint control. The interest held in associates is consolidated using the equity method.\n\nIf appropriate, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures, and joint operations in order to unify their accounting policies with those of the Enagás Group.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/229/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is the word \"enaga\" in blue with a green and blue circle around it.\n\n| Consolidation method/Company                          | Functional currency |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Axent Infraestructuras de<br>Telecomunicaciones, S.A. | Euro                |\n| Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH                             | Euro                |\n| Hanseatic Energy Hub Operations<br>GmbH               | Euro                |\n\n(1) For these companies the Enagás Group recognises interest corresponding to minority interests under \"Minority interests (External partners)\" in Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023.\n\n- (2) Reclassified to Non-Current Assets Held for Sale at year-end 2023.\n- (3) For this company, the Enagás Group recognises the share corresponding to external partners under \"Other financial liabilities\" ([Note 1.5](#page-19-0)).\n- (4) Liquidated on December 27, 2023 without effect at consolidated level.\n\n#### b) Consolidation process\n\nConsolidation of the Enagás Group was carried out in accordance with the following process:\n\n- i. Transactions between companies included in the consolidation scope. All balances, transactions, and results between companies consolidated under the full consolidation method were eliminated upon consolidation. For joint operations, the balances, transactions and results of operations with other Group companies were eliminated in the proportion at which they were consolidated. With respect to gains and losses generated through operations among Group companies and companies consolidated under the equity method, the percentage of interest held by the Group in the latter was eliminated.\n- ii. Harmonisation of criteria. For affiliates which apply different accounting and measurement criteria to those of the Group, the consolidation process included the corresponding adjustments, provided the effect was significant, with a view to presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements based on harmonised measurement standards.\n- iii. Translation of Financial Statements denominated in foreign currency. The translation to euros of the Financial Statements of the aforementioned companies in the Enagás Group consolidation process was carried out in accordance with the following procedures:\n- Assets and liabilities of each corresponding balance sheet denominated in foreign currency are translated at the spot rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n- Income and expense items making up each income statement heading are translated at the average exchange rate for the year in which the related transactions are carried out.\n- The historical exchange rate for Equity is maintained.\n- Exchange gains (losses) arising as a result of net assets are recognised as a separate component of equity under \"Adjustments for changes in value\" and in the income statement under \"Translation differences.\"\n\nWhen disposing of a company whose functional currency is not the euro; or when disposals are carried out as a result of losing control; or result from business combinations with respect to previously held interest, translation differences recognised as a component of equity relating to said investment are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as soon as the effect arising from said disposal is recognised.\n\n#### a) Consolidation methods\n\n| Consolidation method/Company                                 | Functional currency |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Full consolidation                                           |                     |\n| Enagás Transporte, S.A.U.                                    | Euro                |\n| Enagás GTS, S.A.U.                                           | Euro                |\n| Enagás Internacional, S.L.U.                                 | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Financiaciones, S.A.U.                                | Euro                |\n| Enagás U.S.A., L.L.C.                                        | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Perú, S.A.C.                                          | US dollar           |\n| Enagás México, S.A. de C.V.                                  | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Emprende, S.L.U.                                      | Euro                |\n| Enagás Chile, SpA.                                           | US dollar           |\n| Enagás Transporte del Norte, S.L.

Elimination of dividends. Internal dividends are considered to be those a Group company recognises as income for the year and that have been distributed by another Group company.\n\nDuring the consolidation process, dividends received by subsidiaries and joint operations are eliminated by considering them to be reserves of the recipient company, which consequently recognises them under \"Reserves\". In the case of minority interests in companies consolidated using the full consolidation method, the amount of the dividend corresponding to said minority interests is eliminated from the consolidated equity heading \"Minority interests (External partners)\".\n\nv. Equity method. The investment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted by the share corresponding to the investor of the changes in net assets of the affiliate. In addition, dividends received are accounted for as a lower amount under \"Investments accounted for using the equity method\".\n\nAlso, when the associate or joint venture is acquired, any difference between the cost of the investment and the share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associate or joint venture is accounted for as follows:\n\n- The capital gain related to these companies or joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment. This capital gain cannot be amortised.\n- Any excess of the share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income to determine the share of profit or loss of the associate or joint venture in the period in which the investment is acquired.\n\nThe consolidated profit for the year includes participation in the results of the affiliates under \"Results of investments accounted for using the equity method\" in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statement. If the participation in losses of an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds participation in said entities, the loss will no longer be recognised under additional losses. Once interest in an entity is reduced to zero, the additional losses will be maintained and a liability will only be recognised to the extent the corresponding entity incurred legal or implicit obligations or made a payment on behalf of an associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture subsequently reports profits, the entity will once again recognise its interest only after its participation in said profits equals its participation in unrecognised losses.\n\n## 1.4 Estimates and accounting judgements made\n\nIn the Group's Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2023, estimates and judgements were occasionally made by the Senior Management of the Group and of the consolidated companies, subsequently ratified by the Directors, in order to quantify certain assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and commitments reported herein. Basically:\n\n#### Estimates\n\n- The useful life of PP&E assets [\\(Note 2.4\\)](#page-42-0).\n- Provisions for dismantling/abandonment costs, other provisions and contingent liabilities [\\(Note 2.9](#page-49-0)).\n- The measurement of investments accounted for using the equity method, and non-financial assets to determine the possible existence of impairment losses ([Notes 1.6](#page-21-0) and [2.7\\)](#page-44-0).\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-231-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\nImage /page/231/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas. The logo features the word \"enagas\" in a sans-serif font, with the letters in a teal color. Above the word, there is a green circle that is open at the bottom, creating a curved line above the text.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n- The fair value of financial instruments [\\(Notes 3.3](#page-53-0) and [.6\\)](#page-61-0).\n- Impairment losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost [\\(Notes 2.2](#page-31-0) and [3.3](#page-53-0)).\n- The calculation of income tax and deferred tax assetss ([Note 4.2](#page-100-0)).\n- The fair value of equity instruments granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (ILP) (Note 3.1.c).\n- Assumptions on the calculation of the term of lease contracts in application of IFRS 16 (Note 2.4.b).\n- **•** Determination of the expected loss associated with receivables [\\(Note 2.2\\)](#page-31-0).\n\n#### Judgements\n\n• The recognition of investments accounted for using the equity method [\\(Note 1.6](#page-21-0)).\n\n• Compliance with conditions for classifying assets and liabilities as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale ([Note 2.6](#page-43-0)).\n\nAlthough these estimates were made on the basis of the best information available at December 31, 2023, future events may require these estimates to be modified prospectively in the coming years (upwards or downwards). In accordance with IAS 8, this would be done prospectively, recognising the effects of any change of estimate in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## 1.5 Changes in the consolidation scope\n\nThe following are the changes in the consolidation scope of the Enagás Group:\n\n|                                                                      | Amount (thousands) |          | Stake percentage |                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Entity                                                               | In local currency  | In euros | At<br>31.12.2023 | At<br>31.12.2022 | Description/Type of control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Entries into the scope                                               |                    |          |                  |                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Musel Energy Hub, S.L.                                               | 395,544            | 395,544  | 100.0%           | —%               | Addition to the scope of consolidation by incorporation<br>of the company, which Enagás consolidates globally.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Hanseatic Energy Hub<br>GmbH                                         | 2,122              | 2,122    | 10.0%            | —%               | Addition to the scope of consolidation due to the<br>acquisition of 10% of this company.

Its corporate purpose is the regasification, natural gas storage and the provision of logistical capacity services carried out by the El Musel regasification plant. These are to be carried out by means of or through the corresponding gas infrastructures or facilities, either its own or those of third parties, as well as the performance of ancillary activities or activities linked to the foregoing. The effective start of this activity took place on July 28 following receipt of the Final Commissioning Certificate, as explained in [Note 2.4](#page-42-0).\n\nIn relation to MEH, on February 28, 2023 the Enagás Group, through Enagás Transporte, signed an agreement with Reganosa for the sale of a 25% stake in MEH for an estimated 99.9 million euros, as well as the acquisition by Enagás Transporte of Reganosa's gas pipeline network for 54 million euros. This transaction was subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions precedent which were met in full on September 28, 2023, the effective date of the transaction being September 29, 2023. The Musel terminal business was also spun off on this date, with the assets and liabilities associated with the Musel terminal being transferred to MEH, with no impact on the consolidated income statement.\n\nUnder this agreement, a sales option is granted to Reganosa, under which Reganosa has the right to sell, and Enagás Transporte the obligation to buy, 25% of MEH up to a maximum term. Based on this option, the interest transferred has been recorded under financial liabilities, maintaining the application of the full consolidation method for the assets and liabilities of MEH at 100% [\\(Note 3.3\\)](#page-53-0).\n\nNone of this information related to MEH had any impact on the consolidated income statement.\n\n### Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH (\"HEH\") and Hanseatic Energy Hub Operations GmbH (\"HEH Operations\")\n\nOn September 26, 2023, the acquisition of 10% of Hanseatic Energy Hub GmbH (\"HEH\") was completed, which will help ensure security of supply and drive decarbonisation in Germany. The consortium will be located in Stade (Germany), where a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit and an onshore terminal for liquefied gases also be prepared to operate with green ammonia will be located.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\nO&M work for this project will be carried out.\n\n[Our

The rights and obligations associated with a financial guarantee will be considered as financial assets and financial liabilities. For subsequent valuation, a contract will be recognised as the greater amount of a) the amount resulting from standards relating to provisions (IAS 37) or b) accumulated amortisation of the initial measurement and possible accrued income.** \n\n| Commitments and<br>guarantees              | Group and<br>related<br>companies | Third<br>parties | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|---------|\n| 2023                                       |                                   |                  |         |\n| Debt guarantees                            | 645,000                           | 10,750           | 655,750 |\n| Guarantees and sureties<br>granted - Other | 5,702                             | 279,236          | 284,938 |\n| Investment commitments                     | —                                 | 185,101          | 185,101 |\n| 2022                                       |                                   |                  |         |\n| Debt guarantees                            | 557,000                           | —                | 557,000 |\n| Guarantees and sureties<br>granted - Other | 17,754                            | 142,869          | 160,623 |\n| Investment commitments                     | —                                 | 89,725           | 89,725  |\n\n#### a) Debt guarantees\n\n#### **TAP**\n\nThe \"Guarantees on debt of related parties\" heading includes the corporate guarantee granted by Enagás S.A. for financial institutions acquired in the Financing Agreement of November 30, 2018 in the company TAP, through which the following items are basically guaranteed:\n\n- Principal and interest of the Financing Agreement provided by TAP at any time;\n- Market value of the hedging instrument over the interest rate of the Financing Contract.\n\nTAP reached the \"Financial Completion Date\" on March 31, 2021, a milestone that allowed the partners to replace the guarantees provided on the company's debt during the construction phase of the infrastructure with a mechanism for shareholder support for the repayment of the TAP loan (Debt Payment Undertaking), which will be in effect until its maturity, and which would be activated in the event of certain extraordinary events.\n\nThis support mechanism has been granted jointly by each of TAP's shareholders, so that Enagás would only be liable, in a hypothetical case, for the amount corresponding to it in accordance with its stake in TAP's share capital. In 2023 Enagás has increased its stake in TAP from 16% to 20%.\n\n**• An investment commitment corresponds to that obligation contracted with a related party which can give rise to outflows of funds or other resources in the future. The following is included among these: commitments not recognised in connection with contributing funds or resources as a consequence of incorporation agreements, capital intensive projects carried out by a joint venture, commitments not recognised in connection with providing loans or other financial support to the joint venture, or commitments not recognised in connection with acquiring a stake, regardless of whether a specific future event occurs or not.**\n\nThis support mechanism during the operating period is contractually limited by a cap in force throughout the life of the financing arrangement, so that the amounts claimed from Enagás may never exceed a total amount of 903,322 thousands of euros, regardless of the market value of the derivative or any other contingency.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 the amount guaranteed by Enagás, S.A. in favour of TAP creditors amounts to 645,000 thousands of euros (557,000 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022), already taking into account the increase in the stake mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\n#### **Scale Gas**\n\nIn July 2023, the Enagás Group, through its company Scale Gas Solutions, S.L.U., subscribed a guarantee to cover its 50% share in the financial debt formalised in the affiliate Scale Gas Med Shipping, S.L., in the amount of 11,895 thousands of dollars (10,750 thousands of euros). This guarantee will remain in force until the expiry of the financing contract, which is initially estimated for July 2030.\n\n#### b) Guarantees and sureties granted - Other\n\nThe following items are mainly included:\n\n#### **Group and related companies**\n\n- Guarantee of access to the electricity transmission grid, granted by Enagás Renovable, S.L.U. amounting to 5,450 thousands of euros (5,040 thousands of euros in 2022).\n- Guarantees granted to the Comisión Federal de la Electricidad (\"CFE\") for the service contract related to the Soto La Marina Compressor Station in the amount of 116 thousands of euros (December 31, 2022: 121 thousands of euros). The guarantee also granted to the CFE associated with the Gasoducto de Morelos project, which amounted to 9,378 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022, was rendered ineffective in 2023.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/235/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enaga.

Above the word \"enaga\" is a curved line in a light green color, forming an arc over the letters.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n• Guarantees and sureties granted to Group companies at December 31, 2022 included financial guarantees granted to third parties by Llewo Mobility, S.L., in the amount of 172 thousands of euros, counter-guaranteed by Enagás, S.A., and a corporate guarantee granted to a financial institution to support a credit facility arranged by the same company in February 2022, in the amount of 3,043 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022. In 2023, the Enagás Group met the financial obligations deriving from the guarantees and sureties granted to its affiliate Llewo Mobility, S.L. At December 2023 both the guarantee and the surety were cancelled.\n\n#### **Third parties**\n\nThe following items, mainly, are included:\n\n- Technical guarantees granted by financial entities to third parties in the amount of 194,044 thousands of euros (116,158 thousands of euros in 2022) to cover certain responsibilities which may arise during the execution of the contracts constituting the activity of the Enagás Group.\n- In addition, there is an insurance policy with as bid bond for the port concession in Colombia for the Buenaventura project amounting to 1,360 thousands of euros (1,412 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n- Guarantees and sureties granted by Enagás, S.A. totalling 23,900 thousands of euros to cover technical and operational risks related to the projects of the Group company Efficiency for LNG Applications, S.L.\n- A guarantee granted by a financial institution to third parties in the amount of 730 thousands of euros to support the application for an advance payment due to a subsidy granted by the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE).\n- As indicated in Note 3.3.a related to the investment in Peru by GSP, a bank guarantee letter in the amount of 59,100 thousands of euros (65,500 thousands of dollars) has been provided in connection with the measures of Law No. 30737 indicated in that note.\n\nNo guarantees had been granted with respect to tender processes at December 31, 2023 and at December 31, 2022.\n\n#### c) Investment commitments\n\nThe following items are included:\n\n- The Enagás Group has firm investment commitments in Economic Interest Groupings (EIG) amounting to 22,268 thousands of euros, to be disbursed during 2024 and later years (10,345 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n- The Enagás Group has investment commitments for its shareholdings in two investment funds amounting to approximately 51,096 thousands of euros (57,974 thousands of euros in 2022): (i) KLIMA Energy Transition Fund, which seeks investment opportunities through the acquisition of minority stakes in companies with high growth potential in energy transition sectors such as green hydrogen, biogas, energy efficiency, batteries, sustainable transport or digitalisation of electricity grids; and (ii) Clean H2 Infra Fund, which aims to develop the green hydrogen infrastructure sector and have a\n\npositive impact on the use and development of hydrogen transmission networks.\n\n- In the last quarter of 2023, the Enagás Group, through its affiliate Scale Gas Solutions, S.L.U., signed two contracts for the construction and long-term chartering of a ship for bunkering liquefied natural gas and alternative fuels, the geographical scope of which covers both Spain and Europe. The investment commitments associated with this project amount to 61,737 thousands of euros (68,315 thousands of dollars).\n- The Enagás Group, in relation to the Stade project, has investment commitments estimated at an additional 45,000 thousands of euros until the date of its construction, scheduled for 2027. This commitment corresponds to the disbursements expected to be made by the Group until the start-up of this project, taking into account the forecast for the contracting of long-term debt. The infrastructure projects of the Enagás Group are carried out through long-term contracts in which the Group-related project companies participate, where each project specifies the external debt required for their funding, without recourse to the shareholders or with limited recourse to the guarantees granted.\n\nThe Directors consider that no additional significant liabilities will arise in connection with the transactions disclosed in this note other than those already recognised in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## 1.10 New accounting standards\n\n### a) Standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union in force for the current financial year\n\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of these Consolidated Annual Accounts, other than those applied in the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2022, as they came into force on January 1, 2023 are the following: Amendments to IAS 1 and Practice Statement 2 Disclosures on Accounting Policies; Amendment to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates; Amendment to IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction and International Tax Reform - Pillar Two. None of the standards, interpretations or amendments that are applicable for the first time this year have had a material impact on the Group's accounting policies.\n\n#### Amendment to IAS 12 \"Pillar Two\"\n\n#### **New international taxation standard (Pillar Two)**\n\nPillar Two rules shall apply to the Enagás Group. Pillar Two legislation is currently being processed in Spain. According to the provisions of the Preliminary Draft Law published on December 19, 2023, the rule, once approved, will enter into force, in general, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2024, so, as of December 31, 2023, the Group has no impact related to the rules of Pillar Two on its current tax expense for the year 2023.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/236/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a green circle that is open at the bottom, forming a curved shape above the text.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nFrom the financial year 2024 the group will have to pay a supplementary tax that will tax the profits obtained in any jurisdiction in which it operates in which the effective tax rate, calculated at the jurisdictional level, is lower than the minimum rate of 15%.\n\nFurthermore, the group applies the exception to recognise and disclose information on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided for in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.\n\n#### **Adaptation to Pillar Two**\n\nThe Enagás Group has made an explicit commitment to apply the OECD Pillar Two guidelines. It is aligned with the principles and actions advocated by the OECD and is working on analysing the impact of the new Pillar Two standard to establish a compliance, control and management system to enable it to adapt to the regulation in a timely manner.\n\nAlthough a preliminary analysis has been performed for the Group, which will have to be updated in accordance with the Pillar Two standard in Spain taking into account the existing regulatory framework, an estimated calculation has been made of the minimum complementary tax derived from the application of the Pillar Two standard and, as a result of the aforementioned analysis, all Group entities have an effective tax rate that exceeds 15%. Therefore, according to the estimate made, the new global minimum tax should have no impact on the Enagás Group in 2024.\n\nThe Spanish Pillar Two standard is still under development, as indicated above, so that the estimate does not take into account the possible effects of possible developments of the reference standard or administrative guide at the domestic level.\n\n### b) Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB but not effective for the current year\n\nThe Group has not applied in advance the standards, interpretations and amendments to the standards approved by the European Union that have not entered into force at the date of these Consolidated Annual Accounts. Although the Group is currently analysing its impact, based on the analyses carried out to date, the Group does not expect the initial application to have a material impact on its Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\n| Standards                            | Content                                                                                                         | Mandatory<br>application for<br>periods |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Amendments<br>to IAS 1               | Classification of Liabilities as<br>Current or Non-Current, and of<br>Non-Current Liabilities with<br>Covenants | January 1, 2024                         |\n| Amendments<br>to IFRS 16             | Measurement of the lease liability<br>in a sale with subsequent<br>leaseback                                    | January 1, 2024                         |\n| Amendments<br>to IFRS 7 and<br>IAS 7 | Disclosures in relation to supplier<br>financing arrangements                                                   | January 1, 2024<br>(1)                  |\n\n(1) Standard pending approval for use in the EU.\n\n### Amendment to IAS 1 - Classifying Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n\nThe Group has analysed all contracts relating to its liabilities and has not identified any clauses that could have a significant impact on the classification as current or non-current in accordance with the amendment to IAS 1 at the effective date of the amendment.\n\n### Amendment to IFRS 16 - Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nThe Group does not expect to have a significant impact from the application of this amendment as it has not entered into any sale and leaseback transactions since the entry into force of IFRS 16.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/237/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Operational performance of the group\n\n#### RELEVANT ASPECTS\n\n#### Operating profit\n\n**• Operating profit amounted to 457 million euros.**\n\n#### Trade receivables\n\n**• \"Other receivables - Current\" includes the balance pending settlement corresponding to the remuneration of regulated regasification, transmission and underground storage activities for 174 million euros corresponding to the 2023 financial year (453 million euros at December 31, 2022) [\\(Note 2.2\\)](#page-31-0).**\n\n#### Property, plant, and equipment\n\n**This heading involves, at December 31, 2023, 47% of total assets (44% of total assets at December 31, 2022) [\\(Note 2.4\\)](#page-42-0). The change is mainly due to:**\n\n- **• Additions amounting to 162 million euros, corresponding mainly to the acquisition of Reganosa's gas pipeline network, compressor units, air conditioning equipment and work on the Gaviota and Yela underground storage facilities and the Almendralejo and Zamora compressor stations. It also includes actions for the transmission activity, and adaptations to the regasification plants in Barcelona, Cartagena and Huelva.**\n- **• The provision for amortisation for the period, in the amount of 255 million euros (249 million euros in 2022).**\n\nImage /page/237/Figure/17 description: This bar chart compares additions in 2023 and 2022 for land and buildings, technical facilities and machinery, other facilities, tools, and furniture, and prepayments and work in progress. For land and buildings, additions in 2023 were 14,830, while additions in 2022 were 7,617. For technical facilities and machinery, additions in 2023 were 70,651, while additions in 2022 were 7,597. For other facilities, tools, and furniture, additions in 2023 were 3,403, while additions in 2022 were 3,174. For prepayments and work in progress, additions in 2023 were 74,534, while additions in 2022 were 50,381.\n\n#### Current status of the Castor storage collection rights\n\n- **Regarding the Castor storage facility, on November 8, 2019, the Council of Ministers Agreement was published, ending the hibernation of the Castor underground storage facility and agreeing on its dismantling in phases, assigning the work to Enagás Transporte. Said Agreement confirmed the Group's obligation to continue with all operations necessary for the maintenance and functioning of the facilities referred to in Article 3.2 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 until the final phase of dismantling is completed, a commitment that has been fulfilled up to the date of preparation of these annual accounts. Following the Supreme Court rulings of 2018, which annulled various regulations establishing the conditions for the terms of remuneration for the management of the infrastructure, and given the need to introduce an alternative mechanism to obtain the corresponding remuneration for the aforementioned tasks legally entrusted to the Group and that it currently still performs, on December 18, 2018, the Group, through Enagás Transporte, filed a claim for asset liability with the Ministry of Ecological Transition, which, after being dismissed due to administrative silence, continued before the National Court through the filing the corresponding contentious administrative claim on October 3, 2019. In 2022, the Contentious Administrative Chamber of the National High Court filed a question of jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, which was resolved in November 2023, determining the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to resolve the aforementioned appeal, which was in the ruling phase at the date of preparation of these consolidated annual accounts.**\n- **• Thus, the damages lawsuit consists of continuing in the jurisdiction of the claim that has already been filed by the Company to recover the amounts deducted or that have been refunded and those not received, in accordance with the legal conclusions of external and internal advisors. Based on the above, the account receivable for the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., to be paid for the Castor underground storage administration and dismantling, is maintained in the balance sheet, the conclusion being that there is no negative impact on the Group's financial statements for the financial year ([Note 2.2\\)](#page-31-0).**\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-238-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/238/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font.

They are calculated annually on the basis of Enagás GTS, S.A.U.'s remuneration methodology, currently in force for the 2021-2023 and 2024-2026 regulatory periods. Only the revenues from the regulatory account and guarantees of origin are calculated on the basis of the substantiated cost. The monthly attribution of this income to the Income Statement is almost entirely carried out on a straight-line basis.**\n- **• Income arising from regasification, storage, and transmission activities in Spain is calculated based on a regulated remuneration system (Appendix III). Remuneration is made up of several terms that aim to remunerate investment, operation and maintenance costs and other items related to improved productivity and efficiency. The return on investment is the sum of amortisation and financial remuneration, calculated by applying the annual net value of the investment and the financial remuneration rate set for each regulatory period.**\n\n**The remuneration for productivity and efficiency gains includes the term of the continuity of supply remuneration set in the 2014 regulatory reform. As of 2021, this term will be calculated on the basis of the value established for 2020, adjusted by coefficients that no longer depend on fluctuations in demand.** \n\n**Once the regulatory useful life of the facilities has elapsed, and in those cases in which the asset remains operational, the operating and maintenance costs are established as fixed remuneration, increased by a coefficient based on the number of years by which the facility exceeds the regulatory useful life, not accruing any amounts as investment remuneration.**\n\n- **• On January 1, 2021, the new regulatory and remuneration framework came into force with the publication of Circulars 9/2019 of December 12, 2019 and 8/2020 of December 23, 2020 and Royal Decree 1184/2020 of December 29, 2020. The main items of this regulatory reform are set out in Appendix III.**\n- **• The Group's deferred income mainly corresponds to the accrual of amounts received for connecting the basic network infrastructure of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. and Enagás Transporte del Norte, S.L. with networks of distribution companies, secondary transmission companies, gas shippers, and qualified customers. Said income is recognised based on the useful life of the assigned facilities.**\n\n**Based on the types of contractual agreements supporting this type of income, it has been determined that there is an implicit financing component which, under the new regulatory requirements, must be recognised as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.**\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-239-0\"></span>\n\n|      | Annual Report |\n|------|---------------|\n| 2023 |               |\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/239/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font.

They are subsequently measured at amortised cost and related interest accrued at the corresponding effective interest rate is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.**\n- **• Receivables which do not bear explicit interest are recognised at their face value whenever the effect of not discounting the related cash flows is not significant. Subsequent measurement in this instance is still carried out at face value.**\n- **• The Group derecognises financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are transferred, which implies transferring substantially all the risks and rewards inherent in ownership of the financial asset; this is the case in firm asset sales, sales of financial assets with an agreement to repurchase them at their fair value, and securitisations in which the Group neither retains subordinated financing, grants any form of guarantee nor assumes any other type of risk.**\n- **• In contrast, the Group does not derecognise financial assets, but rather recognises a financial liability at an amount equal to the consideration received, in the transfer of financial assets in which it retains substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, such as discounted bills, recourse factoring, disposals of financial assets under repurchase agreements at fixed prices or at the sales price plus interest, and securitisations of financial assets in which the Group retains subordinate liability or grants other types of guarantees which would substantially absorb all possible losses.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• An impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost arises when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover all the corresponding amounts in accordance with the original terms established. The impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement and is determined as the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.**\n- **• If, in subsequent periods, the value of the financial asset measured at amortised cost recovers, then the impairment loss is reversed. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds the carrying amount had the impairment not been recognised. The reversal is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.**\n- **• From January 1, 2018, with the application of IFRS 9, the Group recognises an impairment loss for expected credit losses on financial assets.**\n- **• The Group assess the expected credit losses of a financial instrument in a way that reflects:**\n- **a) an amount weighted based on probability and not biased, determined by evaluating a series of possible outcomes;**\n- **b) the temporal value of money; and**\n\n**c) reasonable and well-founded information available on the date of information, without cost or disproportionate effort, on past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.**\n\n**Under the new standard, an entity will measure the value correction for losses of a financial instrument in an amount equal to the expected credit losses during the life of the asset, if the risk of that financial instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition.**\n\n**Conversely, that is, if the credit risk of a financial instrument has not increased significantly since the initial recognition, an entity will measure the value correction for losses at an amount equal to the expected credit losses in the next 12 months.**\n\n**The gain or loss resulting from impairment of value, the amount of the expected credit losses (or reversals) by which it is required that the value adjustment for losses be adjusted on the posting date to reflect the amount to be recognised under this standard will be recorded in the profit for the period.**\n\n**In the case of the Enagás Group, practically all financial assets present a low credit risk at the date of posting, and their exposure to events that generate credit losses during the next 12 months is therefore calculated.**\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/242/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enaga.

This receivable has been reclassified to long-term during 2023, as it is estimated that a judgement will be passed and enforced in more than 12 months (see details below).\n- The amount corresponding to facilities pending recognition is recorded in the long term as the Directors estimate that they will be recognised in a time horizon of more than one year and will result in a lower future collection.\n\n#### **Financial investment in the Gascan project**\n\nIn relation to the situation of the regasification assets of the Gascan project in the Canary Islands, on February 21, 2022, the Spanish High Court of Justice was notified of the ruling rejecting the contentiousadministrative appeal against the rejection by silence of the application for new administrative authorisation of the LNG regasification plant project in the Canary Islands (GASCAN).\n\nOnce the aforementioned ruling became final, on July 6, 2022, a claim for asset liability was submitted to the Council of Ministers, with the aim of implementing an alternative mechanism to recover the costs incurred in said project, considering, based on the legal conclusions, that the recovery of the assets associated with the project is highly probable.\n\nSince the submission of this claim, the assets and liabilities associated with the project were reclassified as long-term receivables and an initial amount of 18,655 thousands of euros were recognised, as well as the default interest.\n\nThis led to an entry in the income statement in the amount of 3,605 thousands of euros in the year 2022, under the heading \"Profit from fixed assets\".\n\nAt December 31, 2023 the receivable amounts to 19,536 thousands of euros (December 31, 2022: 18,929 thousands of euros).\n\n#### **Situation of Castor Storage Facility**\n\nfunctions at the Castor storage facility, which it was legally obliged to do in accordance with the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of As explained in Note 9.1 to the 2014 Annual Accounts of Enagás Transporte S.A.U. on October 4 and also in the 2014 Consolidated Annual Accounts o, 2014 the Official State Gazette published Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 of October 3, by virtue of which urgent measures were adopted in connection with the gas system and title to the nuclear power plants, with a view to guaranteeing the security of people, goods, and the environment with respect to the Castor natural gas underground storage facility, which establishes, among other matters, the following:\n\n- The termination of the operating concession for the Castor underground storage facility, granted by Royal Decree-Law 855/2008, of May 16.\n- The hibernation of the facilities associated with said concession.\n- The appointment of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. for administration of said facilities, for the sole purpose of carrying out the necessary measures for maintenance and operability during the hibernation period, prioritising the goal of guaranteeing the security of the facilities for persons, goods, and the environment, while ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. Likewise, the decision included the stipulation that the maintenance and operational costs be paid to Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. with a charge to income from tolls and royalties of the gas system.\n- The recognition of the investment made for the storage facility by the titleholder of the concession which was extinguished with 1,350,729 thousands of euros, and the establishment of a payment obligation for said amount by Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to the titleholder of the extinguished concession. As a result of assuming the payment obligation, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. enjoys the right to collect access tolls and royalties from the gas system's monthly invoicing for 30 years, for the amount paid to the titleholder of the extinguished concession plus the financial remuneration which the Royal Decree-Law expressly recognises. Likewise, this Royal Decree-Law contains the necessary measures to guarantee full effectiveness of this collection right, that said right could be freely available to Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. or its third party titleholders, and could consequently be totally or partially ceded, transferred, discounted, pledged, or taxed in favour of any third parties, including securitisation funds or other special purpose vehicles or companies, either domestic or international. The cession of the collection right will be effective with respect to the gas system, which will pay the new titleholder the corresponding amounts.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/243/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a logo with the word \"enac\" in blue, with a green circle above the word and a blue curved line below the word.\n\nIn light of the above, on October 4, 2014, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. signed an agreement with various financial entities by virtue of which it ceded the collection right charged to the gas system awarded by the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law, with said entities assuming the payment obligation imposed on Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. In this manner, on November 11, 2014, said financial entities made a payment of 1,350,729 thousands of euros to the titleholder of the extinguished concession.\n\nFurthermore, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. transferred the aforementioned contractual obligations and rights inherent to ownership of the financial asset to said financial entities, thus derecognising it from the balance sheet as the Directors of the Group consider that all associated risks and benefits have been transferred.\n\nOn December 21, 2017 the Constitutional Court handed down sentence No. 152/2017 declaring various provisions of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 as unconstitutional and null and void due to formal errors. Specifically, (i) acknowledgement of the investment made by the renouncing concessionaire and costs accrued up to the date of said norm becoming effective, and thus the consideration in the amount of 1,350,729 thousands of euros, as well as (ii) recognition of the correlated collection right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. with respect to the gas system for the amount of consideration cited, considering that in both cases the reasons given for the urgency were not justified and therefore said measures should be excluded from the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Constitutional Court did declare the following as constitutional and valid: (i) adoption of the decision to hibernate the underground storage facility; (ii) the declaration of the extinction of the concession; and (iii) the appointment of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. for administration of the facilities to the extent the hibernation is prolonged; as well as (iv) recognition of the right to obtain remuneration for the maintenance and operability costs for Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., including any costs incurred for the administration and other related work which said Royal Decree-Law established as a requirement.\n\nIn accordance with the analysis carried out by the Company's external legal advisors, the purchase-sale contract for the collection rights signed by Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. with the financial entities represents the transfer of rights and obligations to the financial entities and in no case does it enable the buyers (or their possible transferees) the possibility of claiming reimbursement for the price received or payment of any other amounts from the seller. Thus, in no case can adverse effects arise in connection with the financing of the operation for the Company due to the sentence of the Constitutional Court, as Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. is not titleholder to the collection right which was annulled nor is it obliged to pay the titleholder of the extinguished concession.\n\nIn addition, in relation to the above, the Supreme Court issued a ruling on October 27, 2020 partially upholding the contentiousadministrative appeal filed by the financial institutions against the alleged rejection by the Council of Ministers of the claim for liability of the Legislature for the partial unconstitutionality of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014, recognising the right of these appellant banks to compensation, by way of liability of the Legislature, of the total debt recognised in their favour, in the amount of 1,350,729,000 euros plus the corresponding legal interest accrued.\n\nLikewise, in accordance with the analysis carried out and the conclusions drawn by the Company's legal advisors and external legal advisors, the aforementioned sentence of the Constitutional Court does not give rise to any negative effect on the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to obtain remuneration for the administration and operations necessary for maintenance and operability of the infrastructure, as the Royal Decree-Law was not affected in such a manner by the declaration of unconstitutionality. Similarly, on the basis of these same conclusions, it is not believed that there has been any negative effect from the process that targets the liability of the Legislator State to financial institutions, since all the risks and benefits of the financial asset have been contractually transferred to the latter and the Supreme Court has also issued a final ruling in their favour.\n\nDuring 2023, no judicial or regulatory pronouncements have taken place in relation to the various rulings of previous years referring to the declaration of unconstitutionality of certain articles of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014, beyond those associated with the ordinary procedural actions of the proceedings that remain in progress.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it should be noted that since 2014 Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. has assumed and been performing management Article 3 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014, which imposed on it the assumption of the administration of the facilities and of the ownership of all the rights and obligations associated with them during the entire period up to the end of the hibernation period through an agreement of the Council of Ministers referred to in Article 1.2 of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law 13/2014.\n\nIn relation to the Castor storage facility, on November 8, 2019, the Council of Ministers published an agreement ending the hibernation of the Castor underground storage facilities and agreeing to dismantle them in phases, assigning the work to Enagás Transporte and including all the operations required for the maintenance and operation of the facilities referred to in Article 3.2 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 until the last phase of dismantling is completed.\n\nWith all of the above, in practice, the adoption of the aforementioned Agreement has not meant that Enagás Transporte has ceased to attend to the tasks it had been carrying out to guarantee the safety of people, property and the environment but, on the contrary, it has confirmed its obligation to continue to carry out all of the operations required for the maintenance and operation of the facilities referred to in Article 3.2 of Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 until the last phase of dismantling is completed.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-244-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/244/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font.\n\nAnd given that, due to carrying out these tasks, formerly as a storage administrator, and now as a dismantling manager, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., has so far been assuming the costs derived from the operations maintenance and operations imposed, as well as those for the full assumption of the administration and dismantling of the storage; and given that, in addition, the right of this company to obtain remuneration for the functions entrusted by Royal Decree-Law 13/2014 and developed in relation to Castor storage remains in force, since it does not derive from Article 6, annulled by the Constitutional Court, but is expressly recognised in Article 3.2 of the former, which subsists, it is considered that the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to receive the remuneration for the costs incurred is beyond any doubt, with only the specific terms in which this right is specified remaining in doubt, since Article 6 has been annulled.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and as it is necessary to implement an alternative mechanism to receive the remuneration for said tasks, legally entrusted to Enagás Transporte and which the company is still currently carrying out, on December 21, 2018, Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. filed a claim for damages with the Ministry for Ecological Transition, requesting (i) the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to obtain compensation, for the damages sustained as a result of the administration tasks of the facilities, plus the pertinent interests, (ii) payment of the amounts corresponding to the remuneration for the costs assumed by Enagás Transporte, S.A.U., up to the moment when the resolution is issued, plus the pertinent interests, and (iii) the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to obtain compensation for the damages that may be caused to it as a consequence of the tasks of administering the facilities until such time as the Council of Ministers adopted an agreement that would put an end to the storage hibernation situation.\n\nThe aforementioned claim for liability filed on December 21, 2018 was rejected by a presumptive resolution of the Ministry for Ecological Transition. On October 3, 2019 action was pursued before the National High Court through the filing of the corresponding contentious-administrative appeal against the aforementioned presumptive resolution in order to recover all amounts corresponding to the tasks entrusted, which Enagás has continued to provide to date. With regard to this contentious-administrative appeal, in 2022 the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court filed a question of jurisdiction in the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court. It was resolved in November 2023, confirming the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to resolve the aforementioned appeal. At the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated accounts, the judgement of this court has not yet been delivered.\n\nAccording to the legal conclusions of the external and internal advisors, it is considered that this damages lawsuit is the mechanism initiated by the Company for recovering both the amounts deducted from the remuneration corresponding to financial year 2017, the amounts not paid referring to financial years 2018 and the following, and the amounts that have been refunded as a result of the review actions by the CNMC in relation to the settlements corresponding to 2014, 2015 and 2016, included in the final approved settlements of the 2015 and 2016 years, as well as their possible interests. Based on the above, the account receivable for the right of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. to be paid for the performance of the works, the management and the dismantling of the Castor underground storage is maintained in the balance sheet, the conclusion being upheld that there is no negative impact on the\n\nGroup's financial statements as a result of the judgements of the Constitutional Court or the Supreme Court mentioned above. The amount is recorded as long-term as it is not possible to ensure a collection period of less than twelve months in accordance with the different actions.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the amount recorded as Group revenues during 2014 to 2023 relating to the activities and work associated with the Castor storage facility infrastructure by the Enagás Group that are pending collection amounts to 105,720 thousands of euros (94,283 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n### b) Trade and other current receivables Trade and other current receivables\n\nIn the \"Other receivables\" heading, under current assets, the Enagás Group mainly records the outstanding balance corresponding to the remuneration of regulated regasification, transmission and underground storage activities at the end of financial years 2023 and 2022, in the amount of 174,378 thousands of euros and 452,695 thousands of euros, respectively. This heading will include shortterm deficit of the Underground Storage business for the 2022 gas year amounting to 7,112 thousands of euros.\n\nThe deficit associated with the Local Networks activity for the 2023 and 2022 gas years, in the amount of 12,632 thousands of euros, has been recorded as long term as it is considered that it will be recovered in over 12 months.\n\nIt should be noted that, as various gas activities have resulted in surpluses (Trunk Transmission, Underground Storage and Regasification activities in gas year 2023 and Trunk Transmission and Regasification activities in gas year 2022), the corresponding amount has been reclassified to long-term and short-term liabilities based on the best estimate, in the amounts of 133,739 thousands of euros and 200,377 thousands of euros, respectively.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-245-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/245/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color.

In 2023 and 2022, no financial expenses were capitalised for this item.**\n- **• Personnel expenses directly related to work in progress, lowering personnel expenses in the amount of 4,237 thousands of euros at December 31, 2023 (4,447 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022) (Note 2.1.b).**\n- **• The book value of these assets includes an estimate of the current value of the costs to the Group for the dismantling tasks, credited to the \"Long-term provisions\" heading (Note 2.9.a) of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. This provision is subject to periodic review, in order to monitor possible changes in any of the hypotheses used to estimate decommissioning costs, in this case assuming the corresponding change in book value, which would be made prospectively, as has been previously indicated in Note 2.9.a to the Consolidated Annual Accounts.**\n- **• Non-extractable gas required for exploitation of underground natural gas storage (cushion gas) is recognised under PP&E, depreciated over the specific prevailing useful life (20 years) or over the leasing period if less.**\n- **• Natural gas required for minimum levels in gas pipelines and minimum operating levels for regasification plants, (also called \"heel gas\") is recognised as PP&E that cannot be amortised given that it is not available for sale as indicated under current regulations. It is measured at the purchase price as indicated in Order ITC/3993/2006 an Order IET/2736/2015.**\n- **• The restatement of assets recognised under PP&E in accordance with Royal Decree-Law 7/1996 of June 7, on balance sheet restatements, has an effect of 3,135 thousands of euros on amortisation charges in 2023 (3,271 thousands of euros in 2022).**\n- **• On January 1, 2021, the new regulatory and remuneration framework came into force with the publication of Circulars 9/2019 of December 12, 2019 and 8/2020 of December 23, 2020 and Royal Decree 1184/2020 of December 29, 2020. ([Appendix III](#page-303-0)).**\n\n**Grants**\n\n**• The official grants relating to the assets recognised under PP&E lower the acquisition cost of said assets and are taken to the income statement over the foreseen useful lives of the corresponding assets, decreasing the related amortisation.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• PP&E items are amortised using the straight-line method, applying annual amortisation rates that reflect the estimated useful lives of the corresponding assets.**\n- **• The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of the assets do not exceed the recoverable amounts which result from calculating discounted future cash flows generated by said assets based on foreseen remuneration under current regulations.**\n- **• For lease assets arising from the application of IFRS 16, the average term considered in each of the leases has been determined on the basis of both the economic substance and the contractually agreed duration as well as the assumptions on the extension/early termination of the contracts.**\n- **• Depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis in accordance with the following useful lives:**\n\n|                                                | Annual rate | Useful life (years) |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Buildings                                      | 2% - 5%     | 50 - 20             |\n| Technical facilities (transmission<br>network) | 2,5% - 5%   | 40 - 20             |\n| Tanks                                          | 5%          | 20                  |\n| Underground Storage Facilities                 | 5% - 10%    | 20 - 10             |\n| Cushion gas                                    | 5%          | 20                  |\n| Other technical facilities and<br>machinery    | 2,5% - 12%  | 40 - 8,33           |\n| Equipment and tools                            | 30%         | 3,33                |\n| Furniture and fixtures                         | 10%         | 10                  |\n| Information technology<br>equipment            | 25%         | 4                   |\n| Transport equipment                            | 16%         | 6,25                |\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n**Decreases,** \n\n**Increases or** \n\nImage /page/247/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Port of El Musel (Gijón)**\n\nIn relation to the situation of the regasification plant at the Port of El Musel (Gijón), on February 3, 2023, the CNMC notified the company of the Resolution establishing a special temporary economic regime for this infrastructure, and on February 17, 2023, the terminal received approval from the CNMC of the special economic regime for its logistics use.\n\nSubsequently, on June 7, 2023, the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO) granted Administrative Authorisation to the El Musel LNG terminal by Ministerial Order TED/578/2023, establishing the technical conditions for the provision of LNG logistics services at the plant.\n\nThe logistics services offered by this infrastructure, which are provided on the basis of unregulated access, are the unloading and loading of ships and storage, which were allocated in favour of Endesa as part of the \"open season\" process.\n\nIn addition, the Terminal will offer regulated access services, such as the regasification capacity strictly necessary for the efficient management of boil-off gas as well as tanker truck loading.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Ministerial Order, on July 28 the Commissioning Certificate was approved by the Industry and Energy Department of the Government Delegation in the Principality of Asturias, in accordance with the terms established in article 85 of Royal Decree 1434/2002, at which time both the provision of the aforementioned logistics services and the economic regime applicable to the terminal established by the Resolution of the Regulatory Supervision Chamber of the CNMC, dated February 3, 2023, commenced, thus initiating the corresponding depreciation of the property, plant and equipment corresponding to the terminal.\n\n{250}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/250/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color.\n\n## 2.5 Intangible assets\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n<span id=\"page-250-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n**Goodwill and business combinations**\n\n- **• The acquisition of control of a subsidiary by the parent constitutes a business combination, which is recognised using the acquisition method.**\n- **• Goodwill or negative goodwill arising on the combination is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which meet the relevant recognition criteria and the cost of the business combination, all measured at the acquisition date.**\n- **• Goodwill that arises upon acquisition of companies whose functional currency is not the euro is recognised in the functional currency of the acquired company, translating to euros at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.**\n- **• Goodwill is not amortised and is subsequently measured at cost less any impairment losses. Goodwill impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent periods.**\n\n**Other intangible assets**\n\n**• Development costs are capitalised by amortising on a straight-line basis over the corresponding useful life, provided they are specifically itemised by project, their amounts can be clearly established, and technical success and economic and commercial feasibility of the project are reasonably assured.**\n\n**The Group recognises all research expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement, including those development costs for which technical and commercial viability cannot be established. The amount recognised in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statement in connection with research expenses totals 885 thousands of euros in 2022 (549 thousands of euros in 2022).**\n\n- **• Concessions can only be included under assets when acquired for consideration separately by the Company and corresponding to concessions that can be transferred, or in the amount of expenses incurred to acquire them directly from the corresponding State or Public Authority. Should circumstances involving non-compliance with stipulated conditions arise which lead to the loss of rights related to a concession, the corresponding carrying amount for the concession will be written down in order to cancel the net value. These concessions are amortised on the basis of their useful lives.**\n- **• Acquisition and development costs incurred with respect to basic IT systems used for management are recognised with a charge to \"Intangible assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Maintenance costs of IT systems are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year in which they are incurred. They are measured at the amount disbursed for ownership or right-of-use of the IT programs, as well as their production cost if they are developed by the Group.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND

Fully amortised elements\n\nFully amortised intangible assets recognised by the Enagás Group and still in use at 2023 and 2022 year-end are detailed as follows:\n\nImage /page/252/Figure/3 description: This bar chart compares data from 2023 and 2022 across three categories: Development, IT applications, and Other intangible assets. In Development, the value for 2023 is 4,841, while for 2022, it is 3,811. For IT applications, the value in 2023 is 222,144, and in 2022, it is 213,379. Lastly, in Other intangible assets, both 2023 and 2022 have a value of 9,997.\n\n### 2.6 Non-current assets held for sale\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n- **• An entity classifies a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.**\n- **• For the classification, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, which is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, with the period being extended if the delay is caused by events and circumstances beyond the company's control and there is sufficient evidence of commitment to the sale plan and a reasonable price is negotiated than Management can consider acceptable.**\n- **• An entity shall measure non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n**Classification in this category involves the application of judgement to determine whether the asset (or disposal group) meets the above requirements by performing a detailed analysis of the particular facts and circumstances of each transaction.** \n\nOn April 24, 2023, Enagás Internacional, S.L.U. effectively closed the transaction whereby Enagás Internacional, S.L.U. transferred its shareholdings in Gasoducto de Morelos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Morelos O&M, S.A.P.I. de C.V. under the agreement of sale to MIP V International AIV, L.P. (a wholly owned subsidiary, indirectly, of the Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V, L.P. fund managed by Macquarie Asset Management). The agreement was signed in 2021 for 190 million dollars (100%), resulting in an after-tax capital gain for the Enagás Group of 42.2 million euros.\n\nAs it has not represented a line of business, it has not been included in the income statement as a discontinued operation.\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/253/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

At the closing of this period, the Enagás Group considers residual values based on the cash flows of the last period with a growth rate equal to zero.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n**Determination of impairment losses on non-current assets other than financial assets is based on fulfilment of a series of hypotheses which are described below in this note and are revised annually. The Group identifies its operating segments based on internal reports relating to the companies comprising the Group which are regularly reviewed, discussed, and evaluated in the decision-making process, as indicated in** Note 4.7**.**\n\n**To the extent that assets grouped within a segment are at the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified, the segment is identified as a cash generating unit (CGU).** \n\n**The CGUs identified by the Enagás Group in 2023 are shown below:**\n\n- **• Infrastructure activity in Spain (includes transmission, regasification, and storage).**\n- **• Technical Management of the System.**\n\n**In addition, as explained in Note 1.6, for investments accounted for by the equity method, each associate or joint venture is considered as a CGU.**\n\n**The goodwill presented in the balance sheet is allocated to the Infrastructure Activity CGU in Spain.**\n\n**To estimate value in use, the Enagás Group prepares forecasts regarding future cash flows after taxes based on the most recent budget approved by the Directors. The best estimates available for income, costs, investment and dividends (in the case of investments accounted for using the equity method) relating to CGUs are used for said forecasts, making use of past experience, sector forecasts, and future expectations, in accordance with the prevailing regulatory framework and corresponding contracts.**\n\n**With regard to infrastructure activities, in continuation of the impairment methodology applied in previous years, the best estimate of revenue items is used, calculated on the basis of the changes in the parameters taken into account in the current remuneration framework. This criterion is in line with that used in the economic and financial projections included in the strategic update of the Enagás Group. Therefore, in order to determine the residual value, in application of standard market methodological practices, it is assumed that the flows of the last year analysed will be normalised (taking as a reference base the projection of the main variables of the current remuneration framework at both the revenue level - financial/ amortisation/REVU/OPEX - and the expense level - OPEX and amortisation) without applying any adjustment and assuming a growth rate equal to zero.**\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/254/Picture/7 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

Above the word \"enagas\" is a partial circle, with the top portion in green and the bottom portion in blue. The circle appears to be incomplete, with a gap at the bottom.\n\n**The last period considered for projections is the one corresponding to the year in which the regulatory useful life ends, based on the age of the facilities at the time.** \n\n**With respect to the activities corresponding to Technical Management of the System, residual values were calculated based on the cash flows of the last financial year, using a zero growth rate and no normalisation adjustments. This is due to the fact that, as indicated in** [Appendix III](#page-152-0)**, revenue corresponding to this activity is meant to settle the obligations of Enagás GTS, S.A.U. as Technical Manager of the System. This is calculated according to the applicable remuneration methodology for the 2021-2023 and 2024-2026 regulatory periods (see Note 2.1). For the last period, the same criteria were applied as those used for infrastructure activity, under the understanding that while the gas infrastructure is operational and there is demand for gas, technical management of the gas system will continue.** \n\n**As mentioned in Note 2.1 and developed in** [Appendix III](#page-152-0)**, on January 1, 2021, the new regulatory and remuneration framework came into force with the publication of Circulars 9/2019 of December 12, 2019 and 8/2020 of December 23, 2020 and Royal Decree 1184/2020 of December 29, 2020.**\n\n**The modifications in the remuneration model incorporated in these have been taken into account in the calculation of the projected flows from January 1, 2021.**\n\n**The Directors consider that their projections are reliable and that past experience, taken together with the nature of the business, make it possible to predict cash flows for the periods under consideration.**\n\n**The most representative hypotheses used in the projections, based on business forecasts and past experience, are the following:**\n\n- **• Regulated remuneration was estimated in accordance with the remuneration approved by CNMC Circulars and RD 1184/2020 for the years in which it is available, while for subsequent years the same updating mechanisms established by law have been used and a better estimate has been made for the costs paid based on audited costs.**\n- **• Investment: the best available information on investment plans for assets and maintenance of infrastructures and systems has been used, based on the one hand on the history of investment in maintenance and systems and, on the other, in new projects that are highly likely to be executed in accordance with the work in progress being developed with the Ministry and the CNMC.**\n- **• Operating and maintenance costs were estimated considering the prevailing operation and maintenance contracts, as well as remaining estimated costs based on sector knowledge and past experience. The projections made were consistent with the growth expected as a result of the investment plan.**\n- **• Other revenue and costs were projected based on sector knowledge, past experience, consistent with the growth expected as a result of the investment plan.**\n- **• Future dividends have been projected based on the company's knowledge, past experience and activity in free cash flows.**\n- **• In addition, lease liabilities have not been taken into account in the value in use of the CGU or in its carrying amount.**\n- **• In order to calculate present value, projected future cash flows are discounted at an after-tax rate which reflects the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) corresponding to the business and the geographical area in which the business is carried out. For its calculation, the time value of money is taken into consideration together with the riskfree rate and risk premiums generally used by analysts of the business and geographic area in question. The risk-free rate corresponds to the sovereign bonds issued by each country in the corresponding market, with sufficient depth and solvency. However, associated country risk is also taken into consideration for each geographical area. The risk premium of the asset corresponds to the risks specific to the asset, calculated taking into consideration the estimated betas in accordance with the selection of comparable businesses dedicating themselves to a similar main activity.**\n- **• In addition, lease liabilities have not been taken into account in the value in use of the CGU or in its carrying amount. The after-tax discount rate for regulated activities in Spain will be between 5.1% and 7.0% in 2023 (between 3.8% and 5.8% in 2022), while the pre-tax rate will be between 6.7% and 9.3% in 2023 (between 4.6% and 6.5% in 2022).**\n- **• Considering that all the CGUs have been operating normally during 2023, the sensitivity analysis of the discount rate has been performed using a range of +0.5% and -0.5%. No significant associated risks have arisen from this analysis. Thus, the Group management considers that, within the specified ranges, there would be no changes in the impairment calculation.**\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-255-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/255/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Consolidated Annual Accounts, but rather are disclosed, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is considered remote.**\n- **• Provisions, which are quantified taking into consideration the best available evidence on implications of obligating events and that are re-estimated at each balance sheet date, are used to cover the specific obligations for which they were originally recognised and are partially or fully reversed when said obligations decrease or cease to exist.**\n- **• The compensation to be received from a third party when an obligation is settled is recognised as an asset, provided it is certain that reimbursement will be received, unless there is a legal relationship whereby a portion of risk has been externalised as a result of which the Group is not liable, in which case, reimbursement will be taken into consideration in estimating the amount of any provisions.**\n\n**The policy followed with respect to the recognition of provisions for risks and expenses is to recognise the estimated amount required to settle probable or certain liabilities arising from litigation underway, pending indemnities or liabilities, sureties and similar guarantees. They are recognised upon emergence of the liability or obligation determining the indemnity or payment.**\n\n- **• At year-end 2023 and 2022, several legal proceedings were underway against business groups in connection with matters relating to the normal course of their activities. The Group's legal advisors and Directors consider that the final outcome of these proceedings and claims will not have a significant effect on its future Consolidated Annual Accounts.**\n- **• Dismantling provisions are subject to periodic review, in order to monitor possible changes in any of the assumptions used, assuming in that case the corresponding change in book value, applied prospectively.**\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Annual Report |\n|---------------|\n| 2023          |\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/256/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

([Note](#page-279-0)  [4.2](#page-279-0))\n\nThe Directors of the Company consider that the provisions recognised in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet for litigation and arbitration risk as well as other risks described in this note are adequate and, in this respect, they do not expect any additional liabilities to arise other than those already recorded. Given the nature of the risks covered by these provisions, it is not possible to determine a reasonably reliable schedule of payment dates, if any.\n\n#### b) Contingent liabilities\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Enagás Groups has a continge[n](#page-262-0)t liability amounting to 2 million euros further to those in[di](#page-279-0)cated in [Note 3.3.a](#page-262-0) in relation to the GSP project in Peru, as well as in [Note 4.2](#page-279-0)[.](#page-279-0)\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-257-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/257/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image.

During 2023, the Group maintains cash-flow hedges and net investment hedges.**\n\n#### Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. (\"GSP\")\n\n- **• In relation to the situation of the investment in GSP, as a result of the termination of the concession contract on January 24, 2017, the dispute between the Peruvian State and Enagás regarding the application of the investment recovery mechanism established in the GSP Concession contract continues. In this regard, an international arbitration was initiated in 2018 under the Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (hereinafter, APPRI) Spain-Peru, as detailed in Note 3.3.a submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter ICSID). This proceeding continues to take its regular course, and once hearings have been held and briefs filed in the second half of 2022, the award is expected.

This acquisition took place within the framework of the \"Temporary Treasury Share Buy-Back Scheme\", whose exclusive aim was to meet the obligations of delivering shares to the Executive Director and members of the Enagás Group management team under the current remuneration scheme according to the terms and conditions of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan (ILP) and the Remuneration Policy approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. The shares were purchased in compliance with the conditions set out in Article 5 of Regulation EC/2273/2003 and subject to the terms authorised at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. Management of the Temporary Treasury Share Buy-Back Scheme was entrusted to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), which carried out the transaction on behalf of Enagás, S.A. independently and without exercising influence on the process ([Note 4.4](#page-285-0)).\n\nDuring the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the following movements in treasury shares have taken place:\n\n| No. of shares as | No. of shares | No. of shares  | Nº acciones al |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| at January 1,    | acquired new  | implemented    | 31 de          |\n| 2023             | target        | for the target | diciembre 2023 |\n| 821,375          | —             | (97,796)       | 723,579        |\n\n#### d) Reserves\n\nThe Corporate Enterprises Act stipulates that 10% of profit for the year must be transferred to the legal reserve until it represents at least 20% of share capital. At 2023 and 2022 year-end, the legal reserve was fully allocated and totalled 78,597 thousands of euros.\n\nThe legal reserve can be used to increase capital by the amount exceeding 10% of the new capital after the increase. Except for this purpose, until the legal reserve exceeds the limit of 20% of capital, it can only be used to compensate losses provided there are no other reserves available.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n260\n\n#### <span id=\"page-259-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)

that can be attributed to shareholders who have no control over the subsidiary.**\n- **• Such control is transferred when ownership of the shares gives the holder the risks and rewards associated with ownership and access to the returns associated with its interest.**\n- **• They are recognised under equity as a line item separate from the equity attributable to the parent.**\n- **• In business combinations, minority interests are measured at fair value or the proportional part of net assets acquired.**\n- **• Changes in the percentage of ownership interest held by the parent in the subsidiary which do not represent a loss of control are recognised as equity transactions.**\n- **• The amount corresponding to minority interests is calculated for the whole Enagás Group based on the carrying amounts of the companies in which minority interests is held.**\n\nImage /page/259/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logo of Enagás, a Spanish natural gas transmission system

Subsequent measurement in this instance is still carried out at face value.**\n\n#### Financial assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income\n\n**• Equity instruments are measured by default at fair value through profit or loss, but there is an option at initial recognition to present changes in fair value in profit/loss. This decision is irrevocable and is made for each asset individually.** \n\n#### Fair value measurement\n\n- **• In accordance with IFRS 13, for purposes of financial disclosure, the measurement of fair value is classified as Level 1, 2, or 3, based on the degree that the inputs applied are observable and their importance in measuring fair value in its totality, as described below:**\n\t- **Level 1 Inputs are based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for instruments of an identical nature traded in active markets.**\n\t- **Level 2 Inputs are based on valuation models for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data.**\n- **Level 3 Inputs are not generally observable and generally reflect estimates regarding market movements for determining the price of the asset or liability.**\n\n#### Trade and other payables\n\n**• Trade and other payables that do not accrue explicit interest are measured at their face value when the effect of financial discounting is not significant.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n**• In accordance with the requirements established under IFRS 9, the Group regularly calculates the effect of the expected loss on financial assets.

(7.59%) and the funds Klima Energy Transition Fund, F.C.R. and Clean H2 Infra Fund. The change compared to 2022 is mainly due to the change in the fair value of these investments, as well as additional investments made by the Enagás Group during 2023.\n\n#### **Loans**\n\nThis mainly includes loans granted to group companies consolidated using the equity method and therefore not eliminated in the consolidation process.\n\nThe detail of current and non-current loans to Group companies is detailed in Note 4.3.\n\n#### **Other**\n\n\"Other non-current financial assets\" include an amount of 2,250 thousands of euros (6,505 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022) corresponding to the investment made by the Group in Economic Interest Groupings (EIG) whose activity is the leasing of assets managed by another entity unrelated to the Group and which retains both the majority of profits as well as the risks related to the activities, with the Group only availing itself of the regulated tax incentives in Spanish legislation. The Group attributes the carryforward tax losses generated by these EIGs against shares and taking into account the debt registered with the Tax Authorities, recognising the corresponding financial income.\n\nIn addition, receivables from the termination of the GSP concession contract are included. At December 31, 2023, the total amount to be recovered amounted to 456,779 thousands of euros (473,999 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022) relating to both the recovery of the financial investment and the credit rights associated with the recovery of the guarantees executed against the Enagás Group as a result of the termination of the concession contract in GSP, the amount being updated and considering June 30, 2024 as the date for obtaining a favourable award.\n\n#### **Gasoducto Sur Peruano (\"GSP\")**\n\nIn relation to the investment in Gasoducto Sur Peruano, S.A. (hereinafter \"GSP\") as indicated in the Consolidated Annual Accounts of the Enagás Group for 2016, on January 24, 2017 the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons of the Peruvian Government's Ministry of Energy and Mines (hereinafter the \"State of Peru\") sent an official letter to GSP stating \"the termination of the concession agreement owing to causes attributable to the concession holder\", in accordance with the terms of Clause 6.7 of the \"Improvements to the Energy Security of the Country and the Development of the Gasoducto Sur Peruano\" (hereinafter \"the Project\") concession agreement, because the financial close had not been evidenced within the period established in the agreement (January 23, 2017), and proceeded to the immediate enforcement of the totality of the guarantee for full compliance given by GSP (262.5 million dollars), to ensure fulfilment of the obligations relating to the concession, which in the case of Enagás generated a payment of 65.6 million dollars. Also in January 2017, they paid GSP bank financing sureties to Enagás amounting to 162 million dollars, including both principal and interest pending payment. In December 2017, the process for delivering the Concession Assets held by GSP was substantially completed with the Peruvian State assuming control over them.\n\n{263}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nAs a result of the termination of the concession contract, in accordance with the opinion of external and internal legal advisors, the Peruvian State had the obligation to apply Clause 20 of the Concession Contract, calculating the Net Carrying Amount (hereinafter NCA) of the Concession Assets, calling up to a maximum of three auctions to award the Concession, with the auction result being to pay GSP the NCA. With the amount that GSP would have received for the NCA of the Concession Assets, it would have proceeded to settle its obligations to third parties and, if appropriate, reimburse the capital contributions made by its shareholders.\n\nAs a result of inaction by the State of Peru in relation to the aforementioned procedure, on December 19, 2017, Enagás notified the Peruvian State about the existence of a dispute relating to the investment in GSP with a view to reaching an amicable agreement on the terms of Article 9.1 of the Agreement for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of APPRI in Spanish signed by the Republic of Peru and the Kingdom of Spain. This notification represented the beginning of the six-month period for direct contact prior to initiating international arbitration in which the APPRI acts as the mechanism for recovering the investment in GSP. Once the required six months of direct contact between Enagás and the Peruvian State had elapsed without it being possible to reach an amicable settlement of this dispute, on July 2, 2018, Enagás filed an application for the initiation of arbitration against the Peruvian State regarding its investment in GSP with the ICSID.\n\nThrough this arbitration procedure, it is expected that the Peruvian State will reimburse Enagás for its investment in GSP, this being the mechanism by which the financial assets recorded in the balance sheet would be recovered. Thus, it is expected that the Arbitration Court hearing the arbitration procedure in the ICSID will uphold the arguments of Enagás, issuing an award recognising that the Peruvian State has not protected Enagás' investment under the APPRI and, therefore, it must compensate it by paying it the value of that investment.\n\nWith respect to this ICSID arbitration procedure, the Arbitration Court was constituted on July 18, 2019, and Legal Resolution No. 1 was issued on September 24, 2019, establishing the procedural rules that govern the arbitration procedure until the award is handed down.\n\nIn accordance with this Resolution, Enagás filed its claim on January 20, 2020, and the Peruvian State replied on July 17, 2020. Subsequently, the documentary exhibition phase took place in which the parties requested each other to provide documents that each of them considered relevant. This was followed by the presentation of the reply by Enagás on May 31, 2021 and the rejoinder by the Peruvian State on October 20, 2021, with Enagás finally presenting its rejoinder on preliminary objections on January 17, 2022. The hearing phase continued in September 2022, with written submissions in November 2022. According to the indications of the Court, it is at an advanced stage and is expected to be issued during the first half of 2024.\n\nAlso with regard to the ICSID, on January 21, 2020, Odebrecht filed a request to initiate arbitration against the Republic of Peru to recover its investment in GSP.\n\nRegarding the Enagás' statement of claim, the main argument maintained by Enagás is that, if the Peruvian State had complied with its obligation under the Concession Contract, it would have calculated the NCA and organised the three auctions, which it was obliged to do, to award the Concession, and the proceeds of the auction would have been delivered to GSP, which would have applied the amount delivered to pay its creditors and return the capital to its shareholders. Enagás' claim is based on the fact that the Peruvian State must pay 100% of the NCA to GSP, since on January 24, 2018, one year has passed since the end of the concession contract and in that time there have been no calls for auctions. The absence of an auction means that the legal advisors of Enagás believe that it should be considered that GSP would have received 100% of the NCA because it was deprived of the possibility of receiving it when not even the first auction was convened. Therefore, starting from the NCA considered, a certain payments waterfall would have been applied.\n\nEnagás considers that, taking into account the NCA of the Concession Assets determined by an independent expert, and also taking into account the payment waterfall as per the terms of the insolvency legislation, as well as the contracts between Enagás and the members and creditors of GSP relating to subordination and credit agreements, if the State had satisfied its obligations, and thus paid GSP the amount obtained in the auction, Enagás would have recovered its investment.\n\nWith respect to the amount of the NCA, there have been no variations other than the evolution of the exchange rate for certain items in Peruvian soles, maintaining at December 31, 2023 the valuation performed by a firm of independent appraisers hired by Enagás for a total updated value of the NCA of 1,959 million dollars (1,953 million dollars at December 31, 2022).\n\nTaking into account this updated NCA, if the payment waterfall were to be applied to it as per the terms of the insolvency laws, the subordination and the assignment of credit agreements entered into by Enagás and its partners in GSP, Enagás would recover the total value of its investment claim with the ICSID in the amount of 511 million dollars.\n\nIn relation to the aforementioned contracts for the subordination of rights and assignment of credits, their effectiveness and form of application has been successively called into question by Enagás' partners in GSP through different arbitration proceedings, with the Peruvian legal advisors considering these agreements to be fully valid and enforceable. Likewise, the INDECOPI authority has recognised the full effectiveness of the aforementioned agreements in GSP's bankruptcy process. In relation to the arbitration proceeding still in process filed by Negocios de Gas, subsidiary from Aenza (formerly Graña y Montero) questioning the legitimacy of Enagás to claim its credits against GSP, on July 13, 2021, Negocios de Gas communicated to the Court its withdrawal of the claim, thus requesting the end of the arbitration proceeding without the issuance of an award.\n\n{264}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/264/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is a logo with the word \"enac\" inside of a circle.\n\nAs regards the arbitration proceedings against the State of Peru, based on the conclusions determined by Enagás' external and internal legal advisors, the recoverability of the totality of the Enagás investment in GSP, consisting of receivables in relation to the aforementioned enforced guarantees to the total of 226.8 million dollars, interests of 1.8 million dollars, various invoices for professional services rendered to the amount of 7.6 million dollars and the share capital contributed to GSP for the amount of 275.3 million dollars, is considered likely.\n\nRegarding the duration of the recovery periods, taking into account the time required to resolve a dispute of this complexity through international arbitration, as well as the timeframes indicated in the aforementioned ICSID Resolution No. 1 and the review of the planned proceedings, and the indications of the Court itself, it is considered that June 30, 2024 is the estimated date for obtaining an award in favour of Enagás.\n\nBased on this, the amounts outlined in the preceding paragraph are recorded at their updated value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 for a total amount of 456,779 thousands of euros (473,999 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n#### **Other related matters**\n\n On March 12, 2018, Law No. 30737 was published \"guaranteeing immediate payment to the Peruvian State to repair civil damage caused by corruption and related crimes\". On May 9, 2018, Supreme Decree 096-2018-EF was published, enacting the regulations of the aforementioned Law.\n\nIn accordance with Article 9 of Law No. 30737, legal persons and legal entities in the form of partnerships, consortiums and joint ventures who may have benefited from the awarding of contracts, or subsequent to it, jointly with persons who have been convicted or who may have acknowledged having committed crimes against the public administration, asset laundering or related crimes, or their equivalents against the State of Peru, in Peru or abroad are classified as Category 2, and therefore fall within its scope of application.\n\nIn June 2019, the Peruvian Judiciary approved the Effective Partnership Agreement reached between the Odebrecht Group and the Peruvian Public Prosecutor's Office, and the GSP project was not included as one of the projects affected by corruption-related events. Subsequently, on October 15, 2019, Enagás Internacional received notification from the Peruvian Public Prosecutor's Office informing it of the existence of an extension of this effective partnership agreement with Odebrecht, in which it would be acknowledging that it had made illegal payments - according to the Public Prosecutor's Office - with respect to the GSP project, although there are still no facts known or consistent or proven links between GSP and corruption in the awarding of the project.\n\nWith regard to other processes of effective collaboration with other third parties, in the second quarter of 2022, the judicial approval of those relating to José and Hernando Graña took place, with the remaining ones pending approval. From the information contained in the tax record, there is no consistent or proven element linking GSP to corruption in the awarding of the project.\n\nIn this regard, no new facts were presented in the arbitration before ICSID, neither in the statement of defence nor in the rejoinder, nor in the hearings held, which demonstrably and irrefutably link the GSP to corruption.\n\nNotwithstanding the above comments on the extension of the initial Effective Collaboration Agreement signed by Odebrecht and the Public Prosecutor of Peru, there have been no significant developments regarding the actions of the Public Prosecutor of Peru on the investigation of Odebrecht's activities in Peru and other investigations carried out by the Special Team of the Peruvian Prosecutor's Office for alleged crimes that could somehow be related to the awarding of the project. In this regard, two investigations are known to be in progress:\n\n- The first one signed with Folder 321-2014, related to aggravated collusion between a former Odebrecht employee and a public official, whose control and clean-up phase has been resumed on June 28, 2019, after the Supreme Court rejected the request of the Ad Hoc Attorney's Office of Peru to include one of Odebrecht's subsidiaries as a civil third party. At this stage it is expected that a decision on the opening of the oral proceedings will be taken. Based on the opinions of Enagás external legal advisors for the Peruvian criminal code, the possibility of sentencing Odebrecht's former employee is considered to be remote. In this same case, the preparatory investigative court has declared the incorporation of GSP as a liable third party as wrongful.\n- In relation to the second investigation opened, sealed with Folder 12-2017, being that those under investigation include two employees of Enagás and Enagás Internacional, S.L.U., on February 27, 2020, it was decided to move to the preliminary investigation stage. Based on the opinion of our external legal advisors in Peruvian criminal law, it is maintained that to date there is no indication that the investigations could be detrimental to Enagás.\n\nIn relation to this second file, on December 30, 2020, the Peruvian Public Prosecutor's Office requested its incorporation as a civil plaintiff in the criminal proceedings in order to request the payment of a possible reparation in the aforementioned proceedings once a final judgement has been handed down, as well as in order to request possible precautionary measures that seek to ensure the eventual reparation. The initial request was rejected on formal grounds on June 4, 2021. On November 23, 2021, the Attorney's Office submitted a new request for 1,107 million dollars for the GSP project. After the two previous initial applications were rejected on formal grounds, the last application was admitted on March 28, 2023 and thus the Public Prosecutor's Office was constituted as a civil plaintiff, with Enagás Internacional, S.L.U. being incorporated as a civilly liable third party on August 2, 2023. Both proceedings have been contested and have not yet been decided.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/265/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color. The words are stacked on top of each other.\n\nThe amount will be determined in detail by the criminal judge in charge once the final sentence has been handed down. According to both external and internal lawyers, the amount requested has not been duly supported nor does it comply with the possible civil liability that could be claimed on the basis of the offences referred to in the indictment. An objective reference for the calculation is the one established by Law No. 30737, which assures payment of civil compensation to the Peruvian State. Considering the very\n\npreliminary stage of the criminal process, taking into account the elements of knowledge available to date and based on the conclusions of the specialist local lawyers, it is considered that the probability of the imposition of this compensation in any case does not exceed 50% (possible), and therefore it is not appropriate to register any provision, as it is considered a contingent liability. Likewise, in the event that it could eventually be declared wellfounded, and the amount of the compensation could not be reliably estimated, the reference amount to be considered would be between 0 and 242 million dollars.\n\nMoreover, with regard to civil compensation, even without evidence of a criminal conviction or a confession of the commission of crimes, as required under Article 9 of Law No. 30737, on June 28, 2018, the State of Peru classified Enagás Internacional on the \"List of Contracts and Subjects of Category 2 indicating the legal person or legal entity included under Section II of Law No. 30737\" in relation to the concession contract awarded to GSP. The application of the mentioned standard involves different measures to contribute to the payment of potential civil compensation, such as setting up an escrow account, reporting information, limiting transfers to other countries or preparing a compliance programme.\n\nThe total amount of the escrow account that would correspond to Enagás, estimated as 50% of the entire average equity that corresponds to its participation in GSP confirmed with the Ministry of Justice, amounts to 65.5 million dollars, Enagás having delivered a bank guarantee letter for this amount in August 2023 [\\(Note 1.9\\)](#page-25-0).\n\nIn addition, the Peruvian State has also affirmed that the measure prohibiting companies included in Category 2 from making transfers outside of Peru, pursuant to Law No. 30737, is applicable. Based on the conclusions of Enagás' external and internal legal advisors, it is maintained that this measure would be applicable to the investment in GSP and should not restrict the dividends received from TGP (amounting to 461.2 million dollars), also considering that this investment is protected by the Legal Stability Agreements in force in Peru, a regulation whose prevalence and application has been formally requested to the Peruvian state.\n\nIn order to put into practice the application of these Legal Stability Agreements, direct negotiations with the Peruvian State were initiated on February 24, 2021, followed by the submission by Enagás of a request for international arbitration under the Spanish-Peruvian APPRI on December 23, 2021. In addition, Enagás Internacional has pledged its TGP shares in favour of Enagás Financiaciones, S.A.U. and Enagás, S.A. to guarantee the payment of its present or future obligations and debts.\n\nWith respect to this ICSID arbitration procedure, the Arbitration Court was constituted on December 5, 2022, and Legal Resolution No. 1 was issued on January 26, 2023, establishing the procedural rules that govern the arbitration procedure until the award is handed down. On June 1, 2023, Enagás' statement of claim was filed with ICSID, followed by the statement of defence filed by the Peruvian State on October 6, 2023.\n\nIn view of the above, it is still maintained that these regulations do not have a negative effect on the recovery of accounts receivable through the international arbitration process indicated above recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2023.\n\nBased on all of the above, the directors of Enagás, in line with the opinion of their external and internal legal advisors, and of an independent expert and independent expert accountant, consider these facts to have no bearing on the estimation for recovery of the investment in the stake in GSP and the previously mentioned receivables to the amount of 456,779 thousands of euros (473,999 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n#### **Impairment losses on assets**\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the impact resulting from analysis of the expected loss in accordance with IFRS 9 for the financial assets of the Enagás Group described in this section amounts to 308 thousands of euros (433 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\n[model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/266/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image.

liabilities are initially measured at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.**\n- **• Subsequently, financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, except for derivative financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value.**\n- **• Financial liabilities are derecognised when the related contractual obligations are cancelled or expired. The Group also derecognises financial liabilities when there is a material change in cash flows or debt terms and conditions.**\n- **• Options on minority interests, when the agreement does not transfer the risks and rewards to the holder of the shares, result in the recognition of a financial liability. The changes in fair value of the financial liability are accounted for in the Consolidated Income Statement**\n\n{269}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-269-0\"></span>[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n**[2023](#page-1-0)**\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/269/Picture/5 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color.

All derivative financial instruments are measured, both initially and subsequently, at fair value. The differences in fair value are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except in the case of specific treatment under hedge accounting.**\n- **• The measurement and recognition criteria for derivative financial instruments in keeping with the different types of hedge accounting are as follows:**\n\t- **Cash flow hedges**\n\n**Hedges for exposure to changes in cash flows that: (i) are attributed to a specific risk associated with an asset or liability recognised for accounting purposes, with a highly likely expected transaction or with a firm commitment if the hedged risk is an exchange rate and (ii) may affect profit for the period. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised under Equity, and the gains and losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The accumulated amounts under Equity are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods in which the hedged items affect the Consolidated Income Statement.**\n\n◦ **Net investment hedging in a foreign operation**\n\n**These instruments hedge the foreign currency risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.**\n\n**The hedges for net investments in transactions carried out abroad are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges, though the valuation changes in these transactions are accounted for as translation differences under [\"Adjustments for changes in value\"](#page-221-0) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.**\n\n**These translation differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement when the gain or loss on disposal of the hedged item occurs.**\n\n**• In order for these derivative financial instruments to be classified as hedges they are initially designated as such, and the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged items is documented, together with the risk management objective and the hedge strategy for the various hedged transactions. In addition, the Group verifies initially and then periodically throughout the life of the hedge (and at least at the end of each reporting period) that the hedging relationship is effective, i.e., that it is prospectively foreseeable that the changes in fair value or in the cash flows from the hedged item (attributable to hedged risk) are almost entirely offset by those of hedging instrument.**\n\n**Any remaining loss or gain from the hedging instrument will represent an ineffectiveness of the hedge to be recognised in income of the period.**\n\n- **• Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or when it is sold, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting (after taking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable). At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in Equity will be transferred to the income statement to the extent that the expected future cash flows covered will affect profit or loss for the year.**\n- **• In accordance with IFRS 13, for purposes of presenting financial information, the measurements of fair value are classified as Level 1, 2, or 3, as indicated in [Note 3.3.](#page-261-0)**\n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/273/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image.

As required by IFRS 9, an eligible hedged item and hedging instrument have to be designated. By this means, the exchange fluctuations of the investment in foreign currency are associated with the fluctuations due to the debt obtained to finance the acquisition, which is also in that currency (Note 3.7), in such a way that there is no impact on the income statement.\n\nWith respect to net investment hedging in foreign operations, the breakdown by period in which the related cash flows will arise is as follows:\n\n| 2023        | 2024    | 2025    | 2026    | 2027    | 2028                 | Total    |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------------------|----------|\n| Derivatives | (4,518) | (4,164) | (3,969) | (3,787) | 6,355                | (10,083) |\n| 2022        | 2023    | 2024    | 2025    | 2026    | 2027 and later years | Total    |\n| Derivatives | (4,790) | (4,396) | (4,198) | (4,026) | (6,262)              | (23,672) |\n\n## 3.7 Financial and capital risk management\n\nThe Enagás Group is exposed to various risks intrinsic to the sector, the market in which it operates and the activities it performs, which, should they materialise, could prevent it from achieving its objectives and executing its strategies successfully.\n\nThe Company has established a risk control and management model based on the principle of due control, aimed at ensuring the achievement of its objectives in line with the Company's risk tolerance level and the risk appetite approved by the governing bodies, and with a risk profile periodically assessed for all its risks. The particularities of the model are set out in section IV. Risk management of the Company's Management Report.\n\nThe main risks of a financial and tax nature to which the Group is exposed are as follows:\n\n#### **Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk relates to the possible losses arising from the nonpayment of monetary or quantifiable obligations of a counterparty to which the Enagás Group has granted net credit which is pending settlement or collection.\n\nCredit risk in connection with trade receivables arising from its commercial activity is historically very limited as the Group operates in a regulated environment [\\(Note 1.1](#page-227-0)). However, regulations have been developed establishing standards for managing guarantees in the Spanish gas system and which oblige shippers to provide guarantees for: (i) contracting capacity in infrastructure with regulated third-party access and international connections, (ii) settlement of imbalances; and (iii) participation in the organised gas market.\n\nThe Enagás Group is also exposed to the risk of its counterparties not complying with obligations in connection with financial derivatives and placement of surplus cash balances. In order to mitigate this risk, these transactions are carried out in a diversified manner with highly solvent entities.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nInterest rate fluctuations affect the fair value of those assets and liabilities that accrue interest at fixed rates, and the future cash flows from assets and liabilities that accrue interest at floating rates.\n\nThe objective of interest rate risk management is to create a balanced debt structure that minimises financial costs over a multiyear period while also reducing volatility in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nBased on the Enagás Group's estimates and debt structure targets, hedges are put in place using derivatives that reduce these risks ([Note 3.6\\)](#page-118-0).\n\n#### **Exchange rate risk**\n\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect positions held with regard to debt denominated in foreign currency, certain payments for services and the purchase of capital goods in foreign currency, income and expenses relating to companies whose functional currency is not the euro and the effect of converting the financial statements of those companies whose currency is not the euro during the consolidation process. With a view to mitigating said risk, the Group can avail itself of financing obtained in US dollars, as well as contracting derivative financial instruments which are subsequently designated as hedging instruments ([Note 3.6\\)](#page-118-0). In addition, the Enagás Group tries to balance the cash flows of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency in each of its companies.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\nImage /page/275/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

For this purpose, different management measures are taken such as maintenance of credit facilities ensuring flexibility, sufficient amounts and sufficient maturities, diversified sourcing for financing needs via access to different markets and geographical areas, as well as the diversification of maturities in debt issued.\n\nThe financial debt of the Group at December 31, 2023 has an average maturity of 3.9 years (4.4 years at December 31, 2023) ([Note 3.4\\)](#page-268-0).\n\n#### **Tax risk**\n\nThe Enagás Group is exposed to possible modifications in tax regulatory frameworks and uncertainty relating to different possible interpretations of prevailing tax legislation, potentially leading to negative effects on results.\n\nThe Enagás Group has a Board-approved tax strategy, which includes the policies governing compliance with its tax obligations, attempting to avoid risks and tax inefficiencies\n\n#### **Other risks**\n\nThe Enagás Group is exposed to cross-cutting risks that do not correspond to a single risk category but may be correlated with several of them, namely risks related to the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, social and governance (ESG).\n\nIn the context of ESG risks, Enagás is exposed to certain risks arising from climate change. These risks are managed and assessed in an integrated manner within the risk management model described in the Management Report. Risks are identified and quantified which arise from factors such as political and regulatory measures to promote the use of renewable energy, natural disasters or adverse weather conditions, the volume of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, the use and technological development of renewable gases, and reputational risks (for more details on climate change risks, see chapter '[Climate](#page-53-0)  [Action and Energy Efficiency](#page-53-0)' of the [Management Report](#page-2-0)).\n\nThe impact of climate-related risks and how management assesses these risks to incorporate them into the judgements, estimates and uncertaintie[s](#page-290-0) that affect the consolidated financial statements are described in [Note 4.6.a.](#page-290-0)\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of the business and its risks, and despite having a reputational risk control and management system that responds to the best international recommendations and practices, it is not possible to guarantee that some risk may exist that is not identified in the risk inventory of the Enagás Group.\n\nIn addition, the internationalisation process carried out by the Enagás Group in recent years means that a part of its operations are carried out by companies over which it does not exercise control and which perform their activities within different regulatory frameworks and with different business dynamics, so that potential risks may arise relating to financial investment.\n\nAlso, there are uncertainties related to the deployment of renewable gases and the company's future role in the energy sector.\n\n#### a) Quantitative information\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nThe percentage of debt at fixed interest rates at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, amounted to more than 80%. Taking into account these percentages of financial debt at fixed rates, and after performing a sensitivity analysis to changes in market interest rates, the Group considers that, according to its estimates, the impact on results of such variations on financial costs relating to variable rate debt could be as follows:\n\n|                              | Interest rate change |         |        |         |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|---------|--------|---------|\n|                              | 2023                 |         | 2022   |         |\n|                              | 25 bps               | -10 bps | 25 bps | -10 bps |\n| Change in<br>financial costs | 206                  | (82)    | 591    | (236)   |\n\nIn addition, the aforementioned changes would not produce any significant changes in the Company's equity position in connection with contracted derivatives.\n\n#### **Exchange rate risk**\n\nThe currency that generates the greatest exposure to exchange rate changes within the Enagás Group is the US dollar.\n\nThe exposure of the Group to changes in the US dollar/euro exchange rate is mainly determined by the effect of translating the financial statements of the companies whose functional currency is the US dollar. In addition, there are Group companies whose functional currency is the Peruvian nuevo sol and pound sterling, although their effect is not significant.\n\nThe sensitivity of profit/(loss) for the year and equity to exchange rate risk, via appreciation or depreciation of exchange rates and based on said equity held by the Enagás Group at December 31, 2023, is shown below:\n\n|                      | Thousands of euros<br>Appreciation/(Depreciation) of the euro<br>against the dollar |         |        |          |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|----------|\n|                      |                                                                                     |         |        |          |\n|                      | 2023                                                                                | 2022    |        |          |\n|                      | 5,00%                                                                               | -5,00%  | 5,00%  | -5,00%   |\n| Effect on net profit | 4,073                                                                               | (4,073) | 3,028  | (3,028)  |\n| Effect on equity     | 5,552                                                                               | (5,552) | 11,422 | (11,422) |\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/276/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

The ratio is defined as the result of dividing consolidated net financial debt by net consolidated assets (understood as the sum of net financial debt and consolidated own funds).\n\nThe Group's financial leverage, calculated as the ratio of net financial debt and total financial net debt plus own funds at December 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows:\n\n|                               | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net financial debt (Note 3.4) | 2,725,082 | 3,468,905 |\n| Shareholders' equity          | 2,968,155 | 3,076,477 |\n| Financial leverage            | 47.9%     | 53.0%     |\n\nOn December 15, 2023, the credit rating agency Fitch Ratings maintained Enagás' outlook at stable, and placed Enagás' rating at BBB. On December 4, 2023, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Enagás' credit rating at BBB, with a stable outlook.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-277-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/277/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" and the logo for ENA.\n\n## 3.8 Cash flows\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n**• Under the Cash and other cash equivalents heading of the Consolidated Balance Sheet the Group recognises cash in hand, sight deposits, and other highly liquid short-term investments that can be readily converted into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.**\n\n#### a) Cash and cash equivalents\n\n|                                    | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n|------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Treasury                           | 366,757    | 562,474    |\n| Other cash and cash<br>equivalents | 471,726    | 796,810    |\n| Total                              | 838,483    | 1,359,284  |\n\nDeposits that are readily convertible into cash are recorded under the heading \"Other liquid assets\".\n\nGenerally, the banked cash accrues interest at rates similar to daily market rates. The deposits maturing in the short-term are easily convertible into cash, and accrue interest at the going market rates. There are no signi[fi](#page-262-0)cant restrictions on cash drawdown other than those indicated in [Note 3.3.a](#page-262-0) in relation to the GSP project in Peru.\n\n### b) Available funds\n\nIn order to guarantee liquidity, the Enagás Group has arranged credit lines which it has not drawn down. Thus, liquidity available to the Enagás Group is broken down as follows:\n\n| Available funds                  | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 838,483    | 1,359,284  |\n| Other available funds (Note 3.4) | 2,470,521  | 2,434,489  |\n| Total available funds            | 3,309,004  | 3,793,773  |\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors of the Parent Company, this situation allows for sufficient funding to meet possible liquidity requirements in the short-term considering its current obligations.\n\n#### c) Reconciliation of movements in liabilities arising from financing activities and cash flows\n\n|                                    |                                            | Debts with credit<br>institutions | Debentures and<br>marketable securities | Total     |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|\n| 12.31.2022                         |                                            | 1,690,600                         | 2,736,574                               | 4,427,174 |\n| Cash flows                         | Issuance and collection                    | 74,756                            | —                                       | 74,756    |\n|                                    | Repayment and<br>redemption                | (275,725)                         | (400,000)                               | (675,725) |\n|                                    | Payment of interest                        | (74,312)                          | (27,437)                                | (101,749) |\n| Without an impact on<br>cash flows | Interest expense                           | 70,448                            | 36,251                                  | 106,699   |\n|                                    | Changes due to exchange<br>rates and other | (24,993)                          | (1)                                     | (24,994)  |\n| 12.31.2023                         |                                            | 1,460,774                         | 2,345,387                               | 3,806,161 |\n\nThe information for the 2022 financial year is detailed below:\n\n|                                    |                                            | Debts with credit<br>institutions | Debentures and<br>marketable securities | Total       |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|\n| 12.31.2021                         |                                            | 1,777,900                         | 3,481,812                               | 5,259,712   |\n| Cash flows                         | Issuance and collection                    | 953,980                           | 1,294,000                               | 2,247,980   |\n|                                    | Repayment and<br>redemption                | (1,235,479)                       | (2,044,000)                             | (3,279,479) |\n|                                    | Payment of interest                        | (25,023)                          | (45,900)                                | (70,923)    |\n| Without an impact on<br>cash flows | Interest expense                           | 34,422                            | 50,695                                  | 85,117      |\n|                                    | Changes due to exchange<br>rates and other | 184,800                           | (33)                                    | 184,767     |\n| 12.31.2022                         |                                            | 1,690,600                         | 2,736,574                               | 4,427,174   |\n\n{278}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-278-0\"></span>[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n# 4.

These include the temporary differences, identified as those amounts expected to be payable or recoverable, arising from the difference between the book value of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as any unused tax credits. These amounts are measured by applying the tax rate to the corresponding temporary differences or tax credits at which they are expected to be recovered or settled.**\n- **• Deferred tax assets are only recognised when the Group expects sufficient future taxable profits to recover the deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for those arising from the initial recognition of goodwill.**\n- **• Recognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and the appropriate adjustments are made when there are doubts as to their future recoverability.**\n- **• The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities corresponding to one and the same tax authority, as established in IAS 12.74.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• In accordance with prevailing legislation in Spain, tax returns cannot be considered final until they have been inspected by the tax authorities or until the four-year inspection period has elapsed. However, the four-year period can vary in the case of Group companies subject to other fiscal regulations. The Directors consider that the income tax returns for the aforementioned taxes have been filed correctly and, therefore, even in the event of discrepancies in the interpretation of prevailing tax legislation with respect to the treatment applied, the resulting potential tax liabilities, if any, would not have a material impact on these Consolidated Annual Accounts.**\n- **• The deferred tax assets were recognised in the balance sheet as the Directors believe, based on the best estimate of future profits and reversals of deductible temporary differences, that it is probable that these assets will be recovered.**\n\n#### a) Balances with Tax Authorities\n\n|                                                         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Debit balances                                          |         |         |\n| Deferred tax assets (Note 4.2.f)                        | 79,019  | 72,969  |\n| Income tax and other taxes (1)                          | 10,623  | 453     |\n| Value added tax                                         | 21,928  | 24,238  |\n| Total current assets                                    | 32,551  | 24,691  |\n| Credit balances                                         |         |         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities (Note 4.2.f)                   | 208,809 | 221,720 |\n| Income tax (2)                                          | 5,652   | 70,204  |\n| Value added tax                                         | 919     | 670     |\n| Tax Authorities creditor for withholdings and other (2) | 38,203  | 79,824  |\n| Total current liabilities                               | 44,774  | 150,698 |\n\n(1) Corresponds mainly to the Corporate Income Tax of the 2023 Tax Group, amounting to 10,623 thousands of euros of balances receivable (453 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\n(2) The variation is mainly due to the capital gains tax and the retention pending payment and derived from the divestment process in Chile following the sale of GNL Quintero, S.A. in 2022, disbursed in 2023.\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-280-0\"></span>[Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/280/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green, next to the Enagas logo.\n\nb) Tax returns\n\nEnagás S.A. has been the parent company of the Tax Consolidation Group 493/12 for Corporate Income tax from January 1, 2013, comprising the following subsidiaries at December 31, 2023:\n\n- Enagás Transporte, S.A.U.\n- Enagás GTS, S.A.U.\n- Enagás Internacional, S.L.U.\n- Enagás Financiaciones, S.A.U.\n- Enagás Emprende S.L.U.\n- Infraestructuras del Gas, S.A.\n- Scale Gas Solutions, S.L.\n- Efficiency for LNG Applications, S.L.\n- Enagás Services Solutions, S.L.\n- Sercomgas Gas Solutions, S.L.\n- Enagás Holding USA.

However, the four-year period can vary in the case of Group companies subject to other fiscal regulations.\n\nDuring financial year 2021, Enagás S.A. and Enagás Transporte S.A.U. were notified that the Central Economic Administrative Court (hereinafter TEAC) had rejected the claims filed in relation to the assessments signed challenging the Corporate Income Tax for the years 2012 to 2015. During 2022, an appeal against the decisions of the Central Economic Administrative Tribunal (TEAC) was filed with the National Court of Appeal, which has not yet been decided at the time of preparing these consolidated annual accounts.\n\n In the event that this appeal were ultimately contrary to the interests of the Group, it would result in a disbursement of approximately 11.7 million euros (not including any late payment interest that may be applicable), giving rise to the recognition of a deferred tax asset of 7.5 million euros and a negative effect on net profit /(loss) of approximately 4.2 million euros. In accordance with what is mentioned in [Note 2.9](#page-255-0), during the 2023 financial year part of the provision for this concept amounting to 5.7 million euros has been made, which includes both fees and interest on late payment.\n\nThe appeal is expected to be resolved in more than one year.\n\nLikewise, at 2023 year-end, the years 2020 to 2023 are pending audit for the taxes applicable to the company, with the exemption of Corporate Income Tax, which is pending audit for the years 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe Directors consider that all taxes mentioned have been duly paid so that even in the event of discrepancies in the interpretation of prevailing tax legislation with respect to the treatment applied to transactions, the resulting potential tax liabilities, if any, would not have a material impact on the accompanying Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\nImage /page/281/Picture/11 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

This expense is recognised over the stipulated period during which employee services are rendered with a credit to \"Other equity instruments\" in the accompanying balance sheet.**\n- **In cash: personnel expenses are determined based on the fair value of the liability at the date recognition requirements are met. Personnel expenses are recognised over the stipulated period during which services are rendered in the stipulated period (Note 2.9) and are entered in \"Long-term provisions\" in the accompanying Balance Sheet, until it is estimated that they will be settled within less than one year, at which time the associated provision is reclassified to the Personnel line under \"Trade and other payables\" on the liability side of the accompanying Balance Sheet. The liability is subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date, up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement.**\n- **The Enagás Group used the Monte Carlo model to evaluate this programme. The fair value of the equity instruments at the granting date is adjusted to include the market conditions relating to this plan. Likewise, the Company takes into account the fact that the dividends accrued during the plan period are not paid to the beneficiaries as they do not become shareholders of the Parent Company until the plan has effectively been settled.**\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n- **• The Enagás Group estimates fair value of the equity instruments granted on an accrual basis over the corresponding plan period, plus the deferral and loyalty periods of approximately four months for full disbursement. In the 2022 financial year, both the 2019-2021 ILP Plan and the 2022-2024 ILP Plan are considered. 2024.**\n- **• As for that part of the plans payable in shares, the Enagás Group estimates the fair value of the amount payable in cash on an accrual basis over the plan period (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 for the 2019-2021 ILP and January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024 for the 2022-2024 ILP), plus the deferral and loyalty periods of approximately four months for full disbursement.**\n- **• On September 29, 2022, the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) approved its supervisory report on the application of the measures to separate the activities of Enagás GTS, S.A.U., with the following requirements:** \n\t- **The multi-year variable remuneration that may be assigned to Enagás GTS managers must be independent of parameters associated with transmission and other incompatible activities.**\n\t- **The Executive Director of Enagás GTS and other persons responsible for the management of this company who are beneficiaries of long-term variable remuneration shall not receive shares in the share capital of Enagás as payment for such remuneration.**\n- **• In view of the above, it has been necessary to align the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan with the requirements of the CNMC, developing two Plans and their respective Regulations, one for the Enagás Group (with the exception of Enagás GTS, S.A.U. senior managers), and another specific Regulation for Enagás GTS so that senior managers belonging to Enagás GTS will receive their variable remuneration in cash instead of receiving it in Enagás S.A. shares**\n\n| Remuneration received | Salaries | Per diems | Other items | Pension plans | Insurance<br>premiums | Termination<br>benefits |\n|-----------------------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| 2023                  |          |           |             |               |                       |                         |\n| Board of Directors    | 2,533    | 2,400     | 89          | —             | 73                    | —                       |\n| Senior Management     | 4,330    | —         | 256         | 63            | 74                    | —                       |\n| Total                 | 6,863    | 2,400     | 345         | 63            | 147                   | —                       |\n| 2022                  |          |           |             |               |                       |                         |\n| Board of Directors    | 2,645    | 2,382     | 92          | —             | 44                    | 1,630                   |\n| Senior Management     | 4,412    | —         | 181         | 82            | 37                    | 2,454                   |\n| Total                 | 7,057    | 2,382     | 273         | 82            | 81                    | 4,084                   |\n\n{286}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/286/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is the ENA logo, which consists of the letters \"ena\" in blue font, with a green and blue circle around the letters.\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors for their Board membership and those corresponding to the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer for the exercise of their executive and non-executive functions, respectively, during 2023 were approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022, 2023 and 2024\", having been modified by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022, as Item 8 of the Agenda.\n\nThe Chairman, Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá, was beneficiary of the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting on March 29, 2019 as Item 8 of the Agenda. During the 2022 and 2023 financial years, the aforementioned incentive has been settled and a total of 25,061 gross shares have been awarded in 2022 and 27,398 gross shares in 2023, which will not be available until April 2024.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is a beneficiary of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022. Item 9 of its Agenda assigned him a total of 96,970 rights relating to shares. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Management Committee) were equally beneficiaries of the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan. In the terms approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, in the settlement of this incentive in the 2023 financial year, 29,239 gross shares and a cash incentive amount of 205 thousands of euros corresponded to them.\n\nMembers of Senior Management (members of the Executive Committee) are equally beneficiaries of the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan. As approved at the General Shareholders' Meeting, the Board has assigned them a total of 145,764 rights relating to shares as well as an incentive in cash amounting to approximately 1,000 thousands of euros. These rights do not entail the acquisition of shares for the time being, since the termination of the programme and the right to accrue the final incentive, which depends on the degree of achievement of the programme's objectives, will be generated within thirty days following the approval of the 2024 annual accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.\n\nThe Group has outsourced its pension commitments with respect to its Senior Managers through a mixed group insurance policy for pension commitments, including benefits in the event of survival, death, and employment disability. The Chairman was part of the group covered by this policy and of the total premium paid for this during 2022, 62 thousands of euros corresponded to him. The Chief Executive Officer does not have a pension commitment instrument, as he does not have an employment relationship with the company, but rather a commercial relationship. The Chief Executive Officer maintains an assimilated individual savings insurance at a cost of 222 thousands of euros.\n\nThe members of the Senior Management also form part of the group insured under the mixed group insurance policy for pension commitments. The total premium paid for the same during the financial year amounts to 698 thousands of euros.\n\nThe aforementioned remuneration, broken down for each member of the Board of Directors, without taking into account insurance premiums, is as follows:\n\n{287}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  **[2023](#page-1-0)** [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0) [Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0) [Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0)  [Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\n|                                                                             | 2023  | 202   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Mr Antonio Llardén Carratalá (Executive Chairman) (1)                       | 730   | 1,594 |\n| Mr Arturo Gonzalo Aizpiri (Chief Executive Officer) (2) (4)                 | 2,152 | 96    |\n| Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (Proprietary Director) (3) | 160   | 160   |\n| Mr José Blanco López (Independent Director) (3)                             | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms Ana Palacio Vallelersundi (Independent Leading Director) (3)             | 190   | 190   |\n| Mr José Montilla Aguilera (Independent Director) (3)                        | 175   | 175   |\n| Mr Cristóbal José Gallego Castillo (Independent Director) (3)               | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms Eva Patricia Úrbez Sanz (Independent Director) (3)                       | 160   | 160   |\n| Mr Santiago Ferrer Costa (Proprietary Director) (3)                         | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms Natalia Fabra Portela (Independent Director) (3)                         | 160   | 160   |\n| Ms María Teresa Arcos Sánchez (Independent Director) (3)                    | 175   | 175   |\n| Mr David Sandalow (Independent Director) (3) (4)                            | 160   | 114   |\n| Ms Clara García Fernández-Muro (Independent Director) (3) (4)               | 160   | 113   |\n| Ms María Teresa Costa Campi (Independent Director) (3) (4)                  | 160   | 114   |\n| Mr Manuel Gabriel González Ramos (Independent Director) (3) (4)             | 160   | 113   |\n| Mr Ignacio Grangel Vicente (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | —     | 44    |\n| Mr Gonzalo Solana González (Independent Director) (3) (4)                   | —     | 44    |\n| Mr Antonio Hernández Mancha (Independent Director) (3) (4)                  | —     | 44    |\n| Ms Isabel Tocino Biscarolasaga (Independent Director) (3) (4)               | —     | 44    |\n| Mr Marcelino Oreja Arburúa (former Chief Executive Officer) (3) (4)         | —     | 43    |\n| Total                                                                       | 5,022 | 5,119 |\n\n(1) The remuneration of the Executive Chairman for the exercise of his executive duties during 2022 was that approved in detail by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May 27, 2021 as part of the \"Directors' Remuneration Policy for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years\" as approved as Item 10 of the Agenda as amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on March 31, 2022 under Item 8 of the Agenda to cover his remuneration as non-executive Chairman as from that date.

In this regard, and as previously reported, the aforementioned programme has been 50% settled during the first half of 2023.\n\nOn March 31, 2022, the Enagás, S.A. General Shareholders' Meeting approved the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan (ILP) aimed at the Executive Director, the members of the Executive Committee and the senior management of the Parent Company and its Group. The objective of the Plan is to (i) encourage the sustainable\n\nachievement of the objectives of the Company's Strategic Plan, (ii) give the opportunity to share the creation of value with participants, (iii) foster a sense of belonging to the Company and shared destiny, (iv) be competitive, and (v) align with the requirements of institutional investors, proxy advisors, and best Good Corporate Governance practices and, especially, those resulting from the recommendations of the CNMV's new Good Governance Code.\n\nThe plan consists of an extraordinary mixed multi-year incentive which will permit the beneficiaries to receive, after a certain period of time, a bonus payable in (i) Enagás, S.A. shares and (ii) cash; provided that certain strategic objectives of the Enagás Group are met.\n\n{288}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/288/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green color. To the right of the text is a logo with the letter \"e\" inside a circle.\n\nOn September 29, 2022, the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC) approved its supervisory report on the application of the measures to separate the activities of Enagás GTS, S.A.U., with the following requirements:\n\n- The multi-year variable remuneration that may be assigned to Enagás GTS managers must be independent of parameters associated with transmission and other incompatible activities.\n- The Executive Director of Enagás GTS and other persons responsible for the management of this company who are beneficiaries of long-term variable remuneration shall not receive shares in the share capital of Enagás as payment for such remuneration.\n\nIn view of the above, it has been necessary to align the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan with the requirements of the CNMC, developing two Incentive Plans and their respective Regulations, one for the Enagás Group (with the exception of Enagás GTS, S.A.U. senior managers), and another specific Regulation for Enagás GTS so that senior managers belonging to Enagás GTS will receive their variable remuneration in cash instead of receiving it in Enagás S.A. shares.\n\nWith respect to the portion payable in shares, a maximum of 679,907 shares are deliverable, all of which will come from the Company's treasury shares. Furthermore, the beneficiaries of the plan are not guaranteed any minimum value for the assigned shares. The cash part of the Plan is limited to an estimated payment of approximately 3.3 million euros should all the objectives be fully met.\n\nThis plan is aimed at persons who, due to their level of responsibility on their position in the Enagás Group, contribute decisively to achieving the Company's objectives. The Plan initially designated 53 beneficiaries, notwithstanding the possibility that new recruitments due to mobility or professional level changes may include new beneficiaries during the measurement period.\n\nThe objectives determined to evaluate the achievement of the Enagás S.A. Long-Term Incentive Plan are as follows:\n\n- Accumulated results corresponding to the Funds for Operations (\"FFO\") of the Enagás Group. This metric shows the financial soundness and net profit growth, which are the cornerstones of the Strategic Plan. This takes into account both the EBITDA of the regulated business and the dividends received from the subsidiaries that are not controlled by Enagás. It is a benchmark indicator for investors. Fulfilling this objective will satisfy the Company forecasts for the distribution of Group, investment and debt amortisation dividends. It accounts for 20% of the total targets.\n- Accumulated cash flows received from international affiliates and other businesses (\"Dividend\"). This shows the focus on international growth and a realistic and profitable investment plan as the cornerstones of the Strategic Plan. It measures the profitability of the international business compared with the annual remuneration objective which measures the year's international investment volume. It accounts for 20% of the total targets.\n- Total shareholder return (\"TSR\"). To ensure appropriate, competitive shareholder remuneration. It takes into account share performance and the dividend policy. This objective comprises\n\ntwo components, each with a relative importance of 12.5% of the total objectives:\n\n- a) Absolute TSR: this is measured as the acquisition of a target share price in 2024. The target price has been established by investing estimated share dividends and is based on profitability and market parameters.\n- b) Relative TSR: this is measured with respect to the Peer Group of fifteen companies.\n- **• The Company's commitment to long-term sustainable value creation (\"Sustainability\").** The target will have five indicators:\n\t- **Decarbonisation:** Reduction of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions in line with the decarbonisation pathway (emissions 2024 vs. emissions 2021). It accounts for 6% of the total targets.\n\t- **Investment in renewable gases:** 2022-2024 investment associated with the adaptation of infrastructure for the transmission of renewable gases and the development of infrastructure dedicated to the transmission and storage of renewable gases. It accounts for 6% of the total targets.\n- **Diversity and inclusion:** Percentage of female members on the Board of Directors. It accounts for 2% of the total targets. .\n- **Percentage of women in managerial and pre-managerial positions.** It accounts for 3% of the total targets.\n- **Percentage of promotions that are women in managerial and pre-managerial positions.** It accounts for 3% of the total targets.\n- **• Digitalisation of the company.** The target will consist of 2 indicators:\n\t- Implementation of the Digital Transformation Strategy and improvement of the associated indicators.\n\t- Strengthening the positioning of Enagás' digital assets in the company's strategic areas.\n\nIt accounts for 15% of the total targets (7.5% for each indicator respectively).\n\nRegarding the measurement period, although it will occur during the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024, its settlement will take place on the following dates:\n\n- a. The beneficiary will receive 50% of the incentive within thirty (30) days following approval of the 2024 Annual Accounts by the General Shareholders' Meeting. This 50% will apply to the assets part of the incentive as well as the cash part of the incentive;\n- b. The beneficiary will receive the remaining 50% of the incentive once a period of one year has elapsed from the first payment date.\n\n{289}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-289-0\"></span>[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/289/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas.

ILP Regulation establishes the obligation for the beneficiaries to continue to provide their services to the Enagás Group until the first payment date in order to receive 50% of the incentive, and until the second payment date in order to receive the remaining 50%, the Enagás Group accrues the estimated fair value of the equity instruments granted taking account both of the target measurement period (January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024) and the service conditions established for the period required to consolidate the remuneration.\n\nThe portion of said plan to be settled in Enagás, S.A. shares is considered a share-based transaction payable in equity instruments in accordance with IFRS 2 and, in keeping with said standard, the fair value of services received, as consideration for the equity instruments granted, is included in the Consolidated Income Statement at December 31, 2023, under \"[Personnel expenses\"](#page-221-0) in the amount of 1,439 thousands of euros and a credit to [\"Other equity instruments\"](#page-221-0) in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 (1,279 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe breakdown and fair value of the shares at the granting date of the ILP of the Enagás Group are as follows:\n\n|                                                                    | ILP<br>2022-2024 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Total shares at the concession date (1)                            | 679,907          |\n| Fair value of the equity instruments at the granting<br>date (EUR) | 20.15            |\n| Dividend yield                                                     | 7.94 %           |\n| Expected volatility                                                | 26.15 %          |\n| Discount rate                                                      | 0.48 %           |\n\n(1) This number of shares reflects the maximum number of shares to be delivered under the plan, and includes both the possibility of achieving the maximum degree of fulfilment of objectives established in the plan (125%), as well as the possibility that new hiring, staff mobility, or changes in professional levels, lead to the inclusion of new beneficiaries during the measurement period.\n\nWith respect to that part of the bonus payable in cash, the Enagás Group recognised the rendering of services corresponding to this plan as personnel expenses amounting to 635 thousands of euros with a credit to \"Provisions\" under non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 (573 thousands of euros at December 31, 2022). As in the case of the share-based payment plan component, the Enagás Group accrues the estimated fair value of the cash-settled amount over the term of the plan (from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024) and the service conditions established for the period of time required for the consolidation of the remuneration.\n\nThe objectives set to assess the achievement of the Enagás GTS, S.A.U. Long-Term Incentive Plan are as follows:\n\n- **• The Company's commitment to long-term sustainable value creation**. It accounts for 25% of the total targets.\n- **• Digitisation of the Company**. It accounts for 30% of the total targets.\n- **• Improvement of the GTS income statement**. It accounts for 25% of the total targets.\n- **• Security of supply**.

In order to achieve this, the decarbonisation of the sector and the promotion of the use of hydrogen as a key vector in the transition was established as a priority within its Strategic Plan. Enagás is working to boost domestic production of renewable hydrogen in Spain as well as in the development of new hydrogen connections with France and Portugal.\n\nFor the preparation of these Consolidated Annual Accounts and the disclosures of the Management Report, Management has considered both the impact of these initiatives and the main risks arising from climate change. These risks include regulatory measures to discourage the use of fossil fuels that reduce future gas demand and the risk of increased operating costs due to natural disasters. More detail on Climate Risks and Opportunities is provided in the section \"Management of risks and opportunities arising from climate change\" contained in the Non-Financial Information Statement.\n\nThe main aspects that the Group has considered in incorporating the measures and risks mentioned above are described below:\n\n• Impairment of non-financial assets: In the short and medium term (horizon up to 2030) a limited impact is estimated. Revenues for regasification, storage and transportation assets in Spain are calculated on the basis of a regulated remuneration system, which is made up of different terms aimed at remunerating the investment for the indicated useful lives, operating and maintenance costs, and other items associated with improving productivity and efficiency. As of today, the flows considered for the impairment test are calculated on the basis of this stable regulatory framework and are not affected by demand risk.\n\nFlows arising from future European hydrogen projects for the development and use of new infrastructures, such as H2Med, as well as the eventual adaptation of existing infrastructures, will be taken into account from the definition and approval of the regulatory framework for investment and remuneration, including, if applicable, the utilisation factor to be applied to existing infrastructures. The Group is monitoring the regulatory developments being undertaken at European level in this respect.\n\n• Property, plant and equipment: With regard to possible investments from the new connections, it should be noted that the process is currently still at an initial stage, in which the first pillars of the future Hydrogen Backbone Network are being analysed and planned and, based on the studies on the supply and demand of green hydrogen, it is being determined which plants can be reused or need to be built from scratch. At present, it has not been considered necessary to re-estimate the useful life of gas infrastructures as long as the same current regulatory and remuneration framework continues to apply, in which revenues from regasification, storage and transport activities guarantee the remuneration of the investment. In addition, the progressive plan to replace natural gas turbocompressors (the acquisition cost\n\nranges from 10 to 20 million euros per turbocompressors depending on the power) is being continued.\n\n- Provisions and contingencies: Physical risks caused by natural disasters or adverse weather conditions (floods, landslides, etc.) may cause damage to our infrastructures in Spain and in other countries in which Enagás participates. The need for additional provisions for these items or regulatory changes associated with the remuneration of decommissioning costs is reviewed at regular intervals in order to monitor possible changes in the assumptions used.\n- Impairment of investments accounted for using the equity method. No significant impacts have been identified in the calculation of the recoverable value associated with the risk of a possible fall in demand for natural gas. As far as non-financial assets are concerned, revenue projections for each of the investments have been taken into account for their infrastructure, most of which correspond to long-term stable contracts with offtakers, concessions, regulated revenues, etc.\n\nIn addition, other measures related to the energy transition that continue this year are: the inclusion of sustainability as a target in the variable remuneration of all the Group's professionals, the weight of which has increased in recent years; the Enagás Group incorporates environmental criteria in its relationships with suppliers and contractors, as well as in decision-making when awarding contracts for the provision of services and products. As indicated in Note 3.4, the Group has entered into a sustainable credit line with an interest rate linked to the reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\nDuring 2023, environmental actions were carried out in the amount of 6,752 thousands of euros, recognised as investments under assets in the Balance Sheet (8,012 thousands of euros in 2022). The Company also assumed environmental expenses amounting to 26,686 thousands of euros in 2023, recognised under \"Other operating expenses\" (20,459 thousands of euros in 2022).\n\nThe Group has arranged sufficient civil liability insurance to meet any possible contingencies, compensation and other risks of an environmental nature which it might incur.\n\nThe Group did not benefit from any tax incentives during 2023 as a consequence of activities relating to the environment.\n\n#### b) Greenhouse gas emission rights\n\nSome of the Enagás Group's facilities are included within the scope of Law 1/2005 of March 9, which regulates the commercial regime for greenhouse gas emission rights.\n\n{292}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/292/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image.

The calculation of the allocations subject to public consultation has been carried out by applying the allocation methodology set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331.\n\nOn July 13, 2021, the Council of Ministers approved the final assignation of free greenhouse gas emission rights to institutions subject to the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading regime for the period 2021-2025, among which certain facilities of the Enagás Group are included.\n\nThe rights assigned in 2023 and 2022 were 50,881 emission rights (31,724 emission rights in 2022) measured at 83.18 euros/right and 83.52 euros/right, respectively, the spot price on the first working day of 2023 and 2022 of SENDECO2 (European CO<sup>2</sup> Negotiation System), a company engaged in the purchase and sale of emission rights on its own account and in providing technical and administrative advice on industrial facilities subject to the Trade Directive (EU ETS).\n\nIn addition, in 2023, 274,000 emission allowances were acquired for consideration for a total of 22,393 thousands of euros, distributed as\n\n#### c) Audit fees\n\n\"Other operating expenses\" includes the fees for audit and non-audit services provided by the auditor of the Group, Ernst & Young, S.L., or by a company belonging to the same group or related to the auditor, broken down as follows:\n\nfollows: 75,259 emission allowances in the amount of 6,738 thousands of euros for emissions in 2022 and 198,741 allowances in the amount of 15,655 thousands of euros for emissions in 2023 (in 2021, 204,150 allowances were acquired for consideration in the amount of 16,170 thousands of euros).\n\nThe Enagás Group consumed 215,438 greenhouse gas emission rights during 2023 (283,402 rights during 2022).\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Enagás Group presented the verified emissions reports of 2022 by the accredited entity (SGS) to the corresponding Autonomous Communities, which validated the emissions. In the second quarter of 2022, the Enagás Group delivered greenhouse gas emission allowances equivalent to the verified emissions in 2022 for all the facilities referred to.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, the Enagás Group did not engage in any negotiations for future contracts relating to greenhouse gas emission rights, nor were there any contingencies relating to penalties or provisional cautionary measures in the terms established by Law 1/2005.\n\n|                                         | 2023                                                            |                                                  | 2022                                                            |                                                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Categories                              | Services rendered by the accounts auditor and related companies | Services provided by other auditors of the Group | Services rendered by the accounts auditor and related companies | Services provided by other auditors of the Group |\n| Audit services (1)                      | 1,081                                                           | 197                                              | 1,090                                                           | 253                                              |\n| Other assurance services (2)            | 427                                                             | —                                                | 336                                                             | —                                                |\n| <b>Total audit and related services</b> | <b>1,508</b>                                                    | <b>197</b>                                       | <b>1,426</b>                                                    | <b>253</b>                                       |\n| <b>Total professional services (3)</b>  | <b>1,508</b>                                                    | <b>197</b>                                       | <b>1,426</b>                                                    | <b>253</b>                                       |\n\n(1) Audit services: This heading includes services rendered for the performance of statutory audits of the Group's annual accounts and the limited review work performed with respect to the Interim and Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the Certification of the Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) System.\n\n(2) Other audit-related assurance services: This section includes the work relating to the Annual Corporate Governance Report, the review of the non-financial information included in the Management Report, the report on agreed procedures on the ICFR, the Audit Report for the Renewal of the Comfort letter, as well as the issuance of a Report on Agreed Procedures in relation to the regulatory information on costs submitted to the CNMC on June 30, 2023; Preparatory work for the issuance of a possible\n\n(3) Law 22/2015 on the Audit of Accounts establishes that non-audit services provided by the auditor must be less than 70% of the average fees paid for audit services for three consecutive years.

At these facilities, via a physical process which normally makes use of seawater vaporisers, the temperature of the liquefied gas is increased until it is transformed into its gaseous state. The natural gas is injected into the gas pipelines for transmission to the whole peninsula.\n\n**Storage of gas:** The Enagás Group operates the following underground storage facilities: Serrablo (located between Jaca and Sabiñánigo - Huesca), Gaviota (offshore storage, located close to Bermeo - Vizcaya), and Yela (Guadalajara). Likewise, the Company carries out all the operations necessary for the maintenance and operation of the facilities until the last phase of the decommissioning of the Castor storage facility is completed.\n\n#### **Regulated activities - Activity of the Technical Manager of the System**\n\nThe Enagás Group continued carrying out its functions as Technical Manager of the System in 2022 in compliance with Royal Decree 6/2000 of June 23 and Royal Decree 949/2001 of August 3, with a view to guaranteeing supply continuity and safety, as well as the correct coordination among the access points, storage, transmission, and distribution points.\n\n#### **Non-regulated activities**\n\nIncludes all non-regulated activities, as well as transactions related to investments in associates and joint ventures, except those corresponding to BBG, Saggas, MIBGAS and Iniciativas del Gas, S.L.\n\nThe above activities can be carried out by Enagás, S.A. itself or through companies with an identical or analogous corporate purpose in which it holds interest, provided they remain within the scope and limitations established by legislation applicable to the hydrocarbons sector. In accordance with said legislation, the activities related to transmission and technical management of the system which are of a regulated nature must be carried out by two subsidiaries entirely owned by Enagás, S.A. (Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. and Enagás GTS, S.A.U., respectively).\n\nThe structure of this information is designed as if each business line were an independent business, with its own resources, distributed on the basis of the assets assigned to each line in accordance with an internal system of cost allocation by percentages.\n\nThe \"Other activities\" segment also includes the activity relating to hydrogen infrastructures (mainly carried out by Enagás Infraestructuras de Hidrógeno), given that at present it is not sufficiently significant in quantitative terms to constitute a new business segment.

This gas is not reflected in the financial statements as it is gas available for the System and therefore not owned by the Enagás Group.\n\n## 4.9 Subsequent events\n\nFrom December 31, 2023 until the date of preparation of these Consolidated Annual Accounts, the following events have occurred:\n\n- On January 15, 2024, the Enagás Group has successfully completed the issue of 600 million euros in bonds maturing in 2034 and an annual coupon of 3.625%.\n- On January 15, 2024, the credit lines of 400 million dollars and 10 million dollars held by Enagás International and Enagás S.A. respectively were cancelled.\n- On January 29, 2024, the 450 million euro loan with original maturity in January 2025 held by Enagás Financiaciones was repaid early.\n\n{296}------------------------------------------------\n\nidated\nement Our b\nmodel\n\nur business\nmodel\n\nC\nthe\n\n[Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0) [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Management](#page-53-0)\n\nl Risk\nmanagement\n\n<span id=\"page-296-0\"></span>[Annual Report](#page-1-0) [Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [Risk](#page-152-0)  [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nImage /page/296/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas.

Regulatory framework\n\n## a) Adequacy of powers between the Government and the Regulator: Second regulatory period (2021-2026)\n\nIn 2019, the basis for determining the framework of the gas system applicable during the 2021-2026 regulatory period were established. The process began with the publication in the Official State Gazette (BOE) of Royal Decree-Law 1/2019 on urgent measures to adapt the CNMC's powers, where the basic legislation of the electricity and gas sectors is modified in order to perform a distribution of powers between the Government and the CNMC to adapt them to the requirements of EU law.\n\nIn this distribution of powers, the CNMC receives the transfer of all powers related to:\n\n- Toll and remuneration methodologies in transmission, distribution and LNG plants, as well as the establishment of their values.\n- Remuneration parameters and asset bases.\n- Methodology and remuneration of the Technical Manager of the System, i.e., Enagás GTS, S.A.U.\n- Methodology on the conditions of access and connection to gas infrastructures.\n- Approving the Technical Management of the Gas System Regulations (NGTS) in relation to the balance system, programming, international connections and shrinkage.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ministry for the Ecological Transition (MITECO) will be in charge of:\n\n- Establishing energy policy guidelines (Order TEC/406/2019).\n- Methodology for calculating royalties and remuneration of basic services for access to Underground Storage Facilities and approval of their values.\n- Determining the last resort tariffs (TUR).\n- Structure and methodology of the charges for costs of facilities not associated with the use of these facilities (CNMC rate, deficit annuities, regulated remuneration of Mibgas, S.A., etc.).\n- Approving the Technical Management of the Gas System Regulations related to security of supply, emergency, gas quality and input/output control.\n\nIn order to guarantee the proper functioning of both institutions, a Cooperation Committee is created between the Ministry and the CNMC, a transitional regime is established to ensure an orderly transfer of functions and to avoid affecting the legal security of the parties operating in the sectors, and the bases for the next gas and electricity remuneration period are developed.\n\nThe CNMC, within the scope of its regulatory powers, must take into account the strategic priorities established by the Government, which are embodied in energy policy guidelines adopted by order of the head of MITECO.\n\nIn these energy policy guidelines the government:\n\n- Is committed to regasification plants, promoting their competitiveness with respect to other international plants, favouring international connections and committing to a deep and liquid LNG market\n- Is positioned in favour of biomethane and other renewable gases, with special mention of the injection of hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.\n- Encourages the extension of the operation of those facilities that have exceeded their useful life in terms of remuneration.\n- Discourages investment in new infrastructure except for assets that are necessary to ensure the supply of the whole system or that are strategic for meeting energy policy objectives.\n\nAs regards remuneration, the CNMC published the following circulars to update, for the second regulatory period, the current remuneration model, as well as the system of access tolls for each of the services provided by the facility, taking into account the infrastructures involved in the provision of each service:\n\n- **• Circular 2/2019, of November 12,** establishing the methodology for calculating the financial remuneration rate for power transmission and distribution, and natural gas regasification, transmission and distribution.\n- **• Circular 9/2019, of December 12,** establishing the methodology for the remuneration of regulated natural gas transmission and regasification activities.\n- **• Circular 6/2020 of July 22,** establishing the methodology for the calculation of tolls for the regasification, transmission and distribution of natural gas.\n- **• Circular 8/2020, of December 2,** establishing the unitary benchmark values for investment and operation and maintenance for the 2021-2026 regulatory period and the minimum requirements for audits of investments and costs in natural gas transmission facilities and liquefied natural gas plants.\n- In the operational field, it published the following circulars with the aim of encouraging and facilitating competition, promoting greater use of gas infrastructure, harmonising, simplifying and establishing a transparent and competitive mechanism for the allocation and use of capacity, making the operations of agents more flexible and resolving situations of congestion at regasification plants, as well as contemplating measures to regularise the physical imbalance of LNG at regasification plants and in underground storage:\n- **• Circular 8/2019, of December 12**, establishing the access and capacity allocation mechanisms to be applied in the natural gas system.\n\n{304}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our

of December 15,** of the National Commission on Markets and Competition, amending Circular 8/2019, of December 12, establishing the methodology and conditions for access and capacity allocation in the natural gas system.\n\n## b) Remuneration of LNG transmission, regasification and storage activities in the second regulatory period 2021-2026\n\nIn accordance with the aforementioned adequacy of powers between the Government and the Regulator, the CNMC published, at the end of 2019, Circular 9/2019 establishing the remuneration system for transmission and regasification activities. The methodology opts to maintain the principles established in the current regulatory framework, defined in Law 18/2014, adapting them to current gas market conditions, while establishing an orderly and progressive transition between the two remuneration frameworks.\n\nThe review of the remuneration framework established by this Circular was completed with the approval by the CNMC, on December 2, 2020, of Circular 8/2020, establishing the unit reference values for investment and operation and maintenance for the period 2021-2026, as well as the minimum criteria for audits of investments and costs at natural gas transmission facilities and LNG plants.\n\nThe basic principles maintained in the new remuneration framework are as follows:\n\n- Establish remuneration appropriate to a low-risk activity.\n- Ensure the recovery of the investments made by the titleholders during their useful life.\n- Allow a reasonable return on financial resources invested.\n- Determine the operating costs remuneration system in a way that encourages effective management and improvement of productivity that should be partly passed on to users and consumers.\n- Contribute to the economic and financial sustainability of the natural gas system.\n- Consider the costs necessary for performing the activity by an efficient and well-managed company in accordance with the principle of performing the activity at the lowest cost to the gas system with homogeneous criteria throughout Spain, notwithstanding the specific arrangement provided for island and extra-peninsular territories.\n\nFrom a methodological perspective, the following aspects are maintained in the new framework:\n\n• The regulatory periods run consecutively for a period of six years.\n\n- The remuneration parameters for the regulated activities are set for the entire 6-year regulatory period, taking into account the cyclical nature of the economy, gas demand, the development of costs, efficiency improvements, the economic and financial balance of the system, and the reasonable profitability of these activities.\n- Remuneration continues to be calculated individually for each facility.\n- The net value of the asset is maintained as the basis for calculating the return on investment.\n- Any procedure for automatic adjustment of values and remuneration parameters according to price indices is removed.\n- Depreciation continues to be calculated on a straight-line basis and the useful lives of the assets are maintained.\n- The operating and maintenance costs of facilities that are individually remunerated continue to be calculated on the basis of the unit costs in force established in Circular 8/2020 for the facilities to which these unit reference values apply and on the basis of the audited costs for the individual facilities.\n\nOne of the most significant novelties, although it has practically no material impact, is that in order to allow the temporary coordination of remuneration with the methodology of tolls and royalties, in accordance with the European Commission Regulation the remuneration is now calculated per gas year. The gas year for which the remuneration of the facilities is determined runs from October 1 of year \"n-1\" to September 30 of year \"n\", both inclusive, with the exception of 2021 which started on January 1, 2021.\n\nThe remuneration accrued in one year for gas by each company that owns natural gas transmission facilities and liquefied natural gas plants will be the result of adding up the following remuneration components for each of its facilities:\n\n- Return on investment (RINV) which aims to recover the investments made and to obtain a reasonable return.\n- Remuneration for operation and maintenance of the facility (RO&M).\n- Productivity and efficiency remuneration adjustments (ARPE).\n- Remuneration for facilities in special administrative situations (RSAE).\n- Return on investment in facilities with cross-border impacts resulting from the application of Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No. 347/2013, (RIIT).\n\nEach of these components is presented below:\n\n#### b.1) Return on investment (RINV).\n\nIt is determined for each of the assets in production entitled to individual remuneration and is intended to provide return on investment costs incurred. The return on investment includes remuneration for depreciation and financial remuneration for assets and minimum fill level, which remain practically the same as in the current framework, and, if applicable, remuneration based on the gas transported.\n\nRemuneration for investment costs is comprised of the following:\n\n{305}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/305/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in a light green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a logo with the letters \"ena\" in a blue font. The logo also includes a green and blue circle around the letters.\n\n**• Value of assets recognised.** The values recognised in the current framework for assets brought into operation are maintained. For facilities commissioned before 2002, the corresponding amounts are calculated based on the carrying amounts of the assets once the accounting restatement of 1996 is taken into account (Royal Decree-Law 7/1996), less grants received for the purpose of financing said assets, applying a restatement coefficient comprised of the adjusted average Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Industrial Price Index (IPRI) to this difference.\n\nFor the new facilities commissioned from 2002, the standard value of each investment as established by the regulator is used, while for those which require expansion, the real cost is used.\n\nTransmission facilities commissioned from 2008 are measured by taking the average of the standard value and real cost.\n\nRegasification facilities commissioned from 2006 are measured at real cost plus 50% of the difference between the standard value and said real cost, up to a maximum of the standard value.\n\nThe new framework does present a novelty for the regasification facilities to be launched from 2020 as they will be valued as transmission facilities. That is, at the average cost between the standard value and the actual cost, without limiting it to the standard cost.\n\nThe resulting value is reduced by the amounts transferred and financed by third parties, 90% of the amounts obtained from the sale of dismantled equipment and the subsidies received (90% if they come from the European Union).\n\nAnother aspect of the new framework, applicable to transmission and regasification facilities, is that the unit investment reference values in force at the time of obtaining authorisation for the facilities will be applicable to new facilities that come into operation from 2021 onwards. Previously, these were the unit values in force when the commissioning certificate was obtained.\n\n**• Remuneration for amortisation of system assets (A).** The value of the resulting amount recognised for the investment is amortised applying a rate corresponding to its useful life, obtaining the related income in this manner.\n\nIn the new framework, the useful lives of the assets in the current framework are maintained, except for the secondary pumps of the regasification plants (which go from 20 to 10 years). In addition, for new facilities, the remuneration for amortisation starts to accrue from the date of commissioning of the facility. This is different from the current framework, as the accrual for transmission facilities started on January 1 of the year following the commissioning. The remuneration is accrued until the facility is depreciated.\n\nDepreciation is calculated for the facilities of the trunk network and regasification plants commissioned prior to January 1, 2021 and for primary transmission pipelines of local influence with administrative authorisation prior to January 1, 2021.\n\n**• Financial remuneration of the amount invested (FR).** It is calculated by applying a financial remuneration rate to the net values of the assets without restatement and accrues until the net value is zero.\n\nFor the second regulatory period, the remuneration rate on the transmission and regasification assets is no longer indexed to the government bonds, and it is calculated on the basis of the average WACC capital cost of the transmission and regasification activity. For the second period (2021-2026), the rate was established in Circular 2/2019 and was set at 5.44%.\n\nThe financial remuneration is calculated for facilities with individualised remuneration with the right to remuneration by amortisation and begins to accrue from the same date as the latter.\n\n- **• Financial remuneration for heel gas and minimum fill (RFNMLL).** The calculation method of the current framework is maintained. The remuneration is calculated by applying the financial remuneration rate to the purchase value of the gas and has no amortisation. It starts to accrue from the later of the date of purchase of the gas and the date of commissioning of the facility until the closure of the facility or the delivery of the gas to the GTS for use as operating gas.\n- **• Remuneration based on the gas transmitted or processed (RGV).** This remuneration is applied to the primary transmission facilities in the local area of influence awarded by competition and to new regasification plants and primary gas pipelines in the area of influence directly authorised after December 31, 2020. The annual remuneration is that which results from multiplying a unit remuneration coefficient by the gas transmitted or processed annually and is accrued from the date of commissioning. In no case may the RGV remuneration, in each gas year, be greater than the amounts invoiced for tolls and royalties.\n\nFor facilities awarded by competition, the unit remuneration (ROC) is that offered by the company awarded the contract, while for facilities awarded directly (RUM), the unit remuneration is the average remuneration calculated as the sum of the amortisation and financial remuneration during the useful life of the project divided by the sum of the annual gas volumes forecasted by the owner of the facility when the economic justification of the project was presented for award. For these facilities, given that the remuneration risk is greater than for the trunk facilities, the financial remuneration rate is increased by a differential provisionally set at 0.39%, resulting in a rate of 5.83%.\n\n{306}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/306/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the words is a blue and green logo.\n\nThe RGV remuneration is accrued until the present value of the sum of the recognised annual remuneration, discounted at the previous remuneration rate, is equal to the present value of the recognised investment.\n\n#### b.2) Remuneration for operation and maintenance of the facilities (RO&M).\n\nFor transmission and regasification assets to which the standard unit costs apply, the remuneration for operation and maintenance is calculated by applying the reference unit costs of operation and maintenance in force, regardless of the date of commissioning of the fixed asset (COMVU).\n\nFor the second regulatory period 2021-2026, the standard unit costs are those published in Circular 8/2020.\n\nFor one-off assets, costs are calculated on the basis of actual audited costs (COMsing).\n\nApart from the above costs, other costs not included in the unit reference values (OCOM) are also recognised and will be recognised on the basis of their audited cost. These costs include:\n\n- Direct and indirect capitalised operating expenses. When the capitalised expenses exceed 250,000 euros, they will be recognised with amortisation and financial remuneration based on their audited investment value, considering a useful life of 2 years. In these cases, the accrual will occur from January 1 of the year following their commissioning. Capitalised expenses below this limit will be recognised as an expense for the year up to the limit established by the CNMC.\n- The acquisition cost of the operating gas for transmission and of the odorant.\n- The cost of electricity supply for LNG plants and for electric motors in compressor stations. In the case of the regasification plants this audited cost replaces the variable remuneration existing in the current framework.\n- The cost increases from January 1, 2021 for municipal fees for public domain occupancy and for port fees for port domain occupancy.\n\n### b.3) Remuneration for adjustments to productivity and efficiency (ARPE).\n\nUnder this item, facilities that are at the end of their useful life (REVU) are remunerated, as are the transitional remuneration for continuity of supply (RCS), the remuneration for efficiency in operating and maintenance costs (RMP) and the remuneration for incentives to shrinkage reduction (IM) and promote gas in maritime and land transport. The items included are the following:\n\n**• Remuneration for extension of useful life for fully depreciated assets (REVU).** Once the regulatory useful life of each fixed asset finalises, if the asset is still in use, the remuneration accrued for said facility corresponding to remuneration for investment, amortisation, and financial remuneration will be nil. In contrast, remuneration for operation and maintenance of the asset \"i\" each year \"n\" will be increased. In this manner, the value recognised will be the amount corresponding to it multiplied by a coefficient for increasing its useful life, μin. This coefficient is gradually increasing,\n\nthe starting value being higher than the current remuneration framework, from 0.15 to 0.3.\n\n- **• Remuneration for continuity of supply (RCS).** A transitional remuneration is established for the RCS during the 2021-2026 regulatory period. The RCS is no longer indexed to the variation in demand or regasification but is calculated on the basis of the RCS recognised in the year 2020, adjusted by the following coefficients for the different gas years of the second regulatory period. ¾ of 95% for 2021, 80% for 2022, 65% for 2023, 50% for 2024, 35% for 2025 and 20% for 2026.\n- **• Remuneration for productivity improvements in operating and maintenance costs in regulatory periods (RMP).** This item intends to allow the carrier to retain part of the operating and maintenance cost efficiencies achieved over the previous regulatory period and is calculated per company, which is currently set at 50%. Under this item, the company is attributed 50% of the reduction in costs in the current regulatory period with respect to the unit costs of the previous regulatory period.\n- **• Shrinkage reduction incentive (IM)**. Until September 30, 2021, the same methodology is applied as at present, while as from October 1, 2021, the new methodology established in Circular 7/2021 of July 28 comes into force.\n- **• Incentive remuneration for the development of natural gas in maritime and land transport (IDS).** This incentive aims to promote the use of natural gas as a fuel in maritime and land transport and is calculated by multiplying the gas invoiced for service stations connected to the transmission network and the LNG invoiced in regasification plants for use as maritime fuel by unit coefficients, which in both cases is 0.50 euros/MWh.\n\n### b.4) Remuneration for facilities in special administrative situations (RSAE).\n\nThis remuneration applies to the Musel regasification terminal, which was suspended when the licence was processed and was in hibernation until it was commissioned in July 2023. This remuneration corresponds to a transitional remuneration made up of the sum of the financial remuneration calculated on the basis of the standard investment value and the actual audited operation and maintenance costs.\n\nIt is also applicable to the Musel regasification terminal, once it is commissioned and has a unique and temporary economic regime for the provision of LNG logistics services, in accordance with article 60.7 of Law 18/2014, as defined by the CNMC in its resolution of February 2, 2023.\n\n{307}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/307/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. Above the word is a curved line that starts as green on the left and transitions to blue on the right. The curved line is positioned to look like a smile or a stylized representation of a pipeline.\n\n[Annual Accounts](#page-220-0)\n\nIn addition, due to the transfer of remuneration rights from Enagás Transporte to Musel Energy Hub on September 29, 2023, the publication of the Resolution of December 15, 2023 determines the distribution and adjustments to the remuneration in 2023 and 2024 among the owners involved in the transfer of ownership of the El Musel plant.\n\nThis Resolution transfers to Musel Energy Hub the remuneration currently recognised by Enagás Transporte from the effective date of the transfer.\n\n### b.5) Remuneration for investments with crossborder impacts (RIIT).\n\nThis item is aimed at remunerating any costs that a carrier may incur as a result of the cross-border distribution of investment costs for a project of common European interest, as established in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 347/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 17, 2013.\n\nPipelines which affect reverse flow capacities or change the capacity to transport gas across the borders of the Member States concerned by at least 10% compared to the situation prior to the project is put into service may, in the case of natural gas, be considered as a project of common interest as set out in Appendix II to this Regulation. In the case of storage of natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG), they will be considered as a project of common interest when the project is intended for the direct or indirect supply of at least two Member States or for compliance with the infrastructure standard (n-1) at regional level, in accordance with European Regulation 2017/1938 on Security of Supply.\n\n### b.6) Introduction of the principle of financial prudence\n\nFor the purpose of incorporating a principle of financial prudence required of the holders of transmission assets and liquefied natural gas plants, a penalty is established for companies whose ratios are outside the recommended value ranges set forth in the CNMC Communication 1/2019.\n\nAccordingly, a company's annual remuneration in calendar year n could be reduced by up to 1% if the overall ratio defined in that communication, calculated on the basis of the financial statements for year n-2, is less than 0.9. However, this penalty would not be applicable until 2024, based on the 2022 financial statements.\n\n## c) Remuneration for underground storage activity\n\nIn accordance with Royal Decree 1184/2020, of December 29, which establishes the methodologies for calculating charges in the gas system, the regulated remuneration of basic underground storage facilities and the royalties applied for their use, the remuneration of the owners of basic underground storage facilities shall be determined per gas year, prior to the start of the gas year and in accordance with the methodology established in this Royal Decree 1184/2020, of December 29, following a report by the National Commission on Markets and Competition and the agreement of the Government's Delegated Commission for Economic Affairs.\n\nIn general, the remuneration methodology for underground storage is consistent with that established by the CNMC for transmission activities and LNG plants, although there are some differences due to the specific nature of underground storage facilities.\n\nOther differences include the absence of unit reference values for investment and operation and maintenance, as well as the fact that the starting coefficient established for calculating the remuneration for the extension of useful life remains at 15%, compared to 30% for other activities. This difference is justified precisely because the operation and maintenance costs of each underground storage facility are established on the basis of their real audited costs and not on the basis of a reference unit value.\n\nThe annual remuneration of each company will be obtained as the sum of the individual remunerations of all the storage facilities it owns. The titleholders of basic underground storage facilities shall be entitled to the following remuneration:\n\n- Remuneration for investment in facilities with individualised remuneration and in the purchase of gas for use as cushion gas.\n- Provisional remuneration for operation and maintenance costs.\n- Remuneration for life extension.\n- Remuneration for productivity improvements.\n- Transitional remuneration for continuity of supply, in accordance with the second transitional provision.\n- Review, if applicable, of the provisional operation and maintenance remuneration.\n\nAnother novelty of the new remuneration framework is that it establishes a greater level of detail in the definition of the useful life of investments in underground storage facilities. Thus, previously a useful life of 20 years was established for all investments, but now a distinction is made between useful lives of 10 years for research and vehicles, 20 years for facilities, off-shore platforms, vessels, helicopters and cushion gas, 40 years for gas pipelines and 50 years for onshore civil works.\n\nThe remuneration of each holder will be reduced according to the related income obtained, and by application of the penalty for insufficient financial prudence, calculated in accordance with Article 27 of Circular 9/2019, of December 12, of the National Commission on Markets and Competition, which establishes the methodology for determining the remuneration of natural gas transmission facilities and liquefied natural gas plants.\n\n{308}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/308/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in light green on the left, and the word \"enaga\" in blue and green on the right, with the letters inside a green and blue circle.\n\n## d) Income corresponding to Technical Management of the System (GTS)\n\n### Remuneration recognised in the 2021-2023 and 2024-2026 regulatory periods\n\nIn accordance with the adequacy of powers between the Government and the Regulator, the CNMC published, at the beginning of 2020, Circular 1/2020, establishing the methodology for the remuneration of the Technical Manager of the System.\n\nThis establishes a methodology that allows the remuneration of the GTS to be set on the basis of known criteria and parameters, thus giving the remuneration framework the transparency, security and visibility in the medium-term that it lacked.\n\nThe Circular establishes regulatory periods of 3 years for the GTS, as opposed to 6 years for transmission and regasification activities.\n\nThe new remuneration methodology is based on the following principles:\n\n- Obtaining a reasonable return for a low-risk activity.\n- Consideration of the costs incurred by an efficient and wellmanaged company.\n\nThe methodology takes into account that the activity of the GTS requires few assets, basically in software and applications, that its costs correspond mainly to personnel and external services costs, and that its activity is strongly conditioned by European regulations and projects, in a changing and evolving environment, to which it must continuously adapt.\n\nThe remuneration is the sum of a basic remuneration (Bret), an incentive remuneration (RxInc), a remuneration for new obligations (CR and Guarantees of Origin) and a remuneration (D) for the difference, positive or negative, between the amounts received by the technical manager of the system for the application of the quota for the financing of the remuneration and the annual remuneration to be established for year n and for the difference between the estimate of the incentive remuneration term and the amount resulting from the level of compliance with it (the National Commission on Markets and Competition will determine by resolution the level of compliance with the incentives for year n).\n\nThe basic remuneration is made up of:\n\n- Remuneration for OPEX, (BOpex): based on financial and regulatory accounting.\n- Margin on recognised OPEX, (BMarg\\_Opex), set at 5%.\n- Remuneration for depreciation, (BAmort), based on the depreciation of financial and regulatory accounting.\n- Financial remuneration, (BRF) by applying a remuneration rate to the net asset value. The rate is the same as for transmission and regasification activity, 5.44% for the period 2021-2026.\n\nRemuneration for incentives that can be up to +- 5% of the basic remuneration, depending on the incentive mechanism established by the CNMC for each regulatory period. However, for the regulatory period 2021-2023 the limits are set at +/-2%. At the end of 2020, the\n\nCircular establishing these incentives was being processed, and was published in the Official State Gazette in July 2021, effective as of October 1, 2021.\n\nThe remuneration for new obligations is established on the basis of a regulatory account, the balance of which is established for each regulatory period, divided by 3, for each of the years of the regulatory period. For the regulatory period 2021-2023, the regulatory account is 5 million euros.\n\nThus, for the regulatory period 2021-2023, the basic remuneration is set at 25,007 thousands of euros and the remuneration of the regulatory account at 1.667 thousands of euros.\n\nFor the 2024-2026 regulatory period, the remuneration base remains constant, the same as for the 2021-2023 regulatory period, as do the parameters for its calculation. The value is 25,007 thousands of euros.\n\nThe Resolution of March 2, 2023 adjusts the remuneration to the gas year, so that the remuneration corresponding to 2023 covers the period from January 1 to September 30. The remuneration of the GTS for 2023 is 16,038 thousands of euros. It has been calculated considering 14,904 thousands of euros of remuneration for OPEX, a margin of 5% of OPEX (745 thousands of euros), 8,650 thousands of euros of amortisation, 708 thousands of euros of financial remuneration, 1,667 thousands of euros for the annual amount accrued from the regulatory account for new obligations and 500 thousands of euros for the incentive remuneration. A ratio of 9/12 of the full year has been considered. Finally, the differences between the amounts accrued and amounts actually incurred corresponding to previous years have been included, amounting to 4,303 thousands of euros to be refunded.\n\nFor the 2024-2026 regulatory period, the remuneration base remains constant, the same as for the 2021-2023 regulatory period.\n\nAs in the current framework, the remuneration of the GTS will be recovered through the application of a fee, calculated as a percentage of the turnover from tolls and royalties.\n\n## e) Tolls and royalties relating to third party access to the gas system\n\nThe revenues collected from the application of tolls for third party access to gas facilities are exclusively used to support the remuneration of regulated activities for gas supply. As gas system revenues are used to finance all gas system costs, they must be sufficient to meet the full costs of the gas system.\n\nThe tolls and royalties are established so that their setting responds as a whole to the following principles:\n\n- Ensure the recovery of the investments made by the titleholders during their useful life.\n- Allow a reasonable return on financial resources invested.\n\n{309}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Consolidated](#page-3-0)  [Management](#page-3-0) \n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\n[Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/309/Picture/6 description: The image contains the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" in green font on the left side of the image. To the right of the text is a logo with the letters \"ena\" in blue and green.\n\n• Determine the operating costs remuneration system in a way that encourages effective management and improvement of productivity that should be partly passed on to users and consumers.\n\nIn addition, tolls and royalties will take into account the costs incurred by the use of the network in a way that optimises the use of infrastructures and can be differentiated by pressure levels, consumption characteristics and duration of contracts.\n\nThe values applicable from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 have been published in the Resolution of May 19, 2022, of the National Commission on Markets and Competition, which establishes the access tolls to the transmission networks, local networks and regasification for the 2023 gas year.\n\nSimilarly, the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge is responsible for setting the remuneration and fees for access to underground storage facilities. From October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the values of the access charges published in the Order TED/929/2022 of September 27, which establishes the gas network charges and the remuneration and charges for underground base storage for the gas year 2023, shall apply.\n\n## f) System of settlement of costs and regulated revenues\n\nUntil September 30, 2021, the billing and collection of the remuneration of regulated activities were subject to the settlement procedure established in Ministerial Order ECO 2692/2002, of October 28, regulating the settlement procedures for the remuneration of regulated activities, charges and fees with specific destinations in the gas sector.\n\nFrom October 1, 2021, the settlement procedures established in Ministerial Order TED/1022/2021, of September 27, regulating the settlement procedures of the regulated activities remunerations, charges and fees with specific destinations of the gas sector, are applicable.\n\nThe update of the settlement procedure was motivated to adapt it to the European Commission Regulation 2017/460 of March 16, 2017, establishing a network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas. This Regulation determines the need for a regulatory account for the transmission activity that reflects the difference between the recognised remuneration and the revenues actually obtained in the tariff period, a principle that, in order to avoid discrimination, must also be applied to other activities.\n\nIt is also necessary to incorporate changes to adjust the calendar for sending information and approving settlements to adapt it to the gas year (from October 1 to September 30 of the following year).\n\nThus, 5 separate settlement procedures are established for the following activities:\n\n- a. Trunk transmission.\n- b. Local networks, which will include distribution, secondary transmission and primary transmission activities of local influence and any other facility determined by the regulations in force.\n- c. Liquefied natural gas plants.\n- d. Basic underground storage facilities.\n- e. Gas system charges. It will include the revenues from application of the unit charges defined in Royal Decree 1184/2020, of December 29, establishing the methodologies for calculating the gas system charges, the regulated remuneration of basic underground storage facilities and the fees applied for their use, and the costs listed in Article 59.4.b) of Law 18/2014, of October 15. Basically, the costs to be recovered through charges are: CNMC fee, differential cost of supply of liquefied or manufactured natural gas in island territories, annuity of the deficit for 2014 and subsequent years (until 2020), demand management measures that are recognised by regulation, the approved remuneration of the natural gas Market Operator and any other cost that is legally established.\n\nIt is understood that annual mismatches between revenues and costs of the gas system occur if the difference between revenues and settlement costs in each of the settlement procedures of a gas year results in a negative amount.\n\nAs from October 1, 2021, with the entry into force of Order TED/1022/2021, the provisional annual mismatches between revenues and costs for the year for each settlement procedure are determined in the provisional settlement 14 of each year. The provisional annual mismatch of each subject, whether positive or negative, will be recognised in the form of a lump sum payment in the first available settlement of the gas year following the provisional settlement 14.\n\nThe final settlement will determine the final annual mismatch between revenues and costs for each obligated party. The difference between the final and provisional deviation, whether positive or negative, will be settled as a one-time payment in the first available settlement of the following gas year.\n\nAdditionally, in accordance with the provisions of Article 61.3 of Law 18/2014 of October 15, 2014, as long as there is an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2014 or mismatches between revenues and expenses of subsequent years pending amortisation, any surplus or deficit in collection under charges shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article, without being able to reduce the amount thereof. Once there are no outstanding deficits and mismatches to be amortised, any deficit/ surplus in the collection of charges will be applied in the calculation of charges for the following year.\n\nLaw 18/2014, of October 15, establishes the principle of economic and financial sustainability in the gas system. In accordance with this principle, revenues from the system will be used exclusively to sustain own remuneration of the regulated activities concerning the supply of gas and, furthermore, the revenues must be sufficient to satisfy all of the costs incurred by the gas system. In addition, in order to ensure economic sufficiency and avoid the appearance of new deficits ex ante, all regulatory measures relating to the gas system which involve an increase in costs for the system or a reduction of income must incorporate an equivalent reduction in other cost items or an equivalent increase in income which ensures equilibrium for the system.\n\nAlso, the previous remuneration framework established a specific methodology for resolving temporary imbalances between revenues and costs of the system, with a series of measures aimed at definitively ending the deficit of the gas system, such as:\n\n{310}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0)\n\n[Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0) [Key indicators](#page-161-0) [Appendices](#page-168-0) [Consolidated](#page-220-0) \n\nImage /page/310/Picture/6 description: The image shows the words \"Consolidated Annual Accounts\" stacked on top of each other. The text is in a light green color.\n\nImage /page/310/Picture/7 description: The image shows the logo for Enagas. The logo consists of the word \"enagas\" in a lowercase, sans-serif font. The \"e\" is in a teal color, and the rest of the letters are in a darker blue. A green arc surrounds the word, starting from the bottom of the \"e\" and ending at the bottom of the \"s\".\n\n- As long as there are annual amounts pending payment from previous years, tolls and royalties cannot be revised downwards, but will be increased if there are negative mismatches that exceed a set limit.\n- A period of several years is established for the recovery of imbalances, also recognising financial costs to the companies regulated by the financing of these imbalances, in such a way that the subjects shall recover:\n\t- The accumulated deficit of the gas system at December 31, 2014 during the fifteen years following the date of approval of the final settlement of that financial year, recognising an interest rate in conditions equivalent to those of the market.\n- And the temporary imbalances between income and expenses resulting for 2015 during the following five years, also recognising an interest rate in conditions equivalent to those of the market.\n\nIf the annual mismatch between revenues and recognised remuneration is positive, the amount will be used to settle the outstanding annual payments relating to mismatches from previous years. This amount will be applied first to the temporary imbalances between revenues and costs of the system and then to those annual payments relating to the accumulated deficit of the gas system at December 31, 2014.\n\nSince 2018, positive annual mismatches between income and remuneration have been generated (surplus), so that the 2015 and 2017 financial years were amortised on an accelerated basis against the surplus of this 2018 financial year. Similarly, in 2019, the annual mismatch between income and remuneration resulted in a surplus of 353,859 thousands of euros, with the collection right pending receipt for the 2016 (33,475 thousands of euros) mismatch being fully amortised, and the 2014 mismatch being partially amortised (320,384 thousands of euros).\n\nFrom that date, the annual mismatch between revenues and remuneration is used to cover the negative mismatch pending from 2014, partially amortising 186,691 thousands of euros against the surplus for 2020 and 81,127 thousands of euros against the surplus for 2021, whose resolution was approved by the CNMC on July 28, 2022.\n\nSince 2023, only the surplus originated in the settlement of charges is used to amortise the negative mismatch pending from 2014. Therefore, 11,280 thousands of euros are amortised against the surplus from 2022, a resolution approved on July 27, 2023.\n\nAs of October 1, 2022 (start of gas year 2023) the outstanding capital amounts to 58,832 thousands of euros. In 2023, the outstanding deficit accumulated up until 2014, as per the provisions of article 66 of Law 18/2014, was successfully reduced by an annual amount of 6,429 thousands of euros.\n\nFurthermore, in 2023, the surplus resulting from the settlement of charges for the gas year 2022, totalling 11,280 thousands of euros, was utilised for the first time to offset the remaining negative imbalance from 2014, this decision having been made on July 27, 2023.\n\nThus, the 2014 mismatch remaining to be amortised at October 1, 2023 (start of the 2024 gas year) amounts to 41,122 thousands of\n\neuros, which is much lower than the 1,025,053 thousands of euros accumulated at December 31, 2014.\n\nWith regard to the Company's share of the deficit generated by the system during 2014, it should be noted that, as reported in the 2017 annual accounts, on December 1, 2017 the receivables from the accumulated deficit rights at December 31, 2014 were assigned. Said rights represented an amount of 354,751 thousands of euros, corresponding to the nominal amount plus accrued interest pending collection at the date of cession. Through the above operation Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. transferred the obligations and contractual rights involved in the ownership of the transferred financial asset to the Santander Group, and proceeded to derecognise that financial asset from the Balance Sheet, as the Sole Director of Enagás Transporte, S.A.U. deemed that all the risks and benefits associated with it had been substantially transferred, together with control of the aforementioned financial asset.\n\n## g) Development of the regulatory framework in 2023\n\nThe main regulatory developments applicable to the gas sector, approved in the course of 2023, were the following:\n\n## 1.Supranational regulations\n\n#### **Projects of Common Interest (PCI) and Projects of Mutual Interest (PMI)**\n\n**Commission Delegated Regulation of November 28, 2023 amending Regulation (EU) 2022/869 of the European Parliament and of the Council** as regards the Union list of Projects of Common Interest and Projects of Mutual Interest.\n\n#### **RePowerEU**\n\n**Regulation 2023/435 of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 27, 2023** amending Regulation 2021/241 as regards the REPowerEU chapters in recovery and resilience plans and amending Regulations 1303/2013, 2021/1060 and 2021/1755, and Directive 2003/87/EC.\n\nCommunication from the Commission of March 3, 2023 on Guidance on recovery and resilience planning in the context of REPowerEU.\n\n#### **Renewable energy**\n\n**Commission Delegated Regulation 2023/1184 of February 10, 2023** supplementing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union methodology setting out detailed rules for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin:\n\n{311}------------------------------------------------\n\n[Report](#page-3-0)\n\n[Our business](#page-10-0)  [model](#page-10-0)\n\n[Our commitment to](#page-16-0)  [the energy transition](#page-16-0) [Environmental, Social](#page-53-0)  [and Governance](#page-53-0)  [Management](#page-53-0)\n\n[Risk](#page-152-0)  [management](#page-152-0)\n\nImage /page/311/Picture/6 description: The image contains the logo for the company Enagas.
