After the sale of the medical business last summer, we now focus on our industrial core business. In addition, with the acquisition of the Rico Group, we took another step towards strengthening our position as a specialist for elastomer products and further expansion of our leadership position with even greater customer proximity.\n\nThe transformation focused on the industrial business and underlined the need for a leaner organization and an even more competitive fixed cost structure. This also led to the revision of our sustainability strategy in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the adjustment of several ESG targets of the \"Sustainability Strategy 2030\" to the new organizational and regulatory framework. Sempermed, the most energy-intensive production, which also had the greatest potential for improvement, has now left the Semperit Group. As a result, Semperit's new structure now comprises of a reduced savings potential compared to our original target. Nevertheless, our new targets are quite ambitious and are being pursued with extensive action plans at all sites.\n\nIn the area of Social and Governance, Semperit continues to place a strong focus on diversity and inclusion: we set a quantitative objective for gender equality and reaffirmed our commitment by signing the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles and adopting the first Semperit Diversity Charter. We are thus sending a clear message: gender equality has not yet been achieved at Semperit, but we are aware of our obligation and will fulfill it.\n\nWe also implemented new initiatives in other areas in the course of the expansion of our ESG management. As part of the continuous improvement of our climate risk management and the implementation of the EU Taxonomy and CSRD, we carried out a climate scenario analysis for all sites, selected strategically important suppliers for the first time and gained important insights for Group-wide adaptation to climate change. Another milestone was the establishment of our ESG Committee, in which the Executive Board and Supervisory Board deal in depth with environmental,\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/1 description: A man with short dark hair is wearing a blue suit and a red tie.

This committee is an important platform for our ESG plans and contributes to anchoring them even more firmly in our corporate strategy. Semperit also concluded ESG-based financing with a volume of EUR 250 million, consisting of a loan and a credit line, for the first time in the past financial year.\n\nOur progress is also recognized internationally. Semperit once again achieved EcoVadis Platinum status in 2023. EcoVadis is considered the world's largest provider of sustainability ratings for companies. This award underlines our success in integrating sustainability into our business processes and corporate strategy. By publishing our environmental data as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project, we were able to achieve a score of C from the CDP Climate Change program. We are proud of these successes, but also take them as an incentive to continue on our path towards a more sustainable future.\n\nOn the following pages, you will read about the developments we have seen in recent months, the areas we have defined as essential for the sustainable development of the company and our employees, and the goals we have set ourselves for the next stages of our journey towards an environmentally conscious and successful future. We will be delighted if you join us on this journey!\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/11 description: A headshot of a middle-aged man with short gray hair, wearing a blue blazer over a black v-neck shirt, set against a light gray background.

interdisciplinary skills. Semperit therefore relies on a broad and diverse portfolio of competencies at the Executive Board level. This covers the management of key topics such as energy, material use, waste management, health and safety as well as the management of sustainable supply chains, and also includes previous experience in strategic sustainability management. Semperit's gradual shift to renewable energy supply is driven by the Executive Board members' prior experience in implementing energy optimization programs. All members of the Executive Board played leading roles in this area in their previous functions.\n\nHealth and safety were one of the core areas of CEO Karl Haider. In his function as Director of Operations Downstream, he was dedicated to the development and implementation of safety concepts for 18 sites. In addition, he was a decision-maker in responsible sourcing and therefore brings relevant knowledge from sustainable supply chain management.\n\nIn addition, Karl Haider has been involved in the topics of \"Green Steel\", carbon storage, capture and utilization, CO2-low steel production and hydrogen-based energy systems in his previous work in the steel industry. CFO Helmut Sorger was entrusted with the development of sustainability reporting in his function as Head of Corporate Reporting as early as 2013. As sustainability management is increasingly intertwined with finance, he is expanding the core competencies to include a capital market perspective.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Semperit Group Environment Social Governance Appendix\n\nSocial\n\n### **C O O P E R AT I O N B E T W E E N T H E E X E C U T I V E B O A R D A N D SUPERVISORY BOARD**\n\nThe dual management structure of Semperit AG Holding as a publicly listed stock corporation consists of an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. Both bodies are strictly separated from each other in terms of personnel and functions and can therefore perform their different tasks independently. The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company, while the Supervisory Board is responsible for monitoring it. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board are committed to managing the company in accordance with the principles of good corporate governance. This management takes place in an open dialogue between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as within these corporate bodies to ensure its continuous development. Among other things, the Executive Board's internal rules of procedure govern the Executive Board's ongoing reporting to the Supervisory Board. They also specify a catalogue of transactions and measures that, in\n\n### **COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD 1**\n\naddition to legal provisions, require the Supervisory Board's explicit authorization. The Supervisory Board monitors the Executive Board and supports it in managing the company, particularly when decisions of fundamental importance are to be made. The strategic direction of the company is determined in close cooperation between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and is discussed in Supervisory Board meetings held at regular intervals.\n\n### **F U N C T I O N A N D C O M P O S I T I O N O F THE SUPERVISORY BOARD**\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Supervisory Board consisted of seven shareholder representatives and four employee representatives and has resolved to establish the following committees consisting of its own members to carry out specific functions: Audit Committee, Nominating and Remuneration Committee, Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee, ESG Committee and Committee for Urgent Issues. The authority to make decisions and pass resolutions rests primarily in the hands of the entire Supervisory Board.\n\n|                                                                                   | Year of<br>birth | First appointed<br>to the Supervisory Board | Current term of office 2                                                       | Supervisory board positions in<br>other listed companies                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE                                                        |                  |                                             |                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Thomas Cord Prinzhorn,<br>Chairman since 25.04.2023 3,4                           | 1972             | 25.04.2023                                  | Until the Annual General<br>Meeting, resolving upon the<br>2025 financial year | Lenzing AG (Chairman)                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Stefan Fida, Chairman until<br>25.04.2023, Deputy Chairman<br>since 25.04.20233,4 | 1979             | 29.04.2014                                  | Until the Annual General<br>Meeting, resolving upon<br>the 2024 financial year | Lenzing AG                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Birgit Noggler, Deputy Chairwoman<br>until 25.04.2023 Member since 3,4            | 1974             | 08.05.2019                                  | Until the Annual General<br>Meeting, resolving upon the<br>2024 financial year | Raiffeisen Bank<br>International AG                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Stephan Büttner, Member3,5,6                                                      | 1973             | 27.04.2022                                  | Until the Annual General<br>Meeting, resolving upon the<br>2023 financial year | –                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Klaus Friedrich Erkes, Member3                                                    | 1958             | 23.05.2017                                  | Until the Annual General<br>Meeting, resolving upon the<br>2026 financial year | Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Simona<br>AG (based in Kirn, Germany);

Overall attendance was 99%; only one member was absent from one meeting. Stefan Fida served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Birgit Noggler as Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board until the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023. Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting; he was elected as Chairman and Stefan Fida as Deputy Chairman at the constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board. The individual Supervisory Board meetings focused on the further development of the industrial strategy and the associated implementation of the new organizational structure, the acquisition of the RICO Group, the sale of the medical business and measures to reduce costs and increase efficiency.\n\nThe Audit Committee led by finance expert Birgit Noggler performs its duties in accordance with Article 92 Section 4a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and Rule 40 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. In 2023, the Audit Committee held four meetings, focusing particularly on the preparation of the adoption of the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2022, on the acquisition of the RICO Group as well as the sale of the medical business, on risk management, the internal control system, internal auditing, the compliance organization, IT security (cybersecurity), and the preparation of the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023.\n\nThe Nominating and Remuneration Committee was chaired by Stefan Fida until 25 April 2023, and Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was appointed Chairman at the constituent Supervisory Board meeting following the Annual General Meeting. In eight meetings, the Committee focused on the performance assessment and agreement of targets for the members of the Executive Board. Other focal points were the early departure of Kristian Brok as well as the succession to the Executive Board and the appointment of Gerfried Eder. In addition, the potential and succession issues of the second management level and initiatives for talent management within the company were discussed with the Executive Board.\n\nThe Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee, which was established in April 2023, held two meetings under the chairmanship of Thomas Cord Prinzhorn. The committee focused on supporting the strategy process, including the realignment of the organizational structure, as well as discussing strategic initiatives and growth potential. The committee also dealt intensively with the innovation portfolio and the KPIs of the innovation process.\n\nThe ESG Committee, which was also founded in April 2023, monitors the establishment and effectiveness of sustainability reporting, deals with defining ESG targets in Executive Board remuneration and supports the Supervisory Board with other ESG issues, particularly if these are relevant to the Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee. Under the chairmanship of Thomas Cord Prinzhorn, the committee held one meeting to discuss the updating of the ESG strategy and targets as a result of the restructuring of the Group and the implementation of new ESG regulations and standards (e.g., CSRD).\n\nThe Committee for Urgent Issues, headed by Thomas Cord Prinzhorn since 25 April 2023, did not hold any meetings.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, the Supervisory Board completed a comprehensive self-evaluation based on both qualitative and quantitative assessment in accordance with C Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In addition to a generally very positive evaluation result for the Supervisory Board's activities, specific measures to increase efficiency were also derived from this. These measures related, for example, to the areas of organization and working methods, information and communication or committee work and further training. An update of the quantitative evaluation is planned for the second half of 2024 in order to review the successful implementation of the measures developed and to identify further areas for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the Supervisory Board's work.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nSemperit Group Environment Social Governance Appendix\n\nSocial\n\n### **COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES1**\n\n| Ausschuss                                                          | Geburtsjahr                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Committee for Urgent<br>Issues                                     | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (member<br>and Chairman since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stefan Fida (Chairman until<br>25.04.2023)<br>Markus Stocker                                                          |\n| Nominating and Remune-<br>ration Committee                         | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (member<br>and Chairman since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stefan Fida (Chairman until<br>25.04.2023)<br>Markus Stocker                                                          |\n| Audit Committee                                                    | Birgit Noggler (Chairwoman,<br>financial expert)<br>Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Member<br>since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stephan Büttner<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker                    |\n| Strategy, Growth and<br>Innovation Committee<br>(as of 25.04.2023) | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Chairman)<br>Klaus Friedrich Erkes<br>Claus Möhlenkamp<br>Marion Weissenberger-Eibl<br>Birgit Noggler<br>Monika Müller<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker |\n| ESG Committee<br>(as of 25.04.2023)                                | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Chairman)<br>Stefan Fida<br>Birgit Noggler<br>Marion Weissenberger-Eibl<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker                                                |\n\n1 As of 31 December 2023.\n\n2 On 25 April 2023, Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting and elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board at its constituent meeting. At the same time, he took over from Stefan Fida as Chairman of the Committees for Urgent Issues and the Nominating and\n\n### **G U I D E L I N E S F O R T H E I N D E P E N D E N C E O F SUPERVISORY BOARD MEMBERS**\n\nThe Supervisory Board adopted the guidelines for independence as per Appendix 1 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. According to this, all members of the Supervisory Board declared their independence from the company and its Executive Board. In addition, pursuant to C-Rule 54 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the members Stephan Büttner, Claus Möhlenkamp and Marion Weissenberger-Eibl were not shareholders of the company with an investment of more than 10 % each nor did they represent the interests of such shareholders in 2023. There is D&O insurance for the Supervisory Board. The associated expenses are borne by the company.\n\n### **MANAGERS' TRANSACTIONS**\n\nThere were no proprietary transactions in the financial year. In general, transactions in shares or debt instruments of the company or related derivatives or\n\nfinancial instruments by members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are published in accordance with Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation at <https://issuerinfo.oekb.at> and on the company's website.\n\n### **EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND DIVERSITY**\n\nThe promotion of Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) is an essential part of Semperit's sustainability strategy. The vision for Diversity & Inclusion 2040 is to promote a collaborative and inclusive work culture in which all employees feel valued, have a sense of belonging, feel comfortable, can live their authentic selves and are respected as individuals. The intention is to ensure fairness in all aspects. Semperit wants to reduce unconscious bias and use the great diversity in the workforce to its advantage in order to benefit from the experiences and perspectives of people with different cultural imprints and other backgrounds (for details see also Sustainability Report 2023). Respect, diversity, and inclusion are integral and indispensable elements of the corporate culture of Semperit AG Holding and are always considered when filling vacancies. When proposals are made to the Annual General Meeting for filling Supervisory Board mandates and when nominating Executive Board members, special importance is attached to expertise and diversity because this contributes significantly to the level of professionalism and efficiency delivered through the work of the Supervisory and Executive Boards. In addition to professional and personal qualifications, aspects such as age, ethnic origin, gender, education, and experience are also factored in. The written version of a diversity concept of the Supervisory Board was adopted on 1 February 2018 and updated in the 2021 financial year.\n\n### **ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN**\n\nSemperit is committed to equal opportunities for all employees – regardless of age, gender, nationality, religion, skin color, or sexual orientation. A person's skills and potential are what counts. The gradual increase in the proportion of women in the Semperit Group, which – typical for an industrial company – is lower than in other sectors, is a central goal for human resources. The measures to promote women include flexible working models in the form of flexitime and part-time work as well as special agreements for parttime parental leave. These measures and the new ESG target introduced by the Executive Board in 2023, which will be applicable from 2024, are intended to contribute to a continuous increase in the proportion of women (for more details, see the 2023 Sustainability Report). In addition to the new target, the Executive Board has set another example in the fight against gender inequality and signed the UN-initiated Women's Empowerment\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nSemperit Group Environment Social Governance Appendix\n\nSi\n\nPrinciples (WEPs). These comprise a series of principles that provide companies with guidance on how they can promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. As a traditional industrial company with a technical focus, the share of women was 27 % across the Group in 2023 (2022: 23 %). Since May 2017, Semperit AG Holding has met the quota for women on the Supervisory Board, which has been required by law since 2018. Overall, the share of women in management (Executive Board, Management Forum, department heads) was around 14 % (2022: 13 %).\n\n### **REMUNERATION POLICY**\n\nIn accordance with Section 78c of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and, as a result, in accordance with the amended reporting requirements in the Corporate Governance Code and AFRAC Statement 37 on the Compensation Report, Directive (EU) 2017/828 to promote long-term participation of shareholders was implemented in the 2019 Stock Corporation Law Amendment Act. Accordingly, the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board must be dealt with in a separate remuneration report and presented to the Annual General Meeting (please also refer to [www.semperitgroup.com/investor-relations/](http://www.semperitgroup.com/investor-relations/reports-presentations) [reports-presentations\\)](http://www.semperitgroup.com/investor-relations/reports-presentations).\n\nIn general, the compensation system implements the legal requirements of the Austria Stock Corporation Act (Sections 78 et seq. AktG) as well as the recommendations of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code (ÖCGK) to promote long-term success and sustainable corporate development. In the remuneration policy adopted by the Annual General Meeting in 2023, sustainability goals were once again incorporated into the incentive schemes. Performancebased remuneration for achieving sustainability goals was integrated into the Long-Term Incentive (LTI). The LTI is granted on a rolling basis, meaning in annual tranches with three-year assessment periods each. This allows sustainability goals to be regularly adjusted to the business environment of the Semperit Group, and different priorities can be set each fiscal year. In 2023, sustainability goals in the areas of environment (energy and waste) and social aspects (incident rate) were integrated into the bonus system of the Semperit Group through both the Long-Term and Short-Term Incentive (STI) programs. The STI creates incentives for both Executive Board members and employees outside the board to achieve sustainability goals.\n\nSince the performance criteria tied to the LTI are based on the average of a three-year assessment period, a board member can also receive performancebased bonus payments through the LTI even after\n\nleaving the board. This occurs when the company's performance remains consistently strong, leading to the achievement of the values necessary for the payout of the LTI. Thus, board members are incentivized to make long-term effective decisions and investments in the company even towards the end of their tenure. Additionally, the impact of cyclical fluctuations in results on the LTI is balanced. The performance evaluation of the board members is conducted annually by the Nominating and Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board, and the compensation dependent on it is decided by the committee.\n\nThe following table illustrates the ratio of the annual total compensation of the highest paid individual at Semperit to the annual median income of all other employees. In contrast to the [\"Fat Cat Day Survey](https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/fatcatday)\"1 conducted by the Vienna Chamber of Labour (factor 75 in 2022), Semperit calculates this factor based on the total annual income including any special payments, such as those paid upon board exits. The compensation of the top earner at Semperit in 2023 was 111 times higher than the median income of all others. Compared to the previous year, the factor shows a significant increase, which was caused by the change in the Executive Board in 2023 and the associated special payments. As a counter-effect, the departure of the largest facility in Malaysia with the lowest median income in the Semperit Group influenced the factor during the reporting period. The Rico Group was not included in the factor calculation.\n\n### **ANNUAL TOTAL REMUNERATION FACTOR**\n\n(COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL REMUNERATION OF THE BEST EARNER TO THE MEDIAN TOTAL REMUNERATION OF ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES)\n\n| 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|------|------|------|\n| 111  | 57   | 182  |\n\nFor a detailed description of the remuneration system and an overview of the remuneration owed and granted to current and former members of the board of directors and the supervisory board, including all benefits in any form, the Remuneration Report provides further information. This can be accessed for more information on the website.\n\n### **O R G A N I S AT I O N A L A N C H O R I N G OF SUSTAINABILITY**\n\nSince sustainability management requires a holistic approach to all business activities, it is the responsibility of the entire Executive Board. In disciplinary terms, sustainability management is assigned to the Chief Operating Officer. The Executive Board is informed by\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nSemperit Group Environment Social Governance Appendix\n\nSo\n\nAppendix\n\nthe Sustainability Council on a regular basis about current issues and developments and, as the highest decision-maker, bears ultimate responsibility for the sustainable orientation of the company. The Sustainability Council, in consultation with the Group Head of ESG, is responsible for defining the focal points of operational sustainability management and driving the implementation of appropriate measures within the company.\n\nCoordinating sustainability agendas is the responsibility of the Group Head of ESG or the ESG expert, who handle all tasks in the context of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance). The Head of ESG reports to the Director Corporate Development, who reports to the CEO. The Executive Board annually (if necessary) approves the list of major topics for the Semperit Group and regularly informs the Supervisory Board about current developments and the progress of sustainability activities. The topic of sustainability is a fixed item on the agenda of every Supervisory Board meeting and the Audit Committee, where current topics and trends are specifically addressed and discussed by the entire Board in order to take essential steps for the sustainable development of the Group. In addition, the ESG Committee was established in 2023 and reflects the importance of the topic within the company. In addition, there are occasional exchanges between Semperit and its sister companies, as well as other companies and industry and sector associations. This allows potential synergies to be identified and utilized. The exchange with core shareholders and all other shareholders of the Semperit Group is also regularly sought in order to align the sustainability agenda of the Semperit Group with their expectations and to involve them. Therefore, there are numerous functions within the Semperit Group that\n\ndeal with specific sustainability topics. At plant and thus at national level, there are further positions that deal with specific issues and the operational implementation of ESG measures relating to topics such as energy, waste or water, compliance, and HR management.\n\nIn 2023, one focus of sustainability management was on the training of employees and members of the management. The first step involved in-house training, e-learning and newly designed onboarding sessions for new employees with a focus on sustainability. In addition to active training, Semperit is committed to continuously communicating the importance of sustainability in the context of its activities. In the reporting period, for example, separate lockscreens were introduced to communicate and display sustainability information to all employees on their laptops or computers for several weeks. In addition, all employees were trained on the topic of ESG using e-learning courses. At the Odry site, managers from HSE, purchasing, logistics, accounting, controlling and site management were trained in the basics of sustainability management, reporting and strategy as part of an in-depth ESG workshop. The combination of these tools raises awareness and knowledge of sustainability. Other important steps included signing the UN Women's Empowerment Principles, setting quantitative targets for diversity and inclusion and establishing a dedicated ESG committee of the Supervisory Board. Other focal points in sustainability management were the expansion of the EU taxonomy, the preparation for the CSRD and the climate scenario analysis. As confirmation of Semperit's performance in the area of ESG, Semperit was awarded \"Platinum\" by EcoVadis and achieved a score of C by CDP.\n\n**33**\n\nImage /page/32/Figure/9 description: The image shows an organizational chart.

All 193 member states of the United Nations committed themselves to work towards implementing Agenda 2030 with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on a national, regional, and international level by 2030. Semperit has analyzed the 17 sustainable development goals in terms of their significance for its business activities. The goals on which Semperit has the greatest influence are presented in the chart on page 51 and assigned to the corresponding topic areas. The versatile business activities and the diverse product portfolio of the Semperit Group also have an impact on other SDGs that are not explicitly listed here. The reason is that the impact in terms of these goals is not seen as primary.\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/3 description: The image is a circular logo with a stylized letter 'S' in the center. The 'S' is dark blue and is surrounded by a dark blue circle. The outer part of the logo consists of a ring of 17 colored segments. The colors of the segments vary and include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The overall design is modern and vibrant.\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/4 description: The image is a green square with the number 3 in white on the left side. To the right of the number 3 is the text \"GESUNDHEIT UND WOHLERGEHEN\" in white. Below the text is a white line graph with a heart at the peak of one of the lines.\n\n### **SDG 3 G O O D H E A LT H A N D W E L L- B E I N G**\n\nSemperit makes a significant contribution to SDG 3 on a wide variety of levels. Health and safety of employees have top priority for the company. Semperit has implemented an ISO 45001-certified management system for occupational health and safety, which protects employees from potential hazards along all processes – from the storage of raw materials and the handling of hazardous substances and chemicals to the operation of machinery. Training courses, information offers, and a raft of other services and measures are designed to prevent accidents of any kind and ensure maximum safety for employees. In addition, by producing examination and surgical gloves, Semperit contributes directly to the supply of medical products and thus to the protection of society.\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/7 description: The image is a square with a red background. In the upper left corner is the number 5 in white. To the right of the number is the word \"GESCHLECHTER- GLEICHHEIT\" in white. Below the number and word is a white symbol that combines the male and female symbols with an equal sign in the middle.\n\n### **SDG 5 G E N D E R E Q U A L I T Y**\n\nDiversity and equal opportunity are important components of successful employee management. For Semperit, diversity and respect are integral and indispensable components of the corporate culture, and are taken into account when filling all positions, among other things. In 2023, Semperit made an important step towards equality by setting quantitative targets for gender distribution. This is reflected in a triple quota for women across the entire organization, in management and senior management, as well as in the signing of the UN Women's Empowerment Principles.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nSoc\n\nThe following table lists the material ESG risks and opportunities identified by Semperit in 2023 that could have a potentially high negative impact on non-financial concerns in accordance with NaDiVeG or – following the ESRS – on Semperit's business activities and profitability. The overview also lists countermeasures and possible opportunities.\n\nFurther information, such as accident and health risks or corruption risks, can be found in the Risk Management section of Semperit's Group Management Report. These risks are part of Group-wide risk management and have been assessed as having a low probability of occurrence due to the countermeasures already in place in the company. Climate-relevant risks as understood by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the climate scenario analysis implemented in 2023 and the requirements for reporting climate-relevant information are discussed in more detail in the chapter on page 60 ff.\n\n### **O V E R V I E W O F E S G R I S K S I N 2023**\n\nESG risks are identified along the entire value chain of the Semperit Group and are assigned to the various corporate areas in accordance with classic risk management.\n\nIn the area of corporate management and strategic orientation, there is a risk that sustainability aspects are not sufficiently taken into account in the corporate and innovation strategy. This includes all ESG-relevant topics, such as the integration of decarbonization efforts, the promotion of a circular economy, and aspects such as diversity or the creation of a sustainable and resilient supply chain.\n\nA lack of commitment and dedication to achieving the Group-wide sustainability goals on the part of managers and employees represents another relevant risk that would affect all NaDiVeG concerns. In addition, the impact of geopolitical unrest, which intensified particularly due to Russia's war against Ukraine and the war in the Middle East, was discussed and also classified as a risk from a sustainability perspective. Measures to reduce the future risk and mitigate the effects have been and are being implemented. These include the reduction of supplier dependencies and the gradual switch to alternative energy supply systems, for example by installing photovoltaic systems at several production sites.\n\nIn terms of products, the greatest risks for negative ecological and economic impacts are related to the extraction, processing and transportation of the raw materials that Semperit needs for production. This can lead to a loss of biodiversity, for example in the forests\n\nfrom which natural rubber is extracted. In the case of petrochemical raw materials, there may be supply bottlenecks and price increases, as well as negative environmental impacts. This goes hand in hand with constantly changing customer requirements, to which Semperit must, and does, react accordingly.\n\nRelevant risks identified and discussed in the context of production include rising costs in connection with regulatory requirements, for example in waste management and climate protection. Competitive disadvantages could also result from the different levels of ambition of countries and regions to combat the climate crisis – for example through the introduction of a CO2 tax.\n\nThe noticeable change in the prevailing sentiment on the financial and sales markets, as well as the associated regulatory requirements, are also increasing the pressure on the Semperit Group. This development must be increasingly taken into account in planning the various activities and next steps.\n\nThe main risks in social affairs are the loss of existing employees, especially in key functions, as well as a lack of attractiveness for new employees. Semperit counters this risk with numerous measures to strengthen the employer brand and increase Semperit's attractiveness as an employer. Another point to be taken into account at all times and along the entire value chain is respect for and protection of human rights. In accordance with its corporate due diligence, Semperit prevents the risk of human rights violations not only at its own locations, but also in connection with activities in the supply chain and Semperit's business relationships with suppliers, customers and other business partners. In order to counteract potential human rights violations in a timely manner, Semperit uses a variety of tools and measures such as the introduction of business partner checks or increased cooperation with suppliers. This is also reflected in the material issue of respect for human rights.\n\nEmployees are required to act with integrity and to comply with the values and guidelines defined in the Group-wide Code of Conduct. In order to prevent the risk of violations of the Code of Conduct, Semperit relies on a trusting corporate culture as well as on appropriate tools and methods to report any misconduct anonymously and to take appropriate remedial action if necessary.\n\nThe following two tables show the main risks based on the risk assessment and the results of the IRO analysis (based on the ESRS) on the one hand, and the opportunities identified on the other:\n\n**45**\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nAppendix\n\n| MATERIAL RISKS IN<br>SUST.

sustainability strategy \"Move Hearts and Minds\" can only succeed if internal and external stakeholders are involved in the best possible way and pull together. The first step towards achieving the set goals is the active involvement of all employees. Only through shared understanding and awareness, and subsequently through joint action, can sustainability be anchored in the Semperit Group and beyond in the long term.\n\nGoals of the \"30 by 2030\" initiative (valid until 31.12.2023):\n\nEvery employee, whether they work in the office or in production, is encouraged to contribute, which can range from using energy and water sparingly in the workplace to increasing efficiency and conserving resources in the production process. The call for these measures was supported by a communication campaign, which was designed in 2021 as part of the adoption of the sustainability strategy and continued until mid-2023. The implementation, anchoring of the resource-conserving culture, recording of measures and tracking are supported by Group-wide continuous improvement processes, systems and databases such as Track and Move.\n\nIn order to achieve the Group-wide annual savings target of 3 % (base year 2019) all production sites are to reduce energy, water, waste and emissions equally.\n\n- 30 % less energy\n- 30 % lower emissions from Scope-1 and Scope-2\n- 30 % less waste\n- 30 % less water\n\nThese reduction targets, which were communicated in 2021, apply until the end of 2023. Semperit reviewed the target values of the \"30 by 2030\" KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) after the sale of the Medical Sector and the acquisition of the Rico Group in 2023 and adapted them accordingly. Further information on the changes that will apply from 2024 can be found on p. 49 ff. This Sustainability Report is the last report on target achievement as part of the \"30 by 2023\" initiative (see \"Target achievement\" p. 52).\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/14 description: The image shows four circular icons with text below each. The first icon depicts a lightbulb with a leaf inside, accompanied by the text \"30% less energy.\" The second icon features a factory with a leaf on top, labeled as \"30% less CO2.\" The third icon displays a trash can with recycling symbols, stating \"30% less waste.\" Lastly, the fourth icon shows a water droplet with circular arrows, indicating \"30% less water.\"\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-59-0\"></span>**CLIMATE-R E L E VA N T INFORMATION**\n\nIn 2023, the European Union published various regulations and action plans as part of the \"Green Deal\" again that will affect Semperit. In order to take this development into account, Semperit is stepping up its own efforts to make corporate decisions in favor of ecological and social impacts. In addition, clear objectives to minimize negative effects as much as possible, an integration of these objectives into Group-wide sales and investment decisions and viable processes to further develop business models in such a way that they are resilient, sustainable and thus fit for the future are needed.\n\nCompanies must not only consistently reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions, but also systematically address and manage the climate crisis and its impact on their business activities. Risks and opportunities can be derived from this – for the business model as a whole, for individual sites and markets or, for example, with regard to individual materials and goods produced. In this context, the physical impacts directly related to climate change, such as the increase in extreme weather events, floods, droughts and water scarcity, must be considered, as well as market and regulatory impacts, such as CO2 taxes and changing customer and market requirements.\n\nIN ADDITION, CLEAR OBJECTIVES TO MINIMIZE NEGATIVE EFFECTS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, AN INTEGRATION OF THESE OBJECTIVES INTO GROUP-WIDE SALES AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND VIABLE PROCESSES TO FURTHER DEVELOP BUSINESS MODELS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ARE RESILIENT, SUSTAINABLE AND THUS FIT FOR THE FUTURE ARE NEEDED.\n\n### **I N F O R M AT I O N A C C O R D I N G T O T H E TA S K F O R C E O N C L I M AT E - R E L AT E D F I N A N C I A L D I S C L O S U R E S ( T C F D )**\n\nClimate-related information in this report is disclosed according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

RESPONSIBILITIES AND GOVERNANCE**\n\nThe topic of sustainability is anchored in the corporate structure at Semperit. Responsibility for all climaterelevant topics was transferred to the functional area of the Semperit Group's CEO in 2023, which underlines the importance and strategic significance both internally and externally. The Sustainability Council meets quarterly (for more information, see p. 32), informs the Executive Board about important developments. The Executive Board bears ultimate responsibility for the company's direction regarding sustainability. In coordination with the Head of ESG, the Council is responsible for defining operational priorities and driving forward corresponding measures within the company. In addition, relevant sustainability issues and potential opportunities and risks in this context are discussed at the Executive Board meetings.\n\nThrough the organizational anchoring of sustainability (see p. 32), Semperit ensures that aspects of sustainability, impacts, risks and opportunities, including climate and environmental protection, are taken into account in every forward-looking decision. The Executive Board subsequently informs the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee and the ESG Committee about current developments in environmental and climate protection, as well as in social affairs and governance, and about Semperit's goals and performance in the context of the ESG. Regular information enables the Supervisory Board to monitor and promote progress in the individual areas.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/8 description: In an indoor shot, a man and a woman are walking and talking to each other. The woman is on the left, and she is holding a white mug in her left hand. She is wearing a black cardigan over a patterned dress, and she has on black high heels. The man is on the right, and he is wearing a light blue suit with a white shirt and white sneakers. He has glasses on and is smiling at the woman. They are walking in an office space with tables and chairs in the background. There are also some red booths in the background.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/9 description: The image shows three people sitting around a table in a meeting. Behind them is a projection screen with an image of the Earth being held in two hands. The person in the middle is standing and gesturing with their right hand. They are wearing a suit and tie and holding a document in their left hand. The person on the left is sitting in a chair and using a laptop. The person on the right is sitting in a chair and looking at the person in the middle.\n\nSustainability management is part of the HSEQ & ESG department and deals with the Group-wide coordination of all sustainability agendas and the related internal and external communication and representation. The Head of ESG acts as an interface between the decision-makers in production, sales, those in other relevant areas such as the innovation, purchasing or risk departments, and Semperit's Executive Board. The respective department heads are responsible within the departments and promote the corresponding topics.\n\nOn the production side, the highest authority is constituted by the Technical Operation Directors of the divisions and businesses, who coordinate the management of relevant production parameters and report directly to the Executive Board. In connection with environmental aspects, they are currently primarily concerned with increasing efficiency in various areas such as energy and recycling management. Together with the Executive Board, they also deal with questions regarding the future orientation of the product portfolio, production, and innovation performance, and develop sustainable solutions. Jointly with the site managers, they are responsible for setting goals in energy efficiency and material use and for ensuring that the necessary measures are implemented to achieve the goals. The Commercial Directors are responsible for the strategic orientation of the businesses in cooperation with the Operations and Finance Directors.\n\nOn the product side, responsibility lies with the businesses as well with the research and innovation department, which promotes new and further developments at the product level. Semperit maintains close cooperation with customers, suppliers, and research institutions to develop and offer needs-based and innovative products and solutions.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **2. STRATEGY**\n\nThe global economic environment in which Semperit operates is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. In its sustainability management, but also in its corporate strategy and financial planning, Semperit pursues a risk-avoiding, precautionary approach without, however, neglecting the opportunities and potential arising as a result. The risk and opportunity management therefore also forms the basis of Semperit's strategic orientation and financial planning to combat climate change. Based on the climate scenario analysis carried out in 2023, the continuous collection of expertise regarding climatic developments, findings and forecasts as well as monitoring the effects of and on Semperit, the following key risks and opportunities have emerged for the Group (information on the opportunities can be found in the ESG Risk Management chapter on p. 43 ff):\n\n- The risk that the use of fossil raw materials will become increasingly limited or expensive. Consequently, access to alternative raw materials from renewable raw materials must be secured in a timely manner.\n- The risk that energy from fossil sources will no longer be available, or only to a very limited extent. Consequently, the energy supply will have to be converted to renewable energy and the production facilities and the associated processes will have to be adapted accordingly.\n- The risk of production losses at various sites because they are in areas affected by flooding (due to increasing heavy rainfall or gradual rise in sea level) or extreme drought, or also due to population migration because of excessively high temperatures, droughts, etc. This risk varies from location to location in the medium and long term and only affects individual locations of the Semperit Group. It develops with varying degrees of severity in the specified IPCC scenarios. Structural measures to reduce the risk are already being implemented at one of the sites, while the remaining mitigation measures are being defined and implemented as part of the Group-wide risk assessment with the sites.\n\nIn order to counteract the risks in a timely manner, a resilient and future-oriented strategy is needed in addition to measures and goals that can be implemented and verified in the medium term. In this context, the process for developing the Group-wide Semperit Sustainability Strategy 2030 was launched in 2020 and successfully completed in 2021. The\n\nSustainability Strategy 2030 and, in particular, the \"30 by 2030\" initiative (valid until the end of 2023) it encompasses, represent further important steps for environment and climate protection in the Semperit Group and form the basis for further activities.\n\nThe fields of action of the sustainability strategy are also considered in the Group and innovation strategy and in aligning the individual divisions. This includes, for example, expanding the sustainable product range, optimizing and continuously improving production processes to minimize climate-relevant risks, and considering sustainability aspects in evaluating potential future markets. In 2023, Semperit launched a Group-wide strategy process that will set the framework for a future-oriented transformation of the Group. Further information on the strategy process can be found on pages 9 and 10 as well as on page 49.\n\n### **Current and future actions**\n\n### **a. energy and emissions**\n\nIncreasing energy efficiency, reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions, continuous expansion of the survey of Scope 3 emissions, and expanding the share of energy demand that comes from renewable energy sources\n\n### **b. Aspects of the recycling economy**\n\nSelecting recyclable raw materials, efficiency in using materials, increased use of secondary raw materials, in-process recycling, continuous analyses of potential and initial projects in the field of post-industrial and post-consumer recycling, optimizing waste management, efficient handling and low consumption of water\n\n### **c. Expansion of the sustainable product range**\n\nR&D projects on recyclable products (especially in the area of Profiles – further information on p. 95) and cooperation with research institutions, universities and networks (e.g. TfS – further information on p. 37)\n\n### **d. Environmentally sustainable investments that minimize climate risks**\n\nIntegration of environmentally sustainable criteria based on the EU taxonomy and consideration of climate-related risks from the climate scenario analysis in strategy and investment decisions as well as strategic growth investments based on these criteria, such as the expansion of the hose production at the Odry site, Czech Republic\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/22 description: The image shows a circular logo with a dark blue outline. Inside the circle, there are several light blue, arrow-shaped objects pointing upwards.

CLIMATE-RELEVANT RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities can affect Semperit's business units in the medium and long term. In 2019, Semperit therefore integrated the ESG risk management required by the Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (NaDiVeG) and in the future the Sustainability Reporting Act (NaBeG) into its existing Group-wide risk management. Since then, during the annual ESG risk assessment (see page 43 ff.), relevant risks and opportunities in the areas of environment, social affairs and governance (ESG) have been identified, discussed and evaluated. In 2023, the structure of this assessment was adapted, and its content expanded in preparation for the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The integration of the newly identified ESG risks and opportunities into company-wide risk management and strategic planning began in 2023 and will continue in 2024. The last few years have shown that climaterelated risks and opportunities are increasing in importance and tend to affect all areas of the company. The decisive factor for climate-relevant risks is that emerging issues and the associated opportunities are already known but will only have an impact in the medium and long term from a business perspective and according to current knowledge.\n\n### **Physical risks**\n\nThe term physical risks refers to the direct effects of climate change. This includes long-term and short-term risks, as they can already be noticeable depending on the region. A distinction is made between:\n\n- Direct physical risks: acute events (storms and heavy rainfall) and chronic changes (rising sea levels). The consequences to the economy range from storm damage to buildings to temporary interruptions to global supply chains.\n- Indirect physical risks: Risks arising from the indirect or long-term effects of climate change, for example, production losses due to a shortage of water supply because of prolonged droughts. None of the Semperit sites are currently exposed to a physical climate risk in the short term. In the medium and long term, water-related risks such as flooding and water scarcity have been identified at the Roha, Odry and Bełchatów sites.\n\n### **Transition risks**\n\nThe physical risks are offset by climate-relevant transition risks, which could have a greater impact on the activities of the Semperit Group in the short and medium term. Transition risks arise primarily due to regulatory and political requirements, such as the introduction of a CO2 tax or the expansion and tightening of emissions trading, as well as because of market-specific and socially motivated developments in decarbonization and the recycling economy, which can lead to rising company costs. These risks can affect the business model of entire sectors or the use of certain technologies. Changes in customer behavior also belong to this risk class.\n\nIn order to meet these new requirements, extensive investments are necessary, especially in the areas of innovation, production and logistics.\n\nIf the corporate strategy takes insufficient account of sustainability aspects, it will also weaken Semperit's attractiveness on the – increasingly sustainabilityoriented – financial markets. Both aspects – the fulfillment of regulatory requirements and the necessary investments on the one hand and the consideration of sustainability aspects in the corporate strategy to strengthen attractiveness on the other – have a medium or long-term effect and may lead to a weakening of brand positioning as well as market share loss. Conversely, appropriate countermeasures can lead to an image gain and thus to a competitive advantage and increased employee loyalty. The following table lists the transition risks identified during the ESG risk assessment.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nSemperit Group Environment Social Governance

METRICS AND TARGETS**\n\nClear and smart goals and measures are intended to minimize climate-related risks and serve to exploit potential opportunities in good time – such as the goals for adaptation (climate change adaptation) to already prevailing climatic changes or the goal of avoiding climate consequences in the longer term by reducing or neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions (Climate Change Mitigation).\n\n### **Semperit Group focus points**\n\n**a. Increase efficiency and reduce resources and energy consumption as well as waste by 30 % by 2030 through process optimization (base year 2019, goal valid until the end of 2023)**\n\nThe \"30 by 2030\" initiative of the Sustainability Strategy 2030 bundles and accelerates all previous activities relating to efficiency and thus makes a significant contribution to climate protection. The focus is on continuously improving energy efficiency in production as well as in building management and reducing the volume of scrap and waste and the use of water. In addition, further measures to reduce CO2 emissions are to be developed and implemented, such as installing photovoltaic systems.\n\nIn order to successfully advance the Group-wide targets, but also make them tangible, objectives were defined at the site level (3 % reduction per site per year based on 2019) and all participants were involved in the best possible way. Furthermore, since 2021, corresponding processes and tools have been implemented for tracking the status quo of achieved goals. In this context, all projects as well as specific information for continuously improving production factors must be entered into the database provided for this purpose to allow for Group-wide control. This is done using regular system status reports and in the course of internal coordination meetings. A monthly review is performed at the Group level to determine\n\nwhether the key figures, including greenhouse gas emissions, are within the planning corridor. If this is not the case, further measures must be agreed on. More information about target achievements in the 2023 reporting year can be found in the corresponding chapters and in the overview on page 52.\n\n### **b. Further activities to protect the environment and climate**\n\nIn addition to optimizing production processes, further steps are being taken to initiate the path for long-term change. In addition to the ongoing balancing of greenhouse gas emissions the focus is on the successive expansion of the survey of Scope 3 emissions. In 2023, the survey was expanded to include those Scope 3 emissions associated with the goods and services purchased by Semperit. Semperit's own Product Carbon Footprint calculation model was increasingly used to deepen CO2 transparency in the Semperit portfolio on a product-specific basis. In addition, Semperit is proactively working on innovative possibilities in the area of materials. For example, various approaches are being tested in circular economy, such as recyclability or the use of secondary raw materials. The technical and economic possibilities in this context, as well as the associated environmental impact, will be examined in a timely manner and continuously evaluated in the coming years. Further information on Semperit rubber recycling can be found in the chapter on circular economy starting on page 94 ff.\n\nIn order to support market trends with the development of sustainable products, Semperit works closely with customers and supports scientific research – with a focus on innovative materials, technologies and products. The research activities are intended to secure and further strengthen the market position of the Semperit Group in the long term and at the same time make it more attractive for sustainable investments, for example by gradually improving the ESG rating results.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Figure/5 description: The image shows the text \"THE SIX ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES OF THE EU TAXONOMY\" at the top.

A central component of the plan is to make Europe a climate-neutral continent by 2050, i.e., to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero. Financial flows in the private sector have to be redirected to sustainable activities to finance the transformation. The EU taxonomy, a uniform and transparent classification system of environmentally sustainable business activities, was developed for this purpose. According to the provisions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, companies that fell within the scope of the regulation must disclose their proportion of revenues for the 2021 financial year, the capital expenditures (capex), and the operational expenditures (opex) that are related to \"environmentally sustainable\" activities and are therefore taxonomy-eligible. From the 2023 financial year, they must publish the share of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in revenue, capex and opex in line with all six environmental objectives. The share of taxonomy-aligned revenue in total revenue is an indicator of the sustainability of a company's products and services. Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned capital expenditures should indicate the extent to which a company is preparing for a decarbonized economy in 2050.\n\nThe following disclosure of information on the EU taxonomy is based on the Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 as well as the associated published FAQ. Accordingly, the report contains information on the proportion of Semperit's business activities covered by the EU taxonomy (taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned) as well as the required qualitative information. All six environmental objectives of the EU taxonomy were used to determine the key figures (revenue, capex, and opex) relating to business activities. The Semperit Group activities that correspond to the taxonomy can primarily be assigned to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\" and \"transition to a circular economy\".\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the EU taxonomy, business activities are considered \"environmentally sustainable\" if they:\n\n- 1. Substantially contribute to at least one of the six climate objectives, which can be demonstrated through compliance with certain technical screening criteria;\n- 2. Do not have a considerable negative impact on attaining the five other EU environmental objectives (do no significant harm; DNSH), which is also specified in the subordinate delegated acts; and\n- 3. Comply with the Minimum Social Safeguards for occupational safety and human rights.\n\n### **AD 1.**\n\n### **SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO (AT LEAST) ONE EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVE**\n\nThe EU taxonomy-relevant business activities of the Semperit Group relating to revenue reserves and significant capital and operating expenditures make a contribution to the environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" as well as \"transition to a circular economy\" and can be divided into the following five major topics:\n\n### CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\n **Waste** (Activity 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of non-hazardous waste)\n\n### ENERGY\n\n- **Products** (Activity 3.5 Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings)\n- **Photovoltaic systems** (Activities 4.1. Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology; 7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies on-site)\n\n### WATER\n\n **Optimization of water use and treatment systems**  (Activity 5.2. Renewal of water collection, treatment and supply systems)\n\n### VEHICLES\n\n **Transport – acquisition, financing, renting, leasing and operating e-vehicles** (Activity 6.5. Purchase, financing, renting, leasing and operation of vehicles)\n\n### BUILDINGS\n\n **Building management** (Activities 7.2. Renovation of existing buildings; 7.3. Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment; 7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings and parking spaces attached to buildings; 7.5. Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings; 7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies on-site; 7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings)\n\n### **SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO AT LEAST ONE ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVE**\n\n**NO SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE OTHER EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES**\n\n**+**\n\n**+**\n\n**MINIMUM SAFE-GUARDS FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **AD 2.**\n\n**SEMPERIT | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023**\n\n### **NO SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE OTHER EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES (DNSH)**\n\nThe requirements of the delegated acts to fulfill the \"Do No Significant Harm\" principle relate primarily to legal and regulatory provisions as well as minimum technical requirements. Mainly in order to fulfill the DNSH criteria with regard to the environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaptation\", Semperit carried out a climate scenario analysis for 16 of its own sites and 4 sites of strategic suppliers in 2023. In particular for the new construction of the production hall DH5 in Odry, Czech Republic, Semperit aims to comply with the criteria in order to be able to report the building and the associated expenses as taxonomyaligned in the future. The DNSH criteria for the environmental goals \"Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\" and \"Prevention and reduction of air, water and soil pollution\" are essentially based on compliance with regional legal framework conditions. A review process is underway, accompanied by the collection of relevant documentation. For the fulfillment of the requirements of the DNSH criteria for \"Protection and restoration of biodiversity and health of ecosystems\" and \"Transition to the circular economy, including waste prevention and recycling\", the necessary measures, such as the implementation of environmental impact assessments for all relevant sites, are to be examined.\n\n### **AD 3. MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\nAccording to the taxonomy regulation criteria, minimum social requirements must also be met for activities to be classified as \"ecologically sustainable\". Compliance with social standards, in the areas of labor and human rights or health and safety, is ensured at Group level for all companies and sites with the help of various tools, processes, policies and activities as well as a diverse range of services and training. Information on the Group-wide guidelines, the human rights due diligence processes, as well as the measures taken, and achievements can be found in the respective chapters on pages 123 to 127. The corresponding key figures show Semperit's continuous improvement in these areas. In order to ensure that the social minimum standards are met throughout the Group, a detailed analysis of the following frameworks to which Semperit is committed was carried out in 2023:\n\n- OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises\n- UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n- ILO core labor standards and ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\n- International Bill of Human Rights\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/14 description: A man in a blue shirt is looking up at a large, circular metal structure with many small holes. The structure appears to be part of a machine or industrial equipment. The man is standing inside the structure, with his hand resting on the metal surface. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a factory or industrial setting.\n\nACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA OF THE TAXONOMY REGULATION, MINIMUM SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS MUST ALSO BE MET FOR ACTIVITIES TO BE CATEGORIZED AS TAXONOMY-ALIGNED.\n\n**68**\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **A D D I T I O N A L I N F O R M AT I O N**\n\nOn the one hand, the Taxonomy Regulation creates transparency for all stakeholders, and, on the other hand, companies can use the guidelines to align future \"sustainable\" decisions and activities accordingly. The following section lists the taxonomy-relevant products and activities of the Semperit Group that contribute to climate protection and circular economy in accordance with the regulation.\n\n### **TAXONOMY-ELIGIBLE AND TAXONOMY-ALIGNED**\n\nThe EU classification system distinguishes between taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned business activities. Taxonomy eligibility is given if a business activity of a company can be allocated to the economic activities listed in the delegated acts. Taxonomy alignment, on the other hand, can only be shown if all technical screening criteria, DNSH criteria as well as the minimum protection criteria for occupational safety and human rights (Minimum Social Safeguards) are clearly met.\n\n### **TAXONOMY-ELIGIBLE REVENUE**\n\nOf the taxonomy-eligible revenue, only the thermally insulating door, window and facade profiles from the \"Profiles\" product group of the \"Semperit Industrial Applications\" division and activities related to their production can be recognized as taxonomy-eligible for the time being. Due to its heat-insulating and sealing properties, the profiles product group increases the energy efficiency of buildings and thus makes a positive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this area. In 2023, revenue from Profiles was reported as activity 3.5 \"Manufacture of energy-efficient building equipment\" instead of activity 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies\", as in the previous year. Further information can be found on pages 70 and 72.\n\nAn economic activity in this category is an eligible activity in the sense of Article 10(1)(i) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 if it meets the technical assessment criteria determined in this section. Other product groups from the Semperit portfolio are currently not mentioned in the classification system. However, this may change in subsequent years because of possible expansion of the categories and activities, for example by adding further sectors in the \"Manufacturing\" area. With regard to Semperit's revenue-relevant activities – which are currently limited exclusively to door, window and façade profiles – a distinction can be made between the following products from the perspective of ecological sustainability:\n\n• Products that have a positive ecological added value due to their properties or production method (see Product innovations p. 90 and 91).\n\n• Products that are considered sustainable according to the requirements of the EU taxonomy.\n\nIt is important that these products must fulfill the so-called technical screening criteria. In the case of window products, these criteria relate to the heat flow (U-value) and, in the case of insulation products, to thermal conductivity (lambda value). As the evidence and the underlying calculations are only partially available, the criteria cannot yet be fully met. Accordingly, Semperit will fully assess the criteria in the coming years and work on their optimization.\n\nDUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE BUILDINGS SECTOR AND THE DEFINITION IN THE TAXONOMY REGULATION, THE PROFI-LE PRODUCTS CAN BE ASSIGNED TO ACTIVITY 3.5 \"MANUFACTURE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY EQUIPMENT FOR BUILDINGS\"\n\n### **TAXONOMY-ELIGIBLE CAPEX/OPEX**\n\nActivities and thus the associated capital and operating expenditures (capex/opex), which can currently be designated as taxonomy-eligible, relate primarily to the following broad topics:\n\n### TRANSITION TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\n **Circular economy** (Activity 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of non-hazardous waste)\n\n### CONTRIBUTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL GOAL \"CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION\"\n\n- **Energy** (Activities 4.1. Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology; 7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies on-site)\n- **Optimization of water use and treatment systems**  (Activity 5.2. Renewal of water collection, treatment and supply systems)\n- **Transport** (Activity 6.5. Purchase, financing, renting, leasing and operation of vehicles)\n- **Building management** (Activities 7.2. Renovation of existing buildings; 7.3. Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment; 7.4 Installation,\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nSemperit Group Environment Social Governance Appendix\n\nSocial\n\nmaintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings and parking spaces attached to buildings; 7.5. Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings; 7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies on-site; 7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings)\n\nBased on the activities listed by the EU, the activities relevant for Semperit in 2023 were checked for completeness and activity 2.7 was added. Subsequently, the associated expenses (capex/opex) that can be reported as taxonomy-eligible in the reporting year were collected.\n\n### **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (CAPEX/OPEX)**\n\nWhen interpreting the disclosed information and data related to capital and operating expenditures, it should be considered that activities that are not listed in the EU taxonomy and are thus not reported as \"environmentally sustainable\" within the meaning of the classification are not by definition \"unsustainable\" or \"not fit for the future\". Numerous corporate activities and the associated expenditures that serve to improve the environmental and social performance or also the achievement of the company's sustainability goals are currently not considered by the EU taxonomy and thus do not appear in the key figures. This applies, for example, to investments in process and production optimization, which, according to EU taxonomy, may only be included if they serve the production of a taxonomy-eligible product, but not if they are assigned to the production of another product.\n\nIt will be necessary to fulfill the technical screening criteria and the DNSH criteria in the area of taxonomyeligible activities and the corresponding expenses (capex/opex) to be taxonomy-aligned. The associated requirements are narrowly defined, depending on the topic, and pose a number of challenges, which is why it has not yet been possible to fully implement and demonstrate compliance. For example, certain threshold values for primary energy requirements or the water consumption of sanitary equipment must be met for expenditure in the building sector, particularly for new buildings. In addition, there are requirements to carry out a climate scenario and vulnerability analysis and to derive and evaluate mitigation measures. This analysis was already carried out for 16 Semperit locations and 4 locations of strategic suppliers as a first major step in 2023. Semperit aims to comply with the criteria and thus future taxonomy eligibility for the new construction of the production hall DH5 in Odry, Czech Republic, in order to be able to report the associated expenses as taxonomy-aligned.\n\n### **E X P L A N AT I O N S O N T H E P R O C E D U R E F O R C O L L E C T I N G K E Y F I G U R E S**\n\nSince 2023, the EU taxonomy has included information on economic sectors and activities that can make a significant contribution to all six environmental objectives. Previously, only those applying to the environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaptation\" were defined. In 2023, Semperit therefore analyzed and optimized the existing processes and systems to meet the extended requirements together with external experts.\n\nIn addition, the descriptions of the taxonomy activities were re-evaluated in 2023 and, based on this, the economic activities relevant to Semperit were added or adapted. The following changes were made to the activities in the reporting:\n\n- 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of nonhazardous waste was added.\n- 3.5 Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings was added and replaces activity 3.6 from 2023.\n- Activity 7.1 is no longer relevant and is no longer reported, as investments in new buildings can be recognized under 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings.\n\nIn 2023, the key figures were again collected by the responsible experts at the Semperit Group sites and consolidated and reviewed centrally by Group Accounting and Group ESG. When collecting the data, care was taken to avoid double counting by having the key figures collected by responsible experts at the Semperit Group sites and consolidated centrally by Group Accounting and reviewed together with Group ESG. The option of applying a materiality threshold for opex expenditure was not utilized.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **O V E R V I E W O F T H E M O S T I M P O R TA N T S T E P S**\n\n### **PROJECT MANAGEMENT**\n\n- **Project lead:** Group ESG Management\n- **External project support:** PWC Austria\n- **Participating areas:** Group Controlling, Group Accounting, Group Maintenance & Engineering, Operations, Group HSEQ\n- **Tasks:** project organization, internal and external communication\n\n### **PROCEDURE FOR COLLECTING KEY FIGURES**\n\n- Re-evaluation of the economic activities relevant to Semperit according to the NACE code (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community)\n- Training of internal experts in the respective local capex/opex project and finance departments at the Semperit Group sites\n- Content-related assessment of the taxonomy eligibility of the respective capex- and opexrelevant projects based on individual interviews with the respective experts (e.g., from the areas of production, infrastructure, energy, and environmental protection) to prepare key figures\n- Appreciation of significant contribution to the environmental objective and of the \"Do No Significant Harm\" requirement in relation to the other environmental objectives (based on compliance with legal requirements)\n- Reviewing compliance with minimum social standards at Group level\n- Analyzing the various reporting processes that contribute to collecting the relevant data\n- Test and trial phase in the third quarter of 2023\n- Collecting revenue, capex and opex for the \"environmentally sustainable\" activities in 2023 by the persons responsible for finance\n\nNo text was found in this image.\n\nThe following table shows an excerpt of key figures, full information required to comply with the EU Taxonomy Regulation is placed in the Appendix of this report, chapter \"EU Taxonomy Reporting Template\" on page 150.

Excluded from this are merchandise and services, which have a comparatively low share of revenue. Thus, the percentage of \"eligible\" revenue makes about 14% for the 2023 financial year (compared to 18% in the previous year). The specified percentage and information result from the denominator, which corresponds to the revenue of the Semperit Group and the Rico Group in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of EUR 721.1 million. In contrast, the numerator – revenue of EUR 100.9 million for the Profiles division (see section \"Performance of Sectors and Divisions\" in the Consolidated Financial Statement of the Group) – is limited to the products that make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions based on the EU taxonomy information. The decrease in revenue reported as \"eligible\" is primarily due to the decline in revenue in the Profiles division.\n\nDue to its thermal insulation and sealing properties, the profiles product group increases the energy efficiency of buildings and thus makes a positive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this area. For this reason, based on the applicable screening criteria, revenue of Profiles was assigned to category 3.5 \"Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings\" instead of activity 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies\", as in 2022. In order to meet the requirements of the EU taxonomy and to be able to report taxonomy-aligned revenue of Profiles in the future, Semperit would have to be able to prove compliance with the DNSH criteria at the locations, which currently involves considerable administrative effort. There is currently no intention to achieve taxonomy-aligned revenue due to a lack of economic advantage.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nGovernance\n\nAppendix\n\n### **CAPEX DETAILED INFORMATION 20231**\n\n| ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES                                                      | CODE                            | CAPEX<br>EUR million |       | CAPEX<br>% |         | ENABLING<br>ACTIVITY | TRANSITIONAL<br>ACTIVITY |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------|------------|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                          |                                 | 2023                 | 2022  | 2023       | 2022    |                      |                          |\n| A.

IFRS 16) and intangible assets totals EUR 260.8 million (compared to EUR 41 million in the previous year, see additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets according to Segment reporting in the consolidated financial statement plus EUR 205.1 million additions to IFRS 16 and additions from acquisitions of Rico excluding goodwill for 2023). This is compared to the numerator of EUR 26.3 million, which is made up of the taxonomy-eligible activities and the related capital expenditures in the various subject areas as described in the table (capex details). The shares in the key figures were calculated including the Rico Group, which was acquired in July. The figures are therefore only comparable with 2022 to a limited extent.\n\nIn connection with the sales-related capex activities the focus is on improving the production processes for manufacturing the taxonomy-eligible products (Profiles). This focus essentially refers to the use and exchange of machinery as well as the optimization of existing processes.\n\nIn this context, a significant share in the 2023 reporting period resulted from the environmentally sustainable planning and construction of the above-average energy-efficient production hall DH5 at the Odry site (Hoses, SIA division). Investments in connection with this building construction are largely in line with the technical criteria of activity 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings. Under this category, buildings constructed after December 31, 2020, must meet the technical screening criteria of category 7.1 (Construction of new buildings), which stipulate a significantly reduced primary energy demand. Thanks to the energy-efficient construction method, a primary energy demand value below the specified threshold value and energy efficiency class B can be achieved for the DH5 production hall, thereby fulfilling the technical screening criteria. In addition, the DNSH criteria (do no significant harm) are also met with the implementation of a climate risk analysis, including the identification of medium and long-term water-related risks such as flooding and water scarcity at the Odry site. Risk-mitigating measures include the installation of recirculating water systems that secure the water supply at the site and protect against flooding. In\n\n**73**\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nAppendix\n\norder to fully comply with the taxonomy, the minimum safeguards must also be met. Semperit complies with Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the OECD Guidelines, the UN Guiding Principles, the ILO Fundamental Principles and the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nFurther capex activities are collected in relation to various ancillary activities in the EU taxonomy areas of energy, transport and building management. These investments in this context were primarily in the area of infrastructure installation to improve building management and optimize energy use. Semperit also invests in the expansion of energy measurement systems to be able to specifically measure consumption and generate further measures based on these results. The focus in transport is on purchasing or leasing vehicles and small vehicles relating to e-mobility or compliance with maximum emission limits. A new car policy has been in effect since 2021, promoting the switch to lower-emission vehicles and the conscious decision to opt for e-mobility.\n\nImage /page/73/Picture/8 description: The image shows a large, peach-colored building with blue-framed windows under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The building has two stories, with the lower story having larger, floor-to-ceiling windows. A gray concrete base runs along the bottom of the building.

This is compared to the numerator, made up of the taxonomy-eligible activities and the corresponding operating expenses in the various subject areas as described in the table (opex details). In connection with sales-related opex activities, the focus is on improving the production processes for manufacturing taxonomy-eligible products. This refers to the maintenance of production machinery as well as other process improvement work. Another important factor of expenditures from the EU taxonomy's perspective in 2023 was investments in the improvement and maintenance of electric vehicles and charging stations. Other opex-relevant expenditures regarding ancillary activities are made in connection with building renovations and maintenance projects, such as the renewal and conversion of lighting systems to LED or work during building insulation. The key figures on expenditures and investments are directly related to the overall objectives of the Semperit Group, which are included in the Sustainability Strategy 2030 and in particular in the \"30 by 2030\" initiative and are planned for the future.\n\n### **OUTLOOK**\n\nIn order to guarantee the best possible data and reporting quality, further steps will be taken towards automation, standardization and document storage optimization. In addition, it can be assumed that even in the following years, the key figures for taxonomyeligible activities and taxonomy-aligned activities will change due to various parameters. On the one hand, this effect results from dynamic regulatory development and the expansion of the taxonomy and, on the other hand, from the potential expansion of Semperit's business activities and product portfolio through organic and inorganic growth, which could make new activities relevant in the future. Further taxonomy-compliant investments (capex and opex) could arise in particular for the new production hall to be built in Odry, also in connection with the expansion of PV systems at this site. With regard to future projects in circular economy, further taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned activities could also arise under activity 2.7 Sorting and material recovery of nonhazardous waste, which is why the category has already been included in the reporting process, although nothing was reported under this category in 2023. It can be assumed that lower ratios will continue to result for taxonomy-aligned activities than for taxonomy-eligible activities, as the activities must fulfill all the specified criteria (technical screening criteria, DNSH, Minimum Social Safeguards) to be considered taxonomy-aligned. However, the percentage of taxonomy-eligible activities could increase in the future.\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/9 description: The image shows a large, modern industrial building with a flat roof.

Internally, Semperit focuses on raising awareness and training its employees. The internal Energy Excellence Team, which specializes in climate protection, was expanded in 2023 in order to transparently coordinate and manage the increasing number of ongoing sustainability projects.\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/9 description: A cartoon image shows a person standing in front of a presentation screen.

The person is gesturing towards the screen with their right hand.\n\nIN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY DRIVE FORWARD DEVELOPMENTS AND TO ACHIEVE A RETHINKING PROCESS IN THE LONGER TERM, SEMPERIT IS INCREASINGLY FOCUSING ON EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND PARTICIPATION.\n\n### **E N E R G Y**\n\n### **ENERGY EXCELLENCE**\n\nSemperit has implemented measures and activities throughout the Group to increase the efficiency of production processes and reduce energy consumption. The Energy Excellence Team was expanded in 2023 in order to effectively oversee, coordinate and manage the growing project portfolio in the areas of energy efficiency, energy conversion and the expansion of renewable energy supply from own production. The expert appointed for this purpose brings together project information from the entire Semperit Group (\"Knowledge Hub\"). The One List Project aims to consolidate all sustainability projects from various sources such as Track, Move and internal departmental site lists in a single tool in order to provide a comprehensive overview and continuously monitor the energy and CO2 savings potential in a system-controlled manner, prioritize projects and support the budgeting process (\"Project Tracking & Energy Savings Analytics\").\n\nThe \"Think.Act.Save\" initiative launched in 2022 to raise employee awareness of cost-efficient energy-saving measures was continued in 2023 in close cooperation between the Energy Excellence and Operational Excellence teams.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nSoc\n\nAppendix\n\n**SEMPERIT | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023**\n\nAs part of the training and expertise focus, 13 energy managers from the production sites were trained in 18 different topics in 2022. In addition to the training sessions, there were numerous virtual meetings to share successfully implemented improvements with the other sites for the purpose of \"best practice sharing\", and to learn from each other. Other examples include the introduction to useful energy management tools, such as seminars on energy management with software from external service providers. Within the framework of the Energy Excellence program, regular discussions were held with the energy managers at the sites and the energy experts responsible for research and development to ensure smooth communication and a mutual flow of information on the respective activities. The Energy Excellence program supports the sites in implementing the \"30 by 2030\" goals through targeted advice to the sites, developing technical projects, transferring knowledge in a structured way and monitoring consumption.\n\nAs part of the \"30 by 2030\" initiative, Semperit has set itself the goal of reducing energy consumption in relation to production volume by 30 % by 2030. To achieve this goal, the production sites are required to increase their energy efficiency by 3 % annually based on the 2019 values. The locations are focusing on immediate low-cost measures. In this context, a project structure is developed involving the Energy Excellence Team as moderators. This includes creating a project overview, tracking project progress, organizing meetings and providing advice and support during project implementation. (\"internal consultancy\"). Employees' suggestions for improvement and ideas for possible measures to increase energy efficiency are collected, analyzed and implemented where possible (\"analytics & reporting\").\n\n### **-3 % LESS ENERGY INTENSIT Y P.

Optimizations can take place at various levels such as at individual machines, entire processes, or at the industrial building. The following focal points have been defined for this:\n\n- Efficiency enhancement through maintenance and repair measures\n- Reduction of energy losses (leakages)\n- Stabilization of existing production processes\n- Improvement of machine efficiencies\n- Optimization of production planning with few downtimes\n\n### **OVERVIEW ENERGY MIX AT THE SEMPERIT GROUP**\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/13 description: The image is a donut chart showing the distribution of energy sources. Gas & heating accounts for 76.3%, electricity accounts for 21.5%, oil accounts for 1.9%, and fuel accounts for 0.3%.\n\nRico Group energy mix (not included in the chart above): AT 100 % renewable energy; USA gas 70 %, nuclear 20 %, solar: 6 %, coal & oil 0.5 %, other: 3.5 % (data for Swiss site not available)\n\nSome of the activities related to these focal points, such as increasing efficiency in building management through appropriate maintenance and renovation measures, are considered as part of the EU taxonomy (see page 66 ff.).\n\nTo correctly interpret the development of the Semperit Group's total consumption, a wide variety of aspects must be considered. In addition to production and the production of the rubber compounds as the starting point, other factors such as test runs in material and product innovation, procedure and process adjustments, starting up the machines after shutdowns, as well as lighting and heating or cooling of the buildings also have an influence on total energy consumption. Possible location-specific factors or events along the value chain must also be considered. For example, effects such as pre-production or product range changes at individual sites may also have an impact on the Group-wide energy consumption.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/17 description: A medium shot depicts a man in a blue hard hat, dark blue t-shirt, and blue pants, standing with his arms crossed in front of a massive roll of black material. He also wears white gloves. The roll is so large that it dwarfs the man, and it is supported by a blue metal frame. The center of the roll has a square opening with a reddish-brown interior. The background suggests an industrial setting, possibly a warehouse or factory, with a window letting in natural light on the right side of the frame. The floor appears to be concrete, and there are some metal structures visible in the background, adding to the industrial atmosphere.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nSocial\n\n**SEMPERIT | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023**\n\nViewed in terms of processes, glove production consumes the most energy at the Sempermed plant in Kamunting, which left the Group at the end of August 2023 as part of the sale of the Medical Sector to HARPS. In total, four plants of the Semperit Group were responsible for over 91 % of energy consumption. These are the plants in Kamunting, Wimpassing, Odry and Bełchatów. This distribution also provides the background for the sharp decline in energy reduction potential and the associated target adjustment from 30 % by 2030 to 5 % by 2030 from 2024 (base year 2023 instead of 2019).\n\nOn the one hand, the significantly smaller savings potential is due to the fact that the most energyintensive division with comparatively high savings potential was sold and there is only low savings potential in the remaining divisions. On the other hand, there are only seven years with savings potential between the new base year of 2023 and 2030.\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/8 description: The image shows a production line of rubber gloves.

By signing, they confirm that they have understood and acknowledge the Code and that they will duly report all possible incidents. In addition, the People Policy was expanded to include a focus on diversity and inclusion in 2023 (for more information, see p. 136).\n\nSince 2019, the Semperit Group has published an annual \"Modern Slavery Act Statement\". In accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act of October 29, 2015, Semperit sets out the principles and preventive measures which the Group applies to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its sphere of influence – including supply chains. The Statement 2023 can be found on the [Semperit website](https://www.semperitgroup.com/fileadmin/user_upload/MediaLibrary/SemperitGroup/Company/Sustainability/Slavery-Act/ModernSlaveryStatementAct-FY-2022.pdf)2.\n\nThe principles and guidelines of the Semperit Group apply not only to employees but also to suppliers and other business partners. They are a precondition for establishing and continuing business relationships. All business activities must be conducted in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), as well as in strict compliance with local laws. Detailed information, for example on the ILO conventions applied, is set out in the Code of Conduct, which can be accessed on the website. 1<https://www.semperitgroup.com/company/sustainability/sustainability-policies/>\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nAppendix\n\nIn order to implement the provisions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Semperit carried out a detailed analysis in 2023 with the support of external experts to determine whether Semperit fulfills the minimum social protection criteria (Minimum Safeguards) throughout the Group. These are intended to help ensure that future economic activity is not only ecologically sustainable, but also compliant with human rights and fair. The audit was based on Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and included Semperit's compliance with the OECD Guidelines, the UN Guiding Principles, the Fundamental Principles of the International Labour Organization and the International Bill of Human Rights. The result proves that Semperit complies with the high social standards and in particular human rights and thus fulfills the minimum safeguard.\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/7 description: Three people are gathered around a table in what appears to be an office setting.

In line with this recommendation, the Semperit Group is taking measures to prevent violations and is developing appropriate activities to raise awareness and transfer knowledge. The specific measures taken by Semperit in connection with the individual steps are listed below.\n\n### 1. **EMBEDDING AND PUBLIC COMMITMENT**\n\nDefinition and anchoring of the relevant principles in the corporate policy (Code of Conduct, policies, Modern Slavery Act Statement, confirmation of compliance with the United Nations Global Compact Principles and the UN Women Empowerment Principles, Diversity Charta, etc.) and the management systems\n\n### 2. **IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT**\n\nIdentification and assessment of actual or potential negative impacts from direct or indirect business activities (assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities as part of the annual ESG risk process as well as traditional risk management and the Impact, Risk and Opportunity (IRO) analysis based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (RS) – see p. 38 ff)\n\n### 3. **INTEGRATION, ELIMINATION, AVOIDANCE OR MITIGATION**\n\nIncorporating the findings from the impact assessments obtained in step 2 into all relevant company processes and taking appropriate measures (knowledge transfer, training and awareness-raising, whistleblower hotline, employee surveys, etc.).\n\n### 4. **MONITORING**\n\nEffectiveness of measures and procedures to address negative impacts is tracked (internal and external audits (Business Social Compliance Initiative BSCI, Impactt, TfS Audits), rating and monitoring by EcoVadis, Integrity Next, etc.)\n\n### 5. **COMMUNICATION**\n\nregarding measures taken and their impact (Modern Slavery Act Statement, Sustainability Report, progress report within the context of the UNGC and the Women Empowerment principles, internal and external communication measures, etc.)\n\n### 6. **TAKING REPONSIBILIT Y**\n\nDevelopment of or participation in remedial actions where needed (cooperating with relevant organizations and initiatives such as \"Together for Sustainability\")\n\n**123**\n\nImage /page/122/Figure/15 description: The image shows a circular diagram with six blue circles arranged in a clockwise direction. Each circle contains a number and text. The first circle, located at the top, is labeled \"1. EMBEDDING AND PUBLIC COMMITMENT.\" Moving clockwise, the second circle is labeled \"2.

The focus of the BSCI audits is on promoting fair working conditions and respect for human rights.\n\n- The site in Kamunting, Malaysia, was improved to an \"A\" rating in the annual audit in December 2022. The top grade was achieved primarily through successfully implemented measures in the area of health and safety in the workplace and is valid for two years. The new owner HARPS will be responsible for recertification in the future.\n- In 2023, the Sopron site was audited together with the surgical glove production at the Wimpassing site by the external certified auditing partner Impactt. The assessment was not yet available at the time of publication of the report.\n\nWith the external social audit, about 30 % of the active Semperit employees and 7 % of the sites (100 % of the employees and 100 % of the sites with identified risk) were externally audited in accordance with the requirements of the amfori BSCI or Impactt in 2023.\n\n### **SOCIAL STANDARDS**\n\nProtection of human rights and compliance with the highest social standards are must-haves when it comes to retaining existing employees and attracting new ones. The requirements of employees are also subject to change. Factors (high remuneration, hierarchical position) that may have been decisive in choosing an employer in the past are no longer necessarily paramount today. Instead, other aspects such as flexibility and a sustainable corporate strategic focus are gaining in importance.\n\n### **SOCIAL DIALOGUE – FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION, DIALOGUE AND CODETERMINATION**\n\nSemperit uses stakeholder dialogue and codetermination to strengthen employee loyalty while also taking into account the needs of all stakeholders in the best way possible. The exchange of information as well as mutual interests and requirements takes place at various levels. In addition to the company's regular staff meetings, regional committees, and other voluntary initiatives, Semperit naturally complies with all regulatory requirements that serve to represent the interests of employees and give them a say in matters. Works councils can be elected by the workforce in all Semperit companies, and the right to freedom of assembly and association is fully guaranteed. In all production companies and many sales companies, the interests of the employees are represented by a works council or a company trade union. These are active in line with national laws and regulations. There is also a European Works Council at Semperit.\n\nImage /page/123/Picture/14 description: A medium shot shows a business meeting in progress.

In addition, Semperit proactively fosters a local feedback culture with a wide range of communication tools. These range from staff meetings, plant tours, and selected contacts from the HR department to the Semperbox or large event formats such as town halls, which are aimed at all employees and serve to disseminate information widely and answer questions from the workforce.\n\n**Germany:** The sites Hückelhoven and Deggendorf have elected works councils that represent the rights of employees in daily operations in accordance with local labor law. The Deggendorf and Waldböckelheim sites have already concluded external collective agreements. The Hückelhoven site is currently negotiating an external collective agreement.\n\n**France:** The employees in France are covered and represented by a local collective agreement and an employee advisory committee (works council).\n\n**India:** In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Act, employees are represented by a trade union (internal union) which interacts with management through monthly meetings.\n\n**Malaysia:** There is an active works council in Malaysia, which meets every month with management, including the managing director. Proposals, complaints, grievances, and suggestions for improvement from the employees are discussed in the course of these meetings. In addition, there are several additional feedback options such as the Semperbox, which can be used to submit suggestions in writing.\n\n**Austria:** There is a works council for both whitecollar and blue-collar employees, with which the local management cooperates closely and regularly. Quarterly meetings are held with representatives of the Executive Board and local site management to provide information on ongoing business issues and discuss them together. All employees in Austria are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\n**Poland:** There are two trade unions in the Polish organization, which cover different groups of workers. Due to the good relationship with these unions, the Polish employees are covered by a voluntary collective agreement.\n\n**Czech Republic:** The workers and employees at the Czech site are represented by a works council that works together regularly and closely with local management. In connection with this, quarterly meetings are held with representatives of the HR department and local management.\n\n**Hungary:** There is a works council representing all employees at each of the Hungarian production sites.\n\n**United States of America:** Because the concept of works councils is not widespread in the United States, so-called officially published employee handbooks define common standards and rules for all employees. These handbooks are in line with market practices in the US and define Semperit's role as a responsible and attractive employer.\n\nSocial dialogue and human rights due diligence are also exercised outside the company. For example, all suppliers participating in the EcoVadis assessment must also disclose information on whether the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining is threatened in their company, or how this right is ensured. In addition, the [Semperit Supplier Policy](https://www.semperitgroup.com/fileadmin/user_upload/MediaLibrary/SemperitGroup/Company/Sustainability/Lieferanten/Supplier_Policy_English_20220525.pdf)1 requires suppliers to comply with these human rights.\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/17 description: The image shows three people with different colored shirts and hats. The first person is wearing a blue shirt and hat, and has a blue speech bubble with an exclamation point in it. The second person is wearing a green shirt and hat, and has a gray speech bubble with a smiley face in it. The third person is wearing a navy blue shirt and hat, and has a green speech bubble with a sad face in it.\n\n[Lieferanten/Supplier\\\\_Policy\\\\_English\\\\_20220525.pdf](https://www.semperitgroup.com/fileadmin/user_upload/MediaLibrary/SemperitGroup/Company/Sustainability/Lieferanten/Supplier_Policy_English_20220525.pdf)\n\n1 [https://www.semperitgroup.com/fileadmin/user\\\\_upload/MediaLibrary/SemperitGroup/Company/Sustainability/](https://www.semperitgroup.com/fileadmin/user_upload/MediaLibrary/SemperitGroup/Company/Sustainability/Lieferanten/Supplier_Policy_English_20220525.pdf)\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **FAIR WAGES AND COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS (PAY-SCALE AGREEMENTS)**\n\nSemperit ensures remuneration in line with the market for all employees. The wages paid are based on the customary remuneration for a comparable position in the relevant environment. This includes the application of pay-scale (in Germany) or collective agreements (in Austria) at some locations (Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, France, and India). Approximately 67 % of all Semperit employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Furthermore, Semperit offers variable compensation components based on individually agreed targets or group targets. The Semperit bonus policy governs the principles of Group-wide bonus remuneration. The standardized Group-wide bonus scheme applies to all employees above a certain level (experts and above). Employees not covered by these rules are subject to local bonus schemes as well as incentive systems that vary by country, area of work, and position, such as:\n\n**China:** The local bonus policy is aimed at all employees who are not covered by the Group bonus policy. China has an employee handbook for the management of employee performance. The performance management policy is linked to the bonus policy to encourage high participation and provides for regular feedback meetings.\n\n**India:** For employees, especially hourly workers who are not part of the Group-wide bonus scheme, the local bonus is based on the nationally applicable bonus law and the conditions set out in the collective agreement. In addition, there are specific guidelines and standards for employee instruction, which are used for evaluation. The Indian site also offers a quarterly production incentive program linked to quality and output, thus linking company performance to employee performance.\n\n**Malaysia:** The bonus takes into account the length of service with the company. Attendance is used as a measure of commitment and loyalty. Employee retention measures take into account and reward length of service. All work processes are specified by standard operating procedures (SOP). New employees are trained on the basis of the relevant SOPs and their learning efficiency is assessed. Regular reviews are conducted to assess performance levels, and employees who fall behind are supported through a wide range of training programs.\n\n### **A W A R E N E S S - R A I S I N G A N D C O M M U N I C AT I O N**\n\nThe principles and rules of conduct in the area of human rights and social standards, to which Semperit is committed, are defined in multiple guidelines. To ensure that employees, suppliers, and other business partners comply with these requirements in daily work and cooperation, the rules must be clearly communicated and made known to everyone. Semperit carries out the following information and training activities relating to this:\n\n- Annual update and publication of the Semperit Group's Modern Slavery Act Statement\n- Update and accompanying communication of the Group-wide Code of Conduct\n- Online training on the Code of Conduct for all employees with a focus on the topic of human rights, particularly the forms and impacts of possible human rights violations along the supply chain.\n- Integration of human rights and social standards as a point of focus in the regular meetings of the Sustainability Council\n- Increased internal information and awarenessraising by the Compliance and ESG departments\n- Implementation of Group-wide online training courses such as \"ESG\" or \"Responding to harassment\" with a focus on human rights and social standards within the company. In 2023, 90 % of active employees were trained (3,437 training hours in total, an average of 0.87 hours per employee).\n- Participation in stakeholder events to share experiences and jointly plan possible further steps\n- Special focus on the topic of human rights and further work in this regard in the course of the industry initiative \"Together for Sustainability\", which will serve to further raise the industry standard in this area and minimize violations in the future\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nMeasures to safeguard and respect human rights can be as wide-ranging as the various aspects of human rights (30 articles in the Human Rights Charter) and can range from risk assessments to addressing the issue proactively with measures and cooperation with partners to solve specific tasks. Here, Semperit primarily focuses on training and monitoring. In the coming years, employees working in potentially sensitive areas of human rights will be trained through e-learning courses and workshops. Managers at the headquarters and in relevant management positions at the sites will also attend these training courses. In addition to employee training, there is also a need for appropriate monitoring. Sites with a higher risk of human rights violations due to local conditions are regularly audited by external experts.\n\nIn addition, a detailed analysis of compliance with minimum social standards – known as minimum protection criteria – was carried out as part of the EU Taxonomy Regulation with the support of external experts. Among other things, it was confirmed that the guidelines – OECD Guidelines, UN Guiding Principles, Fundamental Principles of the International Labour Organization and International Bill of Human Rights (based on Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852) – are met. With the combination of the measures described, Semperit assumes responsibility for compliance with high social standards and human rights in particular. Semperit furthermore plans to fulfil its human rights due diligence obligations in the supply chain more broadly and in-depth than previously. To this end, the company focuses on cooperation with the members of the \"Together for Sustainability\" initiative. This is because industry-wide synergies should be used, particularly with regard to supply chains, in order to create a sustainable impact.\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/7 description: The image shows a stylized illustration of a person being supported by two hands.

The color scheme is primarily gray and blue.\n\n# **GOVERNANCE** Compliance and anti-corruption [130](#page-129-0)\n\nSustainability in the supply chai[n](#page-138-0) 139\n\n130\n139\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nScoial\n\nSemperit has set itself the goal of further promoting sustainability in the supply chain through supplier evaluations via EcoVadis or self-disclosure questionnaires as well as through close cooperation with suppliers and the joint implementation of improvement measures. Due to the portfolio and strategy changes, Semperit also evaluated and set a more ambitious target for sustainability in the supply chain in 2023. From 2024, Semperit aims to have all purchasing expenditures assessed by EcoVadis – in contrast to the current target, which only relates to direct materials. In this way, Semperit is further expanding its positive impact on sustainability in the supply chain. By 2030, the company aims to generate 75 % of its procurement volume from suppliers that have been screened against ESG criteria and meet Semperit's high standards.\n\n### **O V E R V I E W O F \" S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y I N T H E S U P P LY C H A I N \" TA R G E T S A S PA R T O F T H E S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y S T R AT E G Y 2 0 3 0**\n\nAs part of the cooperation with TfS, Semperit is required to define annual quantitative goals that the company intends to achieve within one year. These goals include the number of suppliers evaluated via EcoVadis, the number of audits conducted, and the rate of improvement achieved in the course of repeated evaluations.\n\nIn 2021, Semperit began inviting its most important suppliers to have their sustainability performance evaluated using EcoVadis. As a result, Semperit was already able to source materials or services from 156 suppliers with an EcoVadis rating by the end of 2023. In 2023, Semperit decided to expand the previously set target from direct materials to the entire purchasing volume (direct materials, packaging materials, merchandise, logistics costs, services and services) and to achieve coverage of 75 % by 2030. In 2023, Semperit conducted 1 TfS audit and 4 audits on site at suppliers. Semperit is aware of the importance of on-site audits, which is why this topic is currently increasingly developed following the Covid-19 pandemic. The improvement rate in 2023 was 62 %. This means that 62 % of suppliers managed to improve their EcoVadis rating during the reporting period. The annual survey of this indicator is intended to show whether and to what extent the sustainability performance of suppliers is improving over the long term. It is therefore an important indicator for Semperit's Sustainability Strategy 2030, which does not aim for a one-time\n\nassessment regarding sustainability in the supply chain, but rather for continuous cooperation with suppliers and their ongoing sustainable development.\n\nSemperit not only endeavors to source as much as possible from EcoVadis-rated suppliers. The company also specifies what rating result its suppliers should achieve and intends to raise this threshold in the future. Suppliers that are below the value are to be developed more intensively. In 2023, 19 suppliers (until 31.08.2023 11 additional suppliers in the Sempermed examination gloves business; excluding Rico Group) achieved a score below 45 – the current threshold value. Semperit will encourage and, if necessary, help these companies to take effective improvement measures.\n\nSemperit continues to focus on the implementation of a circular economy and the increased use of recycled materials. Semperit maintains close and ongoing contact with the still few companies on the market that can supply recycled carbon black and reclaimed rubber. Both secondary raw materials are still only suitable for the production of Semperit products to a limited extent and remain a niche business with limited availability on the raw materials market. Nevertheless, Semperit is trying to strengthen these supplier relationships and jointly make the supply chain more robust in order to successively increase the use of recycled raw materials in Semperit products.\n\n### **SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT**\n\nImage /page/143/Figure/13 description: The image shows a line graph titled \"Supplier evaluation (expenditure on direct materials)\". The x-axis represents the years from 2021 to 2030, and the y-axis represents the percentage from 20% to 80%. There are two lines on the graph, one representing \"Actual\" and the other representing \"Target\". The \"Actual\" line starts at 39% in 2021, increases to 56% in 2022, and reaches 72% in 2023. The \"Target\" line starts at 39% in 2021 and increases gradually to 80% in 2030. The improvement rate is 70% in 2021, 65% in 2022, and 62% in 2023.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/14 description: The image shows a cartoon-style illustration of a factory, a gear, and a truck.

The reporting organization is Semperit AG Holding. The report contains information and data regarding activities, achievements, and targets of the corporate group that are important in the context of sustainable development. It offers stakeholders comprehensive insight into Semperit's business activities and, in particular, describes how the Group meets its economic, social, and environmental responsibilities.\n\n### **STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS**\n\nThe report was prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards (GRI 1: Foundation 2021). These standards are used and recognized worldwide as a framework for transparent and comparable sustainability reporting. The GRI Content Index in the appendix provides a detailed overview regarding the GRI standards covered in the report and where the respective information can be found.\n\nThe Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (NaDiVeG) – the national implementation of the EU Directive 2014/95/EU (NFI Directive) on mandatory reporting of non-financial and diversity-related information – has been in force in Austria since December 2016. This report fulfils the requirements of this law and is equivalent to a separate consolidated non-financial report pursuant to Section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB).\n\nSemperit has participated in the UN Global Compact since the beginning of 2021. This initiative calls on companies all over the world to apply ten principles from the areas of human rights, labor standards, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. This report documents the Group's achievements in the context of these ten principles and thus serves as a Communication On Progress (COP).\n\nThe disclosure of information on the EU taxonomy included in the report complies with the Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 as well as the associated published FAQ.\n\n### **REPORTING PERIOD AND CYCLE**\n\nThe reporting period covers the 2023 financial year, which corresponds to the calendar year. To improve comparability and to make the development of the key figures visible over a longer period of time, the tables primarily show the last three financial years. Semperit publishes an annual Sustainability Report; the last one was issued in March 2023.\n\n### **REPORT CONTENT**\n\nThe content of the report was determined while taking into account the reporting principles defined in the \"GRI 101: Foundation\" standards. This report provides information on the material topics identified on the basis of the materiality analysis conducted in 2020 and the materiality analysis updated in 2023 in accordance with the ESRS. This does not correspond to full compliance with the reporting requirements based on ESRS. The topics and sub-topics from the ESRS identified as material at the end of 2023 will be reported on in the 2024 Sustainability Report.\n\n### **CHANGES IN THE ORGANIZATION AND IN REPORTING**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 5, the earnings and balance sheet figures, and the key performance indicators of the EU taxonomy in this report relate only to continued operations excluding the discontinued medical business, including information from the acquired business division of the Rico Group. All other data and information continue to represent the continued and discontinued operations. In the reporting period, there were significant changes in terms of size and structure due to the divestment of the medical business on August 31, 2023, and the acquisition of the Rico Group on July 31, 2023. There were marginal changes in ownership in the reporting period – further details on changes can be found in the management report.\n\n### **REPORTING BOUNDARY**\n\nAll data and information in the \"Semperit Group\", \"Social\", and \"Governance\" chapters refer to the entire Group. The reporting boundary therefore includes all companies within the scope of consolidation. The examination glove business, which is part of the medical business sold in 2022, left the Semperit Group's scope of consolidation at the end of August 2023.\n\n**147**\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nSoci\n\nTherefore, the values of the examination glove business are only included in the key figures published in the report until the end of August (in the event of individual deviations from the reporting boundary, this is explicitly pointed out at the respective point in the report).\n\nThe Rico Group, which was acquired in July, was not included in the Semperit Group's scope of consolidation in 2023; integration is planned for 2024. Individual key figures and disclosures in chapters on sustainability and environmental management (energy, waste, water) and social issues (accident rate, number of employees) are explicitly noted. The revenue, capex and opex figures of the EU taxonomy include the key figures of all Rico locations in full.\n\nThere are further exceptions to the scope of consolidation and thus limitations to the reporting boundary for the environmental data in the \"Environment and climate protection\" chapter. It includes all production sites except the site in the USA and the German M+R Dichtungstechnik GmbH (full consolidation of the environmental data of both locations from 2024). 51% of M+R Dichtungstechnik were taken over by the Semperit Group in 2021. In order to make the transition as efficient as possible, Semperit relies on a gradual integration of the company into the Group structure, and complete consolidation of sustainability data until the acquisition of the remaining company shares at the end of 2025.\n\nData from the sales locations will not be collected due to their low environmental relevance. This restriction of the reporting boundary for environmental data was based on the criteria of materiality and the Pareto principle: The environmental impact of these companies is comparatively low, and the effort required to collect the environmental data would be disproportionately high. In the case of individual deviations from the report boundary, this is explicitly pointed out at the relevant point in the report.\n\n### **DATABASE**\n\nCompared to the previous Sustainability Report, the depth of key non-financial figures has been improved, the data collection process has been optimized, and the consolidation framework has been aligned where possible. As part of the ongoing development of data management, the values for some key figures for past years may differ slightly from those published in previous reports.\n\n- The commercial data and financial information correspond to that published in the Annual Report 2023 and in the Consolidated Financial Statements according to IFRS contained therein.\n- Data on employment structure is primarily based on the personnel data system SuccessFactors; additional data has been collected manually. Due to a standardization of definitions and recording methods, which was completed in 2020, a consolidated presentation of all data is only possible as of 2020.\n- In the 2023 reporting year, the data on occupational safety and health protection originates from the company's internal database and is collected at site level and consolidated at Group level.\n- In the 2023 reporting year, data on energy originates from the company's internal database, is collected at site level and consolidated at Group level. For the key figure Energy Consumption of the Semperit Group by source (MWh) of 2020 and 2021, there was an adjustment in 2022.\n- The direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) have been determined since the 2017 reporting year. All 7 greenhouse gases regulated under the Kyoto Protocol were taken into account in the calculation of the corporate carbon footprint. This includes:\n\t- Carbon dioxide (CO2)\n\t- Methane (CH4)\n\t- Nitrous oxide (N2O)\n\t- Hydrofluorocarbons(H-FKW/HFCs)\n\t- Perfluorocarbons (FKW/PFCs)\n\t- Sulphurhexafluoride (SF6)\n\t- Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).\n\nSince the 2020 report, Scope 3 has also included business travel by air, rail, bus and leased or private cars (Scope 3-6) as well as purchased upstream and downstream logistics services (Scope 3-4 and Scope 3-9) in addition to fuel and energy-related emissions that are not included in Scope 1 or 2 (Scope 3-3). These categories are calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard.\n\nBoth the greenhouse gas emissions per life cycle inventory data (natural gas, liquid gas, heating oil, fuels, etc.) and the breakdown of fuel-related emissions into Scope 1 and Scope 3 are based on data from the Austrian Environment Agency from December 2023 and are applied to all countries under consideration.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nSemperit Group Environment Social Governance Appendix\n\nSocial\n\nMarket-based greenhouse gas emissions of purchased electricity are calculated using the shares of the individual primary energy sources and the corresponding conversion factors from the Ecoinvent database in the current version 3.10 (2023). Locationbased greenhouse gas emissions are taken from Ecoinvent 3.10, as are the conversion factors for business travel and logistics services. The aim in the future will be to successively develop the depth of data collection in the area of logistics and business travel and to continuously improve the completeness of the greenhouse gas balance sheet.\n\n Supplier, material, innovation, and compliance data comes from the relevant departments and is subject to the data collection systems used there.\n\n### **REFERENCE VALUE FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL DATA**\n\nSpecific values in the \"Environment and climate protection\" chapter, such as energy intensity or greenhouse gas intensity, refer to the reference value \"good product\". The values for the Hoses, Form, Profiles and Belting businesses refer to the metric tons of produced goods, while the value for Sempermed refers to the number of produced gloves.\n\n### **EXTERNAL AUDIT**\n\nThis report was reviewed by an independent third party: Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. The review was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) from the International Federation of Accountants. The assessment was made with limited assurance. Further information on the scope and result of the audit can be found in the audit report. The Executive Board instructed the responsible employees of the respective departments to make the documents and information necessary for the review available in a complete and correct form. The report lists risks in line with the requirements of the Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act based on the ESRS (see page 46 ff.). A comprehensive risk report can be found in the Group Management Report of the Semperit Group for 2023.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **E U T A X O N O M Y REPORTING

According to that, an accountant is only liable for violating intentionally or by gross negligence the contractual duties and obligations entered into. In cases of gross negligence, the maximum liability towards the client and any third party totals EUR 726,730.\n\nOur reporting procedures were taken to achieve limited reporting security as a basis for our assessment. The scope of the reporting procedures for obtaining reporting evidence is smaller than the scope for sufficient reporting security (such as for annual reporting), so that a lower degree of reporting security is given.\n\nThe procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including particularly the following procedures:\n\n- Obtaining an overview of the business activities as well as the company's structural and process organization\n- Interviews with company managers to identify and understand relevant systems, processes and internal controls with regard to the audited report contents that support collecting information for reporting\n- Review of relevant documents on Group, Executive Board and management level to assess awareness and priorities of the issues in consolidated non-financial reporting and to understand how progress was monitored\n\n<sup>1</sup><https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR40189009/NOR40189009.pdf> 2<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/852/> 3<https://www.globalreporting.org/standards>\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nSoci\n\n- Examination of risk management and governance processes related to sustainability and critical evaluation of the representation in the consolidated non-financial report\n- Performing analytical procedures on Group level\n- Site visits in Austria at the headquarters in Vienna and at the Wimpassing site as well as in Deggendorf to obtain evidence on key performance indicators. In addition, we conducted random data reviews on site level to test completeness, reliability, accuracy and current relevance. This year's focus was on the following locations: Vienna, Wimpassing, Deggendorf and Odry.\n- Review of data and processes on a random basis to test whether they had been collected, consolidated and reported appropriately at Group level. This included reviewing data samples to test whether the data had been reported in an accurate, reliable and complete manner.\n- Review of the coverage of material issues raised in stakeholder dialogues, that were covered in media reports and to which significant competitors refer in their environmental and social reports\n- Evaluation of the materiality analysis within the Group, including sector-specific megatrends and aspects of GRI\n- Assessment as to whether the requirements were addressed appropriately according to Art. 267a UGB\n- Review on a random basis of statements on the audited report contents in the reporting based on reporting principles of the GRI Standards 2021\n- Assessment as to whether the GRI Standards 2021 were consistently applied\n- Assessment as to whether the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation were addressed appropriately\n- Provision of a gap analysis regarding the reasonable assurance readiness of the remuneration-relevant key figures Incidence Rate (employees), Energy Efficiency and Waste Reduction (environment).\n\nSubject of our engagement was neither a final audit nor the auditing of financial statements. The performance indicators and statements, as well as information from the Corporate Governance Report and the risk reporting, which were audited by us within the framework of the annual audit, were not subject of auditing by us. We have reviewed the Art. 267a UGB- and GRI-compliant presentation of this information in reporting. Equally, neither the detection and investigation of criminal offences, such as embezzlements or other malicious acts or regulatory offences, nor the assessment of effectiveness and efficiency of the management were subject of our mandate. Furthermore, the figures that were taken from external studies and forward-looking statements were not subject of our contract. The report reviewed the references listed in the GRI content index, but no (web) references going beyond this.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n### **TERMS OF ORDER**\n\nWe provide this report on the basis of the contract concluded with you, which is also based on the \"General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions\"1 with respect to third parties.\n\n### **SUMMARIZED ASSESSMENT**\n\nBased on our reporting procedures and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial report 2023 does not comply in all material respects with Art. 267a UGB (NaDiVeG) and the requirements of Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation as well as the GRI Standards 2021.\n\nVienna, March 18, 2024 Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H.

The international group, headquartered in Vienna, produces and sells its products in more than 100 countries and is one of the leading suppliers in its sectors.\n\nThe main product categories are hydraulic and industrial hoses, conveyor belts, escalator handrails, profiles for windows, doors and facades, cable car rings, ski foils, products for railroad superstructures as well as toolmaking and the production of precision liquid silicone parts.\n\nSemperit operated 16 production sites in the past financial year and employed roughly 4,600 people at the end of 2023. The products were sold in the business-to-business field using its own distribution network in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australia.\n\n### **L E A D I N G S P E C I A L I S T F O R INDUSTRIAL ELASTOMER PRODUCTS**\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, as part of Semperit's strategic realignment, Semperit decided to focus on the identifiable potential in the industrial sector going forward and to complete its transformation to become a specialist for industrial elastomer products.\n\nThe restructuring steps taken in previous years have significantly strengthened resilience within the industrial sector and laid solid foundations for future growth. In the past financial year, this transformation was implemented through the sale of the medical business and a powerful divisional structure that is oriented towards Semperit's two main business models was introduced. The Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) division focuses on highly efficient production and cost leadership for industrial applications in connection with large-scale production, while the innovation- and technology-driven Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) division focuses on customized solutions and attractive niche markets. The new positioning enables the optimal scaling of the business for future profitable growth.\n\n### **F O C U S O N C U S T O M E R - O R I E N T E D SOLUTIONS**\n\nFor both divisions, the priorities are a significant increase in customer proximity, a market-oriented alignment of the entire organization and a stronger focus on customeroriented solutions. The goal is to serve existing and future markets faster, more effectively and more efficiently. In addition, the systematic and continuous improvement across all areas of the company is intended to further improve the Semperit Group's competitive position and sustainability. The organic growth potential for the existing divisions is coupled with a clearly aligned M&A strategy. The focus on the strategic M&A activities will be on profiting from key trends, improving the geographical footprint, broadening the range of business activities and driving automatization, digitalization and circular economy.\n\nAgainst this background, Semperit took an important growth step with the acquisition of the internationally active Rico Group in the financial year 2023, which gave Semperit a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking and expanded the portfolio in terms of products, processing technologies, automation and materials.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **200 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE FOR TOMORROW**\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/1 description: The image is a QR code with a blue background and a darker blue pattern. The QR code is square and contains a complex arrangement of small squares and larger squares in the corners. The pattern is designed to be read by a QR code scanner.\n\nThe Semperit Group story began all the way back in 1824. Semperit is taking its 200th anniversary in 2024 as an opportunity to highlight its centuries-long tradition as well as its path to a successful future in a number of ways under the motto \"200 Years Semperit – Experience for Tomorrow\". On the 200-year website www.200.semperitgroup.com/en, Semperit looks back on the company's history, which is a story of outstanding personalities and innovative ideas, of resounding successes and also of overcoming crises that threatened the company's existence. At the same time, solutions and people are presented who are already working on Semperit's future successes today. Visit our website to find out how the Semperit Group keeps its customers' technology and infrastructure running in the world of tomorrow with its products and solutions.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/3 description: The image shows a computer monitor displaying a website with the text \"A JOURNEY THROUGH 200 YEARS OF HISTORY\".

Two light blue hands are positioned at the bottom, palms up, as if cradling something. From between the hands, a plant stem emerges with two green leaves. Above the plant, there's a circular emblem featuring a light blue globe with a stylized 'S' shape in a darker blue shade. The emblem is encircled by a white line, with small arrowheads indicating a circular motion around it.\n\n# **SUSTAINABILITY AT SEMPERIT**\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/6 description: The image is a square QR code with a blue pattern on a dark blue background. The QR code is made up of small squares arranged in a grid pattern. There are three larger squares, one in each of the top corners and one in the bottom left corner, which are used for alignment.\n\nWithout sustainability in its corporate DNA, Semperit would not be 200 years old. And without sustainability as a strategically anchored basic principle, no bright future would be possible. Semperit is making small and large adjustments in implementation, from climate protection and sustainable supply chains to a healthy and safe working environment. The Semperit Group published its seventh independent sustainability report for the 2023 financial year. The report provides an overview of the various activities, developments and key figures in the context of the main topics and is divided into the sections of environment & climate protection, social affairs and governance (Environmental, Social, Governance – ESG). In addition to topics such as energy, greenhouse gas emissions, material use, health and safety as well as compliance and anti-corruption, it contains general information on the integration of sustainability in the Group and further climate-related information according to the TCFD – Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The Sustainability Report for 2023 and the reports from previous years can be accessed online on our website.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **FORE WORD FROM THE EXECUTIVE BOARD**\n\n### **DEAR READERS, DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,**\n\nThe past financial year 2023 was eventful and at the same time formative for the Semperit Group, as it marked the successful transformation into an industrial elastomer specialist.\n\nFollowing the sale of our medical business in late summer, from which you were able to benefit with an additional dividend, we are focusing on further developing and expanding our leading position in the core business for industrial elastomer products.\n\nWith the acquisition of liquid silicone specialist Rico, we immediately took an important growth step and now occupy a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking. This enables us to exploit the huge growth potential for silicone products in Western Europe and the USA.\n\n**E F F I C I E N T S T R U C T U R E F O R FUTURE GROWTH** I N D U S T R I A L E L A S TO M E R SPECIALIST.\n\n> As part of our enhanced strategy with a focus on our industrial core business, we have streamlined our organization and introduced a powerful divisional structure that is aligned with Semperit's two main business models. With the Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) division, we are a leading international supplier of hydraulic and industrial hoses (Hoses) and sealing profiles (Profiles). In these business units, we focus on highly efficient production and cost leadership for industrial applications in connection with large-scale production. With the Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) division, we are an internationally renowned supplier of customized and tailormade technical solutions based on elastomers. We are already one of the world market leaders in escalator handrails, conveyor belts and track underlays. We also cover the entire value chain in the field of liquid silicone – from prototype development and toolmaking to largescale production. In addition to liquid silicone (Rico), the SEA division, which is strongly driven by innovation and technology, also includes the Belting and Form units. With this new structure we are increasing our efficiency and focusing on even greater customer proximity. It also enables us to optimally scale our business for future profitable growth.\n\nT H E 2 0 2 3 F I N A N C I A L Y E A R M A R KS T H E S U C C E S S F U L T R A N S F O R M AT I O N O F T H E S E M P E R I T G R O U P I N TO A N\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/7 description: A man in a blue shirt is looking at the inside of a large metal ring. The ring has a series of holes drilled into it. The man is standing inside the ring, and his head and shoulders are visible. The background is blurry, but it appears to be a factory or industrial setting.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/0 description: The image shows a large industrial complex with several buildings, a road, and a grassy area. The buildings are a mix of old and new styles, with some having red brick facades and others having white or blue exteriors. The road leads into the complex and there are several vehicles parked in the area. The sky is cloudy and the overall impression is one of a busy industrial site.\n\n### **ESG PRIORITIES**\n\nBased on the sale of the medical business and our purely industrial focus, we also adapted our ESG targets to the new structure in the past financial year. In the environmental area, we are systematically continuing to reduce energy, waste and CO2 emissions at all our sites. In addition, we are giving top priority to the continuous improvement of our health and safety performance indicators. We are placing a new focus on diversity and inclusion and have set ourselves specific targets for increasing the proportion of women in management positions. We will also take an even more ambitious approach to screening our supply chain. In order to achieve all of these goals, we are making numerous small and large adjustments during implementation, from climate protection and sustainable supply chains to a healthy and safe working environment. You will find all the details about our ESG initiatives and the development of our key figures in our Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n### **ECONOMIC HEADWIND**\n\nAs expected, the business development of the Semperit Group in 2023 was characterized by a challenging market environment in which we performed very solidly and generated revenue of EUR 721.1 million (–7.5%) in continued operations. While Semperit Industrial Applications was confronted with the general economic slowdown and ongoing destocking by customers, the Semperit Engineered Applications division benefited above all from continued strong demand for conveyor belts and specialty products in the Form business. Our two divisions, which are partly subject to different cycles, therefore complement each other very well.\n\nIn anticipation of economic headwinds, we took early countermeasures in the form of cost reductions and intensified these once again in the middle of the year as a result of the downsizing of the Group following the sale of the medical business. Continued operations generated EBITDA adjusted for one-off expenses of EUR 81.7 million (–14.7%) or EUR 71.8 million unadjusted (–28.5%). Earnings after tax from continued operations were positive at EUR 24.9 million, while the loss from the discontinued and now sold business division had a significant negative impact, as expected. Earnings after tax therefore amounted to EUR –17.1 million.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **ROBUST FINANCIAL BASE**\n\nWe have a very robust balance sheet and financial base in our Group, whereby we proactively adjusted our financing to our strategic needs over the course of 2023. Following the acquisition of Rico and the sale of the medical business, our balance sheet structure is now more balanced between equity and debt with a solid equity ratio of 45.3% and net financial debt of EUR 115.2 million. Our liquidity position of EUR 112.7 million at the end of 2023 was very comfortable. In addition, we have access to an undrawn credit line of EUR 100 million.\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/2 description: A man in a white shirt and glasses is standing in a factory, looking to the right. He is standing behind a large, flat, black surface, possibly a conveyor belt or a sheet of material. The factory has blue walls and ceilings, with pipes and machinery visible in the background. There are fluorescent lights on the ceiling, and the overall lighting is bright.\n\n### **STRATEGIC GROWTH INITIATIVES**\n\nWhile we are countering the economic downturn by cutting costs and increasing efficiency, we are systematically pursuing our strategic growth initiatives. These include the construction of a highly automated, additional hydraulic hose production facility at our site in Odry in the Czech Republic, which is already Europe's largest hose factory, and the expansion of production in the liquid silicone sector at Rico at its headquarters in Thalheim near Wels. With the expansion in Odry, we are strengthening our position and our competitiveness as one of the top global players for hydraulic hoses. We are paying particular attention to a high degree of automation and the ecological sustainability criteria of the EU taxonomy. The capacity expansions in Thalheim will in turn enable us to further extend our technological lead in the production of injection molding tools for a high number of cavities per tool and in automation.\n\nIn 2023, we thus invested in the future and our competitiveness while improving our efficiency. Therefore, despite the currently still challenging economic environment, we look to the future with confidence, because our business model is healthy and resilient, and we have the ambition to constantly improve and to be able to serve existing and future markets even faster. We will prove this once again in the 2024 financial year, which is a very special year for the Semperit Group.\n\nI N 2 0 2 3 , W E I N V E S T E D I N T H E F U T U R E A N D O U R C O M P E T I T I V E N E S S W H I L E I M P R OV I N G O U R E F F I C I E N CY.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **EXPERIENCE FOR TOMORROW**\n\nIn 2024, we will celebrate the 200th anniversary of Semperit under the motto \"200 Years Semperit – Experience for Tomorrow\". The impressive history of our company is based on strong success factors such as globalization, innovative spirit and customer orientation.

We will successfully continue this legacy in the future. Because with our products and solutions, we will keep our customers' technology and infrastructure running in the world of tomorrow.\n\nWith this in mind, we also want to ask our employees worldwide to come forward in 2024. Because without our Semperit employees, our success would never have been possible. Our 200-year website will therefore publish historical and current success stories from the world of Semperit throughout 2024. Check back at regular intervals!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we thank you for the trust you have placed in us with your investment in our company and look forward to continuing on the path we have chosen with full commitment.\n\n### **THE EXECUTIVE BOARD VIENNA, MARCH 18 2024**\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/5 description: A man with short brown hair and a blue suit is smiling at the camera.

There is also a smaller building to the right of the main building, with a red roof.\n\nJohann Nepomuk Reithoffer's factory in Wimpassing in 1852\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/2 description: This black and white image shows a factory with a tall smokestack and a sign that reads \"PNEUS HARBURG WIEN\". The factory is surrounded by buildings and trees, and there are people walking on the street in front of the factory.\n\nJohann Nepomuk Reithoffer's factory in Wimpassing in 1852 In 1872, Reithoffer's sons merge with the German Harburg rubber factory. One of the most important products is the \"Harburg-Wien\" rubber tyre, internationally recognised as a quality product. Around 1900, a wide variety of products are manufactured, including balloon envelopes.\n\n# 1824–1872 1872–1918\n\n# **FOUNDATION AND EARLY YEARS**\n\nIn **1824**, tailor Johann Nepomuk Reithoffer lays the foundations for today's company with his patent for waterproof fabrics. The first European factory for rubber products is established in Wimpassing, Lower Austria.\n\n# **A EUROPEAN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANY IS CREATED**\n\nThe merger of several rubber companies makes Semperit the largest rubber goods producer in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Semperit goes public on the Vienna Stock Exchange in **1890**.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/10 description: This image is a black and white portrait of a man sitting in a chair. He is wearing a dark suit with a white shirt and tie. His hands are clasped in his lap. The background is a plain white wall.\n\nIn 1872, 800 workers are already employed in the factory in Wimpassing. Every month, they produce 15,000 pairs of shoes, 10,000 dozen combs, 2,500 bales, 3,000 pounds of rubber products for technical purposes, 500 coats and skirts and 1,500 rubber threads. A large proportion of the products are already exported worldwide.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/12 description: The image shows three gloves of different sizes. The gloves are all the same color and style, but they vary in length. The gloves are arranged from left to right, with the shortest glove on the left and the longest glove on the right. The gloves are all pointing in the same direction, with the fingers pointing downwards. The gloves are all lying flat on a surface. The image is well-lit and the gloves are in focus.\n\nGloves have been manufactured in the Wimpassing factory since the 19th century.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/14 description: The image contains two separate images. The image on the left is a black and white drawing of a woman holding a large hoop. The image on the right is a black and white photograph of a long building with a smokestack.\n\nSemperit Österreichisch-Amerikanische Gummiwerke AG is founded in 1912. The company is internationally competitive and employs more than 3,000 people.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/17 description: The image shows a document with text written in a non-English language. The document has a yellow background and is surrounded by a decorative border. The text is arranged in several lines and appears to be a formal certificate or document. There are also some decorative elements on the right side of the document.\n\nThe Semperit share is one of the oldest shares listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe increasing motorisation in the interwar period causes a surge in growth for Semperit tyres. In 1929, tyre production is already Semperit's largest production branch.\n\nSemperit's General Manager Messner talking to employees.\n\n# **AUSTRIA'S SECOND LARGEST INDUSTRIAL GROUP**\n\nAfter the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Semperit is able to regain a foothold through expansion and the establishment of new sites. In **1926**, Semperit is Austria's second-largest industrial group with 9,000 employees and nine factories. The age of tyres is dawning.\n\nThe economic crisis of the 1930s leads to a dramatic revenue decline. The wide variety of the production programme proves to be uneconomical. 40,000 items are produced in Wimpassing, which is the most extensive range on the entire continent. Following a reorganisation of the company, business recovers from 1936 onwards.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/21 description: The image shows a black and white photograph of a room with several large, dark, spherical objects suspended from the ceiling. The room appears to be a library or office space, with shelves visible in the background. A person is seated at a desk in the background. The spherical objects are the most prominent feature of the image, and they create a sense of surrealism or abstraction.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/9 description: In a black and white photograph, several women are working at tables in what appears to be a factory or workshop setting. The women are seen from the back, and they are wearing light-colored aprons or dresses. They are seated at individual workstations, each equipped with some sort of machinery or equipment. The room is filled with shelves and storage units, suggesting a busy and organized workspace. The overall atmosphere is one of industry and labor.\n\nSoccer production\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/11 description: A vintage black and white photograph shows a truck parked in front of a building. The truck has a flatbed and the name \"WIMPEY & CO\" is painted on the side. The building behind the truck has an arched entrance with text above it, though the text is difficult to read. The truck is parked on a street, and the overall scene has a historical feel.\n\n# 1918–1938 1938–1945\n\n# **SEMPERIT UNDER NATIONAL SOCIALISM**\n\nSemperit is integrated into the wartime economic system of the Nazi era. Forced labourers are employed. Despite the adverse circumstances, General Manager Franz Josef Messner is committed to above-average social benefits at Semperit. He is also active as a resistance fighter and is executed in the last days of the war in **1945**.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/15 description: The image shows a life raft. The raft is made of a light-colored material and is shaped like a horseshoe. There is a paddle resting on the raft. The raft is sitting on a wooden platform. In the background, there are two more life rafts.\n\nInflatable boats for military operations\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/17 description: The image shows four black and white photographs. The first photograph shows the production of latex bulbs. The second photograph shows a truck. The third photograph shows women working. The fourth photograph shows women dominating everyday working life in Wimpassing during the war.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/18 description: In a sepia-toned indoor shot, a woman is seated and working at a machine.

Her hair is dark and appears to be pulled back. She is seated on a stool or chair, and her hands are engaged with the machine in front of her. The machine is a complex piece of equipment with various components, including wheels and levers. It is positioned on a stand or table. The background is somewhat cluttered, with various objects and structures visible, suggesting a workshop or factory setting. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a vintage or historical feel to the image.\n\neveryday working life in Wimpassing during the war.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/0 description: The image shows a tall building with many windows.

The man on the left is wearing glasses. All of the men are wearing ties. There is a decorative wall behind them.\n\nSatisfied faces after the sale of the tyre division. From left to right: Semperit Tyre CEO Günther Sieber, Semperit CEO Franz Josef Leibenfrost, Continental CEO Helmut Werner, Creditanstalt CEO and Semperit Supervisory Board Chairman Hannes Androsch.\n\n## **RECONSTRUCTION IN POST-WAR EUROPE**\n\nAfter disassembling the plants as reparations to the victorious powers and thanks to substantial investments, partially from the Marshall Plan, Semperit gets started with modern production facilities. Shareholdings in Europe provide a boost to internationalisation. In **1965**, the Semperit Group exports goods to 100 countries around the world. 15,000 employees in 24 production and sales companies and an annual production of 158,000 tonnes underpin the Semperit Group's position as an international flagship in **1973**.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/7 description: This is a black and white, slightly blurred, aerial shot of a factory complex. The complex is composed of several buildings of varying heights and sizes. A tall smokestack rises from one of the buildings. In the background, there are rolling hills and a small town.\n\nDemand is huge after the war. Semperit produces in three shifts and is still unable to fully satisfy demand.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/9 description: The image shows the rear of an airplane. The tail and wings are visible. The airplane is parked at an airport terminal. A set of stairs is leading up to the plane.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the product range reaches unprecedented diversity. The products are advertised with a designated bus and are so valuable that air freight sometimes pays off.\n\n# 1945–1973 1973–1989\n\n## **OIL PRICE SHOCK AND YEARS OF RESTRUCTURING**\n\nSemperit's tyre business collapses due to the oil crisis of the 1970s. In **1985**, the tyre division is sold to Continental. After a difficult restart, product streamlining leads to initial restructuring successes and the development potential of technical products is accelerated. The takeover of a conveyor belt plant near Paris in 1988 makes Semperit the largest supplier of textile conveyor belts in Europe.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/14 description: The image shows a close-up of a machine with multiple blue gloves attached to it. The gloves are arranged in a circular pattern, and the machine appears to be in operation. The background is blurred, but it seems to be an industrial setting.\n\nThe previously highly profitable tyre business collapses along with the entire automotive market. Semperit repositions itself. Investments are made in a product range that is concentrated on gloves, hoses, moulded goods and conveyor belts.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/16 description: In an indoor shot, a person in a blue jumpsuit stands next to a large tire. The tire is black and has a deep tread pattern. The person is facing away from the camera and appears to be inspecting the tire. The background is a warehouse or factory setting, with boxes and equipment visible. The lighting is somewhat dim, creating a slightly grainy effect.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/17 description: In a monochrome outdoor shot, a vintage car is captured in motion on a dirt road, with a backdrop of trees. The car, a classic sedan, is equipped with auxiliary lights on its front, suggesting it may be a rally or off-road vehicle. The dirt road is uneven, and the car is kicking up dust as it drives. The trees in the background are dense, creating a natural, wooded environment. The image has a vintage feel due to the monochrome palette and the style of the car.\n\nSemperit is one of Austria's best-known brands in the postwar period and is omnipresent, for example at the \"Semperit Rally\", the first cross-Austrian rally event in post-war Austria.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/19 description: The image shows a large ship docked at a port. The ship is red and black, and it is docked next to a large crane. The crane is also red, and it is used to load and unload cargo from the ship. The port is a busy place, with lots of activity. There are several other ships in the background, and there are also several buildings and warehouses. The sky is blue, and there are a few clouds.\n\nSemperit expands with conveyor belts.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/0 description: In the image, several workers are wearing surgical masks and caps while working on a production line. They are putting on white gloves. The workers are wearing light-colored uniforms.\n\nIn 1989, the first glove factory in Thailand starts operation together with the joint venture partner Sri Trang. This is followed by dynamic expansion. By the end of 1998, annual production has risen to 2.6 billion examination and protective gloves, making Siam Sempermed the largest global glove factory. The products are exported all over the world.\n\nInnovative strength is further enhanced with the new R&D centre in Wimpassing.\n\n# **ASIA PIONEER SEMPERIT**\n\nFrom **1989**, General Manager Rainer Zellner shapes the development of Semperit for almost three decades. Under his leadership, the Group becomes the cost leader in many areas and pursues a course of international growth. Semperit is one of the first Austrian companies to have production facilities in Asia.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/7 description: The image shows two separate scenes within the same frame. The first scene depicts a factory setting with workers in blue uniforms operating machinery. One worker is actively engaged with a machine that has a large red wheel. The second scene shows a woman in a blue uniform and cap, also in a factory environment, working with a machine that appears to be winding or processing a thin, flexible material.\n\nIn 1996, Semperit enters the Chinese growth market for handrails. A hose and moulded goods plant is also built in Thailand. Sales are globalised. The important US glove market is served by Sempermed USA in Florida.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/9 description: A woman in a blue uniform and cap is standing in what appears to be a factory or industrial setting. She is holding a long, flexible orange tube or wire in both hands, creating a large loop. The tube extends from a coil on the floor to her hands, and then arches upwards. The background includes industrial machinery and gray walls, suggesting an indoor environment.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/10 description: A man in a blue shirt and blue overalls is working on a machine with many cylindrical objects arranged in a circular pattern. The machine appears to be in an industrial setting, with green walls and other machinery visible in the background. The man is focused on his task, and his hands are positioned as if he is adjusting or manipulating something on the machine.\n\nParallel to the expansion into Asia, the Wimpassing site is modernised. Under reorganisation manager Rainer Zellner, all business areas achieve sustainable profitability.\n\n# 1989–1998 1998–2017\n\n# **RISING TO THE TOP LEAGUE OF THE INDUSTRY**\n\nThe focus is on internationalisation, innovation and cost leadership. Europe's largest hose factory in Odry, Czech Republic, becomes part of the Semperit Group in **1998**. The conveyor belt segment Sempertrans expands into Poland and takes over the Bełchatów conveyor belt plant in several stages. At the turn of the millennium, Semperit is present on three continents with 20 production sites and 6,000 employees.\n\nWith the acquisitions in the Czech Republic and Poland, Semperit has become one of the big players in the global hose and conveyor belt business.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/16 description: The image shows an industrial area with a large building in the background. There are pipes running overhead, and the ground is wet, possibly from rain. The sky is cloudy and overcast, suggesting a gloomy or rainy day. The overall impression is one of a functional, utilitarian space, likely part of a factory or industrial complex.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/17 description: The image shows a blurred factory interior with rows of large spools of cable in the foreground. To the right, there is text that reads \"At the turn Semperit threshold schillings consistent\".\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Semperit exceeds the revenue threshold of 5 billion Austrian schillings. The product portfolio is consistently competitive.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/19 description: A medium shot depicts a man in a blue uniform and a hard hat, holding a device in his hands, standing in what appears to be a factory or industrial setting. The man is looking upwards, seemingly inspecting or observing something above him. Large, dark-colored spools or reels are suspended from the ceiling, adding to the industrial atmosphere of the scene. The lighting is somewhat dim, but sufficient to illuminate the man and the surrounding equipment.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/0 description: Two men in suits are sitting at a table, with one man signing a document. The man on the left is looking at the document, while the man on the right is signing it. There is a blue abstract design on the wall behind them.\n\nWith the divestment of the medical business, Semperit is realising its transformation to become an elastomers specialist for the industrial sector and is focussing on the expansion of its industrial core business. Semperit CEO Karl Haider (right) signs the closing documents for the sale at the end of August 2023 with Haziq Bin Zairel Oh, CEO of the buyer Harps.\n\n# 2017–2023\n\n## **GLOBAL PLAYER SEMPERIT**\n\nSemperit implements the largest investment programme in the company's history and expands its production capacities worldwide in response to strong demand. After a phase of global growth, the strategic decision is made to focus on the Industrial Sector. Semperit divests its glove segment Sempermed. In **2023**, Semperit acquires the Rico Group, a global technology leader in liquid silicone and mould making, thereby strengthening its industrial core business.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/5 description: Two men wearing hard hats and safety vests are standing next to two signs. One man is holding a shovel and the other is holding a tool. The sign on the left has the text \"DEMONSTRATE & UNIQUE APPLICATIONS\" and the sign on the right has the text \"Aviation Fueling Solutions\".\n\nStart of construction for the expansion of hose production in Odry, Czech Republic. This will strengthen the company's position as global market leader for hydraulic hoses.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/7 description: A man in a blue shirt is standing inside a large, circular structure made of metal. The structure appears to be part of a machine or industrial equipment. The man is smiling and looking towards the right side of the frame. The metal structure has a number \"28\" written on it.\n\nCapacities are being expanded around the world. From Odry to Shanghai, from Bełchatów to Kamunting and from Deggendorf to Newnan.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/9 description: This is an aerial shot of a complex of buildings, likely an industrial or commercial park, set against a backdrop of fields and distant trees. The buildings are a mix of sizes and shapes, with some having red roofs and others with blue or gray. A large parking lot filled with cars is visible in the foreground, suggesting a busy working environment. The overall impression is one of a well-organized and active business area in a rural or suburban setting.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/10 description: The image shows an industrial autoclave with its door open. The autoclave is a large, cylindrical pressure vessel, and the open door reveals the interior, which contains a metal rack structure. The exterior of the autoclave is painted in a light color, and there are various pipes and machinery visible in the background, suggesting it is located in a manufacturing or industrial setting. The lighting is bright, highlighting the metallic surfaces and the overall scale of the equipment.\n\nWith Rico's expertise in liquid silicone and mould production, Semperit can tap into new, attractive markets and continue to grow, especially in North America.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **SUCCESS FACTORS OUR DNA**\n\nThis experience and our strong focus on our success factors enable us to actively shape the future. With our products and solutions, we keep our customers' technology and infrastructure up and running in the world of tomorrow.\n\n# **INNOVATION ENGINE**\n\nEnabling innovation was the birth of Semperit in 1824: developing products that give our customers a clear advantage. What was then water-repellent clothing are now our technologically sophisticated innovations, which we also use to keep the technology and infrastructure of tomorrow's world running.\n\n# **GLOBAL PIONEER**\n\nFor over 200 years, Semperit has made success possible by thinking and acting on an international scale. This was true before the First World War, when Semperit was already a multinational company by the standards of the time. And it is all the more true today and in the future, when we, as a leading supplier, constantly expand our global footprint and grow intelligently and profitably.\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/6 description: The image is a QR code with a blue background.

This is also our credo for the future: in a world that never stands still, we, as a reliable partner, will ensure that our customers are successful. With top performance in quality and service.\n\n# **SOLUTION MAKER**\n\n\"Semper it\", there is always a solution – this is the mindset that has made Semperit robust and successful for two centuries. Sometimes our team has to be inventive and innovative, sometimes it is more important to act with pragmatism and routine. But it always goes on, and there is always a solution – you can continue to rely on that in the future.\n\nImage /page/18/Picture/5 description: The image shows a meeting with three people. One person is standing and presenting to the other two people who are sitting at a table. There is a large screen behind them with a logo on it.\n\n# **SUSTAINABLE PARTNER**\n\nWithout sustainability in its corporate DNA, Semperit would not celebrate its 200-years anniversary. And without sustainability as a strategically anchored basic principle, no promising future would be possible for Semperit. In implementing this principle, we make small and large adjustments, from climate protection and sustainable supply chains to a healthy and safe working environment.

The ongoing war in Ukraine led to restraint on the part of international investors and thus to a more subdued share price performance on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Towards the end of the year, however, there was growing hope that the easing inflationary pressure would clear the way for key interest rate cuts. Corresponding signals from central banks also led to a year-end rally on the stock markets. Over the full year, the ATX Index gained 9.9% and the MDAX improved by 8.0%.\n\nThe Semperit share performed positively in the first half of 2023, with the signing of the contract for the sale of the medical business at the end of 2022 also having a supportive effect. At EUR 27.10, the share reached its high for the year on April 17, shortly before the Annual General Meeting approved the dividend and the then still conditional additional dividend, totaling EUR 4.5 per share. The second half of the year was characterized by a downward trend. Possible reasons for this were the sales of larger blocks of shares by individual investors as a result of the adapted Semperit business model (sale of the medical business) as well as increased sales following the payment of the additional dividend in September. The low for the year was EUR 13.10 on December 1, the closing price at the end of 2023 was EUR 14.16. Based on the closing price of EUR 19.82 per share for the 2022 financial year, this represents a decline of 28.6%; taking into account the dividends paid out, the total return is –5.9%. The start to the 2024 stock market year was generally positive, with the share also outperforming benchmark indices and shares. However, larger sales volumes at the beginning of February weighed on the share price again.\n\nMarket capitalization totaled EUR 291 million at the end of 2023 (EUR 408 million at the end of 2022). The average daily trading volume of Semperit shares in euros decreased accordingly in 2023 compared to 2022, amounting to EUR 291 thousand with around 15,000 shares (2021: EUR 529 thousand with around 24,000 shares).\n\n### Dividend\n\nThe dividend policy of the Semperit Group basically aims at a distribution of around 50% of earnings after taxes – assuming continued successful performance with no unusual circumstances.\n\nIn view of the positive earnings after taxes from continued operations – the relevant earnings and comparative figure for future business development – the Executive Board will propose a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share to the Annual General Meeting. A total of EUR 10.3 million therefore should be distributed. With a share price of EUR 14.16 at the end of 2023, this results in a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nA basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share plus an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share was distributed for the 2022 financial year following the fulfillment of the conditions precedent in connection with the (first) closing of the sale of the medical business. This corresponds to a total dividend yield of 22.7% in relation to the closing price of EUR 19.82 in 2022.\n\nHaving been listed since 1890, the Semperit share is one of the oldest on the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/2 description: The image is a bar chart comparing earnings per share (EPS) in EUR from 2018 to 2023. In 2018, the EPS was -4.13. In 2019, the EPS was -2.48. In 2020, the EPS was 9.06 and 1.50. In 2021, the EPS was 11.99 and 1.50. In 2022, the EPS was -0.27 and 4.50. In 2023, the EPS was -0.82 and 0.50.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) in EUR\n\nDividend per share in EUR; 2023 proposal to the AGM; 2022 base dividend of EUR 1.50, an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 was paid, which was linked to the successful sale of the medical business; see Dividend section for further details\n\n### Communication in the capital market\n\nThe Semperit Group intends to provide current and potential shareholders with a complete picture of the company's business performance through a transparent and prompt communications policy. The company also relies on different ways of conveying information. This should enable an accurate valuation of Semperit shares on the markets and facilitate a long-term relationship of trust with both shareholders and the general public.\n\nThe Executive Board and Investor Relations actively seek dialogue with players on the capital markets. As a result of the change in communication habits and in travel behavior after the pandemic, traditional activities such as roadshows or plant visits have shifted more to digital forms of communication. In 2023, Semperit took part in numerous investor conferences, some of which were held online format, while others took place on site, for example in Frankfurt, Munich, Algarve, Zürs and Vienna. Moreover, numerous meetings, conference calls and video calls were arranged to best cater to the requests of individual investors expressing an interest.\n\nEquity research and the ongoing dialogue with analysts are also important elements of the company's communications with the financial market. Analysts from the following institutions reported on Semperit during the 2023 financial year: Baader Bank, Erste Bank, Kepler Cheuvreux, and Raiffeisen Bank International. Meetings with analysts took place regularly again in 2023.\n\nIn addition, the Investor Relations website also plays an important role in communication on the technical side.

This code contains common international standards and significant related regulations in this context, stipulated in the Austrian Stock Corporation, Stock Exchange and Capital Market Acts. The Austrian Corporate Governance Code is based on the EU recommendations on the tasks of supervisory board members and on the remuneration of executive board members and supervisory board members as well as on the principles set out in the OECD Guidelines for Corporate Governance. The code is aimed at ensuring responsible management and supervision of individual companies and groups, with the goal of creating sustainable and long-lasting value. The code seeks to create a high level of transparency for all company stakeholders.\n\nCompanies voluntarily commit to compliance with the guidelines set out in the current version of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code as amended. The version of the Corporate Governance Code that is applicable to the 2023 financial year was published in January 2023 and can be found online at www.corporate-governance.at.\n\n### Statement on corporate governance\n\nThe Semperit Group, as a publicly listed company that operates globally, hereby declares that it will voluntarily observe the Austrian Corporate Governance Code in its current version and that it also intends to observe the code in the future and justify any behavior to the contrary. Semperit AG Holding complies with all legally binding L-Rules (legal requirements). Unless otherwise declared, the C-Rules (comply or explain) will be observed by the relevant bodies and the company.\n\n### Dual management structure\n\nThe dual management structure of Semperit AG Holding as a publicly listed stock corporation consists of an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. Both bodies are strictly separated from each other in terms of personnel and functions and can therefore perform their different tasks independently. The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company, while the Supervisory Board is responsible for monitoring it.\n\n### Cooperation between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board are committed to managing the company in accordance with the principles of good corporate governance. This management takes place in an open dialogue between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as within these corporate bodies to ensure its continuous development. Among other things, the Executive Board's internal rules of procedure govern the Executive Board's ongoing reporting to the Supervisory Board. They also specify a catalogue of transactions and measures that, in addition to legal provisions, require the Supervisory Board's explicit authorization. The Supervisory Board monitors the Executive Board and supports it in managing the company, particularly when decisions of fundamental importance are to be made.\n\nThe strategic direction of the company is determined in close cooperation between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and is discussed in Supervisory Board meetings held at regular intervals.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Executive Board\n\n### Composition and function of the Executive Board\n\nAt the end of the 2023 financial year, the Executive Board consisted of three members: CEO Karl Haider, CFO Helmut Sorger and CIO Gerfried Eder.

The Board has full responsibility for managing the company for the benefit of the business while considering the interests of shareholders and employees as well as the public interest.\n\nThe Executive Board's internal rules of procedure regulate the allocation of business responsibilities and the principles of cooperation between members of the Executive Board. Decisions of primary importance are taken by the Board as a whole. The Executive Board is solely responsible for all communications that have a significant impact on how the company is perceived by its stakeholders. Legally binding regulations, the Articles of Association, and the internal rules of procedure for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board laid down by the Supervisory Board form the basis for corporate management.\n\n### Karl Haider\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) since 11 January 2022; term of office ends on 31 March 2025.\n\nKarl Haider, born in 1965, started his career as a chemical lab technician.

Overall attendance was 99%; only one member was absent from one meeting. Stefan Fida served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Birgit Noggler as Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board until the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023. Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting; he was elected as Chairman and Stefan Fida as Deputy Chairman at the constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board. The individual Supervisory Board meetings focused on the further development of the industrial strategy and the associated implementation of the new organizational structure, the acquisition of the RICO Group, the sale of the medical business and measures to reduce costs and increase efficiency.\n\nThe Audit Committee led by finance expert Birgit Noggler performs its duties in accordance with Article 92 Section 4a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and Rule 40 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. In 2023, the Audit Committee held four meetings, focusing particularly on the preparation of the adoption of the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2022, on the acquisition of the RICO Group as well as the sale of the medical business, on risk management, the internal control system, internal auditing, the compliance organization, IT security (cybersecurity), and the preparation of the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023.\n\nThe Nominating and Remuneration Committee was chaired by Stefan Fida until 25 April 2023, and Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was appointed Chairman at the constituent Supervisory Board meeting following the Annual General Meeting. In eight meetings, the Committee focused on the performance assessment and agreement of targets for the members of the Executive Board. Other focal points were the early departure of Kristian Brok as well as the succession to the Executive Board and the appointment of Gerfried Eder. In addition, the potential and succession issues of the second management level and initiatives for talent management within the company were discussed with the Executive Board.\n\nThe Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee, which was established in April 2023, held two meetings under the chairmanship of Thomas Cord Prinzhorn. The committee focused on supporting the strategy process, including the realignment of the organizational structure, as well as discussing strategic initiatives and growth potential. The committee also dealt intensively with the innovation portfolio and the KPIs of the innovation process.\n\nThe ESG Committee, which was also founded in April 2023, monitors the establishment and effectiveness of sustainability reporting, deals with defining ESG targets in Executive Board remuneration and supports the Supervisory Board with other ESG issues, particularly if these are relevant to the Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee. Under the chairmanship of Thomas Cord Prinzhorn, the committee held one meeting to discuss the updating of the ESG strategy and targets as a result of the restructuring of the Group and the implementation of new ESG regulations and standards (e.g., CSRD).\n\nThe Committee for Urgent Issues, headed by Thomas Cord Prinzhorn since 25 April 2023, did not hold any meetings.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the first half of 2023, the Supervisory Board completed a comprehensive self-evaluation based on both qualitative and quantitative assessment in accordance with C Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In addition to a generally very positive evaluation result for the Supervisory Board's activities, specific measures to increase efficiency were also derived from this. These measures related, for example, to the areas of organization and working methods, information and communication or committee work and further training. An update of the quantitative evaluation is planned for the second half of 2024 in order to review the successful implementation of the measures developed and to identify further areas for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the Supervisory Board's work.\n\n### Composition of the Supervisory Board Committees1\n\n| Committee                                                          | Members                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Committee for Urgent Issues                                        | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (member and Chairman since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stefan Fida (Chairman until 25.04.2023)<br>Markus Stocker                                                                |\n| Nominating and Remuneration<br>Committee                           | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (member and Chairman since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stefan Fida (Chairman until 25.04.2023)<br>Markus Stocker                                                                |\n| Audit Committee                                                    | Birgit Noggler (Chairwoman, financial expert)<br>Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Member since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stephan Büttner<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker                          |\n| Strategy, Growth and Innovation<br>Committee<br>(as of 25.04.2023) | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Chairman)<br>Klaus Friedrich Erkes<br>Claus Möhlenkamp<br>Marion Weissenberger-Eibl<br>Birgit Noggler<br>Monika Müller<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker |\n| ESG Committee<br>(as of 25.04.2023)                                | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Chairman)<br>Stefan Fida<br>Birgit Noggler<br>Marion Weissenberger-Eibl<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker                                                |\n\n¹ As of 31 December 2023.\n\n<sup>1</sup> As of 31 December 2023. 2 On 25 April 2023, Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting and elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board at its constituent meeting.

According to this, all members of the Supervisory Board declared their independence from the company and its Executive Board. In addition, pursuant to C-Rule 54 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the members Stephan Büttner, Claus Möhlenkamp and Marion Weissenberger-Eibl were not shareholders of the company with an investment of more than 10% each nor did they represent the interests of such shareholders in 2023. There is D&O insurance for the Supervisory Board. The associated expenses are borne by the company.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Remuneration of the Executive and Supervisory Boards\n\nIn accordance with Section 78c of the Stock Corporation Act and, as a result, in accordance with the amended reporting requirements in the Corporate Governance Code and AFRAC Statement 37 on the Compensation Report, Directive (EU) 2017/828 to promote long-term participation of shareholders was implemented in the 2019 Stock Corporation Law Amendment Act. Accordingly, the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board must be dealt with in a separate remuneration report and presented to the Annual General Meeting (please also refer to www.semperitgroup.com/investor-relations/reports-presentations).\n\n### Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance\n\nDirectors and Officers (D&O) insurance has been taken out for the members of the Executive Board and senior executives within the Group. The company bears the related costs. In case of damage, deductibles were agreed for the event that Executive Board members are found to be in breach of duty.\n\n### Managers' transactions\n\nThere were no proprietary transactions in the financial year. In general, transactions in shares or debt instruments of the company or related derivatives or financial instruments by members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are published in accordance with Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation at https://issuerinfo.oekb.at and on the company's website.\n\n### Equal opportunities and diversity\n\nThe promotion of Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) is an essential part of Semperit's sustainability strategy. The vision for Diversity & Inclusion 2040 is to promote a collaborative and inclusive work culture in which all employees feel valued, have a sense of belonging, feel comfortable, can live their authentic selves and are respected as individuals. The intention is to ensure fairness in all aspects. Semperit wants to reduce unconscious bias and use the great diversity in the workforce to its advantage in order to benefit from the experiences and perspectives of people with different cultural imprints and other backgrounds (for details see also Sustainability Report 2023). Respect, diversity, and inclusion are integral and indispensable elements of the corporate culture of Semperit AG Holding and are always considered when filling vacancies. When proposals are made to the Annual General Meeting for filling Supervisory Board mandates and when nominating Executive Board members, special importance is attached to expertise and diversity because this contributes significantly to the level of professionalism and efficiency delivered through the work of the Supervisory and Executive Boards. In addition to professional and personal qualifications, aspects such as age, ethnic origin, gender, education, and experience are also factored in. The written version of a diversity concept of the Supervisory Board was adopted on 1 February 2018 and updated in the 2021 financial year.\n\nAt the same time, the topic of diversity and inclusion (D&I) is not only relevant for filling management positions, but for the entire Semperit Group. This applies to the existing workforce as well as to the recruitment and hiring of new employees. In addition to professional and personal qualifications, aspects such as age, origin, gender, education and experience are also taken into account, as is the case for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. A diversity and inclusion strategy was developed in 2022. In the course of various workshops, four dimensions and goals were defined that are crucial for Semperit in the area of D&I:\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Gender: In a step-by-step process, Semperit is pursuing the path to a more balanced gender distribution at all hierarchical levels of the Group. Each Semperit site is developing a local action plan with at least two defined initiatives to eliminate relevant local gender barriers. In addition, Group HR has been reporting on the current gender balance in Semperit's senior management on an ongoing basis since 2023. In the second half of 2023, a progress plan for a balanced gender ratio in senior management was drawn up, and in October 2023 the Executive Board defined an annual increase in the proportion of women as a target by 2030.\n- Age: By the end of 2025, Semperit will have ensured that there is equal treatment of all age groups both in guidelines and in corporate practice in the areas of recruitment, employee promotion and development. This goal is to be achieved through a change in corporate culture, which will in turn be initiated through the implementation of at least five defined initiatives focusing on the elimination of system barriers and prejudices against all age groups.\n- People with disabilities: Following a successful pilot project in Austria in 2022, initiatives to better identify and analyze the needs of employees with disabilities and to implement improvements were carried out at all Semperit sites in 2023. The approach is based on the identification of local system barriers at the site and their targeted elimination. Measure, cost and implementation plans were developed at all production sites in order to make the workplaces and the site more inclusive for employees with disabilities.\n- Culture and intercultural competence: By the end of 2025, Semperit will have strengthened intercultural competence through continuous awareness-raising communication measures and ensure that all employees have completed awareness training to eliminate prejudices with regard to culture, origin and inclusion.\n\nBuilding on this, \"D&I Councils\" were established for each dimension at the beginning of 2022 with representatives from various divisions, locations, age groups and hierarchical levels. The D&I Councils also work as think tank platforms where data is analyzed, ideas are exchanged, and initiatives are designed to promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce. The fact that D&I has become an integral part of Semperit's corporate culture is also reflected in numerous communication measures implemented in 2023. Examples include the D&I PC screensavers provided within the company or informative intranet and shop floor postings. In addition, Semperit offers information opportunities via a specially created \"D&I microsite\", where employees can also contribute their own ideas. In June 2023, the Executive Board and the upper management levels also signed a \"Diversity Charter\". This document underlines the importance of promoting a networked and inclusive culture at Semperit.\n\n### Advancement of women\n\nSemperit is committed to equal opportunities for all employees – regardless of age, gender, nationality, religion, skin color, or sexual orientation. A person's skills and potential are what counts. The gradual increase in the proportion of women in the Semperit Group, which – typical for an industrial company – is lower than in other sectors, is a central goal for human resources. The measures to promote women include flexible working models in the form of flexitime and part-time work as well as special agreements for part-time parental leave. These measures and the new ESG target introduced by the Executive Board in 2023, which will be applicable from 2024, are intended to contribute to a continuous increase in the proportion of women (for more details, see the 2023 Sustainability Report). In addition to the new target, the Executive Board has set another example in the fight against gender inequality and signed the UN-initiated Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs). These comprise a series of principles that provide companies with guidance on how they can pro\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nmote gender equality and the empowerment of women. As a traditional industrial company with a technical focus, the share of women was 27% across the Group in 2023 (2022: 23%). Since May 2017, Semperit AG Holding has met the quota for women on the Supervisory Board, which has been required by law since 2018. Overall, the share of women in management (Executive Board, Management Forum, department heads) was around 14% (2022: 13%).\n\n### Issuer Compliance Policy\n\nIn order to implement and ensure compliance with all relevant stock exchange regulations, Semperit AG Holding has issued its own Issuer Compliance Policy designed to prevent the misuse or dissemination of insider information. Compliance is monitored and administered by an Issuer Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Executive Board.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nBeyond issuer compliance, the Semperit Group has a compliance organization that covers all corporate units. A Group Compliance Officer receives support in fulfilling their responsibilities from central compliance team and local compliance coordinators working in the subsidiaries of the Semperit Group. The main focus is on ensuring compliance with regulations in the areas of anti-corruption, antitrust law, export control and sanctions as well as data protection. The Group Compliance Officer is also the deputy of the Issuer Compliance Officer.\n\nThe Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees and managers and is available in several languages, was updated and published in 2022. Its most important objectives are to avoid corruption, money laundering, human rights violations, insider trading, and breaches of competition law. In addition, it deals with aspects of data protection and export restrictions. These conduct requirements are further specified in thematic compliance guidelines. Employees receive in-depth and practical training with a focus on the matters referred to in the Code of Conduct. In addition, there is regular internal communication from the Executive Board and the relevant managers providing support on compliance-related topics. The Code of Conduct can be viewed online here: https://www.semperitgroup.com/company/compliance-code-of-conduct.\n\n### Whistleblower system\n\nIn order to support the above-mentioned targets of the Code of Conduct, the information hotline \"SemperLine\" was set up in January 2018. Employees as well as external stakeholders are welcome to report infringements of the Code of Conduct – also in an anonymous way:\n\nhttps://www.bkms-system.com/bkwebanon/report/clientInfo?cin=19semp16&c=-1&language=eng.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risk Management & Assurance\n\nThe \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department is responsible for the central coordination, moderation and monitoring of the structured risk process for the entire Group. The enterprise risk management process is based on the globally recognized framework concept of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and aims to identify, assess and manage risks at an early stage. In addition to fulfilling legal requirements (compliance), the strategic focus is on the early identification of negative developments in the strategic, operational, market and financial areas that could hinder the success of the Semperit Group. Relevant risks are identified and assessed in terms of their impact and probability of occurrence. Responsibilities are identified, measures are defined, and tracking is ensured. Elements of both the bottom-up and top-down approaches are combined to ensure that potential new risks are discussed at management level and, if relevant, included in reporting. As part of the enterprise risk management approach, the reporting period for risk assessment is one year in any case and – in line with medium-term planning – up to five years. ESG-relevant risks may have a different, longer observation period. The process is completed by reporting to the relevant stakeholders. Individual reporting takes place immediately after the respective risk update in the respective Group divisions. Comprehensive risk reporting on individual risks, including aggregation at Group level, is carried out at least once a year, and a quarterly progress report on current developments, changes and additions to the risk portfolio is submitted to the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board. The regular reporting process is complemented by an ad-hoc reporting process to draw attention to critical issues in good time.\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. audited and confirmed the functionality of the risk management system of the Semperit Group for the 2023 financial year in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nThe purpose of the internal control system of the Semperit Group is to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency and profitability of business operations, the reliability of financial reporting, and adherence to applicable laws and regulations. It also supports the early recognition and monitoring of risks from inadequate monitoring systems and fraudulent actions and is revised and expanded on an ongoing basis by the \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department together with the relevant specialist departments. The management of the relevant business units is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the internal control system and the risk management system. The Executive Board of Semperit AG Holding stipulates cross-divisional framework conditions and regulations that are applicable throughout the Group. Follow-up audits are undertaken at the various sites and at the headquarters on a regular basis to ensure sustainable implementation of these framework conditions and regulations.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n### External evaluation\n\nIn accordance with C-Rule 62 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the Semperit Group commissioned an external organization to evaluate its compliance with the stipulations contained in the code and the accuracy of the associated public reporting for 2022. This evaluation, which was performed by Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., did not identify any facts inconsistent with the declaration of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board found in the 2022 Corporate Governance Report with respect to its compliance with the C Rules of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. In accordance with C-Rule 62, a new evaluation is planned for the year 2025.\n\nVienna, 18 March 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nKorda Ward\n\nKarl Haider CEO\n\nHelmut Sorger CFO\n\nGerfried Eder CIO\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/2 description: A portrait shot of a middle-aged man in a suit and tie.

On the one hand, the past financial year was characterized by the still challenging economic environment, in which our company held its ground very solidly and introduced cost-cutting measures at an early stage. On the other hand, important strategic decisions were made and the transformation of the Group into an industrial elastomer specialist was implemented as announced. This was achieved through the sale of the medical business with the first and important transaction closing at the end of August, in which you as shareholders were able to participate in the form of an additional dividend. The acquisition of the Rico Group, in turn, secured Semperit a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking. The new divisional structure, which is based on the two main business models, is also accompanied by a reduction in complexity and an increase in efficiency. Moreover, it is the ideal platform for further profitable growth.\n\nIn our function as the Supervisory Board, we accompanied and supported the Semperit Group and its Executive Board in this strategic transformation and all other projects, took on an active role as a sparring partner for the Executive Board and, as in previous years, performed the duties assigned to us by law and the corporate statutes with great care. The Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board comprehensively, continuously and promptly about developments on the markets and the effects of the challenging market environment on the course of business as well as countermeasures to ensure the Group's competitiveness, strategic growth projects and the company's assets, financial position and earnings situation, thereby fulfilling its duty to provide information at all times and in appropriate depth. A total of seven Supervisory Board meetings were held in 2023, with a total attendance rate of 98% by the shareholder representatives. In addition, there were 15 committee meetings with a total attendance rate of 100%. A detailed overview of the individual attendances and the committees can be found in the Corporate Governance Report from page 31 onwards. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board were also in regular contact between meetings, and several resolutions were passed by way of circulation. Cooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board was characterized by open discussions and constructive cooperation throughout.\n\n### Effective work in committees\n\nThe Audit Committee, chaired by financial expert Birgit Noggler, held four meetings in 2023. The focal topics were the preparation of the resolution on the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2022 financial year, deconsolidation of the medical business, risk management, the internal control system, internal auditing, the compliance organization, IT security (cybersecurity) and the preparation of the annual and consolidated financial statement audit for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Nominating and Remuneration Committee held eight meetings in 2023. It was chaired by Stefan Fida until the Annual General Meeting, and then by myself. Our focus was on the performance assessment and objectives of the Executive Board members as well as the early departure of Kristian Brok and the succession to the Executive Board with the appointment of Gerfried Eder. In addition, the potential and succession issues at the second management level and talent management initiatives were discussed with the Executive Board. The Committee for Urgent Matters did not hold any meetings.\n\nIn addition, we formed two new committees under my chairmanship in April: In the Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee, we held two meetings to discuss the strategy process and the realignment of the organizational structure as well as strategic initiatives and growth potential. The committee also dealt intensively with the innovation portfolio and the control variables of the innovation process.\n\nThe ESG Committee held one meeting to discuss the update of the ESG strategy and objectives following the restructuring of the Group and the implementation of new ESG regulations and standards.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Changes to the Supervisory Board and Executive Board\n\nAt the end of the 134th Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023, Astrid-Skala-Kuhmann stepped down from the Supervisory Board at her own request, and the shareholders elected Marion Weissenberger-Eibl and me as new members of the Supervisory Board. In June, the Supervisory Board approved the early termination of the Executive Board contract of Kristian Brok, who left the company at his own request, and appointed Gerfried Eder as a new member of the Executive Board and Chief Industrial Officer with effect from 1 July 2023. We are convinced that the Executive Board team is ideally positioned to continue Semperit's successful course.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank Astrid Skala-Kuhmann and Kristian Brok for their professional work and support of the Semperit Group.\n\n### Approval of the 2023 annual financial statements\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (EY) was appointed as the auditor of the company's annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year. As a result of its audit, EY has issued an unqualified audit opinion on the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of Semperit AG Holding as of 31 December 2023. The management report and the group management report are consistent with the annual and consolidated financial statements. The non-financial reporting (sustainability report) for the 2023 financial year was also subjected to an independent audit by EY.\n\nIn its meetings held on 13 and 18 March 2023, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board dealt intensively with the annual financial statements including the management report, the consolidated financial statements including the group management report, the corporate governance report, the sustainability report and the auditor's reports, with the results of the audit being discussed in detail with the auditor. Based on the efficient audit process for the annual financial statements 2023, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual General Meeting to reappoint Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. as auditors for the financial year 2024.\n\nThe Supervisory Board examined the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the management report and the group management report, the corporate governance report and the sustainability report and concurs with the conclusions of the audit. The Supervisory Board formally approves the annual financial statements for 2023, which are consequently adopted in accordance with Article 96 para. 4 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The corporate governance report, the sustainability report, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report 2023 as well as the remuneration report have also been approved by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is following the recommendation of the Audit Committee and proposing Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. as auditors for the 2024 financial year to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Supervisory Board declares its agreement with the Executive Board's profit distribution proposal, according to which a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share should be proposed to the AGM. A total of EUR 10.3 million is therefore intended to be distributed.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees of the Semperit Group for their extraordinary dedication and commitment. Special thanks also go to you, the shareholders, customers and partners of Semperit for the trust you have placed in us.\n\nVienna, March 18, 2024\n\nSh. C. Porter\n\nThomas Cord Prinzhorn Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group Management Report\n\nWith effect from July 1, 2023, the planned adjustment of the organizational structure was carried out as part of the further development of the industrial strategy, and the previously existing segments of the Industrial Sector were divided into two divisions: the Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) division focuses on industrial applications through highly efficient production and cost leadership; this includes hydraulic and industrial hoses (the former Semperflex segment) as well as profiles (formerly part of the Semperseal segment). The Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) division focuses on customized technical solutions and comprises escalator handrails, cable car rings and other customerspecific elastomer products (the former Semperform segment), including elastomer sheets (formerly part of the Semperseal segment) and conveyor belts (the former Sempertrans segment). The Rico Group, a leading supplier of silicone injection molding tools and producer of liquid and solid silicone components, has also been part of this division since 1 August 2023.\n\n### Economic environment\n\nOverall, the 2023 financial year was characterized by headwinds for the global economy, although the global economy continued to slowly recover from the negative shocks of recent years, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the sharp increase in raw material and energy prices. However, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, geopolitical uncertainties and the high inflation and interest rate environment remained among the main factors influencing global economic development. In the period following the pandemic, many companies began to reduce their inventories, which they had previously increased as a precautionary measure to ensure production and delivery during periods characterized by supply chain bottlenecks.\n\nIn its growth forecast published in January 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts global economic growth of 3.1% in 2023. It also forecasts 3.1% for 2024, and 3.2% for 2025. Although the forecast for 2024 has been raised by 0.2 percentage points compared to the October 2023 forecast, the estimate for the years 2024 to 2025 is below the historical average (2000 - 2019) of 3.8%.\n\nA growth rate of 2.5% was calculated for the USA for 2023, while 2.1% is currently expected for 2024 – unchanged from last October's estimate. In contrast, the growth forecast for the eurozone has been revised downwards for 2024 and now stands at 0.9% after 0.5% for 2023. In October 2023, GDP was still expected to increase by 1.2% in 2024. With regard to the major eurozone economies, the forecasts fell by 0.4 percentage points to just 0.5% for Germany and by 0.3 percentage points to 1.0% for France. The forecast for Italy remains unchanged at 0.7%. By contrast, the forecast for (primarily Asian) emerging and developing countries improved slightly: while a growth rate of 4.0% was still forecast for both 2023 and 2024 in the fall forecast, the forecast is now 4.1%. China is expected to grow by 4.6% in 2024, after 5.2% in 2023.\n\nAccording to the forecast published by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) in December 2023, there are hardly any signs of a recovery in the domestic industrial economy. The Austrian economy shrank by 0.8% in 2023. The negative factors were high inflation and global industrial weakness. WIFO is therefore assuming a delayed recovery in industrial production in Austria, which means that GDP should only grow by 0.9% in 2024.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nVarious raw materials such as butadiene, carbon black and natural rubber are important basic components\nfor the manufacture of polymer products. After the geopolitical environment led to a shortage of supply\nand sharp price increases for a number of raw materials in 2022, the situation eased in the 2023 reporting\nperiod. Exceptions to this were the prices for carbon black, which were primarily impacted by a supply\nshortage as well as energy and CO₂ surcharges. Below is an overview of the most important raw materials:\n\nImage /page/46/Figure/4 description: The image contains two line charts comparing the indexed prices of different commodities over time. Both charts share the same x-axis, spanning from 2020 to 2023, and the y-axis, labeled 'Indexed to 100'. The left chart plots the indexed prices of 'Butadiene Korea', 'Butadiene Europe', and 'TSR20'. 'Butadiene Korea' is represented by a dark blue line, 'Butadiene Europe' by a light blue line, and 'TSR20' by a gray line. The right chart plots the indexed prices of 'Brent' and 'HFO'. 'Brent' is represented by a dark blue line, and 'HFO' by a gray line. The source of the data is Reuters, Refinitiv Eikon, and the data is indexed to January 1, 2020.\n\nIndexed to January 1, 2020; source: Reuters, Refinitiv Eikon;\nBrent Crude, LCOc1 ICE Europe Brent Crude Electronic Energy Future (USD/bbl)\nHFO, Heavy Fuel Oil 1% NWE (USD/t)\nButadiene, PHAKE00 BD Korea, PHAKG00 BD Europe (USD/t)\nTechnically Specified Rubber, TSR20 SICOM (Usc/kg)\n\nCrude oil is an important raw material for synthetic rubber precursors such as butadiene, but also\nfor carbon black. Parallel to the decline in crude oil prices, the average prices for the basic raw mate-\nrial butadiene, which is relevant for both divisions, were lower in 2023 than in 2022, both in Asia (by\naround 13%) and in Europe (by around 30%). This was also reflected in the price trend for butadiene\nderivatives.\n\nIn the past, prices for the filler carbon black, which is used in both divisions, generally correlated\nstrongly with the development of heavy fuel oil (HFO), which was on average 17% cheaper in 2023\nthan in the previous year in line with the development of crude oil prices. However, a decoupling\nbegan towards the end of the first quarter of 2022, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and energy and CO2\nsurcharges had a significant impact. Overall, average carbon black prices in 2023 were therefore\nslightly higher than the average level in 2022.\n\nNatural rubber, which is particularly relevant for the Belting business, was traded around 11%\ncheaper on the commodity exchanges in Asia in 2023 than in 2022.\n\nThe price of iron ore, which is used in wire rod, was stable on average in 2023 compared to the\nprevious year but still 7% higher than the five-year average. Wire rod itself was traded below the\n2022 level on an annual average in both China and Europe.\n\nAfter supply chains normalized over the course of 2023, the attacks on shipping in the Red Sea\naround the turn of the year 2024 once again led to longer transport times and higher freight costs.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Revenue and earnings performance\n\n### Key figures Semperit Group\n\n| in EUR million                                                       | 20231 | Change  | 20222 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                                              | 721.1 | -7.5%   | 779.8 |\n| EBITDA                                                               | 71.8  | -28.5%  | 100.5 |\n| EBITDA margin                                                        | 10.0% | -2.9 PP | 12.9% |\n| EBITDA adjusted                                                      | 81.7  | -14.7%  | 95.8  |\n| EBITDA margin adjusted                                               | 11.3% | -0.9 PP | 12.3% |\n| EBIT                                                                 | 34.6  | -44.3%  | 62.1  |\n| EBIT margin                                                          | 4.8%  | -3.2 PP | 8.0%  |\n| EBIT adjusted                                                        | 44.5  | -31.9%  | 65.4  |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                                                 | 6.2%  | -2.2 PP | 8.4%  |\n| Earnings after taxes from continued operation                        | 24.9  | -35.2%  | 38.4  |\n| Earnings after taxes from discontinued operation                     | -41.9 | -4.6%   | -44.0 |\n| Earnings after taxes                                                 | -17.1 | n/a     | -5.6  |\n| Earnings after tax adjusted                                          | -8.1  | n/a     | 10.9  |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and<br>equipment3 | 277.0 | n/a     | 37.6  |\n| Employees (average)                                                  | 4,637 | 7.8%    | 4,300 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Adjusted for the following negative effects: one-off severance payments for changes to the Executive Board and for reductions in headcount (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –2.2 million; earnings after tax effect: EUR –2.1 million), one-off effects from the sale of the medical business (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –1.3 million; earnings after tax effect: EUR –1.3 million), transaction costs for Rico (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –3.3 million, earnings after taxes effect : EUR –3.2 million) and from profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation of the Rico Group (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –3.0 million; earnings after taxes effect: EUR –2.3 million).\n\n<sup>2</sup> Adjusted for the positive one-off effect of the net proceeds from the property sale in France in the Belting business (2022: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR 4.7 million; earnings after tax effect: EUR 4.0 million), for the negative effect of the net impairments in the former Sempermed segment and the Profiles business (2022: EBIT effect from continued operations: EUR –7.9 million; earnings after tax effect in total from continued and\n\ndiscontinued operations: EUR –12.3 million) and by the negative effect of transaction costs (2022: earnings after tax effect: EUR –8.2 million). <sup>3</sup> Excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Semperit Group performed solidly in a challenging market environment characterized by high inflation and a weak economy. Revenue of EUR 721.1 million was generated, which was –7.5% below the previous year's figure. Positive price effects could not offset lower sales volumes, as customers reduced their inventories and ordered more cautiously due to the economic situation – especially in the Semperit Industrial Applications division. This decline was only partially compensated for by the significantly higher earnings of the Semperit Engineered Applications division. In anticipation of this development, cost reduction programs were introduced at an early stage, which already had a positive effect of EUR 5.8 million and thus exceed the planned run rate of EUR 10 million per year. EBITDA from continued operations amounted to EUR 71.8 million (previous year: EUR 100.5 million), including one-off expenses of around EUR 9.9 million. These one-off expenses consisted of the transaction costs for the acquisition of the Rico Group, from profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation, from one-off severance payments for changes to the Executive Board and for reductions in headcount, as well as expenses in connection with the sale of the medical business (separation of IT systems). Earnings after tax from continued operations were positive at EUR 24.9 million, while the loss from the discontinued and now sold operations had a significant negative impact, as expected. Earnings after tax thus amounted to EUR – 17.1 million.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe continued operations of the Semperit Group recorded revenue of EUR 721.1 million (–7.5%) in the 2023 financial year. The two divisions, in which the former Industrial Sector has been reorganized, developed differently. While the difficult economic market environment in the Semperit Industrial Applications division (SIA, comprising Hoses and Profiles) led to a decline in sales volumes and thus revenue by –26.5% to EUR 330.8 million in the 2023 financial year, the Semperit Engineered Applications division (SEA, comprising Form, Belting and Rico) benefited primarily from the ongoing strong demand for mining products and the associated demand for conveyor belts as well as the demand for special products for formed parts. Revenue in the SEA division thus increased by 23.7% to EUR 351.0 million, of which EUR 37.2 million was attributable to Rico (since initial consolidation, for the months of August to December 2023). In Surgical Operations (production of surgical gloves in Wimpassing including packaging in Sopron), revenue fell as expected by –23.3% to EUR 42.1 million.\n\nInventories of own products decreased by EUR 11.0 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: increase of EUR 11.8 million), reflecting the focus on working capital management.\n\nOther operating income fell slightly to EUR 8.3 million (previous year: EUR 9.3 million) and includes income from the sale of emission certificates (EUR 0.9 million) and from research funding (EUR 1.8 million). In the previous year, this item included income from the sale of a property in France in the amount of EUR 4.8 million.\n\nCost of materials (including energy and purchased services) fell by EUR 79.5 million or 19.4% to EUR 330.7 million (previous year: EUR 410.2 million), primarily as a result of lower production volumes in the SIA division. Around two thirds of the reduction can be attributed to volume effects and around one third to the slight easing of the raw material price situation compared to 2022.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased to EUR 220.1 million in the 2023 financial year (+11.7% compared to EUR 197.1 million in 2022), primarily as a result of the Rico takeover. Other effects included inflationrelated wage and salary increases as well as one-off severance payments in connection with the changes to the Executive Board and the reduction in personnel overheads. This increase has already been partially offset by capacity-related adjustments to headcount.\n\nAt EUR 98.5 million, other operating expenses were 2.8% higher than in the previous year (previous year: EUR 95.8 million). This is primarily due to transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of the Rico Group (EUR 3.3 million) and a warranty claim for conveyor belts. In addition, there were higher IT-related expenses in connection with the sale of the medical business and the further development of IT systems as well as higher travel expenses following the end of the corona pandemic. By contrast, lower expenses for outgoing freight (EUR –7.5 million compared to the previous year) had a positive effect.\n\nThe cost-cutting programs introduced have already reduced expenses by a total of EUR 5.8 million, of which around 85% was attributable to personnel expenses and the remainder to other operating expenses.\n\nEBITDA in continued operations amounted to EUR 71.8 million (previous year: EUR 100.5 million) and the EBITDA margin to 10.0% (previous year: 12.9%). The Rico Group's operating contribution to EBITDA totaled around EUR 7.6 million. However, the profits recognized in advance of EUR 3.0 million as part of the purchase price allocation and transaction costs of EUR 3.3 million initially reduced this contribution to around EUR 1.2 million.\n\nAdjusted for special effects amounting to around EUR 9.9 million, EBITDA totaled EUR 81.7 million. These are transaction costs for the acquisition of the Rico Group, profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation, one-off severance payments for changes to the Executive Board and for reductions in headcount, as well as one-off expenses (IT) for the sale of the medical business. The adjusted EBITDA margin 2023 amounted to 11.3%. Adjusted EBITDA in the previous year was EUR 95.8 million and was adjusted for the positive one-off effect of EUR 4.7 million; the corresponding margin was 12.3%.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased to EUR 37.6 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 30.4 million), primarily as a result of the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group (EUR 7.0 million). EBIT from continued operations therefore amounted to EUR 34.6 million (previous year: EUR 62.1 million) or EUR 44.5 million after adjustment (previous year: EUR 65.4 million).\n\nThe financial result improved to EUR –8.7 million (previous year: EUR –10.4 million). Higher financing expenses as a result of new bank financing for strategic growth projects were offset by higher interest income and a change in the result attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\nTax expenses decreased to EUR 1.1 million (previous year: EUR 13.4 million). In the 2023 financial year, the effective tax rate for continued operations was therefore 3.7% compared to 22.9% in the comparative period. In particular due to the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses in the Austrian tax group in the 2023 financial year, the effective tax rate is very low in comparison. The effective tax rate relates to income taxes in relation to earnings before tax less the earnings attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\nEarnings after tax from continued operations amounted to EUR 24.9 million (previous year: EUR 38.4 million) and earnings after tax from discontinued operations were EUR –41.9 million (previous year: EUR –44.0 million). The latter included a reclassification of historical currency translation differences of EUR –23.5 million due to the deconsolidation.\n\nOverall, earnings after tax (from continued and discontinued operations) were negative at EUR –17.1 million (previous year: EUR –5.6 million). Earnings per share attributable to the shareholders of Semperit AG Holding thus amounted to EUR –0.82 in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR –0.27).\n\n### Discontinued operations\n\nDiscontinued operations were deconsolidated as of 31 August 2023, after the (first) closing of the sale of the medical business. Following the pandemic-related exceptional economic situation in the preceding years with comparatively high demand and price trends, revenue in discontinued operations fell significantly to EUR 108.4 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 324.2 million).\n\nEBITDA amounted to EUR –21.2 million, EBIT to EUR –19.7 million and earnings after tax from discontinued operations to EUR –41.9 million (previous year: EUR –1.6 million, EUR –28.0 million and EUR –44.0 million respectively).\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Dividend policy and treasury shares\n\nThe dividend policy of the Semperit Group basically aims at a distribution of around 50% of earnings after taxes – assuming continued successful performance with no unusual circumstances.\n\nIn view of the positive earnings after taxes from continued operations – the relevant earnings and comparative figure for future business development – the Executive Board will propose a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share to the Annual General Meeting. A total of EUR 10.3 million should therefore be distributed. With a share price of EUR 14.16 at the end of 2023, this results in a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nA basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share plus an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share was distributed for the 2022 financial year following the fulfillment of the conditions precedent in connection with the (first) closing of the sale of the medical business. This corresponds to a total dividend yield of 22.7% in relation to the closing price of EUR 19.82 in 2022.\n\nSemperit AG Holding did not hold any treasury shares as of 31 December 2023, or 31 December 2022.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Assets and financial position\n\n### Balance sheet\n\nThe development of the balance sheet structure as of 31 December 2023, can be summarized as follows:\n\n| in EUR million                              | 31.12.2023 | Share | 31.12.2022 | Share | Change  |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------|------------|-------|---------|\n| Non-current assets                          | 597.7      | 64%   | 316.6      | 38%   | +88.8%  |\n| Current assets                              | 339.6      | 36%   | 338.4      | 40%   | +0.4%   |\n| Assets held for sale                        | 0.5        | 0%    | 187.9      | 22%   | -99.7%  |\n| ASSETS                                      | 937.9      | 100%  | 842.9      | 100%  | +11.3%  |\n| Equity¹                                     | 425.3      | 45%   | 519.1      | 62%   | -18.1%  |\n| Non-current provisions and<br>liabilities   | 346.6      | 37%   | 115.9      | 14%   | +199.2% |\n| Current provisions and liabilities          | 165.5      | 18%   | 161.0      | 19%   | +2.8%   |\n| Provisions and liabilities held for<br>sale | 0.4        | 0%    | 46.9       | 6%    | -99.1%  |\n| EQUITY AND LIABILITIES                      | 937.9      | 100%  | 842.9      | 100%  | +11.3%  |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Incl. non-controlling interests\n\nThe balance sheet as of 31 December 2023, is heavily influenced by the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group. Non-current assets increased by 88.8% to EUR 597.7 million, which was primarily driven by additions to property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use assets) in the amount of EUR 188.8 million and intangible assets in the amount of EUR 121.3 million. Of this amount, EUR 125.8 million and EUR 120.9 million respectively (including goodwill of EUR 49.4 million) was attributable to the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group. The remaining additions to property, plant and equipment totaled EUR 63.0 million, which primarily includes investments in the modernization of the Wimpassing site (EUR +12.1 million) and in the Czech Republic, in particular the expansion of hose production in Odry (DH5 project; EUR +22.9 million). This was contrasted by regular depreciation and amortization amounting to EUR 37.6 million.\n\nCurrent assets increased slightly by 0.4% or EUR 1.2 million to EUR 339.6 million compared to 31 December 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents by EUR 6.0 million to EUR 112.7 million and in other assets by EUR 12.5 million (mainly due to the Rico Group) to EUR 23.8 million was contrasted by the reduction in inventories by EUR 17.5 million to EUR 110.8 million and the reduction in trade receivables by EUR 2.8 million to EUR 86.1 million. The (first) closing for the sale of the medical business took place on 31 August 2023; the Group companies in discontinued operations were deconsolidated on this date, which led to a reduction in the \"Assets held for sale\" item by EUR 187.3 million to EUR 0.5 million.\n\nEquity primarily reflects the dividend payments made in May and September in the amount of EUR 92.6 million.\n\nIn addition to the effects of the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group, the increase in noncurrent liabilities and provisions is mainly due to an increase in liabilities to banks of EUR 181.2 million for the expansion investment in the Czech Republic (DH5) and the acquisition of the Rico Group. In addition, non-current other financial liabilities increased by a total of EUR 30.9 million to EUR 49.8 million as a result of the acquisition of the Rico Group, primarily due to its lease liabilities and the present value of the deferred purchase price of EUR 3.9 million.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent liabilities and provisions are EUR 4.5 million or 2.8% higher at EUR 165.5 million, which is partly due to the acquisition of the Rico Group.\n\n### Net Financial Debt\n\n| in EUR million                                     | 31.12.2023   | Change      | 31.12.2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan                        | 38.4         | -26.8%      | 52.5         |\n| Liabilities to banks                               | 189.4        | n/a         | 0.0          |\n| <b>Financial liabilities</b>                       | <b>227.8</b> | n/a         | <b>52.5</b>  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 112.7        | 5.7%        | 106.6        |\n| <b>Cash and cash equivalents</b>                   | <b>112.7</b> | <b>5.7%</b> | <b>106.6</b> |\n| Net Financial Debt (+) / Net Financial Surplus (-) | 115.2        | n/a         | -54.2        |\n\nThe Semperit Group had net financial debt of EUR 115.2 million as of 31 December 2023, as financial liabilities (EUR 227.8 million) exceeded cash and cash equivalents (EUR 112.7 million) (31 December 2022: net cash surplus of EUR 54.2 million). The leverage ratio as the quotient of net financial debt divided by EBITDA was 1.6x as of December 31 (previous year: –0.6x).\n\nNew bank financing with a volume of up to EUR 360 million was concluded with effect from 31 March 2023. A financing agreement for a total of EUR 250 million consists of a loan of up to EUR 150 million and a framework credit line of EUR 100 million. In this financing agreement, Semperit AG Holding has undertaken to comply with three ESG key figures, which are also part of the sustainability strategy. This financing is provided by a consortium of six Austrian and international banks and replaces an earlier framework credit line of EUR 75 million. In July 2023, the loan of EUR 150 million for the acquisition of the Rico Group was drawn down. Of this amount, EUR 40 million was repaid in December. The second financing agreement for EUR 110 million was concluded particularly for the expansion investment at the Odry site. Of this amount, EUR 33 million was drawn down in the reporting period.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Cash flow\n\nThe cash flow statement is prepared jointly for the continued and discontinued operations; no distinction is made between the cash flows of the individual business units. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the discontinued operation are disclosed in the note.\n\nThe development of the liquidity situation in the 2023 financial year can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Cash flow\n\n| in EUR million                                       | 31.12.2023 | Change | 31.12.2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|------------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                 | 66.2       | 43.2%  | 46.2       |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                 | -131.4     | n/a    | -46.2      |\n| Cash flows from financing activities                 | 20.5       | n/a    | -82.1      |\n| Net increase / decrease in cash and cash equivalents | -45.2      | -41.7% | -77.6      |\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, cash flow from operating activities developed positively despite the lower result, which was primarily due to a significant reduction in inventories and a decrease in receivables.\n\nAt EUR 55.6 million, cash expenditures in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the 2023 financial year were slightly above the prior-year level (previous year: EUR 54.5 million). The largest investments were made in the Czech Republic with EUR 23.5 million (previous year: EUR 6.2 million), Austria with EUR 14.6 million (previous year: EUR 15.8 million), Germany with EUR 3.7 million (previous year: EUR 3.8 million) and Poland with EUR 4.9 million (previous year: EUR 3.5 million). The comparative figure for the previous year included investments in Malaysia amounting to EUR 17.3 million.\n\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to EUR –131.4 million (previous year: EUR –46.2 million) and was influenced in particular by the major corporate transactions (sale of the medical business and acquisition of Rico) in the 2023 financial year.\n\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR 20.5 million (previous year: EUR –82.1 million) and included the cash receipts from financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 190.0 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 0). In addition, in particular the dividends to the shareholders of Semperit AG Holding totaling EUR 92.6 million (previous year: EUR 30.9 million), dividends to redeemable non-controlling interests in subsidiaries amounting to EUR 6.5 million (previous year: EUR 5.7 million), the repayment of current and non-current financial liabilities amounting to EUR 58.6 million (previous year: EUR 39.0 million) and the repayment of lease liabilities with a volume of EUR 4.4 million (previous year: EUR 3.4 million) were considered.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Free cash flow1\n\n| in EUR million                                                                                                                                                                          | 2023  | Change | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                                                                                                                    | 66.2  | 43.2%  | 46.2  |\n| Interest paid                                                                                                                                                                           | -7.5  | n/a    | -2.8  |\n| Interest received                                                                                                                                                                       | 2.8   | n/a    | 1.2   |\n| Cash investments for maintenance and small growth projects<br>(intangible assets and property, plant and equipment)                                                                     | -36.2 | -33.7% | -54.5 |\n| Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment<br>and from the repayment of financial investments, investment<br>grants received, and payments made for the acquisition of | 0.9   | -86.8% | 7.2   |\n| financial investments                                                                                                                                                                   |       |        |       |\n| Free cash flow before the sale of companies                                                                                                                                             | 26.3  | n/a    | -2.8  |\n| Proceeds from business disposals net of cash disposed of                                                                                                                                | 85.3  | n/a    | 0.0   |\n| Free cash flow after the sale of companies                                                                                                                                              | 111.5 | n/a    | -2.8  |\n\n<sup>1</sup> The calculation includes continued and discontinued operations.\n\nFree cash flow is the net cash flow adjusted for interest payments that is available for strategic growth investments, dividends and the repayment of debt.

As expected, the effects of the recession intensified throughout the year; this led to a significant decline in revenue – mainly due to a significant drop in volume – and earnings.\n- Demand for hydraulic and industrial hoses and incoming orders were also affected by high inventory levels and customers' ongoing destocking. Ordering behavior was restrained, also based on the customers' low market demand. Due to short delivery times, there was no pressure for customers to order well in advance.\n- Demand for elastomer and sealing profiles remained low as a result of the weak construction sector. The downward trend from 2022 thus continued to a lesser extent in the reporting year.\n- The lower order intake led to a persistently declining order book, particularly in the first half of 2023. The level finally stabilized, albeit at a low level as expected.\n- Adjustments to personnel capacities were initiated at an early stage and have largely already been implemented. In addition, further savings potential was identified as part of an overhead cost project, and implementation has begun. This relates to third-party costs and, above all, further personnel costs.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Division Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA)\n\n### Key figures Semperit Engineered Applications\n\n| in EUR million                                                       | 20231 | Change  | 20222 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                                              | 351.0 | 23.7%   | 283.8 |\n| EBITDA                                                               | 50.5  | 35.8%   | 37.2  |\n| EBITDA margin                                                        | 14.4% | +1.3 PP | 13.1% |\n| EBITDA adjusted                                                      | 56.9  | 75.2%   | 32.5  |\n| EBITDA margin adjusted                                               | 16.2% | +4.8 PP | 11.4% |\n| EBIT                                                                 | 33.2  | 18.4%   | 28.1  |\n| EBIT margin                                                          | 9.5%  | -0.4 PP | 9.9%  |\n| EBIT adjusted                                                        | 39.6  | 69.5%   | 23.4  |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                                                 | 11.3% | +3.1 PP | 8.2%  |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and<br>equipment3 | 240.0 | n/a     | 9.2   |\n\n1 Adjusted for the negative effects of the transaction costs for Rico (2023: EBITDA and EBIT impact: EUR –3.3 million) and for profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation of the Rico Group (2023: EBITDA and EBIT impact: EUR –3.0 million).\n\n2 Adjusted for the positive one-off effect of the net proceeds from the sale of real estate in France in the Belting business (2022: EBITDA and EBIT effect: EUR –4.7 million).\n\n3 Excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16\n\n- Business development in the SEA division benefited significantly from the continued good economic situation for mining products and, as a result, from the high demand for conveyor belts and higher sales prices. Higher sales and earnings were also generated in the Form business. In particular, the Mountain Applications business, which includes ski foils and cable car upper rings, and the handrail business developed positively despite the economic headwind. This also reflects the firsttime consolidation and the results of the last five months of the Rico Group, which has been part of the Semperit Group since August. The Rico Group's revenue contribution for the months of August to December 2023 totaled EUR 37.2 million. Rico's operating contribution to EBITDA for five months amounted to around EUR 7.6 million. However, the profits recognized in advance as part of the purchase price allocation of EUR 3.0 million and the transaction costs of EUR 3.3 million initially reduced this contribution to around EUR 1.2 million.\n- The good overall capacity utilization, the related higher operating leverage and a slightly higher average price level due to a more advantageous product mix led to an increase in margins.\n- Demand in the late-cycle business with conveyor belts (Belting) continued to be determined by the effects of the positive price trend for mining products and the resulting high demand for conveyor and transport belts in 2023. Order intake continued to develop very well and was only just below the high level of the comparable period 2022. As a result of the continuous processing of orders, the order backlog also declined slightly.\n- Overall, demand for the individual products in the Form business showed a mixed picture. The railroad business remained stable at a high level, as did Mountain Applications. Products in the construction industry and related areas such as piping, sanitary and household, on the other hand, recorded a decline. Overall, incoming orders were just below the previous year's level. Although sales volumes were down, the product mix was significantly higher in terms of margins.\n- Demand for the Rico Group's products also varied depending on the product group. While demand from the healthcare and food sectors was stable and strong and remained at a high level in the mobility sector, the areas assigned to construction showed significant declines in some cases.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Surgical Operations\n\n### Key figures Surgical Operations\n\n| in EUR million                                                    | 2023   | Change  | 20221  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Revenue                                                           | 42.1   | -23.3%  | 54.9   |\n| EBITDA                                                            | -6.1   | 88.2%   | -3.3   |\n| EBITDA margin                                                     | -14.6% | -8.6 PP | -6.0%  |\n| EBIT                                                              | -7.0   | -29.1%  | -9.9   |\n| EBIT margin                                                       | -16.6% | +1.4 PP | -18.0% |\n| EBIT adjusted                                                     | -7.0   | -72.7%  | -4.1   |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                                              | -16.6% | -9.2 PP | -7.4%  |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment2 | 1.4    | -42.9%  | 2.5    |\n\n1 Adjusted for the negative one-off effect of the net impairment of Surgical Operations (2022: EBIT effect: EUR –5.8 million). 2 Excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16\n\nFollowing the first closing of the sale of the medical business at the end of August 2023 (see Note 2), only the time-limited contract production agreed with the buyer (production and packaging of surgical gloves) will be reported in Surgical Operations.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Sustainability\n\nThe Semperit Group published its seventh independent Sustainability Report for the 2023 financial year. The document provides an overview of the various activities, developments and key figures in the context of the material topics and is divided into the areas of environment & climate protection, social and governance (Environment, Social, Governance – ESG). In addition to topics such as energy, greenhouse gas emissions, use of materials, health & safety and compliance & anti-corruption, it contains general information on the anchoring of sustainability in the Group and other climate-related information in accordance with the TCFD – Task force on climate-related financial disclosures. The Sustainability Report 2023 and the reports from previous years can be accessed online on the Semperit website.\n\n### Employees\n\nAt 4,576 employees (FTE, full-time equivalent), the headcount for continued operations as of 31 December 2023 was above the level as of 31. December 2022 (4,506). The year-on-year increase is due to the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group, while the reduction in headcount as part of the cost-cutting program had an opposite effect. The average number of employees for the year was 4,637 (average 2022: 4,300).\n\n### Research and development\n\nThe Research & Development (R&D) team of the Semperit Group is continuously working on the development of innovative materials and products as well as on the improvement of manufacturing processes. The innovation management system used across the Group is the core of all R&D activities, covering the systematic identification of potential, the selection of promising ideas, risk analysis with regard to the effects of products on people and the planet, and successful project management. In the 2023 financial year, R&D expenditure in continued operations (for personnel and other expenses) amounted to around EUR 18.0 million (previous year: EUR 17.7 million) and therefore around 2.5% of revenue (previous year: 2.3%).\n\nThe R&D team is divided into a central and several decentralized areas. The central area, which is working in the R&D Centre in Wimpassing, deals with fundamental projects in addition to material and central process development as well as the management of Group-wide activities. Decentralized teams in the business units work on product and process optimization – often in close cooperation with customers. In addition to the headquarters in Wimpassing, Semperit operates seven further research sites. Most production sites have by onsite laboratories, which carry out the daily quality assurance processes and are also involved in the R&D activities. In addition to integrated and structured processes, communication between the various departments and with important stakeholders, such as customers and university research institutes, is paramount.\n\n### Fields of activity in R&D\n\nIn addition to the optimization of production processes, the further and new development of products is at the heart of research and development work. The topic of resource and energy efficiency was also a focus in 2023. In addition to intensive work on the product carbon footprint model (CO2 footprint), cross-departmental workshops were initiated to develop ideas for more effective and efficient use of resources and to check their feasibility. The most promising approaches are further \n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\ndeveloped and implemented by the relevant departments. The Semperit Group is now able to calculate a carbon footprint for most of its products.\n\nThe Semperit Group relies on close cooperation with customers in research and development in order to be able to respond to their wishes and requirements in the best possible and most timely manner. In addition, the company is continuously working on expanding its product portfolio, for example with regard to environmental friendliness. Ecological advantages can include, for example, low material consumption during production and therefore lower weight in use and consequently a reduction in energy consumption during operation.\n\nThe Group is also driving developments in the area of bio-based elastomers. In this regard, the use of traditional natural rubber should be highlighted, which was expanded in 2023, especially in conveyor belts, hoses and molded products, and synthetically produced bio-based rubber as a substitute for the petroleum-based raw material. Products that contain up to 50% more ecologically sustainable raw materials have been developed, especially in the Form business.\n\nAmong other things, Semperit focuses on avoiding and replacing ecologically questionable or harmful additives. Since 2020, two Semperit products from the sealing profiles area have been evaluated according to the criteria of the material health category in the Cradle to Cradle Certified™ product standard and have been awarded a gold level material health certificate by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. Pollutant-free materials in residential and house construction are important topics that is being continuously worked on.\n\nHowever, it is not only the safety and health safety of the products that play a role in their use; negative ecological effects during the use phase can also be reduced. These are not serious in the case of Semperit products because, unlike car tires, there is no significant abrasion and thus no problematic release of microplastics. Nevertheless, the aim is to use certain material properties, such as low weight, low rolling resistance or high strength, to contribute to more efficient operation or a longer service life and thus to a lower environmental impact during the use phase of the products. The \"Silent Pad\", for example, which was developed for railroad superstructures, contributes to a reduction in noise emissions of around 3 dB when driving over the sleepers supported by it, thus improving the quality of life of local residents. Another best-practice example from railroad superstructures is an angled polyamide guide plate for fastening the sleeper to the rail. Material consumption was reduced by 25% while maintaining the same functionality.\n\n### Corporate innovation\n\nIn addition to traditional research and development work, Semperit places a special focus on the Group-wide innovation program. End-to-end transparency from the creation of an idea through its development to its market launch is highly relevant for effectively evaluating and managing the entire portfolio of ideas and projects. In order to achieve this goal, the foundations have been laid for the uniform measurement of the effectiveness of the innovation program. This includes the introduction of innovation KPIs and Group-wide targets, the measurement of which was continued in 2023.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Additional information\n\n### Corporate governance\n\nThe corporate governance report can be found online at www.semperitgroup.com/en/ir, under the Corporate Governance menu. The direct link is:\n\nwww.semperitgroup.com/en/ir/corporate-governance/corporate-governance-reports.\n\n### Disclosures pursuant to Section 243a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB)\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the share capital of Semperit AG Holding (SAG) amounted to EUR 21,358,996.53 and consisted of 20,573,434 no-par-value ordinary shares, each carrying equal rights in every respect.\n\nThere are no restrictions with regard to voting rights or the transfer of shares that go beyond the general provisions contained in the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. No shares were issued entitling the owners to special control rights.\n\nB&C KB Holding GmbH directly owned 50% of the shares in SAG as of 31 December 2023, and is the direct majority shareholder of SAG. The private foundation B&C Privatstiftung is the highest controlling legal entity. B&C Holding Österreich GmbH is the indirect majority shareholder which draws up and publishes consolidated financial statements in which the Semperit Group is consolidated. Employees who own shares are entitled to exercise their right to vote at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Executive Board consists of up to five people. Members of the Executive Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a maximum period of five years. Reappointments, for a maximum of five years, are permissible.\n\nThe following applies with respect to the appointment and revocation of Supervisory Board members pursuant to the Articles of Association: Unless a shorter term of office is specified, Supervisory Board members are elected until the end of the Annual General Meeting resolving upon the ratification of the actions of the Executive and Supervisory Boards for the fourth year after the election, not including the financial year in which the election took place. However, at least two members of the Supervisory Board shall resign each year at the end of the Ordinary Annual General Meeting. Members of the Supervisory Board who have resigned from the Supervisory Board since the last Annual General Meeting or have resigned from office with effect from the end of the respective Annual General Meeting shall be counted towards this figure.\n\nOtherwise, the members having to resign are determined as follows: First of all, members have to leave if their term of office has ended. If this does not apply to at least as many members required for two members to be determined, including other members who have left since the last Annual General Meeting or have resigned from office at the end of the respective Annual General Meeting, the members who have been in office for the longest will have to resign. In the event that the number of members eligible for departure is greater than required, the members will draw lots to decide who leaves. This procedure is also used to decide which members will depart if a decision cannot be made based on the above rules. The resigning members are immediately eligible for re-election.\n\nIf an elected member of the Supervisory Board retires from the Supervisory Board during their term of office, a substitute election shall only be held immediately if the number of elected Supervisory Board members falls below three. Substitute elections shall be held for the remaining term of office of the retiring Supervisory Board member unless the Annual General Meeting decides otherwise at the time of election. If a member is elected to the Supervisory Board by an Extraordinary Annual General Meeting, the first year in office is considered to be completed upon the close of the next Ordinary Annual General Meeting.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board may resign from office by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board without having to provide reasons, subject to a four-week period of notice.\n\nResolutions of the Annual General Meeting require a simple majority of the votes cast, unless mandatory law requires a larger majority. In cases where capital majority is required, it shall pass resolutions by a simple majority of the share capital represented at the passing of the resolution, unless mandatory law requires a larger capital majority.\n\nThe Executive Board was authorized by the Ordinary Annual General Meeting on April 25, 2023, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the nominal capital of the company within five years from the registration of the amendment to the Articles of Association with the commercial register – if necessary in several tranches – by up to EUR 10,679,497.23 by way of issuing up to 10,286,716 new no-par-value shares in bearer or registered form against cash and/or payment in kind and to determine the share type, the issue price, and the terms and conditions of the issue. The Executive Board was also authorized to issue convertible bonds with agreement from the Supervisory Board. This may be linked to a right of conversion or purchase or a mandatory conversion or purchase of up to 10,286,716 no-par-value shares in SAG. The share capital is conditionally increased according to Section 159 (2) (1) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act by up to EUR 10,679,497.23 by issuing up to 10,286,716 new no-par-value bearer shares.\n\nThe Ordinary Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2022 authorized the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to repurchase and, if applicable, retire own shares up to the legally permitted maximum of 10% of the share capital for a period of 30 months from the adoption of the resolution in the Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 65 (1) (8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. At the same Annual General Meeting, the Executive Board was also authorized – pursuant to Section 65 (1bb) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and with agreement from the Supervisory Board – to decide on a different type of sale than via the stock exchange or through a public offering, and to decide on a possible exclusion of the repurchase option (purchase right) on the part of shareholders. There is no share buyback program in place at present and SAG does not hold any treasury shares.\n\nCertain financing agreements contain contractual clauses regarding a change of control in the event of takeovers pursuant to Section 243a (1) (8) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\nThere are no compensation agreements pursuant to Section 243a (1) (9) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risk management\n\n### Basic principles of risk management (Enterprise Risk Management)\n\nThe Semperit Group's risk policy supports the efforts to achieve competitive advantages, thereby increasing the Semperit Group's enterprise value in the long term. Risk management serves to create robust operational processes. In addition to fulfilling legal requirements (compliance), the strategic focus is on the early identification of negative developments in the strategic, operational, market and financial areas that could be detrimental to the success of the Semperit Group. An essential integrative component here comprises environment, social and governance (ESG) topics as well as areas for securing the supply chains and ensuring on-time deliveries. The chosen systematic risk management process is also intended to increase risk awareness. The resulting findings are incorporated into strategic corporate development and daily operational work.\n\nThe Semperit Group manages risks by avoiding, reducing or transferring them, or creates a framework for the company to accept and thus bear risks. The Group-wide risk management is an integral component of planning and implementing the business strategy and serves as a sparring partner for the ongoing evaluation of target achievement. The risk policy is defined by the Executive Board. In accordance with the organization and the accountability structure, all Semperit companies are obliged to follow and implement the defined risk management process. Enterprise Risk Management is organizationally part of the \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department.\n\n### The enterprise risk management process\n\nThe Semperit Group uses coordinated internal control and risk management systems for early identifying and reducing material risks and negative deviations representing risks to the company as a going concern. These systems are based on Group-wide processes that serve to assess potential risks as early as possible before major business decisions are made. The internal reporting system facilitates more thorough monitoring of such risks in the course of business.\n\nThe Semperit Group's risk management is based on a comprehensive enterprise risk management approach (ERM approach) that is integrated into the business organization. The ERM approach is based on the globally recognized conceptual framework drafted by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), the \"Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework\". The ERM process aims at the early identification, assessment and control of risks, which could have a significant influence on the achievement of the Group's strategic, operational, financial, and social goals as well as goals related to governance and compliance, health, occupational safety and the environment (HSEQ and ESG).\n\nRisks are identified and evaluated along a structured process combining elements of both the bottom-up and top-down approaches. As part of the ERM approach, the reporting period for risk assessment is at least one year and – in accordance with medium-term planning – up to five years. ESG-relevant risks can have a deviating, longer observation period. With regard to climate risks in particular, assumptions are considered in decades and up to 80 years into the future in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe ERM is based on a net principle, according to which only risks remaining after the implementation of existing measures to mitigate or transfer risks are addressed. If potential negative deviations have already been accounted for in the consolidated financial statements, in the budget or in medium-term planning, they are no longer shown as risks. The progress made in implementing riskreducing measures is monitored on a regular basis and is broken down to the individual Group companies in the internal risk reporting.\n\nThe \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department is responsible for the central coordination, moderation and monitoring of the structured risk management process for the entire Semperit \n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nGroup. Relevant risks are prioritized from different perspectives and, in a further step, assessed with regard to their potential impact and their probability of occurrence. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supported by (remote) workshops with the management of the respective Semperit Group companies. This bottom-up element ensures that potential new risks are brought up for discussion at the management level and incorporated into the reporting, if relevant. These risks are coordinated with the business management (top-down). Individual reporting takes place immediately after the respective risk update in the respective Group businesses. At least once a year, a comprehensive risk reporting of the individual risks including aggregation is made at Group level, and a quarterly progress report on current developments, changes and additions to the risk portfolio is submitted to the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board. The regular reporting process is supplemented by an ad hoc reporting process to draw attention to critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nIntegrated risk management must also identify, assess and manage internal and external trends and effects in the field of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance). In order to address current and future issues, the Semperit Group conducts an annual ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Risk & Opportunity Assessment. In a comprehensive process that takes place in parallel with the traditional risk process, the ESG and Group Risk Management & Assurance departments identify and evaluate the main risks. This process will be integrated into the general risk assessment from the 2024 financial year onwards.\n\nIn addition to the assessment of risks with regard to their impact on the planned EBITDA figure, possible effects on liquidity have also been taken into account on the basis of a cash flow analysis since the 2023 financial year. This approach is used to assess the risk-bearing capacity, i.e., the maximum level of risk that the company can bear without jeopardizing its continued existence. Following the acquisition of the Rico Group as of 31 July 2023, the implementation of the risk management system also began there; it had not yet been fully integrated by the end of the 2023 financial year.\n\n### Organization of risk management and responsibilities\n\nTo monitor the ERM process and to further drive the integration and standardization of existing control activities in accordance with legal and operational requirements, risks, changes and developments in the risk management process are discussed in the Executive Board, Audit Committee and Supervisory Board meetings on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Group Risk Management & Assurance department is supported in the process by the individual Group companies and central functions. An update on the progress of measures is provided by the persons responsible for risks or measures. Insurable risks are covered by insurance policies as far as economically reasonable (see also \"Insurable risks\").\n\nThe legal framework and principles relevant to risk management are set forth in the Risk Management Guideline.\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. audited and confirmed the functionality of the Semperit Group's risk management system for the 2023 financial year in the 2024 reporting year in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risk report\n\nAs an internationally active corporate group, the Semperit Group is continuously confronted with new challenges posed by pronounced regional differences in global economic development. The countries in which the Semperit Group operates differ in terms of economic conditions as well as political, constitutional and social development. The success of the two divisions Semperit Industrial Applications and Semperit Engineered Applications and the five operating business units depends on the overall economic situation to varying degrees due to their strategic orientation.\n\nThe slowdown in macroeconomic development, consistently high inflation rates and the limited ability to pass on the associated additional costs to customers led to negative financial effects overall in the 2023 financial year. Political tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, availability (sourcing) as well as inflationary pressure and the price development of raw materials and energy also characterized the 2023 financial year. These uncertainties again posed challenges for the Semperit Group. However, thanks to its global presence and the different market dynamics of the five business units, the Semperit Group was able to address the risk accordingly.\n\nAt the time this management report was prepared, no risks were identified in connection with future developments that could threaten the continued existence of the Semperit Group either in isolation or jointly. Adequate insurance has been taken out for specific liability risks and damages when reasonable and cost effective. Selected individual risks that could have a significant negative effect on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group are discussed below. In addition to the risks listed here, further risks possibly exist, including strategic, operational, financial, and social risks, governance- and compliance-related risks, and health, safety, and environmental risks (HSEQ and ESG) as well as other internal and external risks that are currently unknown to the Semperit Group or which it is presently not aware of. If one or more known or unknown risks occur, this may have significant adverse effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation as well as the reputation of the Semperit Group.\n\n### Strategic risks\n\n### Transformation, governance and sustainability risks\n\nThe structure of the Semperit Group was significantly influenced by the first and major closing of the sale of the medical business and the acquisition of the Rico Group in 2023. The transformation into an industrial rubber and elastomers specialist was thus implemented. The definition of the refined new strategy and the adjustment of the organizational structure to this strategic realignment were accompanied by the risk management team identifying opportunities and risks. In order to perform management and control tasks, projects to optimize information flows were driven forward and processes were implemented, particularly in the areas of finance and IT. The risks relating to the implementation of transformation and governance measures, such as a longer implementation period, higher costs or a lower positive effect than originally estimated, were incorporated into the risk management system.\n\nFurthermore, the Semperit Group has committed itself to complying with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and achieving sustainability targets. Deviations from these goals can result in risks such as loss of reputation or higher interest rates.\n\nThe Semperit Group sees several opportunities in the introduction of the new divisional structure, which is based on the two main business models. These include a reduction in complexity and an increase in efficiency, which can lead to faster decisions, lower costs and an overall more effective way of working. Furthermore, the flexible organizational structure can strengthen the Semperit Group's innovative capability.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risks from technology development\n\nInnovative and disruptive technologies as well as regulations for industrial chemicals can have a significant impact on the Semperit Group's business areas and products. New technologies can lead to the displacement or replacement of Semperit products (e.g., the use of direct extrusion for window seals). With respect to environmental requirements, the significance of low-carbon products and circular economy will continue to increase. In addition, chemicals used by the Semperit Group could be added to the list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) defined under the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). It is updated twice a year and must be taken into account in the selection of raw materials and in product development and production.\n\nIn order to ensure its competitiveness, the Semperit Group is continuously working on the development of innovative materials and products as well as on the improvement of manufacturing processes. Topics such as resource and energy efficiency, consideration of the life cycle perspective as well as health and environmental compatibility in product application are becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe innovation projects initiated in connection with the utilization of new raw materials, the introduction of new products and technologies can be associated with the investment of significant financial resources and cannot always be successful. If capital expenditures do not lead to the expected success or are not met with the expected market acceptance, it could lead to a negative influence on the financial performance. Existing patents and other intellectual property rights of the Semperit Group cannot completely prevent competitors from developing and selling similar products. Furthermore, not all trade secrets are patentable. In order to ensure appropriate secrecy, confidentiality agreements are agreed in service contracts or non-competition clauses.\n\n### Risks relating to customer needs and market trends\n\nThe competitiveness of the Semperit Group is based on the ability to recognize market trends in good time and the flexibility to adapt products, production and services to them in a timely manner. For example, EPDM (ethylene propylene diene rubber) seals in PVC windows are being replaced by alternative products such as thermoplastic elastomers. If market trends and potential substitute products are not recognized in time and no countermeasures are taken, this could have a major adverse effect on the earnings situation of the Semperit Group. In order to profitably exploit market trends with the development of new or sustainable products, Semperit works closely with customers and supports scientific research – with a focus on innovative materials, technologies and products. The aim of the research activities is to secure and further strengthen the market position of the Semperit Group in the long term and at the same time to become more attractive for sustainable investments, for example through the successive improvement of ESG rating results.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Operational risks\n\n### Investment and divestment risks\n\nIn the case of investments and divestments, the opportunities arising from corporate development and sustainable transformation are contrasted by numerous risks. These include transaction risks (market, liquidity, creditworthiness, inflation, currency, operational, regulatory, social and environmental risks, political and geopolitical risks as well as industry and company risks), the risk of cost remanence, misjudgments in the transaction process and legacy risks of all kinds. The mentioned risks were taken into account in the investment (acquisition of the Rico Group, expansion of the Odry site to include DH5 hose production, expansion of the Rico Group site in Thalheim) and divestment projects (sale of the medical business) by implementing each of them as separate projects, taking into account modern management disciplines (project management including risk management) and with external support. The risks arising from transaction processes were countered by structuring the contractually agreed guarantees and indemnities accordingly and by taking out W&I insurance. Longer-term risks, above all financial risks (liquidity and interest), were transferred to the risk management system. Furthermore, delays in growth projects can lead to strategic risks. Company acquisitions may result in the recognition of goodwill, which reflects intangible assets that cannot be recognized in the balance sheet, expected synergies and positive future prospects of an acquired company. Such goodwill must be tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is only recoverable if the original expectations can be realized or even exceeded. Otherwise, impairment losses in the form of extraordinary depreciation would result. Such an impairment risk naturally increases with the amount of goodwill and its share of Group equity. In order to confirm the recoverability of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the Rico Group amounting to EUR 49.4 million, the management determined the recoverable amount of this business as at 30 September 2023. The recoverable amount was calculated as the value in use. The increased forecasting uncertainty caused by the economic slowdown and geopolitical crises was countered by considering alternative planning scenarios. Rico's products are used in particular in the automotive and medical technology industries as well as in the consumer and household goods industries.\n\nThe Semperit Group sees the acquisition of companies with complementary products or services as an opportunity to diversify its offering, expand its range of services and realize synergies. By acquiring the Rico Group or another company with advanced technologies and know-how, particularly in the area of production automation, the Semperit Group can strengthen its technological lead and accelerate innovation.\n\n### Value chain risks\n\nThe value chain of the Semperit Group covers all stages from research and development, through supply chain management and production to marketing and sales of products. In particular in raw material and energy supply, bottlenecks may arise along the value chain; likewise, production disruptions, scrap, quality defects in products/packaging/storage/ delivery may occur and thus lead to additional costs and delivery bottlenecks and/or delays. Moreover, this may result in reputational damage and loss of orders as well as potential product liability, occupational safety, compliance and environmental risks, which may have a negative effect on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe earnings position of the Semperit Group depends on the reliable and effective management of the supply chain for raw materials and mixes as well as on ensuring the appropriate cost-optimized logistics. Capacity limitations and supply shortages – also in the face of global disruptions in the transport chains – could lead to delays and additional costs as well as an increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to longer freight times. The most recent examples of this development are the rebel attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and the water shortage in the Panama Canal.\n\nPrice increases for raw materials, components, personnel costs and energy, for example due to market bottlenecks, could also have a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group. This also applies to delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a result of (economic, geopolitical, pandemic or climate-related) disasters, especially if it is not possible to develop alternative sources of supply in different countries or regions.\n\nActive management of the supplier portfolio and globally oriented and coordinated Group-wide purchasing and supply chain management counteract these risks.\n\n### Procurement risks\n\nThe Semperit Group purchases large amounts of raw materials such as rubber (natural and synthetic rubber), chemicals, fillers and both textile and steel reinforcing materials as well as energy (gas, electricity) for manufacturing its products. These raw materials can be subject to significant price volatility. If price increases, for example for raw materials, cannot be passed on to customers, or can only partially be passed on or with delay, this will lead to a negative impact on earnings. There are also monopolistic and oligopolistic supply situations for some raw material and chemical suppliers as well as energy and water suppliers, which means that the Semperit Group has only limited options for negotiations. Geopolitical unrest can significantly increase this risk.\n\nA supply shortage of individual raw materials or finished products, restrictions on imports, limitations due to geopolitical tensions or international restrictions and sanctions or the loss of an important supplier can lead to a production loss and a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\nThe management of appropriate safety stocks, multiple sourcing and reducing dependence on individual suppliers, the conclusion of long-term contracts and price escalation clauses with suppliers and the continuous monitoring of their sustainability performance counteract these risks.\n\n### Production and utilization risks\n\nThe Semperit machine park includes facilities which are essential for production and for which there are no adequate replacements. A long-term failure of one of these machines would lead to a (partial) loss of production and negative effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, further investments were made in the replacement of equipment that had been in use for a longer period and in the expansion of production facilities. In addition, the risk that production facilities may break down is counteracted by regular inspections, including preventive maintenance and servicing. As far as possible, such risks are optimized through technical preventive measures and insurance in an economically reasonable dimension.\n\nQuality problems may arise in Semperit products, which are caused by low-quality raw materials or result from the development or production of these products. Despite all efforts, the risk of operational downtimes, accidents, underutilization or overloading of production sites as well as limited availability of space for production, room to move and storage cannot be completely ruled out. Such risks may lead to delayed deliveries and, subsequently, to a potential loss of customers, with possible negative effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with the replacement of older production facilities, the Semperit Group sees opportunities in increasing the degree of automation of the production process and the associated efficiency gains.\n\n### Risks related to information technology (IT), cyber-attacks, and data protection\n\nThe majority of production and control systems as well as services are dependent on a functioning and error-free IT/OT (information technology and operation technology) landscape. The failure of essential servers and production scheduling units as well as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, non-availability, and unauthorized access to IT networks (cyber-crime) may lead to an irrecoverable loss of production volumes, quality impairment as well as delivery delays and loss of orders and thus be detrimental for the Semperit Group. Like other multi-national companies, the Semperit Group is also subject to the risk of cyber-attacks. In addition, the risk of cybercrime could continue to increase as a result of international conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and potentially result in the disclosure, falsification, espionage or loss of information, abuses of information systems or product faults, production losses and supply shortages. This would have negative effects on the reputation and competitiveness as well as the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group. The company continuously invests in resources for the further development of training measures and projects that serve to increase cyber security.\n\nAdditional risks are posed by IT/OT systems developed in-house and a wide variety of different systems in use requiring a large number of manual interventions or depending on specific persons, which could have a negative effect on data quality and processes. Ensuring the traceability of produced goods may not be possible due to faulty and non-existent systems. This risk is countered with strategic projects to standardize IT/OT processes and ERP systems.\n\nFraud and cyber-attacks (e.g., email fraud, fake president fraud, etc.) generally represent a major risk for the company, which is also countered with ongoing Group-wide awareness training as part of the \"Sempercyber\" project, ICS training (internal control system training) and projects in the area of payment security. The non-detection of such attacks or the failure of internal control systems cannot be completely ruled out and could therefore contribute to a deterioration of the business, financial position, financial performance, and profit situation.\n\nHandling sensitive/confidential data inappropriately or not in compliance with legal requirements (particularly with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR) may also represent a risk. A data protection organization has been set up based on the Group-wide data protection guidelines, and regular training courses are held.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Personnel risks\n\nThe Semperit Group's business performance will be largely determined by the recruitment of adequately qualified professional and managerial staff at the individual locations, their integration, further development, and long-term retention. Risks arising from the departure of key personnel should be countered by training internal successors in due time. The orientation of the Semperit Group with regard to social aspects such as diversity, inclusion and attractive work is becoming increasingly important. This applies to existing and potential staff and will be successively expanded through appropriate additional benefits and activities to increase employer attractiveness. Should this not be possible, it may lead to a risk of a deterioration of the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\nLabor shortages or restrictions on the admission of guest workers or outsourcing, state minimum wage regimes, strikes or outflow of know-how may lead to an impairment of production and to limitations in other business areas, thus also burdening productivity and the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation. The risk of a staff shortage is countered with substitutions, flexibilization, and preventive measures using shift models and remote working.\n\n### Financial risks\n\nAs an internationally active company, the Semperit Group is exposed to financial risks, which can have an impact in particular in the areas of capital, liquidity and financing risks, foreign currency and interest rate risks, as well as in the default risks of customers and banks. As required by IFRS 7.31, the financial risks and their management are described in detail in the notes under chapter 11.\n\n### Capital, liquidity and financial risks (capital management)\n\nCapital risk is the risk of capital tied in investments. Liquidity risk (also known as refinancing risk) refers to the risk of being unable to raise the necessary cash for possible payments or only at increased refinancing costs. Financing risk refers to the risk that financing instruments are not available or not available to the required extent and thus threaten to cause payment difficulties or even insolvency.\n\nMarket risks to which the Semperit Group is exposed include political and economic developments that negatively influence the financial markets all over the world. These may be, for example, more restrictive regulations for the finance sector, monetary policy of central banks or a limited availability of financial resources, including due to the consideration of sustainability aspects, e.g., in connection with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Changes in the credit ranking and limitations of the legal capacity of banks and other funders, changes in interest rates or restrictions on the use of financial instruments are risks, which may affect the company's scope of action regarding the taking up of financing operations or which impair the financing costs and deposit conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the Semperit Group is subject to corporate risks in capital management. For example, a deterioration of its own creditworthiness may lead to higher expenses for borrowings, or no further financing granted by creditors. An increase in credit risk premiums may also result in a negative change of the market values of financial assets due to uncertainty and risk aversion on the financial markets.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Foreign currency risks\n\nForeign currency risks can generally be divided in transaction and translation risks. Due to international trade relations and existing subsidiaries all over the world, the Semperit Group is exposed to both risks. Furthermore, in some countries there are capital controls that limit the Semperit Group in its freedom of action. Some national banks, for example, have restrictions on trade in currencies and hedging instruments.\n\n### Interest rate risks\n\nInterest rate risks arise from the change in interest rates, both for variable and fixed interest financing, in the form of interest change risks or cash value risks. The external financing of the Semperit Group exists primarily at the level of Semperit AG Holding. Since 2023, there has also been local financing at the Czech subsidiary Semperflex Optimit s.r.o. and within the Rico Group, which was newly acquired in the 2023 financial year. The majority of this financing has a variable interest rate, while a small portion has a fixed interest rate. According to the latest forecast, yield curves have already peaked, and interest rates are expected to fall in the near future.\n\n### Default risks of customers and banks\n\nThe Semperit Group is exposed to the risk of loss of orders or receivables on the part of customers. If the credit rating of Semperit customers deteriorates, their default risk increases. Credit risks and the risk of payment default are managed through standardized credit checks, defined credit limits and credit insurance. The default of a key business partner could have a negative impact on the results and the liquidity of the Semperit Group. This is particularly relevant for the Rico Group, as it has not yet been integrated into the Semperit Group's credit insurance program.\n\nIn addition, there are default risks in relation to the credit balances that the Semperit Group holds with banks. Although the risk of bankruptcy of individual banks or of another banking and/or financial market crisis tends to be low for the Semperit Group's partners, it would be associated with considerable potential effects. In the event of such a default, the Semperit Group may not be able to access this liquidity or credit lines or may only be able to do so partially or with a delay.\n\n### Tax risks\n\nThe group companies of the Semperit Group are subject to local tax legislation in the respective countries and have to pay income taxes as well as other (local) taxes and fees. Changes in tax legislation and regulations in these jurisdictions could lead to higher tax expenses. The constant change and, in some cases, tightening of tax regulations increases the demands on tax compliance to comply with and monitor these regulations. Inadequate controls in business processes or lack of documentation can lead to the violation of regulations in national and international tax law and result in negative findings in tax audits.\n\nUnused tax loss carryforwards could also be subject to tax audits and be questioned in part. The Semperit Group and its local companies are subject to regular tax audits by financial authorities which may entail negative findings.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Compliance risks\n\nThe constant tightening of international codes of conduct and laws increases the requirements for compliance and monitoring of these regulations. Inadequate controls in business processes or insufficient documentation can lead to the violation of applicable rules and jeopardize the company's reputation and economic success through compliance violations. Among other things, the Semperit Group counters this risk with a Group-wide Code of Conduct and continuous training for all employees worldwide in order to further increase awareness of non-compliant actions. The implemented whistle-blowing system also makes an important contribution by pointing out concerns and potential abuses regarding unethical or illegal behavior.\n\n### Regulatory risks and potential sanctions\n\nThe Semperit Group had or has business activities with customers and suppliers, which are subject to export and import control regulations or other forms of trade restrictions (for example through the USA and the EU). New or extended sanctions could lead to restrictions of the raw material supply and the existing business activities in these countries, or indirectly in other countries. In addition, the Semperit Group could be subject to claims or other measures by customers due to the termination of their business in countries, which are subject to sanctions.\n\nFor business activities in emerging countries, there are risks such as unrest, health risks, cultural differences, for example regarding employment relationships and business practices, volatility of the gross domestic product, economic and governmental instability and legal uncertainty, possible nationalization of private assets as well as imposition of currency restrictions and stricter environmental requirements.\n\n### Risks arising from cartel and corruption allegations\n\nProceedings against the Semperit Group regarding corruption and cartel allegations as well as due to other violations of laws could lead to monetary fines under criminal or civil law as well as to penalties, sanctions, court orders regarding future behavior, disgorgement of profits, to the exclusion from directly or indirectly participating in certain business transactions, to the loss of trade licenses or other restrictions and legal consequences. Part of the Semperit Group's business activities are conducted with state-owned companies. Investigations into corruption or cartel allegations or allegations regarding other legal violations could have a long-term impact on the Semperit Group's business, including even an exclusion from public and private-sector orders. Moreover, such investigations could also lead to the cancellation of existing contracts and loss of orders and customers, and proceedings against the Semperit Group could be initiated.\n\nDevelopments in ongoing or potential future investigations, such as the reaction to requests by the authorities and cooperation with the authorities, could distract the attention and resources of the management from other business matters.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risks related to legal proceedings\n\nThe Semperit Group is, and will be in the future, confronted with different legal disputes and proceedings as part of its ordinary business activities. As a consequence of such litigation, the payments of damages, punitive damages, meeting other claims as well as criminal or civil sanctions, fines or disgorgements may be imposed on the Group. In addition, this may in individual cases result in the formal or informal exclusion from tendering procedures, or withdrawal or loss of business licenses or permits. Moreover, further proceedings may be initiated, and existing proceedings could be extended. Asserted claims from litigation are generally subject to interest payments.\n\nIn some of these legal disputes, negative decisions can be made against the Semperit Group, which may have significant effects on the business, financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the company.\n\nThe Asian markets are of major importance for the Semperit Group. These legal systems there are subject to regular changes, which could have negative effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\n### Occupational safety, health, and environmental risks (HSEQ)\n\nThe safety and health of employees are focal points of the corporate strategy with the aim of ensuring the protection of employees, further raising awareness of hazardous situations and continuously improving occupational safety.\n\nPresent or future occupational safety-related, health-related, and environmental or other state regulations, or changes of such regulations, could require adjustments of the operating activities of the Semperit Group and lead to a significant increase in operating costs. Moreover, there are risks regarding a possible occupational safety-related, environmental, and health-related incident, also when handling hazardous substances, as well as non-compliance with environmental, health- or occupational safety-related regulations, which could subsequently lead to severe accidents, staff absences, reputation loss and legal consequences. Environmental damage could result in losses for the Semperit Group which exceed the insured amount or are not covered by insurance. Such losses could have a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation.\n\n### Compliance risks with respect to corporate social responsibility (ESG)\n\nDue to existing local and international requirements as well as regulations in the area of environment, social and governance (ESG), risks that are not sufficiently known at the current time may arise. These can be based on legal requirements in the respective countries, but also on international requirements and, in addition to burdens on the business, financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the company, can also lead to reputational damage and loss of customers. A detailed description of ESG and climate change-related risks and opportunities can be found in the Sustainability Report of the Semperit Group (see www.semperitgroup.com/company/sustainability). It includes, for example, risks regarding the impact of climate change, the so-called transition effects on technologies, markets and regulations as well as rising energy costs and additional costs due to decarbonization efforts.\n\nTo counter these risks, the Semperit Group regularly undergoes external audits, for example those of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). In addition, the Semperit Group is a member of EcoVadis in order to be assessed with regard to its own performance in the fields of the environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement, and to subsequently improve further. Furthermore, since 2021 the Semperit Group has been a member of \"Together for Sustainability\" (TfS), an initiative of leading chemical companies with the goal of ensuring and successively improving sustainability along the supply chain and thus the environmental and social standards of the relevant suppliers.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Insurable risks\n\nAlthough the Semperit Group has concluded global insurance programs to cover the risks relevant to its business, for example with regard to fire, natural hazards and natural disasters, there is no guarantee that possible losses will be fully covered by these insurance policies, that the insurance companies will be liable for damages, or that the insurance coverage will be sufficient. In order to counteract this loss potential, the Semperit Group has taken further precautions in the form of additional insurance coverage, for example with regard to so-called earthquake or flood layers, which in some cases doubles coverage in addition to other existing insurance policies. In addition, critical business processes with a high potential threat are regularly examined as part of risk assessments and business continuity management, and preventive strategies and measures are developed to ensure that the company can continue to operate in the event of an emergency. The implementation of these measures is monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn this context, specific effects of climate change were also identified based on a climate risk analysis carried out in 2023 and included in the catalogue. This analysis identified immediate physical risks, such as acute events (storms and heavy rainfall), as well as chronic changes (rising sea levels). The consequences for the economy range from storm damage to buildings to temporary disruptions of global supply chains. Indirect physical risks were also identified. These are risks that can arise from the indirect or long-term effects of climate change, for example losses in production due to a shortage of water supply as a result of prolonged periods of drought. According to this analysis, none of the Semperit sites are currently exposed to a physical climate risk in the short term. In the medium and long term, water-related risks such as flooding and water shortages were identified at the Roha, Odry and Bełchatów sites. Projects for efficient water use and sustainable water management have been initiated to counter these risks.\n\nIn any case, Semperit ensures that the risk of insurable natural hazards is reduced as much as possible through regular exchanges with contracted insurers. Legal disputes that exceed the sum insured or are not covered by the insurance may result in additional losses for the Semperit Group. A further risk lies in the fact that it cannot be guaranteed that the Semperit Group will continue to receive adequate insurance cover at economically reasonable conditions in the future.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Market risks\n\n### Competitive environment\n\nThe global markets for the Semperit Group's products are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, production technology, product development and introduction times, customer service and financing conditions, and regarding shifts in market needs. The Semperit Group continues to be confronted with strong competitors, partially also from emerging countries, which have a more favorable cost structure, often also due to higher energy costs in Europe. Some industries in which the Semperit Group operates are undergoing consolidation, which could lead to increased competition and a change in the relative market position of the Semperit Group. Furthermore, it must be noted that suppliers are also increasingly becoming serious competitors for the Semperit Group. In order to further strengthen the competitiveness of the Semperit Group, projects with the goal to increase the strengthening of innovative power, reduce costs, improve efficiency, reduce waste and maintain sustainable energy management are being implemented.\n\n### Economic, political, and geopolitical environment\n\nFrom the Semperit Group's perspective there is currently an insecurity regarding the future development of the global economy. The global markets were recently considerably affected by geopolitical crises and their impact on the supply chain. Since February 2022, the development of the global economic climate has been significantly influenced by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the uncertainty in the energy sector due to generally higher or strongly fluctuating energy prices as well as high inflation. There is a risk that the global economy will recover more slowly than expected and that the negative impact particularly in Asia, Europe and the USA will continue. A slowdown in economic growth in Asia or even a collapse of the real estate market, the banking sector or the stock market represent further significant risks. In the euro zone, too, the cooling of the economic climate might continue. This could increase business volatility and represent risks for the financial markets. The investment climate could suffer a slump due to political upheavals in Eastern Europe, further independence movements inside and outside the European Union or because of sustainable successes of protectionist parties and policies that are hostile to business and the EU.\n\nA further intensification of the trade conflicts between the USA and China as well as USA and Russia and the consequences of a dispute with Iran, the tensions between China and Taiwan, and Japan as well as the further development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict could have negative effects on the business performance of the Semperit Group.\n\nA terrorist attack or a series of such attacks in large economies or along supply chains could impair the global economic activity.\n\nIf the Semperit Group is not able to further adjust its production and cost structures appropriately in the current economic development, there is a risk of a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the company.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Opportunities\n\nIn addition to monitoring risks, it is an essential part of corporate management to recognize opportunities in good time and make the best possible use of them for the company. Opportunity management as an entrepreneurial approach that aims to identify, record and utilize the positive aspects and opportunities in a business environment is aimed at managing the uncertainties associated with business activities.\n\nTo identify opportunities, the Semperit Group looks for possibilities to recognize potential for growth and improvement, for example through market analyses, innovations or partnerships. Potential opportunities are carefully evaluated and prioritized in order to use resources efficiently. Strategies developed on the basis of identified opportunities can result in the adaptation of business models, product developments or market entry strategies. Opportunity management is therefore a proactive approach that aims to not only minimize risks, but also maximize the positive potential for the Semperit Group.\n\nIn the long term, the management sees great potential in the further expansion of the core business as part of the strategic orientation of the Semperit Group as an industrial rubber and elastomer specialist.\n\n### Opportunities arising from the new organizational structure\n\nThe new divisional structure is oriented towards the two main business models of the Semperit Group, while at the same time reducing complexity and enabling business expansion. This can open up various opportunities for the Semperit Group, such as rationalizing processes and increasing efficiency.\n\n### Opportunities through acquisition\n\nThe acquisition of the Rico Group in the reporting year, its further growth steps and other potential acquisitions of companies with similar elastomer or complementary products and services may offer the Group the opportunity to gain access to new geographical regions and sales markets or to strengthen its presence in existing markets. This opens up new sales opportunities and the expansion of the customer base. The acquisition of the Rico Group, for example, has given Semperit a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking. This goes hand in hand with servicing high-growth sectors such as healthcare and industrial household applications. In addition, synergy effects can be achieved through acquisitions by rationalizing redundant functions and resources, for example in the areas of sales, logistics and administration. The acquisition of a company with advanced technologies, such as the Rico Group or another company with advanced technologies and know-how, especially in the area of production automation, strengthens the technological lead of the Semperit Group, can accelerate innovation and provides access to highly qualified employees. Instead of developing new markets or products organically, an acquisition enables faster market entry. This is particularly important in fast-moving industries. As a further opportunity, a broader business base through acquisitions can help to diversify risk.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Opportunities through automation\n\nIncreasing the level of automation is a key component of the Semperit Group's strategic orientation. This is reflected, for example, in the construction of the DH5 hose production facility in Odry, where automation in production and internal logistics is intended to achieve a very high and consistent level of quality throughout the entire production process, and in the recent acquisition of the Rico Group. Increased use of automation technologies leads to cost savings, error reduction and time savings, which in turn improves responsiveness to customer requirements. Automated systems are often easier to adapt to fluctuating demand than manual processes, which is particularly advantageous in a volatile market environment. In addition, processing information in real time enables data-driven decision-making processes.\n\n### Opportunities through sustainability\n\nThe Semperit Group's commitment to sustainability can strengthen its reputation and market value. Consumers and stakeholders increasingly value companies that assume social and ecological responsibility. Sustainability is becoming an important decision-making factor for many consumers when purchasing products or services. Sustainable practices can therefore help to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the long term.\n\nIn order to drive the development of new or sustainable products and identify corresponding market trends, the Semperit Group is cooperating closely with customers and supporting scientific research – with a focus on innovative materials, technologies and products. The aim of the research activities is to secure and further strengthen the market position of the Semperit Group in the long term while at the same time becoming more attractive for sustainable investments, for example through the successive improvement of ESG rating results. In the production of sealing profiles, for example, the Semperit Group is working on a gradual increase in the reuse of recycled material.\n\n### Opportunities through innovation\n\nInnovations offer a variety of opportunities for the Semperit Group to achieve competitive advantages, promote growth and increase market success. Examples of innovative products that satisfy new market trends are the \"Hybrid Handrail\" and \"SemperSilentPads\". The former, a newly developed escalator handrail, consists of two materials (rubber and Smart Polymer) and combines the best of both material worlds. The SemperSilentPads are an innovative solution for a rail pad that significantly reduces noise compared to competitor products.\n\n### Opportunities through digitalization\n\nThe consistent implementation of digitalization projects will allow the Semperit Group to collect, store and analyze large amounts of cross-location data on production and financial processes. This will enable even faster reactions to market trends, changes in demand and external threats. Current major projects such as \"oneERP\" with the introduction of SAP S/4 Hana serve to harmonize the IT infrastructure. On the other hand, automation and digital back-office projects are being used to further increase efficiency.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Internal Control System (ICS)\n\nThe Semperit Group's internal control system is designed to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of its business activities, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant statutory regulations. It also supports the early recognition and monitoring of risks deriving from inadequate monitoring systems and fraudulent actions and is improved and expanded on an ongoing basis by the Group Risk Management & Assurance department together with the relevant specialist departments. The management of the respective business unit is responsible for implementing and monitoring the ICS and the risk management system. The Executive Board of Semperit AG Holding stipulates cross-divisional framework conditions and regulations that are applicable throughout the group. Regular follow-up audits are performed at the locations to ensure the sustained implementation of the framework conditions and regulations.\n\nThe following principles form the basics of ICS:\n\n- Ensuring the accuracy of accounting and reporting\n- Compliance with internal regulations (limits of authority) and external laws and regulations\n- Increased payment security based on a predefined corset of payment transaction controls\n- Ensuring adequate implementation and segregation of duties\n- Ensuring the controls provided in the process\n- Auditability by independent experts\n- Protection of property\n- Recognition of potential operating risks and making losses visible that have already occurred\n- Improvement in operating effectiveness\n\n### Essential characteristics of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the financial reporting process\n\nThe key points of the existing internal control system and the risk management system with regard to the (consolidated) financial reporting process are summarized as follows:\n\n- With regard to the financial reporting process, the functions of accounting are separated from other areas of responsibility such as treasury.\n- The applied financial systems are protected against unauthorized access by appropriate IT facilities.\n- With regard to applied financial systems, standard software is widely used.\n- A guideline system (e.g., accounting guidelines, payment guidelines) has been implemented.\n- Received or forwarded accounting data will be examined for completeness and correctness, e.g., by means of random samples, by the responsible persons.\n- The dual-control principle is applied in accounting-related processes.\n- Accounting-related processes are examined on a random basis by internal audit.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter a solid performance in continued operations in the 2023 financial year, the Executive Board of the Semperit Group expects the market environment to remain challenging in the coming months. For the SIA division, no significant recovery in demand is expected in the short term, as the reduction of increased customer inventories will extend into the first half of 2024. In addition, demand from the relevant industries (including construction machinery and agricultural machinery such as tractors) continues to decline or is not yet showing any signs of recovery. For the SEA division, the good demand from the mining industry, healthcare and food sectors as well as the railway sector should continue, while demand for products linked to the construction industry and related sectors will be lower.\n\nIn addition, uncertainties due to geopolitical conflicts are still present and may quickly lead to adverse effects on the market environment.\n\n### Cost masures take effect\n\nIn anticipation of this development, countermeasures have been introduced at an early stage of the 2023 financial year. These include improvements to the product mix in the direction of higher-margin products, cost reduction programs and a streamlining of processes, accompanied by an increase in operating efficiency in order to be able to react flexibly to further market fluctuations. Defined and already established measures for savings include a run-rate of more than EUR 10 million, of which around EUR 5.8 million was already recognized in profit or loss in 2023.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Executive Board of the Semperit Group expects EBITDA to increase to around EUR 80 million for the 2024 financial year.\n\n### Dividend/distribution\n\nThe dividend policy of the Semperit Group generally aims at a distribution of around 50% of earnings after tax – provided that business development continues successfully, and no extraordinary circumstances occur.\n\nIn view of the positive earnings after tax from continued operations – the relevant earnings and comparative figure for future business development – the Executive Board will propose a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share to the Annual General Meeting. A total of EUR 10.3 million should therefore be distributed. With a share price of EUR 14.16 at the end of 2023, this results in a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Note\n\nThis outlook is based on the assessments of the Executive Board as of 18 March 2024, and does not take into account the impact of potential acquisitions, divestments, or other unforeseeable structural and economic changes during the remainder of 2024. These assessments are subject to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may result in actual events and outcomes differing from the statements made here.\n\nVienna, 18 March 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nHola Wall\n\nKarl Haider CEO\n\nHelmut Sorger CFO\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/10 description: The image shows a stylized signature above the name \"Gerfried Eder\" in blue text, followed by \"CIO\" in black text.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>\n\n| Consolidated financial statements                     | 8  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Consolidated income statement                         | 8  |\n| Consolidated statement of comprehensive income        | 8  |\n| Consolidated cash flow statement                      | 8  |\n| Consolidated balance sheet                            | 8  |\n| Consolidated statement of changes in equity           | 8  |\n| Notes to the consolidated financial statements        | 8  |\n| 1.

<span id=\"page-87-1\"></span>1. General\n\n### 1.1. General information\n\nSemperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding (SAG), a public limited company under Austrian law, is the parent company of an international industrial group (hereinafter: the Semperit Group). It is domiciled at Am Belvedere 10, 1100 Vienna, Austria, and it develops, produces, and sells highly specialized rubber products in the Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) and Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) divisions and in the Surgical Operations business. B&C KB Holding GmbH is the direct majority shareholder of SAG, and B&C Privatstiftung is the controlling legal entity. The Semperit Group completed its strategic realignment and transformation to an industrial rubber specialist by selling the Medical Sector, which initially excluded the Surgical Operations business, in August 2023. Please see section 2.1 for additional information on the divisions.\n\n### 1.2. Basic preparation principles\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023 were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), and Section 245a of the Austrian Commercial Code (Unternehmensgesetzbuch, UGB). The fiscal year comprises the period from January 1 to December 31. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on March 18, 2024 and approved for submission to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe reporting currency is the euro (EUR), with figures rounded to the nearest thousand, unless expressly stated otherwise. Rounding differences may occur when totaling rounded amounts and percentages through the use of automated calculation methods.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the former Medical Sector, which is now Surgical Operations and Examination Operations, was recognized for the most part under discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements (see section 2.9). As per the accounting rules under IFRS 5, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the earnings after taxes of continuing and discontinued operations are shown separately in the consolidated income statement. The earnings from discontinued operations were reported as a separate item, including the earnings after taxes resulting from the measurement at fair value less costs to sell or from deconsolidation. This item also includes the recycling of any historical currency translation differences recognized in other comprehensive income relating to discontinued operations. Cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations were presented together in the consolidated cash flow statement. Cash flows from the operating, investing, and financing activities of discontinued operations are disclosed in the notes (see section 2.9). The disclosures in the notes explaining the consolidated income statement, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated balance sheet follow the presentation described here.\n\nWith the exception of the measurement of certain financial instruments, as well as provisions and deferred taxes, the consolidated financial statements were prepared based on amortized cost. Securities and derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The three levels in the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\n- Level 1: measurement based on quoted prices on an active market for a specific financial instrument\n- Level 2: measurement based on quoted market prices for similar instruments or on the basis of measurement models based exclusively on input factors that are observable on the market\n- Level 3: measurement based on models with significant input factors that are not observable on the market\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, no financial instruments were reclassified between the individual levels.\n\nThe amount of provisions corresponds to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liabilities as at the reporting date. Deferred taxes that are expected to be realized are calculated based on the nominal amount of existing temporary differences between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base, using the tax rate that is expected to apply.\n\n### 1.3. Consolidation principles\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company and the financial statements of the subsidiaries controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control begins and until the date on which control ceases. Please see sections 1.6 and 10.1 through 10.2 for more detailed information on the scope of consolidation.\n\nAcquisition accounting involves offsetting the amortized cost of the equity interest in subsidiaries and the respective subsidiary's equity attributable to the investment. Receivables and liabilities between companies included in the scope of consolidation are eliminated during the course of the consolidation of intercompany balances. Foreign currency differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are presented in the other financial result. All income and expenses from intercompany transactions, such as deliveries of goods and services, Group financing, or profit distributions, are offset during the elimination of income and expenses. Depending on the underlying transaction, foreign currency differences from the elimination of income and expenses are presented in the cost of materials, other operating expenses, or other financial result. In addition, intercompany profits and losses from intragroup goods and services are eliminated.\n\n### Currency translation\n\nAssets and liabilities, including goodwill of subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements whose functional currency is not the euro, are translated at the mean exchange rate as at the reporting date; items in the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and the consolidated cash flow statement are translated using an average mean exchange rate for the fiscal year. The reference exchange rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) are generally used for currency translation. Currency differences resulting from this translation of subsidiaries' financial statements are recognized in the consolidated financial statements through other comprehensive income in the currency translation reserve and reclassified to the consolidated income statement upon the sale or other disposal of the subsidiary in question.\n\nPursuant to IAS 21, for some subsidiaries there are mixed factors and indicators for determining the functional currency. In management's judgment, attributes that give rise to a functional currency other than the local currency predominate at the following subsidiaries:\n\n- Semperit Industrial Products Singapore Pte Ltd., Singapore: US dollar\n- Sempermed Singapore Pte Ltd., Singapore: US dollar\n- Sempermed Kft., Sopron, Hungary: Euro\n\nAt Semperflex Optimit s.r.o., the Czech Republic, and Sempertrans Bełchatów Sp. z o.o., Poland, the assessment of the (mixed) factors and indicators for determining the functional currency results in the use of the local currency as the functional currency.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.4. Judgments and uncertainties in estimates\n\n### Judgments\n\nThe accounting policies set out in the IFRS provide users of the standards with various implicit and explicit options. The application of accounting policies is therefore subject to various exercises of judgment by management that can significantly affect the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The following judgments by management have a significant influence on these consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Determination of the functional currency of subsidiaries (see section 1.3)\n- Determination of sufficient indications of a need to recognize impairment losses or the reversal of impairment losses (see section 3.2)\n- Lease terms: assessment of whether the exercise of extension options or the non-exercise of termination options is reasonably certain; determination of any economic disadvantages resulting from an early termination (see section [3.2](#page-125-0))\n- Treatment of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries with termination options (see sections 6.1 and 10.2)\n- Classification of money market fund units as cash equivalents (see section 6.6)\n- Full consolidation of companies (see section 10.2): assessment of whether control over a subsidiary does or does not exist\n- Determination of whether the conditions for the presentation of non-current assets held for sale or discontinued operations have been met (see section 2.9 as well as the consolidated balance sheet)\n- Identification of intangible assets as part of a purchase price allocation for the acquisition of subsidiaries (see section 1.6)\n- Determination of whether the useful life of intangible assets is indefinite (see section 3.1)\n\n### Material estimates and assumptions\n\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future developments that affect the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, the disclosures on other obligations as at the reporting date, and the reporting of the income generated and expenses accrued during the fiscal year. The amounts ultimately realized may differ from the amounts recognized based on the decisions and assumptions that were made. Estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly and adjusted if necessary.\n\nThe following estimates and assumptions were made; more detailed explanations of these can be found under the respective item:\n\n- Intangible assets: the annual impairment test of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (see section [3.1](#page-120-1))\n- Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment: determination of the useful lives of assets with finite useful lives (see sections [3.1](#page-120-1) and 3.2)\n- Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment: indication-driven impairment testing of the assets, delineation and determination of costs to sell (see section 3.2)\n- Inventories: determination of net realizable values during inventory measurement (see section 4.1)\n- Trade receivables: determination of loss allowances (see section 4.2)\n- Financial instruments: determination of the fair values for which there is no active market (see section [6.4](#page-147-0))\n- Contract assets: determination of the stage of completion based on the total expected order cost for customer tools (see sections 2.2 and 8.1)\n- Tax uncertainties: recognition and measurement of actual and deferred income taxes in cases in which there is uncertainty about the amount of (recoverable) income taxes owed (see sections 2.8 and 9)\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profits against which unused tax loss carryforwards or tax credits can be utilized, or of tax planning opportunities that will create taxable profits in future (see sections 2.8 and 9)\n- Provisions for personnel: significant actuarial assumptions used in measuring provisions for pensions, severance payments, and anniversary bonuses (see sections 7.1 and 7.2)\n- Other provisions: significant assumptions about the probability of occurrence and extent (see section 7.2)\n\n### Effects of climate-related matters and risks\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the European Union's aim to use the \"Green Deal\" to create the framework required for a sustainable economic future led once again to the development of rules and regulations as well as action plans that are now being implemented step by step. Taking this into account, the Semperit Group enhanced its efforts to make entrepreneurial decisions in favor of environmental and social impacts. The Semperit Group used the \"30% by 2030\" initiative to bundle and accelerate all existing activities aimed at boosting efficiency, thus making a significant contribution to climate action. Its goal was to leverage process optimization to achieve a 30% increase in efficiency and a 30% decrease in resource and energy consumption and waste generation by 2030 relative to the baseline year 2019.\n\nDue to the sale of the Medical Sector and the acquisition of the Rico Group, the size of the Semperit Group and its impact on the environment and society changed in the 2023 fiscal year. The Semperit Group's management therefore examined the targets set in 2020 by conducting a materiality analysis in the fiscal year 2023 and adjusting them in line with the new circumstances and potential. The fact that the division with the comparatively highest potential to reduce energy, emissions, waste, and water consumption was discontinued, and that there is comparatively little, if any, remaining potential to make reductions in the continued operations, is one reason why this savings potential is now much smaller. In addition, there are \"only\" seven more years between the new baseline year 2023 and 2030 to realize this savings potential. From 2024, the adjusted targets will include a reduction in energy consumption by 5%, emissions by 10%, and waste by 7% by 2030. This work focuses chiefly on continual improvements in energy efficiency in production and also in facility management, as well as on reductions in waste, waste generation, and water consumption. In addition, further measures to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions are to be developed and implemented (e.g., installation of photovoltaic (PV) units and the continued promotion of electromobility in the fleet). Thanks to the demolition of the given thermal generation plants and measures aimed at reducing combustible heat capacities, for example, plants at the Austrian entity, Semperit Technische Produkte Gesellschaft m.b.H. (STP), and the Czech entity, Semperflex Optimit s.r.o. (SFO), have already fallen outside of the purview of the respective emission allowance laws (see section 3.1). Additional activities aimed at environmental protection and climate action concern measures specific to materials (e.g., recycling activities) or the use of secondary raw materials. Not every raw material used in a rubber mixture can be substituted by a secondary raw material, because a change in the formulation not only affects the finished product's material and product properties but also the process-related steps in manufacturing. Currently, the use of secondary raw materials is still limited for this reason – not least in view of their limited availability. Different kinds of vulcanized rubber are difficult to reuse due to the chemical crosslinking reaction that occurs when they are exposed to heat – i.e., long-chain rubber molecules are crosslinked by sulfur bridges; elastomeric product components must be subjected to a separate regeneration step. This distinguishes rubber from other materials such as steel, glass, paper, or cardboard. Recycling rubber and silicone is highly desirable from a circular economy perspective: in the Semperit Group, production waste and scrap are fed back into the production process to the extent technically possible. Nevertheless, what must be considered in this case is the fact that the extraction \n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nof secondary raw materials can be very energy-intensive and may also involve large quantities of chemicals. Product design also plays a major role in the potential recycling of old products. In addition to the rubber mixture, the Semperit Group's finished products often contain reinforcing materials such as ropes, wires, woven fabrics, and yarns. It is difficult to separate these materials at the end of a product's useful life. As the main component of the finished products from the Rico Group, silicone is considered non-recyclable for environmental and economic reasons based on the latest technological and scientific knowledge. Energy-intensive thermal recycling (incineration) generates sand, water, and carbon dioxide, which cannot be directly converted back into silicone or are only marginally returned to the production process. Despite this, it is possible to manufacture lubricating oil from silicone waste and silicone residue in production (with the help of an external partner). This downcycling will significantly reduce the amount of waste generated at Rico and enable the reuse of waste silicone in the production process.\n\nThe Semperit Group tracks developments and technological progress in the extraction of secondary raw materials, regularly tests newly available recyclates, and works to establish a supplier network for this, as well as to improve technical options through research and development conducted in cooperation with third parties. Thanks to technological advances, the Semperit Group was able to develop products in the Profiles business in the 2023 fiscal year that contain up to 70% regenerated vulcanized waste from the company's own profile production. This will make it possible to close the recycling gap in the construction industry in the future, as the market does not currently offer an option to recycle sealing profiles. While sealing profiles that are no longer needed were previously utilized for energy purposes, i.e., incinerated, the Semperit circularity profiles enable reuse as a secondary raw material for the first time – in keeping with the principle of a circular economy. The process of chemical crosslinking, which generates an insoluble and no longer deformable elastomer from the rubber compound, is reversed. The bridges formed during crosslinking are split and a deformable, soluble rubber compound is formed. In the next process step, 50% of the newly recovered raw material will be reused as the primary raw material for the total mass of a new EPDM compound. As with the recycled vulcanized profiles, the resulting compound containing 50% recycled content meets the standard requirements for elastomer materials DIN 7863-1. Semperit circularity profiles make a noteworthy contribution to the decarbonization of the construction industry and thus to climate action, with a product carbon footprint that is 47% lower than that of a conventional, comparable sealing profile and 26% lower than that of a standard Semperit Group profile.\n\nClimate-related matters and risks may affect the business medium-term financial planning, which may be used as the basis to determine the value in use for impairment tests. For example, this applies to the assumptions used to estimate the market development of the Belting business: it engages in the production and sale of transport and conveyor belts, which are used (among other things) in the mining of coal, ores, and rare earth metals, in the steel and cement industry, as well as in the civil engineering and transport industry. In order to meet various application requirements, the Belting business reinforces the belts either with textile or with steel cord carcasses. The market for transport and conveyor belts comprises the replacement business as well as new or expansion projects. In the medium to long term, the coal phase-out in Europe will lead to the replacement of both the coal infrastructure and related energy production in favor of non-fossil and carbon-neutral energy sources. The demand for transport and conveyor belts from the European coal mining industry will therefore decrease in the medium and long term. By contrast, the demand is growing from the heavy load sector (particularly for transport and conveyor belts reinforced by steel cord carcasses) in the mining industry in connection with the mining of ores (e.g., copper) and rare earths, which are increasingly needed for electrification purposes and sustainable power supplies. The mining industry also aims to reduce its carbon footprint through \"green mining\" initiatives. In this context, the traditional truck and shovel operation model is increasingly being replaced by transport and conveyor belt solutions. Furthermore, transport and conveyor belt solutions help counteract soil compaction resulting from \n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe use of heavy mining machines. The business medium-term financial planning accounts for sustainability issues related to energy consumption and emissions (e.g., improving energy efficiency, reducing emissions, improving the use of renewable resources to meet energy demands, etc.).\n\nThe medium-term financial plans include EUR 1.7 million in investments in photovoltaic units in the SIA division to speed up the relevance of solar energy in the energy mix and to produce up to 2.1 million kWh of electricity with it. Investments in circulation water treatment have also been factored in to reduce the SIA division's water requirements and mitigate water shortage risks. Finally investments in more modern and efficient lighting systems in the SEA division were planned to achieve up to EUR 0.7 million in annual energy savings and up to 10% savings in production energy. The same applies to aspects of the circular economy (e.g., choice of raw materials, use of available recyclates, efficiency of material use, improvements to waste management) and to environmentally friendly new product development (e.g., high-density window profiles and sound-reducing rail pads to lower environmental noise pollution arising from harmful excess noise). Planned climate-related measures aimed at improving earnings that are predicated on infrastructure improvements were explicitly taken into account in the determination of the values in use, provided they had been formally adopted and are being implemented. This applies, for example, to the plant expansion in Odry, the Czech Republic (see section 3.1). Future developments related to the potential expansion of the sustainable product portfolio, to the realization of potential in the economical recycling of vulcanized rubber, and to the use of replacement materials and technologies for vulcanized rubber products were only anticipated in part in the medium-term financial planning (e.g., use of recyclates) even though the Semperit Group is currently evaluating such measures. As far as the resilience of the corporate strategy underlying the medium-term planning with regard to various climate-related scenarios (including a scenario aimed at achieving the 1.5-degree objective of international climate policy) is concerned, the Semperit Group conducted a climate scenario analysis for the first time in the fiscal year 2023 in order to assess the potential effects and risks of future climate developments and enable well-founded decisions with respect to climate adaptation and investments. The climate scenario analysis helps prepare the sites better for climate change and to develop a sustainable corporate strategy and medium-term planning. The risk of the limited availability and increase in price of raw materials is reflected in medium-term planning. The transition to alternative energy sources and adaptation of production facilities and associated processes can also have an effect on mediumterm planning, and investments in photovoltaic systems have already been taken into account. The risk of flooding and droughts varies depending on the location over the medium and long term, and only affects certain locations. Mitigating structural measures have already been partially incorporated into medium-term planning as investments. The implications of the analysis will be incorporated into the current financial and strategic planning starting in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nCurrently, there are no inventories in the Semperit Group that are at risk of obsolescence or falling prices due to climate-related risks. Climate-related risks did not represent an indication of impairment and also did not result in any adjustment of the useful lives of intangible assets or property, plant, and equipment. The recognition of provisions for climate-related matters and risks is of minor importance to the Semperit Group. However, the topic of sustainability with its three key dimensions – environmental, social, and governance (ESG) – has also found its way into corporate and Group financing. The current regulatory and market-related developments with respect to sustainable finance first found their way into the terms and conditions of bank financing in the 2023 fiscal year. Three key performance indicators (KPIs) with quantitative targets up to 2030 have been identified and incorporated into bank financing:\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Reduction of energy consumption by 5% by 2030,\n- Improvement in occupational accident rate by 8% p.a.,\n- Integration of sustainability into the supply chain with more than 75% ESG-certified expenditure by 2030\n\nThe KPIs are reported to the bank via the Semperit Sustainability Report and are applied to determine the credit margin. Starting in the fiscal year 2025, the achievement of these targets will have a direct impact on interest rates from bank financing of up to +/– 6 basis points with a nominal value of up to EUR 360,000 thousand as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition, the ESG targets of occupational health and safety, energy efficiency, and waste reduction, as well as a target value for an ESG rating (CDP Climate Rating), are applied to achieving the target of long-term variable performance bonuses for management, whereby climate-related issues may have a direct impact on premium provisions (see section 7.2).\n\n### Macroeconomic influences\n\nThe indirect consequences of macroeconomic developments related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, in particular a mixture of high inflation and interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and a slowdown in macroeconomic developments, had a major impact on both Semperit Group divisions. The SEA division's Belting business benefited from the intensification of mining activities and, as a result, from the high demand for conveyor belts. In the SIA division's Hoses business, customer portfolio optimization programs resulting from the economic downturn led to customer ordering behavior that was outside the scope of usual practice, which resulted in a sharp decline in revenue. As at the end of December 2023, the Hoses business' order books were more than 50% lower than the figures from the same period in the previous year. In addition, the SIA division was impacted by the effects of a weak construction industry, especially in the Profiles business, which suffered from weak demand. Please see section 2.1 for more details on the individual divisions' performance. To offset this, EUR 5.8 million in savings were realized as part of the ongoing implementation of an overhead costs project, approximately 85% of which was attributable to personnel expenses and the remainder to other operating expenses.\n\nThe impact of trade conflicts and growing geopolitical tension on global procurement flows was negligible for key raw materials and auxiliary materials used in the production of the Semperit Group's products due to a wide range of optimization initiatives. On the whole, we observed a restoration of supply chains following the severe bottlenecks in the previous year, which ensured improved and reliable supplies in the 2023 fiscal year. These developments had a positive impact on freight costs and contributed substantially to ending the trend toward the highly precautionary building up of safety stock levels for materials critical for production.\n\nThe escalation of the conflict in the Middle East did not affect the Semperit Group in the fiscal year 2023. At the start of 2024, the attacks on shipping in the Red Sea led to a slight increase in delivery times and container costs. Both effects were much smaller than during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ramifications of the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East have so far been confined to shipping in the Red Sea. In principle, the Semperit Group established international multiple sourcing some time ago now and this mitigates the effects of crises.\n\nThe revenue for surgical glove production in Wimpassing, Austria, which for now remains part of the Semperit Group and thus within its continued operations despite the sale of the medical business, has decreased after the exceptional boom period during the pandemic with a comparatively high demand and price development. Despite savings in personnel and lower freight costs, the result remained negative due to the reduction of customer inventories.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nStagnant to slightly slowing economic performance is expected for the fiscal year 2024; this has already been anticipated accordingly in the medium-term financial planning, which may be used as the basis to determine value in use for impairment tests. The changed interest rate landscape mainly affects investment income, debt service for financial liabilities, social capital (i.e., provisions for pensions, severance payments, and anniversary bonuses), and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for impairment test purposes (see sections 7.1 and 3.1).\n\nAs part of the impairment tests, the increased forecasting uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was managed by considering alternative planning scenarios. The risk-free interest rate rose due to the central banks raising the key interest rates and changes in inflation expectations, whereas the market risk premium fell. The calculation of the weighted average cost of capital takes into account a risk-free interest rate of 2.7% (previous year: 1.6%), which is calculated on the basis of German federal securities with a 30-year term using the Svensson method. The market risk premium was assumed to be 5.8% (previous year: 7.9%), taking into account observable developments in market rates of return (see section 3.1).\n\nThe measurement of social capital reflects the changed interest rate landscape by applying the most recent interest rates based on the Mercer Yield Curve (MYC) on the reporting date that take into account the corresponding duration of the liabilities, derived from a spot rate yield curve on euro area bonds. The current wage and salary cost pressures were countered in the measurement of social capital by assuming salary increases in 2024 and 2025 in excess of those expected in the long term (from 2025). Please see section 7.1 for details on the measurement of social capital, including sensitivity analysis.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the financial position of the Semperit Group changed primarily due to the acquisition of the Rico Group, the first closing for the sale of the Medical Sector, the commencement of new bank financing, and the payment of dividends from a net cash surplus of EUR 9,424 thousand in the previous year to a net debt of EUR –192,411 thousand as at the reporting date.\n\nThe Semperit Group's financial liabilities currently consist of fixed-interest corporate Schuldschein loans and variable-interest bank financing (see section 6.2). Corporate Schuldschein loans do not bear any (negative) present value risk as interest rates rise, in contrast to the higher variable-interest bank financing. The effective interest rate on the corporate Schuldschein loans is below the current interest rate level and, given the current level of inflation, has a favorable effect on the Semperit Group's financial position (see section 6.4). The newly acquired variable-interest bank financing was concluded with a volume of up to EUR 360,000 thousand. Of this amount, EUR 110,000 thousand from the first loan and EUR 33,000 thousand from the second loan were utilized as of December 31, 2023 and recognized as a liability (see section 6.2). Both the newly acquired bank financing and the bank financing of the Rico Group, which was consolidated for the first time, are subject to fluctuations in the usual benchmark interest rates on the European money market. Please see section 11.1 for details on interest rate terms and requirements under credit law.\n\nIn the period from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, the three-month EURIBOR surged from 2.1% to 3.9%. Please see section 2.7 for the impact of higher interest rates on finance expenses and section 11.4 for details on the interest rate profile and sensitivities. At the time the annual report was prepared, the development of the three-month EURIBOR forward interest rate curve indicated that lower interest rates are expected between 2024 and 2030, which will have a favorable effect on the refinancing risk. Please see section 11.2 for details on liquidity management and maturities on financial liabilities. Due to its international trade relations, the Semperit Group is exposed to currency fluctuations that are strongly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Please see section 11.5 for details on the foreign currency risk profile.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.5.

acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in the Rico Group. As a one-stop-shop (OSS) provider of individual synthetics and elastomer projects, the Rico Group's product portfolio ranges from the manufacture of injection molding tools, to consulting on component development, all the way to mass production of customer-specific components. The Group focuses on the processing of elastomers, especially liquid and solid silicone. This involves producing the components in single, double, or multi-shot component injection molding processes. The technological market leadership of the Rico Group in the processing of liquid and solid silicone, the group's strong expertise in toolmaking and process automation to develop high-precision and highly complex customer solutions, its access to attractive markets, and its presence in the United States are the main reasons for this business combination. These factors determine goodwill as well as the tax synergies that will be realized through inclusion in the Austrian Group in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (Körperschaftssteuergesetz, KStG) (see section 12.3), as well as the acquired workforce. The closing of the acquisition of the Rico Group took place on July 31, 2023.\n\nThe final purchase price totaled EUR 184,329 thousand, which corresponds to a cash and debt free purchase price of EUR 197,500 thousand taking into account a customary price adjustment mechanism at the time the transaction was effected. The amount of cash and cash equivalents in the subsidiaries consolidated for the first time was EUR 15,004 thousand. According to the contractual agreements, the final purchase price is EUR 4,500 thousand to be paid three years after closing. A present value of EUR 3,832 thousand was taken into account in the purchase price allocation for the deferred purchase price in the total consideration and recognized as a non-current other financial liability. The transaction costs totaled EUR 3,350 thousand and were recognized in the SEA division's other operating expenses.\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Rico Group as of the acquisition date, the goodwill, and disclosures pursuant to IFRS 3.B64 (q) are as follows:\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand

area of toolmaking), and brand names. Customer relationships were measured using the residual value method, technologies using the excess profit method, and brand names using the license price analogy method. Please see section 3.1 for the subsequent measurement of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-99-0\"></span>2. Performance\n\n### 2.1. Segment reporting\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 8, segment reporting is based on internal reporting to the SAG Executive Board as the chief operating decision-maker, which decides on the allocation of resources to the businesses. Segment reporting comprises the two divisions SIA and SEA, plus the two businesses Surgical Operations and Examination Operations.\n\nAs part of the development of the Group's industrial strategy, both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of the Semperit Group adopted the Group's organizational structure effective July 1, 2023 and divided up until then existing segments in the Industry Sector into two divisions. From the former Medical Sector, Surgical Operations remain as a business – for the duration of the contract manufacturing agreement concluded with Harps Global Pte. Ltd. and/or Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.). The new divisional structure distinguishes between business models that focus on different customer groups and their specific technical and organizational requirements.\n\n- Semperit Industrial Applications: The Semperit Industrial Applications division will focus on industrial applications such as hydraulic and industrial hoses (the former Semperflex segment) and profiles (formerly part of the Semperseal segment). Its business model is characterized by cost leadership in the volume business, optimization of rubber compounds, manufacture of standard products with long life cycles, high standardization of products and processes, and relatively low product portfolio complexity.\n- Semperit Engineered Applications: The Semperit Engineered Applications division will focus on technical solutions tailored to customers' individual needs and comprises escalator handrails, cable car rings and other elastomer products built to customer specification (formerly the Semperform segment), including elastomer plates (formerly part of the Semperseal segment) and transport and conveyor belts (formerly the Sempertrans segment); the newly acquired Rico Group (see section 1.6) is also a part of this division. The Semperit Engineered Applications division's business model is characterized by a focus on industrial niches, the creation of products with a high degree of customer customization through the effective use of application-specific technologies and knowhow, and relatively high product portfolio complexity.\n- Surgical Operations and Examination Operations: In the fiscal year 2023, the former Medical Sector, the Sempermed segment, was divided into two businesses for internal segment reporting: Examination Operations, which comprise the production of examination gloves, the production of porcelain dip moldings used to manufacture gloves in Malaysia, and worldwide sales and distribution organizations, and Surgical Operations, which comprise the production of surgical gloves in Wimpassing, Austria, by STP and their packaging in Sopron, Hungary. The (first) closing for the sale of the Medical Sector to Harps Global Pte. Ltd. was effective from August 31, 2023. The Semperit Group thus separated itself from the Medical Sector, with the exception of Surgical Operations for the time being. The Semperit Group will continue this business for up to five years as a contract manufacturer until its final sale in a separate (second) closing. Consequently, Surgical Operations will remain under continuing operations for the time being.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe accounting policies applied in deriving the segment figures are identical to the Semperit Group's accounting policies. This does not apply to the presentation and measurement requirements in IFRS 5 for discontinued operations; these were not applied in internal segment reporting (see below).\n\nThe segment result is EBITDA. It is the result that is reported to the Executive Board for the purposes of allocating resources and performance measurement. Trade working capital and additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment are reported to the Executive Board as key performance indicators of the segment assets.\n\n### Segmentation by division and businesses\n\nThe segmentation by division and businesses is based on internal management and reporting that still includes the entire former Medical Sector in the fiscal year 2023, divided into the Surgical Operations and Examination Operations businesses.\n\n| 1–12 2023 in EUR thousand                                                                  |

production and/or sales operations in more than one segment are divided and allocated to the appropriate segment so that no additional eliminations are required. The Corporate Center consists of SAG, which is not operationally active, as well as of those parts of a service company in Singapore that are assigned to the Corporate Center. In addition, certain Corporate Center services are provided by operating companies. Corporate Center's internal charging and allocations have already been assigned to the segments, to the extent possible.\n\nAs far as Surgical Operations is concerned, the pre-packaged surgical gloves were sold by STP to the (formerly intra-Group) Singaporean Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) on August 31, 2023, both before and after the (first) closing for the sale of the Medical Sector; the latter will continue to sell the surgical gloves to external customers. As at August 31, revenue totaled EUR 24,245 thousand (previous year: EUR 45,825 thousand). As the revenue (of the continuing operation) and the cost of materials (of the discontinued operation) from this supply relationship still exist, the expense and income consolidation was not retained for this purpose. Taking into account the previous transfer prices up to August 31, 2023, this adjustment will result in a corresponding recognition of earnings in the respective business segments.\n\nThe consolidated income statement is thus extended in order to present the effects of the disposal of the Medical Sector as realistically as possible. In addition, all intra-Group charges between the continuing operation and the discontinued operation were eliminated in full. The primary expenses underlying the intra-Group charges were allocated to the divisions in accordance with the current contractual arrangements with Harps Global Pte. Ltd. In addition, EBITDA and EBIT were adjusted for the transaction costs of the discontinued operation in the amount of EUR 612 thousand (previous year: EUR 8,364 thousand). Transaction costs are presented in discontinued operations below earnings after taxes (see section 2.9).\n\nEBITDA in the \"Continuing operations\" column corresponds to EBITDA in the Semperit Group's consolidated income statement; the reconciliation to earnings before taxes can therefore be taken from the consolidated income statement. Please see section 2.9 for EBITDA related to discontinued operations. In addition to the revenue from the ongoing supply relationship between STP and Semperit Investment Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investments Asia Pte. Ltd.), the \"Adjustments\" column also includes the the suspension of scheduled depreciation and amortization that was not applied in internal segment reporting. Furthermore, the \"Adjustments\" column includes the transaction costs incurred, the effects of deconsolidation, and the reclassification of other comprehensive income to profit or loss, all of which, unlike internal segment reporting, are presented separately after tax in the discontinued operation's income statement.\n\nTrade working capital consists of inventories plus trade receivables, less current trade payables (also see section [4](#page-134-0)).\n\n### Geographic segmentation\n\nThe Group's activities are conducted primarily in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. In accordance with IFRS 8, the disclosures on revenue are presented by the customer's location and those on non-current assets and additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment are presented on the basis of the Semperit Group companies' locations.

Revenue\n\nRevenue is recognized using the transaction prices assigned to the performance obligations. Deductions are made for agreed rebates, volume and cash discounts, and similar sales reductions, as well as for contractual penalties and expected returns. These sales reductions are based on contractual agreements. All available information and historical values are taken into account when estimating the variable price components. As a rule, the amount delineated as a transaction price reduction is the amount that is likely to be claimed based on agreements or historical values; these estimates are updated regularly.\n\nA refund liability is recognized for potential returns and expected refunds on the basis of contracts or historical values over the past three years. Assets from return claims (refund assets) are recognized at the original carrying amount less expected costs for the return of the products and are presented in inventories.\n\nThe agreed transaction price is normally charged upon delivery. Revenue from deliveries must generally be recognized when economic control is transferred to the customer and therefore refers to a given date in accordance with the Incoterms agreed for the delivery of the goods. In the Rico business, revenue from toolmaking is recognized over time. This is done by applying the cost-to-cost method, which best reflects the manufactured tools' degree of completion. In this way, the expenses already incurred for customer tools are set in relation to the expected total order costs and the pro rata margin is realized over time based on the degree of completion.\n\nWith the production of injection molding tools in the Rico business, part of the revenue is generated with an amortization component. These injection molding tools are sold to customers at a reduced sales price. Higher sales prices for the series production of customer-specific finished products will be charged in return. Both, the receivable from the amortization component and the revenue from the injection molding tool are recognized at the non-reduced sales price. The receivable from the amortization component is subsequently reduced based on the added margin of the products sold from series production.\n\nThe payment targets normally granted are between 14 and 90 days.\n\nFor practical reasons, revenue has not been adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component if the period between satisfaction of the performance obligation and payment by the customer is not more than one year. As in the previous year, no revenue was generated in the 2023 fiscal year from contracts that included a significant financing component and for which the period between satisfaction of the performance obligation and payment by the customer is longer than one year.\n\nSome contracts are agreements with several components that, in addition to the sale of certain products, also include additional performance obligations such as services. In accordance with IFRS 15, the consideration is allocated to the components in line with the relative stand-alone selling prices, where appropriate.\n\nContractually agreed warranties, which represent a separate and identifiable performance obligation, are recognized pro rata over the warranty period from the date on which control of the product sold is transferred.\n\nContract performance costs exist in the form of tool costs that are paid by customers but not transferred to them. The tools are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of IAS 16, and depreciated over a useful life of one to ten years. These tools are offset by contract liabilities, which are recognized in revenue over the useful life of the tools.\n\nContract initiation costs, if material, are capitalized when the contract term exceeds twelve months. As in the previous year, there were no instances of such cases in the fiscal year 2023.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is broken down by division and geographic region, which is determined by the recipient of the invoice, as follows:\n\n| 1–12 2023 in EUR thousand | Semperit<br>Industrial<br>Applications | Semperit<br>Engineered<br>Applications | Surgical<br>Operations | Group   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Western Europe            | 215,964                                | 164,252                                | 0                      | 380,217 |\n| Asia                      | 22,436                                 | 67,063                                 | 39,317                 | 128,816 |\n| Eastern Europe            | 48,015                                 | 39,256                                 | 0                      | 87,271  |\n| North America             | 40,173                                 | 46,167                                 | 0                      | 86,339  |\n| Africa                    | 760                                    | 17,865                                 | 0                      | 18,624  |\n| Central and South America | 1,698                                  | 11,456                                 | 0                      | 13,154  |\n| Australia and Oceania     | 1,740                                  | 4,920                                  | 0                      | 6,660   |\n| Revenue                   | 330,786                                | 350,978                                | 39,317                 | 721,081 |\n\n| 1–12 2022 in EUR thousand | Semperit<br>Industrial<br>Applications | Semperit<br>Engineered<br>Applications | Surgical<br>Operations | Group   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Western Europe            | 308,284                                | 122,495                                | 24                     | 430,803 |\n| Asia                      | 25,536                                 | 57,638                                 | 45,825                 | 128,999 |\n| Eastern Europe            | 64,711                                 | 33,711                                 | 0                      | 98,422  |\n| North America             | 62,956                                 | 23,899                                 | 0                      | 86,855  |\n| Africa                    | 2,586                                  | 11,600                                 | 0                      | 14,186  |\n| Central and South America | 5,086                                  | 11,327                                 | 0                      | 16,412  |\n| Australia and Oceania     | 1,762                                  | 2,411                                  | 0                      | 4,173   |\n| Revenue                   | 470,919                                | 263,081                                | 45,848                 | 779,848 |\n\nThe revenue for Surgical Operations relates essentially to the supply relationship involving prepackaged surgical gloves between the Austrian production company and the Singaporean sales company (see sections 2.1 and 2.9).

Earnings after taxes from discontinued operations\n\nOn December 16, 2022, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the Semperit Group decided to sell the Sempermed business to Harps Global Pte. Ltd., which is based in Singapore and maintains production activities in Malaysia. Please see section 2.1 for a description of the Sempermed business activities. A corresponding sale and purchase agreement (SPA) was also signed on December 16, 2022. The strategic decision of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on January 28, 2020 to dispose of the Medical Sector, to focus on the Industrial Sector in future, and to complete the transformation into an industrial rubber and elastomer specialist was thus implemented. Completion of the transaction was subject to regulatory approval under investment control and competition law and will be implemented in two steps:\n\nThe (first) closing for the sale of the Medical business took place on August 31, 2023, and included the sale of the 100% stake in Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.), Singapore and in Sempermed Europe GmbH (now HARPS Europe GmbH), Austria, as well as certain intellectual property rights held by STP. The cash and debt free sales price of EUR 108,000 thousand is subject to the customary price adjustment mechanism at the time the transaction is effected. The final sales price was EUR 124,234 thousand. The amount of cash and cash equivalents in the deconsolidated subsidiaries was EUR 38,982 thousand. This transaction separated the Semperit Group from Examination Operations and comprised a total of 12 subsidiaries (see section 10.1).\n\nThe (second) closing for the sale of the Medical Sector will include the sale of the operation housed by STP to produce surgical gloves in Wimpassing, Austria, and the 100% stake in Sempermed Kft., which packages them in Sopron, Hungary. However, this Surgical Operations business will be continued by the Semperit Group as contract manufacturers for Harps Global Pte. Ltd. or Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) until its final sale. A contract manufacturing agreement was concluded for this purpose, which provides for the delivery of defined quantities at cost plus. The term of this contract manufacturing agreement includes several renewal options and will be up to five years. The (second) closing will not occur for the sale of the Medical Sector until the contract manufacturing agreement has ended or after the conclusion of a couse agreement for the Surgical Operations business in Wimpassing, Austria. The sale price (cash and debt free) is EUR 7,000 thousand and is subject to customary price adjustment mechanisms at the time the transaction is effected. The requirements for presentation as a discontinued operation had not been met for Surgical Operations as at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and the carrying amounts of the related assets have not yet been recognized as part of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe income statement for the discontinued operation is presented below:\n\n| in EUR thousand                                                                         | 1–12 2023 | 1–12 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                                                                 | 108,376   | 324,155   |\n| Changes in inventories                                                                  | –3,774    | –38,316   |\n| Own work capitalised                                                                    | 216       | 784       |\n| Operating revenue                                                                       | 104,817   | 286,624   |\n| Other operating income                                                                  | 400       | 365       |\n| Cost of material and purchased services                                                 | –93,620   | –213,212  |\n| Personnel expenses                                                                      | –19,113   | –35,388   |\n| Other operating expenses                                                                | –13,722   | –40,036   |\n| Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)                 | –21,238   | –1,647    |\n| Depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets and property, plant and<br>equipment | 0         | –21,369   |\n| Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment                       | 0         | –45,220   |\n| Reversal of impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment           | 1,570     | 40,262    |\n| Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)                                               | –19,668   | –27,974   |\n| Finance income                                                                          | 189       | 727       |\n| Finance expenses                                                                        | –40       | –49       |\n| Other financial result                                                                  | 141       | –288      |\n| Financial result                                                                        | 289       | 390       |\n| Earnings before taxes                                                                   | –19,379   | –27,584   |\n| Income taxes                                                                            | –239      | –8,148    |\n| Earnings after taxes                                                                    | –19,618   | –35,731   |\n| Transaction costs recognized                                                            | –612      | –8,364    |\n| Income taxes on transactions costs recognized                                           | 0         | 143       |\n| Result from deconsolidation                                                             | 1,833     | 0         |\n| Reclassification of other income to profit/loss for the period                          | –23,541   | 0         |\n| Subtotal                                                                                | –22,320   | –8,221    |\n| Result from discontinued operations                                                     | –41,938   | –43,952   |\n| thereof attributable to the shareholders of Semperit AG Holding                         | –41,672   | –43,889   |\n| thereof attributable to non-controlling interests                                       | –266      | –63       |\n\nThe discontinued operation's revenue comprises all external revenue of the deconsolidated company's Medical business from the (first) closing – so including the revenue from the sale of surgical gloves. The pre-packaged surgical gloves have been and will continue to be sold by STP to Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) until further notice and in future too. As the revenue (of the continuing operation) and the material expenses (of the discontinued operation) from this supply relationship will continue to exist due to the contract manufacturing agreement, an incremental approach was selected for the presentation, but the income and expense consolidation was not retained for this purpose. This adjustment led to the accurate recognition of earnings in both operations and extended the consolidated income statement in order to present the effects of the disposal of the Medical Sector as realistically as possible. The cost of manufacturing the packaged surgical gloves as well as the revenue from the supply relationship between STP and Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) remained in continuing operations; the cost of materials and purchased services from the supply relationship between STP and Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) as well as revenue with external customers remained under discontinued operations. In addition, all intra-Group charges between the \n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\ncontinuing operation and the discontinued operation were eliminated in full. The primary expenses underlying the intra-Group charges were allocated to the operations in accordance with the current contractual arrangements with Harps Global Pte. Ltd.\n\nThe effects of the transitional service framework agreement (TSFA) entered into with effect from August 31, 2023 were not reflected in the discontinued operation's presentation. Remaining overhead costs were recognized in continuing operations as before.\n\nThe cost of material and purchased services comprise the following:\n\n| in EUR thousand                      | 1–12 2023 | 1–12 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cost of materials                    | 68,032    | 165,089   |\n| Energy expenses                      | 23,849    | 45,291    |\n| Production-related maintenance costs | 1,531     | 2,533     |\n| Purchased services                   | 209       | 299       |\n| Total                                | 93,620    | 213,212   |\n\nPersonnel expenses comprise the following:\n\n| in EUR thousand                                                               | 1–12 2023 | 1–12 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wages                                                                         | 3,687     | 8,273     |\n| Salaries                                                                      | 11,078    | 20,433    |\n| Severance payments                                                            | 68        | 62        |\n| Retirement benefit expenses                                                   | 144       | 251       |\n| Statutory social security expenses and other compulsory wage-related payments | 2,256     | 2,764     |\n| Other social security expenses                                                | 1,879     | 3,604     |\n| Total                                                                         | 19,113    | 35,388    |\n\nThe average number of employees in Austria (full-time equivalents) was 23 in total (previous year: 23).

Consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nThe cash flow statement shall be prepared jointly for continuing and discontinued operations; no distinction is made between the cash flows of the individual businesses . Cash flows from the operating, investing, and financing activities of discontinued operations are disclosed in the notes (see section 2.9).\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities is determined using the indirect method. The measurement effects are presented under other non-cash expenses or income. These include, in particular, income from changes in exchange rates, the measurement of derivatives, reclassifications of (historical) foreign exchange rate differences in the consolidated income statement (recycling), as well as changes in loss allowances on inventories and trade receivables. Of the other non-cash income or expense of EUR –2,220 thousand (previous year: EUR 7,742 thousand), loss allowances on inventories accounted for a total EUR 937 thousand (previous year: EUR 5,955 thousand); of this, EUR –998 thousand (previous year: EUR 5,745 thousand) related to discontinued operations. A further EUR –2,309 thousand (previous year: EUR –519 thousand) was attributable to differences from foreign currency translation between Group companies and EUR –493 thousand (previous year: EUR 77 thousand) to loss allowances on trade receivables.\n\nThe cash flows from investing and financing activities are determined directly. Interest received is presented in the cash flows from investing activities, interest paid is presented in the cash flows from financing activities.\n\nAdditions of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment totaled EUR 66,177 thousand (previous year: EUR 53,870 thousand). Of this amount, EUR 4,326 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,802 thousand) relates to additions of right-of-use assets. Liabilities related to additions of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment increased by EUR 11,800 thousand (previous year: decrease by EUR 3,519 thousand), and prepayments increased by EUR 5,697 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,010 thousand). Capitalized interest on the assets in the amount of EUR 145 thousand (previous year: EUR 63 thousand) is shown in the cash flows from financing activities.\n\nThe non-current financial liabilities relate to bank financing in the amount of EUR 150,000 thousand for the acquisition of the Rico Group and EUR 33,000 thousand for the plant expansion at the site in Odry, the Czech Republic. In December 2023, EUR 40,000 thousand (previous year: n.a.) was repaid early from the above loan. In addition to the basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share, the dividend to SAG shareholders also includes an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share. In total, dividends of EUR 92,580 thousand were distributed to shareholders.

Non-current assets\n\n### <span id=\"page-120-1\"></span>3.1. Intangible assets\n\n### Acquired intangible assets\n\nAcquired intangible assets are recognized at cost and subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. The estimated useful life is normally in the range of one to fifteen years. Assumptions and estimates must be made when determining useful lives. Upon visible indications of a change in value, acquired intangible assets are tested for impairment (see section 3.2).\n\n### Internally generated intangible assets\n\nInternally generated intangible assets are recognized at cost. With regard to amortization and impairment testing, the explanation relating to acquired intangible assets above applies mutatis mutandis to internally generated intangible assets. Internally generated intangible assets essentially comprise software implementations and, to a minor extent, capitalizable development costs. The estimated useful life is generally eight years.\n\n### Intangible assets acquired through business combinations\n\nThe cost of intangible assets acquired through a business combination and recognized separately from any goodwill is the fair value of such assets at the acquisition date. These are specifically trademarks, technology-based intangible assets, and (non-) contractual customer relationships. The assumed useful lives are typically between five and 15 years for technology-based intangible assets and between one and 25 years for (non-) contractual customer relationships. Trademarks may be assumed to have an indefinite useful life and are subject to an annual impairment test. Otherwise, an impairment test is only performed for observable indications of a change in the value of intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations.\n\n### Emission allowances\n\nSTP and Semperflex Optimit s.r.o. (SFO) were originally subject to the respective emission allowance laws in Austria and the Czech Republic and received emission allowances free of charge from the government. The emission allowances were recognized at zero cost in the balance sheet (net method). Plants in STP (in 2020) and SFO (in 2021) fell outside of the scopes of the respective emission allowance laws due to the demolition of the respective thermal generation plants and measures aimed at reducing combustible heat capacities. The emission allowances held by the company STP were sold in the fiscal year 2022. The emission allowances held by the company SFO were sold in the fiscal year 2023 (see section 2.3). As at December 31, 2023, the Semperit Group held no emission allowances (previous year: 12,500 units).\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and additionally if there are indications of a possible impairment, provided that there are no circumstances that would allow forgoing the annual impairment test in accordance with IAS 36.\n\nIn the Semperit Group, the businesses are the lowest level (cash generating unit, CGU) at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The Hoses and Profiles business form the SIA division, and the Belting, Form, and Rico business form the SEA division.\n\nManagement determined the recoverable amount as at September 30, 2023 for the impairment test of goodwill in the amount of EUR 1,677 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,677 thousand) in the Hoses business (manufacture and sale of hydraulic and industrial hoses). The recoverable amount was calculated as value in use. The increased forecasting uncertainty due to a slowdown in economic development and geopolitical crises was countered by considering alternative planning scenarios (upside and downside scenarios). The products from the Hoses business are typically used in the agriculture, construction, food, and chemical industries and are exposed to their cyclical developments.\n\nFull customer inventories and the onset of a recession in the second half of fiscal year 2023 were the two main reasons for the drop in revenue in the 2023 fiscal year (see section 2.2). There are no signs of a significant recovery of the European market in the fiscal year 2024. The trend on the North American market is viewed more positively than that on the European market.\n\nThe planning scenarios differ from the base case scenario mainly in the assumptions for the different estimations of the market trend and consequently the annual growth rates in the production quantities. In addition, the downside scenario assumed a reduction in the gross margin by –150 basis points for the fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe key assumptions that were used in determining the recoverable amount of the Hoses business relate to the future development of the EBITDA margin. In the perpetual annuity phase (i.e., from fiscal year 2029), the EBITDA margin is around 23% (previous year: 22% from fiscal year 2028). The EBITDA margins in fiscal year 2028 differ only slightly depending on the planning scenarios and are around 23% (previous year: 22%). The planning was initially based on management's assumptions regarding the development of the markets, the market shares, and strategic product and customer initiatives. Management's medium-term planning is based on the continuation of the Hoses business successful niche strategy to focus exclusively on hose production and thereby distinguish itself from competitors who also produce or assemble fittings and lines or manufacture complete hydraulic systems.\n\nPlanned measures to improve earnings that require capacity expansion or infrastructure improvements as well as such measures that have yet to be sufficiently substantiated were not taken into account when determining the value in use. However, the new plant expansion in Odry, the Czech Republic, which is currently being implemented was taken into account: around EUR 110,000 thousand will be invested in hydraulic hose production over the next few years to expand capacity. Particular attention is being paid to meeting sustainability criteria and achieving a high degree of automation. In the fiscal year 2023, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board resolved to adjust the plant expansion plans in light of the economic slowdown: instead of the originally planned capacity increase of 32 million meters in hydraulic hoses, a capacity increase of \"just\" 24 million meters is now planned; the ramp-up of production facilities will be phased in from fiscal year 2025. In addition, the production of 3.6 million meters of flexible spiral hoses will be relocated from Wimpassing in Austria to Odry in the Czech Republic; the costs of this relocation of business activities were adequately covered by a restructuring provision. The adjustments to the plant expansion plans were taken into account in the impairment test. The new production plants are operated exclusively using green energy and are therefore low in emissions. The total water consumption at the Odry location will drop by around 40–50% after completion of the new production facilities, irrespective of the capacity \n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nexpansion. The capital expenditure on property, plant, and equipment is intended to maintain capacity; it roughly corresponds to planned depreciation. Changes to trade working capital are planned on the basis of revenue.\n\nThe cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2029 were extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%). The growth rate reflects the competition and the price pressure on the market as well as an assumption of moderate market growth. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was determined as the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model. A uniform peer group was assumed for the Hoses, Profiles, Belting, and Form business. The pre-tax discount rate calculated for the Hoses business is 10.5% (previous year: 12.3%). The after-tax discount rate is 8.8% (previous year: 9.5%).\n\nThe recoverability of the recognized goodwill was confirmed in the course of the impairment test for the Hoses business.\n\nManagement determined the recoverable amount as at September 30, 2023 for the impairment test of goodwill in the amount of EUR 49,358 thousand in the Rico business (manufacture of injection molding tools, manufacture of plastic parts, in particular, from liquid silicone and solid silicone in single, two, or multi-component injection molding, and their distribution). The recoverable amount was calculated as value in use. The Rico business products are used especially in the automotive and medical technology industries, as well as in the consumer and household goods industries. The increased forecasting uncertainty due to the economic slowdown and geopolitical crises was countered by considering alternative planning scenarios (upside and downside scenarios).\n\nThe planning scenarios differ from the base case scenario mainly in the assumptions for the different estimations of the market trend and consequently the annual growth rates in the production quantities (i.e., the plastic parts requested by customers and the sales of injection molding tools).\n\nThe key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount of the Rico business relate to the ramp-up of production facilities from the expansion of capacity, which the SAG Executive Board and Supervisory Board committed to in the course of the acquisition, the increased activity on the US market, and the future development of the EBITDA margin. In the perpetual annuity phase (i.e., from fiscal year 2029), the EBITDA margin is around 25% (previous year: n.a.). The EBITDA margins in fiscal year 2028 differ only slightly depending on the planning scenarios and are around 24% in the downside scenario and 26% in the upside scenario. The planning was based on management's assumptions regarding the development of the markets, the market shares, and strategic product and customer initiatives with respect to the production of injection molding tools, as well as advice on component development and the mass production of customer-specific plastic parts. Management's mediumterm planning focuses on consolidating and expanding its technological edge in the production of high-cavity injection molds, automation, and problem-solving expertise. In addition, the focus is on strengthening sales and expanding geographically in relation to this.\n\nPlanned measures to improve earnings that require capacity expansion or infrastructure improvements as well as such measures that have yet to be sufficiently substantiated were not taken into account when determining the value in use. However, the plant expansion in Thalheim, Austria, which is currently being implemented, as well as further capacity expansion with a total investment volume of around EUR 39,800 thousand by fiscal year 2028 were taken into account. The capital expenditure on property, plant, and equipment is intended to maintain capacity; it roughly corresponds to planned depreciation. Changes to trade working capital are planned on the basis of revenue.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe cash flows after fiscal year 2029 were extrapolated based on a sustainable growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: n.a.). The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was determined as the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model. A separate peer group was formed for the Rico business. The pre-tax discount rate calculated for the Rico business is 9.9% (previous year: n.a.). The after-tax discount rate is 8.3% (previous year: n.a.).\n\nThe recoverability of the recognized goodwill was confirmed in the course of the impairment test for the Rico business.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Development of intangible assets\n\nThe development of intangible assets is as follows:\n\n|

technology-based intangible assets of EUR 17,718 thousand (previous year: n.a.), and trademarks of EUR 9,848 thousand (previous year: n.a.), which were identified in connection with the allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of the Rico Group. Indefinite useful lives were assumed for the Rico Group's trademarks because the brand names are very well established in the respective product markets and have clear brand attributes. The Semperit Group will therefore continue to use the brand names for an indefinite period of time and continue to expand the new Rico business under these brand names. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of these trademarks totaled EUR 9,848 thousand (previous year: n.a.). The recoverability of the recognized trademarks was confirmed while conducting separate impairment tests. The impairment test was carried out methodically in line with the determination of fair value as part of the purchase price allocation (see section 1.6).\n\n### 3.2. Property, plant, and equipment\n\n<span id=\"page-125-0\"></span>Property, plant, and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nThey are amortized by allocating the cost less their expected residual value on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. Assumptions and estimates have to be made when determining the useful lives, which are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary.\n\nThe assumed useful lives of each category of property, plant and equipment are within the following ranges:\n\n| Property, plant and equipment excluding right-of-use assets | Useful life<br>in years |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Technical plants and other operating buildings              | 2–50                    |\n| Technical equipment and machinery                           | 1–40                    |\n| Operating and office equipment                              | 1–46                    |\n| Vehicles                                                    | 2–25                    |\n\nThe assumed useful lives of the right-of-use assets included in property, plant, and equipment are within the following ranges:\n\n| Right-of-use assets                                          | Useful life<br>in years |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Land and buildings, including on land owned by third parties | 2–20                    |\n| Technical equipment and machinery                            | 2–5                     |\n| Operating and office equipment                               | 3–8                     |\n| Vehicles                                                     | 2–7                     |\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Impairment tests\n\nIf there are observable indications of impairment, items of property, plant and equipment are tested pursuant to IAS 36 as to whether the carrying amount of the asset or the cash generating unit in question exceeds the recoverable amount. An appropriate impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The assessment of recoverability and determination of the recoverable amount are subject to significant estimates and assumptions. In particular, these include assumptions about corporate planning, future inflation, and growth rates, as well as regarding foreign currency rates, the cost of capital rate used to discount future cash flows, the expected economic development of each individual cash generating unit, as well as with regard to the separate recoverable amounts for individual assets as the lower limit of an impairment loss.\n\nRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities were taken into account during impairment testing in accordance with IFRS 16. The carrying amount of the cash generating unit contains the right-of-use assets; it is reduced by the carrying amount of the lease liabilities. The recoverable amount as the total value of the cash generating unit includes the present value of the cash flows, which is reduced by the lease payments.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Development of property, plant, and equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment developed as follows:\n\n|

11,060 thousand (previous year: EUR 4,079 thousand) relates to land (basic value).\n\nBorrowing costs were capitalized in the fiscal year 2023 as part of the cost of qualifying assets in the amount of EUR 285 thousand (previous year: n.a.) for the expansion of the production facility in Thalheim, Austria. In addition, EUR 141 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand) was capitalized as part of the expansion of a production hall in Odry, the Czech Republic. In both cases, the borrowing costs directly attributable to production were capitalized.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, property, plant, and equipment with a carrying amount of EUR 23,422 thousand (previous year: n.a.) in the Rico business were pledged as security for liabilities.\n\nA new production facility in the United States belonging to the Profiles business was opened in the fiscal year 2021. The ownership rights to the newly constructed production line of US-based Semperit Industrial Products Inc. were then conveyed to the Coweta County Development Authority, Georgia, in order to optimize property-related taxes. At the same time, the company purchased a municipal revenue bond issued by the Development Authority to finance the transaction and entered into a lease agreement for the use of the transferred production line. The nominal amount of the bond as at December 31, 2023 translated into EUR 7,025 thousand and was increased by investments of EUR 433 thousand made in the fiscal year 2023. The bond will be repaid with the lease payments. The business may transfer the bond to the Development Authority at any time, or at the latest at the end of the term, and thereby reacquire the ownership rights to the production line. There are no cash flows because the company is both the lessee and the bondholder. From an economic perspective, therefore, neither a sale-and-lease-back agreement nor a revenue bond was concluded or recognized. The production line for rubber gaskets will continue to be recognized in property, plant and equipment.\n\n### Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Semperit Group is a lessee in particular with regard to right-of-use assets related to land and buildings, office equipment, and motor vehicles.\n\nAs the lessee, the Semperit Group recognizes a lease liability for leases that must be recognized as an other financial liability and a right-of-use asset under property, plant, and equipment at the time the leased asset is made available to the company. The lease liability bears interest and is amortized on an annuity basis by the current payments; the right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life or lease term.\n\nThe option not to apply the lease accounting requirement to short-term leases (i.e., up to 12 months), to leased assets of low value (i.e., up to a replacement value of approximately EUR 5 thousand), and to intangible assets is exercised. The Semperit Group therefore does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these types of contracts; lease payments from these contracts are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe right-of-use assets from leases included in property, plant, and equipment developed as follows in fiscal year 2023:\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                             | Land and<br>buildings,<br>including on<br>land owned by |

The fair values of securities are determined using publicly available prices.\n\nThe derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss are forward exchange contracts.\n\nIn addition to operational measures, individual derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge foreign currency risks. They are measured at the current fair value. The fair value corresponds to the value that the respective Group company would receive or have to pay if the transaction were terminated on the reporting date. Positive fair values as at the reporting date are presented under other financial assets and negative fair values under other financial liabilities. If the requirements for hedge accounting are met, this is applied in part. Recognition is as described in section [6.4](#page-147-0) depending on whether it is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge.\n\n### Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nFor all financial assets not measured at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3.4. Assets held for sale and provisions and liabilities held for sale\n\nUnder IFRS 5, all those long-term assets and disposal groups that can be disposed of in their current condition and are very likely to be disposed of within 12 months due to the management's properly documented intention to dispose shall be classified as held for sale. Non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAssets and liabilities related to the production of examination gloves and the production of porcelain dip moldings for the manufacture of gloves in Malaysia, as well as to the worldwide sales and distribution organizations of the Medical Sector, form discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement and a disposal group in the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2022. The disposal group's assets shall be presented under the Assets held for sale item and the liabilities under the Provisions and liabilities held for sale item. All assets and substantially all liabilities of discontinued operations were disposed of as of the (first) closing of the sale of the Medical Sector on August 31, 2023. The Provisions and liabilities held for sale item includes liabilities that are expected to mature in summer 2024. Please see section 2.9 for the deconsolidation result realized in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nOn December 4, 2023, the Executive Board resolved to sell the property together with the building located on it belonging to Semperit Profiles Leeser GmbH in Dalheim, Germany, in the course of the merger of the company's operations with the Hückelhoven site. After the removal of the machinery and technical equipment in the fourth quarter of 2023, the property was in a condition that could be sold immediately under current and customary conditions and was therefore presented as held for sale for the first time as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe non-current assets held for sale, outside the discontinued operation's disposal group, by the Semperit Group are as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                                        | Business | Asset                                               | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Semperit Profiles Leeser GmbH,<br>Hückelhoven, Germany | Profiles | Land                                                | 158        | 0          |\n|                                                        |          | Buildings                                           | 373        | 0          |\n|                                                        |          | Other equipment, operating,<br>and office equipment | 11         | 0          |\n| Total                                                  |          |                                                     | 541        | 0          |\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>4. Trade working capital\n\nTrade working capital consists of inventories, current trade receivables, and current trade payables.\n\n### 4.1. Inventories\n\nInventories must be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, whereby, in the course of determining the net sales values, in particular realization risks related to obsolete or surplus inventories are taken into account. Utilization is determined using the moving average price method. Income and expenses from intercompany deliveries of inventories are eliminated unless they are of minor significance.\n\n| in EUR thousand                         | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Finished goods and merchandise          | 50,811     | 51,645     |\n| Raw materials, consumables and supplies | 42,182     | 58,568     |\n| Work in progress                        | 17,079     | 17,945     |\n| Prepayments                             | 662        | 9          |\n| Refund assets                           | 26         | 47         |\n| Total                                   | 110,760    | 128,214    |\n\n| in EUR thousand                 | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|---------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Inventories                     |            |            |\n| thereof at cost                 | 82,644     | 104,025    |\n| thereof at net realisable value | 28,116     | 24,189     |\n| Total                           | 110,760    | 128,214    |\n\nNet realizable values as part of the inventory measurement on the reporting date are determined based on specific customer contracts or, in the absence of such contracts, existing list prices; the relevant business management also assesses recoverable prices and market developments. These are evaluated regularly and adjusted as necessary. The net Inventory write-downs recognised as an expense were EUR 1,936 thousand (previous year: EUR 209 thousand).\n\n### 4.2. Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables, which essentially originate from revenue with the Semperit Group's customers, must be allocated to the AC (at cost) measurement category in accordance with IFRS 9 and are therefore measured at amortized cost less expected defaults.\n\nUnder a factoring program concluded on December 29, 2023, trade receivables from STP in Austria, SFO in the Czech Republic, and Sempertrans Belchatów Sp.z.o.o. (STB) in Poland can be sold to a German factoring bank until a maximum amount of EUR 75,000 thousand. The purchase price of the receivables sold is equal to the nominal value, so there is no earnings effect on derecognition. The delcredere risk is transferred to the factoring bank, but only the payment date risk and interest rate risk remained partially within the Semperit Group. The requirements for a complete derecognition of the trade receivables sold under the factoring program are met in accordance with IFRS 9. Interest on factoring is recognized in interest expense.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, trade receivables of EUR 0 thousand (previous year: n.a.) were sold to the factoring bank. In the fiscal year 2023, no interest expense was incurred for factoring (previous year: n.a.)\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n### The trade receivables comprise the following:\n\n|                           |        | 12.31.2023 |        |  |        | 12.31.2022 |        |  |\n|---------------------------|--------|------------|--------|--|--------|------------|--------|--|\n| in EUR thousand           | Gross  | Allowances | Net    |  | Gross  | Allowances | Net    |  |\n| Receivables not yet due   | 69,740 | -11        | 69,728 |  | 71,472 | -41        | 71,430 |  |\n| Up to 30 days overdue     | 10,596 | -1         | 10,595 |  | 12,884 | -134       | 12,750 |  |\n| 30 to 90 days overdue     | 5,100  | -5         | 5,095  |  | 2,995  | -44        | 2,951  |  |\n| More than 90 days overdue | 1,486  | -831       | 656    |  | 2,688  | -959       | 1,730  |  |\n| Total                     | 86,922 | -848       | 86,074 |  | 90,039 | -1,178     | 88,861 |  |\n\nInternal measurement guidelines are used to assess creditworthiness. When determining the extent of the impairment need, the Semperit Group assesses the defaults from the past four years by business and country groups and uses this analysis to create an impairment matrix based on time ranges.This impairment matrix is updated to include forward-looking macroeconomic variables. Payment defaults for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 as forecast by the credit insurer Allianz Trade were also taken into consideration in the calculation of the impairment matrix. The analysis of the past did not identify an elevated default risk for receivables that are overdue by more than 90 days. As a result, the Group does not deem overdue status of more than 90 days to be an indicator that a loss event has occurred, which would imply an allocation to stage 3 of the impairment model according to IFRS 9. Loss events are, for example, a significant downgrade of creditworthiness by credit rating agencies, the commissioning of collection services, or the insolvency of the customer.\n\nAs of the reporting date, the newly acquired subsidiaries belonging to the Rico business had not yet been integrated into the Semperit Group's credit insurance regime. Credit insurance, bank guarantees, secure payment terms, and bank acceptance drafts are in place for a significant portion of the remaining gross trade receivables (90.3% and 77.2%, including the Rico Group; previous year: 92.8%). The credit insurances include a deductible if a loss occurs. The maximum loss allowance recognized for a credit loss is the insurance deductible for these receivables. In the case of payments from credit insurance, the insured receivable is derecognized in accordance with the payment amount under other operating expenses. The payments from the credit insurance are presented in other operating income.\n\nReceivables not covered by credit insurance, or deductibles for receivables covered by credit insurance, are written down based on empirical values in accordance with the default risk categories in the impairment matrix (stage 2 of the impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9). Receivables allocated to stage 3 of the impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 based on an individual assessment of the creditworthiness of the relevant customers are also written down to the expected recoverable amount.\n\nWith the exception of the newly acquired subsidiaries belonging to the Rico business, the overdue receivables are essentially covered by credit insurance, as all subsidiaries with significant receivables hold credit insurance. With respect to the receivables not covered by credit insurance and to the deductibles for receivables covered by credit insurance, there is no significant concentration of credit risk as the customers are widely dispersed.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe impairment losses in level 2 amounting to EUR 101 thousand (previous year: EUR 22 thousand) are based on the following impairment matrix:\n\n### 12.31.2023\n\n|          | Not overdue | 1–30 days  | 31–90 days | >90 days   |\n|----------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Hoses    | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.01% | 0.00–0.17% | 0.00–0.14% |\n| Profiles | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.34% | 0.00–3.10% | 0.00–2.65% |\n| Form     | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.03% | 0.00–0.30% | 0.00–0.81% |\n| Belting  | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.07% | 0.00–0.20% | 0.00–0.06% |\n| Surgical | 0.00–0.00%  | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% |\n| Rico     | 0.00–0.00%  | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.07% | 0.00–0.30% |\n\n### 12.31.2022\n\n|          | Not overdue | 1–30 days  | 31–90 days | >90 days   |\n|----------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Hoses    | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.03% | 0.00–0.29% | 0.00–0.42% |\n| Profiles | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.27% | 0.00–2.50% | 0.00–2.14% |\n| Form     | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.05% | 0.00–0.44% | 0.00–1.18% |\n| Belting  | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.05% | 0.00–0.10% | 0.00–0.03% |\n| Surgical | 0.00–0.00%  | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% |\n| Rico     | n.a.        | n.a.       | n.a.       | n.a.       |\n\nThe ranges arise from the geographic regions where the revenue is generated.

In fiscal year 2023, trade receivables of EUR 429 thousand (previous year: EUR 194 thousand), which were not written down, were derecognized.\n\n### 4.3. Trade payables\n\nTrade payables must be allocated to the AC (atcost) measurement category in accordance with IFRS 9 and are therefore measured at cost.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of current and non-current trade payables totaled EUR 69,187 thousand (previous year:EUR 63,942 thousand).\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-139-0\"></span>5. Equity\n\n### 5.1. Share capital and reserves\n\n### Share capital\n\nThe share capital of SAG as at December 31, 2023 remained unchanged compared to the previous year at EUR 21,359 thousand. This is broken down into 20,573,434 fully paid-in no-par value ordinary shares of which each has an equal participation in the share capital. Each share is entitled to a voting right and to receive a dividend.\n\nThe Executive Board was authorized by the Annual General Meeting on April 25, 2023 with the agreement of the Supervisory Board to increase the share capital by 50% or up to 10,286,716 new no-par-value shares over the next five years following registration of the change to the Articles of Incorporation on the Company Register, through cash and/or non-cash contributions. The Executive Board was also authorized to issue convertible bonds with agreement from the Supervisory Board. This may be linked to a right of conversion or purchase or a mandatory conversion or purchase of up to 10,286,716 no-par-value shares (50% of the existing shares) in the company.\n\nThe Executive Board was authorized by the Annual General Meeting on July 27, 2022 to buy back and, if necessary, to redeem the company's treasury shares up to the legally permissible amount of 10% of the share capital for a period of 30 months from the date that the resolution was passed in the Annual General Meeting pursuant to Section 65(1) No. 8 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG) with agreement from the Supervisory Board. At the same Annual General Meeting, the Executive Board was also authorized, pursuant to Section 65(1b) Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to decide on a different type of sale than via the stock exchange or through a public offering, and to decide on an exclusion of the buyback option (purchase right) on the part of shareholders. There is currently no share buyback program.\n\n### Capital reserves\n\nThe capital reserves result primarily from the amount generated beyond the proportional amount of the share capital following the issue of shares (share premium). Capital reserves also include EUR 21,503 thousand in appropriated reserves as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 21,503 thousand). These may only be released to offset any net loss otherwise stated in the SAG annual financial statements under corporate law, unless there are any free reserves available to cover such a loss.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Revenue reserves\n\nRevenue reserves contain the retained results of the Semperit Group and the accumulated other comprehensive income (excluding currency translation differences).\n\nThe distribution of revenue reserves is as follows:\n\n### Revenue reserves\n\n|                            | Retained<br>earnings | IAS-19-<br>reserve | Total   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|---------|\n| in TEUR                    |                      |                    |         |\n| Balance as at 01.01.2022   | 526,990              | -14,774            | 512,216 |\n| Earnings after taxes       | -5,529               | 0                  | -5,529  |\n| Other comprehensive income |                      | 6,309              | 6,309   |\n| Total comprehensive income | -5,529               | 6,309              | 780     |\n| Dividend                   | -30,860              | 0                  | -30,860 |\n| Balance as at 12.31.2022   | 490,601              | -8,464             | 482,136 |\n| Balance as at 01.01.2023   | 490,601              | -8,464             | 482,136 |\n| Earnings after taxes       | -16,807              | 0                  | -16,807 |\n| Other comprehensive income |                      | -1,195             | -1,195  |\n| Total comprehensive income | -16,807              | -1,195             | -18,002 |\n| Dividend                   | -92,580              | 0                  | -92,580 |\n| Balance as at 12.31.2023   | 381,213              | -9,659             | 371,554 |\n\nRevenue reserves include, inter alia, the SAG statutory reserve of EUR 999 thousand (previous year: EUR 999 thousand), which may only be released to offset any net loss otherwise stated in the annual financial statements under corporate law. The fact that free reserves are available to offset the loss is no obstacle to the release for the purposes of offsetting the loss.\n\nThe IAS 19 reserve includes the effects of remeasurements of defined benefit plans due to severance payments and pensions.\n\n### Currency translation reserve\n\nThe currency translation reserve records translation differences resulting from converting the subsidiaries' financial statements from their functional currency to euros until the subsidiaries in question are sold or disposed of by other means.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, currency differences totaled EUR 17,662 thousand (previous year: EUR 8,137 thousand). Of this amount, EUR 23,541 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand) was reclassified, i.e., \"recycled\" to the consolidated income statement in fiscal year 2023. Hence other comprehensive income as at December 31, 2023 that will be recognized through profit or loss in future periods totaled EUR 10,891 thousand (previous year: EUR –6,825 thousand).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 5.2. Non-controlling interests\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, all non-controlling interests related to discontinued operations, namely Latexx Partners Berhad (LPB, Group share: 97.36%) and FormTech Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd (FTE, Group share: 69.88%). Both subsidiaries were deconsolidated on the occasion of the (first) closing of the sale of the Medical Sector. No dividends were distributed to the non-controlling interests in fiscal year 2023 (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\n### 5.3. Dividends and treasury shares\n\nThe shareholders are entitled to a distribution of SAG's net profit for the year. The Executive Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share, meaning a total of EUR 10,287 thousand, which is still to be approved at the Annual General meeting and is therefore not yet recognized.\n\nDistributions for fiscal year 2022 were made in May and September 2023 and totaled EUR 92,580 thousand. A basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share was paid in May 2023, and an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share was paid in September 2023.\n\nThe Semperit Group did not hold any own shares as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022 .\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-142-0\"></span>6. Net debt\n\nThe net debt of EUR 192,411 thousand (previous year: EUR –9,243 thousand) is made up of the liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests, financial liabilities, and other financial liabilities, less other financial assets (current), and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### 6.1. Liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests\n\n<span id=\"page-142-1\"></span>Shares of subsidiaries' net assets held by non-controlling shareholders are recognized as liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests if the respective shareholder has an unconditional termination right or a termination right linked to conditions whose fulfilment or non-fulfilment lies outside the control of the Semperit Group, or if the company in which the non-controlling shareholder owns an interest has a limited life span.\n\nThe liability was initially recognized at fair value. As IFRS do not provide any guidance on the subsequent measurement of such an obligation, the amount of the liability initially recognized is increased by the share in profit or reduced by the share in loss accruing at the measurement date in accordance with the option described in the statement issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW RS HFA 45). In this connection, this share of profit or loss also includes the share in other comprehensive income. In addition, any amounts reported directly in equity are included in the measurement of the liability. Dividends distributed to non-controlling shareholders reduce the liabilities. The amounts recognized as part of the subsequent measurement are recognized in the consolidated income statement and constitute finance expenses. This is disclosed separately as results attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\nThe pro-rata cash flows relevant to measurement were derived from the latest medium-term financial planning to determine the fair value (stage 3) of the redeemable non-controlling interests of SAC, Thailand. The detailed planning period runs until the end of fiscal year 2028. The pro-rata cash flows relevant to measurement after fiscal year 2029 were extrapolated based on a sustainable growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%). The growth rate reflected the competition and the price pressure in the market as well as an assumption of moderate market growth. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was determined as the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model. The after-tax discount rate is 9.8% (previous year: 10.5%). The main assumptions used in determining the fair value relate in particular to the market-dependent future development of the EBITDA margin.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nLiabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests changed as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying amount 01.01.                       | 18,907 | 17,536 |\n| Dividends                                    | −6,482 | −5,705 |\n| Share of annual income after tax             | 2,892  | 6,684  |\n| Currency translation differences             | −592   | 392    |\n| Carrying amount 31.12.                       | 14,725 | 18,907 |\n| thereof Semperflex Asia Corp.

Financial liabilities\n\nBoth corporate Schuldschein loans and liabilities to banks are initially recognized at their fair value net of transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method.\n\nThey are derecognized if and when the underlying obligation is settled or terminated or has expired.\n\n| in EUR thousand             | 12.31.2023 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current | 12.31.2022 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | 38,392     | 37,970                 | 422                | 52,457     | 37,956                 | 14,501             |\n| Liabilities to banks        | 189,430    | 181,196                | 8,235              | 3          | 0                      | 3                  |\n| Total                       | 227,822    | 219,165                | 8,657              | 52,460     | 37,956                 | 14,503             |\n\n### Corporate Schuldschein loans\n\nBetween 2013 and 2016, SAG issued several corporate Schuldschein loans, some with fixed and some with variable-interest rates, in euros (EUR) as well as in the foreign currencies US dollars (USD), Polish zloty (PLN), and Czech crown (CZK).

Disclosures on financial instruments – liabilities\n\n<sup>1</sup> FVPL (at fair value through profit and loss); AC (at amortized cost).\n\n### Liabilities at fair value\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used in isolated cases to hedge against interest rate risks. The derivative financial instruments are accounted for either as cash flow hedges or as fair value hedges, provided both the prospective effectiveness measurements under IFRS 9 are carried out and the hedging strategy documentation requirements are met. There were no derivatives designated as hedging instruments, neither as at 31 December 2023 nor as at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe financial instruments measured at fair value are derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments on December 31, 2023 relate to a contingent purchase price liability from the M+R acquisition on January 4, 2021 (see section 6.3).\n\nThe fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts are determined using accepted actuarial measurement models. Future payment flows are simulated using the yield curves published on the reporting date. In addition, the carrying amount is adjusted to take into account the credit risk of the respective counterparty. When doing so, positive exposures are measured considering the default risk of the counterparty, while negative exposures are measured considering the Group's own default risk. The contingent purchase price liability is calculated using the future development of the business activities of M+R and is discounted at a customary market cost of equity. It is measured at fair value through profit or loss and reported as a derivative in other non-current financial liabilities.\n\n### Liabilities at amortized cost\n\nThe fair values correspond to the carrying amounts for all financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of those stated below and the liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests (see section [6.1](#page-142-1)). Actuarial measurement models are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which no active market is available. The parameters relevant to measurement for determining fair value are based in part on forward-looking assumptions.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand             | Measurement<br>category<br>according<br>IFRS 91 | Level | Fair value<br>12.31.2023 | Fair value<br>12.31.2022 |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Liabilities                 |                                                 |       |                          |                          |\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | AC                                              | 3     | 37,445                   | 50,052                   |\n| Liabilities to banks        | AC                                              | 3     | 190,771                  | 3                        |\n\n<sup>1</sup> AC (at amortized cost)\n\nThe fair value of the corporate Schuldschein loans and fixed-interest bank financing was determined by discounting the contractual payment streams with current interest rates. The comparable interest rates on the reporting date were derived from capital market yields with matching terms and then adjusted for current risk and liquidity costs that are observable on the market, and determined in a range of 1.68–5.81% (previous year: 3.41–8.47%). These comparable interest rates were derived based on management's current assessment of the rating of the Semperit Group using a Moody's methodology.. The difference between the carrying amount and the fair value is the result of the significant volatility in the banks' refinancing costs (as part of the cost of corporate financing through banks) since the corporate Schuldschein loans were issued due to the measures taken by the European Central Bank (ECB), such as medium-term refinancing tenders for banks at extremely low interest rates and the ECB's quantitative easing measures, which led to considerably volatile risk premiums. In addition, several clauses in the corporate Schuldschein loan contract are worded in the Semperit Group's favor. For variable-interest bank financing, fair value is the carrying amount.\n\n### <span id=\"page-148-0\"></span>6.5.

Cash and cash equivalents\n\n| in EUR thousand        | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash on hand           | 15         | 7          |\n| Cash deposits in banks | 101,299    | 80,898     |\n| Short-term deposits    | 11,357     | 25,727     |\n| Total                  | 112,671    | 106,631    |\n\nShort-term investments are cash equivalents and consist of fixed-time deposits with a remaining term of no more than three months from the date of acquisition amounting to EUR 9,205 thousand (previous year: EUR 22,940 thousand) and of money market fund units of EUR 2,152 thousand (previous year: EUR 2,787 thousand). The fixed-time deposits are comprised of EUR 750 thousand in euros (previous year: EUR 20,000 thousand), EUR 4,896 thousand in Indian rupees (INR) (previous year: EUR 2,722 thousand), EUR 318 thousand in Chinese renminbi (CNY) (previous year: EUR 217 thousand), and EUR 3,240 thousand in Swiss francs (CHF) (previous year: EUR 0 thousand). These items enable the Semperit Group to meet short-term payment obligations and minimize the interest rate risk. As a result, they are not typically held for investment or other purposes.\n\nThe assessment of whether money market fund units are to be classified as cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7 requires discretionary judgment. Cash equivalents refer to short-term, highly liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are only subject to immaterial risks of fluctuations in terms of their value; equity investments are generally not classified as cash equivalents, unless they are such investments by their very nature. The investments made by the Semperit Group in the CIFM RMB money market funds were classified as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. This classification was based on an analysis of the fund characteristics and their integration into the Semperit Group's cash management or liquidity management. An assessment of whether the financial investment is highly liquid or not took into account the redemption options and the fund's liquidity. Given that classification as cash equivalents also requires the financial investment to be able to be converted directly into a payment amount already determined when the deposit is made, money market fund units cannot be classified as cash equivalents on their own as they can be traded at any time on an active market at the respective market price. As for assessing the immateriality of risks of fluctuations in terms of their value, the Semperit Group is continuously analyzing whether the variability of returns is small and comparable to the variability of returns for the money market interest rate, the \"PBOC (People's Bank of China) 7 Days Deposit Rate\". This assessment also takes into account the fund's rigorous investment policy, the weighted average fixed-interest period of the fund portfolio (well below three months), the fund's risk and volatility exposure, and its high diversification and issuer spread along with the fund's strong credit rating. The money market fund units are an integral part of the Semperit Group's payment and liquidity management measures.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 7. Provisions\n\n### <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>7.1. Retirement benefit expenses, provisions for pensions and severance payments\n\n### Retirement benefit plans – defined benefit plans\n\nIn the case of defined benefit plans, the cost of providing the benefit is calculated using the projected unit credit method (PUC); for this purpose, an actuarial assessment is carried out at each reporting date. All remeasurement results of plan assets and obligations, especially actuarial gains and losses, are reported directly in equity under other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe provision recognized in the balance sheet for defined benefit plans equals the present value of the benefits accruing to the employees on the reporting date, less the fair value of any plan assets required to settle the obligation as at the reporting date.\n\n### Pension commitments\n\nBased on an existing SAG and STP pension statute, company pensions are granted to employees who joined the company before January 1, 1991 in the form of a fixed amount, with this amount being dependent on the relevant employee's number of years of service. The statute stipulates that only retired former employees or their surviving dependents are now entitled to these pensions. The obligations of this statute are not funded by plan assets.\n\nA number of former members of the Executive Board have been granted pensions under individual pension agreements. These liabilities are not covered by pension plan assets either.\n\n### Severance payment commitments\n\nDepending on their length of service, most employees in Austria, France, India, Poland, Switzerland, and Thailand are legally entitled to a one-off payment, particularly on retirement.\n\nThe benefits due on retirement are considered to be payments due following termination of the employment relationship in accordance with IAS 19. These liabilities are not funded by plan assets.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Overview of the carrying amounts of the pension and severance payment provisions\n\nThe carrying amounts of pension and severance payment provisions are distributed across the individual countries as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                      | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Austria – pensions                   | 9,964      | 9,819      |\n| Austria – severance payments         | 12,948     | 12,913     |\n| Germany – pensions                   | 2,035      | 2,099      |\n| Switzerland – pensions               | 424        | 0          |\n| Other countries – severance payments |            |            |\n| France                               | 1,055      | 953        |\n| Switzerland                          | 211        | 0          |\n| Poland                               | 182        | 130        |\n| India                                | 157        | 148        |\n| Thailand                             | 565        | 578        |\n| Total                                | 27,542     | 26,641     |\n\n### Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe most important actuarial parameters for the defined benefit pension and severance payment plans are as follows.

Sensitivities were determined based on the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the provisions for pensions and severance payments, with one parameter changing in each case. The other parameters remained unchanged. If the change of the parameter results in a negative interest rate, then this is used for the calculation.\n\nThe impact of changes to these parameters – plus/minus one percentage point with regard to the interest rate and increases in wages and salaries, and plus/minus one year with regard to life expectancy – on the present value of pension obligations of EUR 18,359 thousand (previous year: EUR 11,999 thousand) and on the present value of severance payment liabilities of EUR 15,118 thousand (previous year: EUR 14,722 thousand) were as follows:\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nPresent value of obligation\n\n|                       |                        | (DBO) 12.31.2023         |                          | (DBO) 12.31.2022         |                          |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| in EUR thousand       | Change in parameter    | Increase in<br>parameter | Decrease in<br>parameter | Increase in<br>parameter | Decrease in<br>parameter |\n| Pensions              |                        |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Interest rate         | +/- 1 percentage point | 11,238                   | 14,295                   | 11,173                   | 12,952                   |\n| Increases in salaries | +/- 1 percentage point | 13,343                   | 11,757                   | 12,749                   | 11,343                   |\n| Life expectancy       | +/- 1 year             | 13,062                   | 11,965                   | 12,530                   | 11,485                   |\n| Severance payments    |                        |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Interest rate         | +/- 1 percentage point | 13,745                   | 16,400                   | 13,564                   | 16,041                   |\n| Increases in salaries | +/- 1 percentage point | 16,073                   | 14,087                   | 15,948                   | 13,628                   |\n\nPresent value of obligation\n\n### Retirement benefit plans – defined contribution plans\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense if the employees have actually completed the service obliging the company to make this contribution.\n\nSAG is required to contribute to a pension fund for all current members of the Executive Board. An amount fixed by contract is paid into a pension fund (APK Pensionskasse AG) each year. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 163 thousand (previous year: EUR 135 thousand).\n\nOne former member of the Executive Board and selected executives were granted pensions in the past that are covered by reinsurance policies with Generali Versicherung AG, with the pension entitlement matching the amount covered by the reinsurance. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 103 thousand (previous year: EUR 116 thousand).\n\nEmployees whose employment is subject to Austrian law and who entered into this employment relationship after December 31, 2002 are not entitled to severance payments from their employer. For these employees and all current members of the Executive Board, contributions amounting to 1.53% (previous year: 1.53%) of their wages or salaries were paid into a staff pension fund. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 895 thousand (previous year: EUR 852 thousand).\n\nFor employees in Singapore, contributions equivalent to a fixed percentage of the annual salary are paid into a pension fund. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 105 thousand (previous year: EUR 72 thousand).\n\nSemperit Group employees are also entitled to country-specific state pension plans, which are usually financed on a pay-as-you-go (unfunded) basis. The obligations of the Semperit Group are limited to paying contributions when they are due. There is no legal or de facto obligation with regard to future benefits.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 7.2. Other provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized at the present value of the expected settlement amount based on management's best possible estimate of the uncertain obligation. This is done by taking account of unavoidable risks and uncertainties associated with a large number of events and scenarios as well as future events, insofar as there exist sufficient objective and substantial indications of their occurrence. However, discounting takes place only if the interest effect is material.\n\nIf it can be assumed that the amount required to settle the obligation will be completely or partially reimbursed by a third party, this reimbursement claim is recognized if and to the extent that it is virtually certain that such reimbursement will be received and the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nThe timings of the expected payment flows from other provisions (except anniversary bonuses) largely reflect the maturities outlined below.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the other provisions are as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                        | 12.31.2023 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current | 12.31.2022 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Bonuses and other personnel provisions | 11,242     | 689                    | 10,554             | 13,419     | 470                    | 12,949             |\n| Guarantees                             | 7,579      | 0                      | 7,579              | 5,015      | 1                      | 5,015              |\n| Anniversary bonuses                    | 4,484      | 3,959                  | 525                | 3,342      | 2,882                  | 460                |\n| Miscellaneous                          | 8,161      | 4,825                  | 3,336              | 7,158      | 4,467                  | 2,691              |\n| Total                                  | 31,467     | 9,473                  | 21,994             | 28,935     | 7,820                  | 21,115             |\n\nThe other provisions changed as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                           | 01.01.2023 | Additions<br>due to<br>business<br>acquisitions | Additions | Currency<br>differences | Release | Use     | 12.31.2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Bonuses and other personnel<br>provisions | 13,419     | 5,371                                           | 12,047    | 10                      | -1,789  | -17,816 | 11,242     |\n| Guarantees                                | 5,015      | 253                                             | 7,733     | 220                     | -4,310  | -1,333  | 7,579      |\n| Anniversary bonuses                       | 3,342      | 842                                             | 907       | 1                       | -21     | -587    | 4,484      |\n| Miscellaneous                             | 7,158      | 695                                             | 1,675     | 280                     | -663    | -984    | 8,161      |\n| Total                                     | 28,935     | 7,161                                           | 22,362    | 510                     | -6,782  | -20,720 | 31,467     |\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Anniversary bonuses\n\nProvisions for anniversary bonuses are calculated using the PUC method in accordance with IAS 19, based on an actuarial assessment. Remeasurements (actuarial gains and losses) are recognized as personnel expenses in profit or loss for the period.\n\nProvisions for anniversary bonuses are established for employees in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic, whose entitlement to them is based on collective bargaining agreements. They are measured based on the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the provisions for pensions and severance payments.\n\nUndiscounted cash flows arise for the provision of anniversary bonuses as at December 31, 2023 of EUR 525 thousand (previous year: EUR 460 thousand) within one year and EUR 4,332 thousand (previous year: EUR 2,784 thousand) for up to ten years.\n\nThe average weighted duration of the present value of the anniversary bonus obligations is around 8 years (previous year: around 8 years). Sensitivity analyses were performed regarding the effect of significant actuarial parameters (interest rate, wage and salary increases). These resulted in the following effects on the present value of the provisions for anniversary bonuses:\n\n|                       |                        | Present value of obligation<br>(DBO) 12.31.2023 |                          | Present value of obligation<br>(DBO) 12.31.2022 |                          |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| in EUR thousand       | Change in parameter    | Increase in<br>parameter                        | Decrease in<br>parameter | Increase in<br>parameter                        | Decrease in<br>parameter |\n| Interest rate         | +/- 1 percentage point | 4,162                                           | 4,859                    | 3,112                                           | 3,609                    |\n| Increases in salaries | +/- 1 percentage point | 4,780                                           | 4,222                    | 3,558                                           | 3,153                    |\n\n### Guarantees\n\nThe provisions for guarantees are based largely on case-by-case assessments of the guarantee risks; guarantee provisions that are allocated on a portfolio basis derived from experience are of minor importance in the Semperit Group. Since guarantee claims may involve lengthy negotiations as well as legal proceedings, it is not possible to accurately predict when payments will actually have to be made.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Bonuses and other personnel provisions\n\nThe provisions for bonuses paid to employees (as per the Semperit Group Bonus Policy), managers (also as per a Long-term Incentive Plan based on long-term performance bonuses for the Executive Board), and Executive Board members (as per the remuneration policy) are recognized at the bestpossible estimated settlement amounts. The estimated settlement amounts take into consideration the expected achievements of Group targets as well as the current results from the performance evaluation. Long-term performance bonuses are distributed over several periods and accumulated; the anticipated vesting of the claims determines the end of the accumulation period. Due to a lack of materiality, there is no discounting of the long-term performance bonuses. Local bonus agreements also exist for employees and management staff, which provisions are also recognized for on the basis of the individually estimated and anticipated achievement of targets.\n\n### Other provisions\n\nThe remaining other provisions include a provision for tax proceedings relating to transaction taxes in Brazil in respect of the assessment years 2008–2010 in the amount of EUR 3,571 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,150 thousand). The duty (PIS/COFINS) is levied on the import and resale of goods in Brazil. A security was deposited in the 2017 financial year in connection with the resale PIS/COFINS to ensure that the case would continue through the relevant court system after appeals in the administrative proceedings were unsuccessful. As before, the provision in the amount of EUR 3,571 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,150 thousand) ) is offset by a corresponding demand for reimbursement of the security deposited with the civil court. For the assessment years 2011 and 2012, management is assuming that the period of limitation has expired.\n\nIn the case of disputed charges (including any interest on arrears) for the disposal of raw materials imported into Poland, there is a provision amounting to EUR 1,430 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,064 thousand). Furthermore, an environmental reserve of EUR 863 thousand (previous year: EUR 945 thousand) exists for a soil treatment obligation with a Polish subsidiary.\n\nOne subsidiary is involved in competition law proceedings. These lengthy proceedings are currently at a stage where the outcome is highly uncertain. The case is being heard before the authorities in consultation with local specialists, and the subsidiary in question is cooperating with the competent authorities and providing all the necessary assistance. For the anticipated costs and the associated risk, a provision in the most likely amount has been recognized in line with an assessment made by the Semperit Group. The amount is reviewed periodically in order to determine if it needs to be adjusted.\n\nDetailed information on the specific financial impact would seriously weaken the position of the Semperit Group in asserting its interests in current legal proceedings and is therefore omitted pursuant to IAS 37.92.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-160-0\"></span>8.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities of the same taxable entity are offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and there is a right to offset current tax liabilities against current reimbursement claims. The corporate group formed in Austria in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) is deemed to constitute a taxable entity for this purpose. In Germany, a corporate tax group exists between Semperit Profiles Deggendorf GmbH and Semperit Profiles Leeser GmbH. Deferred tax assets recognized more than five years in the past were written down.\n\nOf the loss allowances for deferred tax assets on temporary differences and loss carryforwards, a total of EUR 19,412 thousand (previous year: EUR 32,346 thousand) is related to the group of companies in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG), whose parent company is SAG. Due to the Austrian tax group's history of losses in the recent past, there are stringent IFRS requirements for reliable tax planning. The recognition of deferred tax assets (not covered by deferred tax liabilities) on temporary differences and loss carryforwards requires additional substantial evidence that, in the upcoming fiscal years, tax results will be generated that can be used for future tax relief. In view of the Austrian tax group's history of losses in the recent past and the uncertainties that exist primarily due to the slowing down of the economy and geopolitical crises, the Group's deferred tax assets are not eligible for recognition pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) on the basis of future taxable income. The acquisition of the Rico Group gives SAG management the option of including three additional Austrian subsidiaries in the Group in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG). The application to join the Group pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) was submitted in February 2024 (see section 12.3). Taking the loss carryforward limit into account, this makes it possible to offset portions of the deferred tax liabilities that arose in particular from the purchase price allocation at RICO Group GmbH, RICO-Elastomere Projecting GmbH, and Härtereitechnik Rosenblatt GmbH with \n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\ndeferred tax assets on SAG's loss carryforwards. As a result, the loss allowance for deferred tax assets in the Group pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) was reduced by EUR 12,861 thousand. The remaining change in the loss allowance for deferred tax assets in Austria essentially applies to the loss allowance for non-current deferred tax assets.\n\nThe net amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities has changed by EUR 15,098 thousand. Of this amount, EUR –10,049 thousand was recognized as tax income (of which continuing operations: tax income of EUR –10,139 thousand; of which discontinued operations: tax expense of EUR 90 thousand), EUR –886 thousand as income taxes attributable to other comprehensive income from the remeasurement of performance-based plans, EUR –138 thousand related to the currency conversion of deferred tax from functional currency into the reporting currency, and EUR 26,175 thousand from business sales and acquisitions.\n\nAs at the reporting date, there were deductible temporary differences of EUR 10,419 thousand (previous year: EUR 21,561 thousand) as well as tax loss carryforwards of EUR 102,608 thousand (previous year: EUR 145,221 thousand) and unused tax credits of EUR 29,842 thousand (previous year: EUR 30,249 thousand) for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized. Of these unused tax losses and tax credits, EUR 17,887 thousand (previous year: EUR 11,924 thousand) expires within the next five years and EUR 26,463 thousand (previous year: EUR 27,943 thousand) within the next seven years. The major part of the remaining tax losses and deductible temporary differences can be carried forward without limit.\n\nIn the fiscal year, the surplus of deferred tax assets of EUR 3,254 thousand (previous year: EUR 4,302 thousand) is accounted for in tax jurisdictions with tax losses. Of this amount, EUR 3,218 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,924 thousand) relates to the German organization. The tax loss for the previous year resulted from impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. The other deferred tax assets of EUR 36 thousand relate to France.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities of EUR 29,146 thousand (previous year: EUR 42,263 thousand) were not recognized for taxable temporary differences of EUR 128,953 thousand (previous year: EUR 178,742 thousand) in connection with interests in subsidiaries as the parent is able to control when the temporary difference is reversed, and it is likely that the temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. There were also deductible temporary differences in the amount of EUR 4,001 thousand (previous year: EUR 4,218 thousand) for which deferred tax assets of EUR 920 thousand (previous year: EUR 116 thousand) were not recognized as it is unlikely that the temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Rules were published as part of the Framework for International Minimum Taxation. Directive 2022/2523 was finally adopted in December 2022 to implement the Directive within the EU Member States.\n\nThe Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (Mindestbesteuerungsgesetz, MinBestG), which entered into force in Austria on December 31, 2023, transposed the OECD Model Rules and the corresponding EU Directive on ensuring a minimum level of taxation for corporate groups (Pillar Two) into Austrian law. The Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (MinBestG) shall apply to the fiscal years beginning on December 31, 2023. B&C Privatstiftung, based in Vienna, is the ultimate parent company of the Semperit Group and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (MinBestG). Consequently, any additional taxes due to exceeding the legally enshrined turnover limits will have to be determined in future.\n\nIn some countries in which the Semperit Group operates, it is still unclear whether and when implementation will take place (e.g., the United States). The legal status of each jurisdiction is relevant to assessing a potential tax burden at the level of the ultimate parent company or other Group companies. Failure to comply with the minimum tax rate of 15% may result in the income inclusion rule \n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n(IIR) being applied in Austria, in the absence of a recognized national undertaxed profit rule (UTPR) being applied in that country.\n\nAn evaluation of the effects of the new minimum taxation rules for the Semperit Group as a subgroup of the B&C Group was conducted based on the CbCR values as at December 31, 2022. From today's perspective, given both the temporary safe harbor regulations and the minimum tax calculation, a stand-alone analysis of the Semperit Group's \"subgroup\" shows that neither the 2023 nor the 2024 fiscal year will have any material effects on the recognition and measurement of tax receivables and liabilities.\n\nThe new, mandatory exception to the accounting treatment of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the introduction of the Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (MinBestG) and/or comparable foreign tax laws was applied by the Semperit Group. Current taxes resulting from the implementation of Austrian and/or similar foreign tax laws were not recognized as at December 31, 2023 due to the lack of applicability.\n\n### Receivables from current income taxes\n\nReceivables from current income taxes result from refundable advance payments, in particular from SFO in the amount of EUR 2,496 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\n### <span id=\"page-165-0\"></span>10.

The Semperit Group's management has conducted and continues to conduct ongoing analysis of the subsidiary in order to determine whether control exists within the meaning of IFRS 10 and if consolidation would therefore be justified. On the basis of past and current analyses, the management of the Semperit Group remained, as at December 31, 2023, of the opinion that SAC should be incorporated into the consolidated financial statements of the Semperit Group as a consolidated subsidiary. This discretionary decision is based on the underlying contracts, an investigation of the relevant activities, and the facts and circumstances. The following points were evaluated:\n\n- The Chairman of the Board of Directors, who is appointed by the Semperit Group, has a casting vote.\n- The Semperit Group has a call option for the remaining 50% of shares in the Sri Trang Group, which can be exercised at a fixed price until mid-2026.\n- Purchasing, production, and sales are managed by the Semperit Industrial Applications division's management.\n- Two positions were established for local employees to implement the Semperit Group's right of control.\n- As at the reporting date, there were no indications of the Sri Trang Group effectively restricting the Semperit Group's exercise of control.\n\nNo significant non-controlling interests existed for the Semperit Group (see section 5.3). The minority interests in SAC were shown as redeemable non-controlling interests in the liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests (see section [6.1](#page-142-1)).\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-170-0\"></span>11. Risk management\n\nAs a group with international operations, the Semperit Group is continuously confronted with new challenges resulting from global economic developments and their strong regional variations. The Semperit Group operates in countries with different economic framework conditions. In addition, these countries are going through different stages of political, constitutional, and social development. On account of the differences in their strategic orientation, the success of the Semperit Group's two divisions is dependent on the overall economic environment to varying degrees. As a result, the Semperit Group is exposed to risks.\n\nDue to its involvement in international trading activities in various foreign currencies, the Semperit Group is exposed to currency risks.\n\nIn principle, derivative financial instruments and natural hedges are used in the Semperit Group to hedge currency and interest rate risks. The risk management strategy aimed at hedging currency and interest rate risks is applied to individual cases and specific projects in both the long and short term. Cost-benefit/risk considerations play a decisive role here. . In part, currency risks arising for example from expected customer, investment, and dividend payments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are accounted for as freestanding derivatives.\n\n### 11.1. Capital risk management\n\nThe objectives of capital management are to ensure the company's ability to continue as a going concern, to enable growth-oriented organic and non-organic investment activities as necessary, and to allow for a compatible dividend policy. The financing structure, liquidity, and finance risk positions are managed centrally by the Semperit Group. Based on capital market principles, the long-term capital management additionally includes decisions regarding fixed or variable-interest borrowing and hybrid borrowing.\n\nIn connection with loan agreements, standard credit agreement clauses (financial covenants) exist that include termination by investors in case of non-compliance as well as adeterioration of agency credit ratings for the Semperit Group, which could therefore result in a potential negative effect on the company's financial position and financial performance, as well as credit agreement clauses (ESG key performance indicators) that may affect the rate of interest in the event of compliance or noncompliance.\n\nFrom a capital management perspective, the total capital of the Semperit Group consists of equity, including non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, redeemable non-controlling interests, and net financial debt defined in the financial covenants. Net financial debt of EUR 115,151 thousand (previous year: net financial surplus of EUR 54,171 thousand) corresponds to the sum of financial liabilities of EUR 227,822 thousand (previous year: EUR 52,460 thousand) from corporate Schuldschein loans and liabilities to banks less cash and cash equivalents of EUR 112,671 thousand (previous year: EUR 106,631 thousand).\n\nThe Semperit Group is not subject to any legal requirements with regard to minimum equity, minimum equity ratios, or maximum levels of gearing; however, it is subject to certain credit agreement stipulations. These relate to a maximum leverage ratio. This is the the quotient resulting from EBITDA and net financial debt. The Semperit Group should ensure that it does not exceed a leverage ratio of 3.5. A default would occur if a leverage ratio of 4.0 is exceeded twice. As at December 31, 2023, the leverage ratio is 1.6 (previous year: –0.6).\n\nSAG's new bank financing is variable interest and linked to the three-month EURIBOR. The newly concluded loan is due on March 31, 2028 and has an extension option of up to two years. The margins are linked to the leverage ratio (150 to 250 basis points if a leverage ratio of 3.5 is exceeded) and ESG key performance indicators (up to 6 basis points, see section 1.4). The general credit line has comparable terms and conditions in terms of the leverage ratio (120 to 220 basis points if a leverage \n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nratio of 3.5 is exceeded) and identical ESG key performance indicators. The bank financing of EUR 110,000 thousand for the new plant expansion in Odry, is linked to the one-month EURIBOR during the availability period (until September 30, 2025) and to the three-month EURIBOR from the first repayment date (December 31, 2025), plus a margin of 0.675%. This does not take any ESG key performance indicators into account and a default would occur in the same way as bank financing by SAG if a leverage ratio of 4.0 is exceeded twice.\n\nThe relevant financial covenants were complied with both as at December 31, 2023 and as at December 31, 2022.\n\n### 11.2. Liquidity risk management\n\nIn addition to continual liquidity planning, liquidity risk management also entails monitoring the applicable financial covenants as well as ensuring the availability of both drawdown options (from the framework credit agreement) and reserve liquidity. A cash pool in EUR is available for significant group companies.\n\nThe maturities of the undiscounted contractual cash flows from financial liabilities break down as follows:\n\n|                             | Total   | up to 1<br>month | 2 to 3<br>months | 4 to 12<br>months | 1 to 5<br>years | over 5<br>years |\n|-----------------------------|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| in EUR thousand             |         |                  |                  |                   |                 |                 |\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | 41,006  | 0                | 0                | 965               | 32,609          | 7,432           |\n| Liabilities to banks        | 230,307 | 342              | 936              | 15,392            | 180,623         | 33,014          |\n| Trade payables              | 66,510  | 46,539           | 17,265           | 1,855             | 851             | 0               |\n| Refund liabilities          | 1,280   | 4                | 110              | 1,165             | 0               | 0               |\n| Derivatives                 | 2,333   | 0                | 0                | 0                 | 2,333           | 0               |\n| Lease liabilities           | 67,046  | 541              | 1,171            | 5,052             | 20,673          | 39,609          |\n| Other financial liabilities | 12,265  | 5,226            | 1,140            | 476               | 4,843           | 581             |\n| Summe                       | 420,747 | 52,652           | 20,622           | 24,905            | 241,931         | 80,636          |\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand             | Total   | up to 1<br>month | 2 to 3<br>months | 4 to 12<br>months | 1 to 5<br>years | over 5<br>years |\n|-----------------------------|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | 56,269  | 0                | 0                | 15,261            | 32,927          | 8,082           |\n| Liabilities to banks        | 3       | 2                | 1                | 0                 | 0               | 0               |\n| Trade payables              | 63,942  | 42,580           | 16,427           | 4,882             | 52              | 0               |\n| Refund liabilities          | 867     | 7                | 15               | 845               | 0               | 0               |\n| Derivatives                 | 2,637   | 0                | 0                | 1                 | 2,636           | 0               |\n| Lease liabilities           | 22,368  | 309              | 602              | 2,603             | 9,846           | 9,009           |\n| Other financial liabilities | 5,734   | 4,090            | 1,298            | 196               | 150             | 0               |\n| Summe                       | 151,819 | 46,987           | 18,343           | 23,789            | 45,610          | 17,090          |\n\n12.31.2022\n\nA new EUR 100 million variable-interest general credit line was taken out in fiscal year 2023. This financing is provided by a consortium of six Austrian and international banks and replaces a previous general credit line of EUR 75 million. Please see section 11.1 for details on defined interest rate terms and the effect of defined ESG key performance indicators and leverage ratio on interest rates.\n\nThe Group Controlling department continually monitors compliance with the financial covenants associated with the financing operations and forecasts possible deviations in order to take timely risk minimization measures. In doing so, it proactively analyzes liquidity and cash flow trends to ensure that the agreed conditions are met and that potential financial shortfalls can be identified and addressed early on. In contrast to the newly concluded variable-interest bank financing, there is fixed interest on the existing corporate Schuldschein loans and some of the liabilities to banks. Please see section 6.2 for more details on maturities and interest rate terms.\n\nThe existing cash pool in EUR and the completion of the new factoring program on December 29, 2023 may improve the Semperit Group's liquidity. Please see section 4.2 for more details on the sale of receivables under the factoring program. The cash pool allows the businessesto optimally utilize liquidity surpluses, thereby helping to reduce financing costs, while the factoring program shortens the average receivable term and optimizes the liquidity position. These strategies, combined with a high level of trade receivables covered by credit insurance (see section 4.2), play a key role in protecting the Semperit Group from a potential liquidity shortfall and in maintaining financial stability. Individual interest rate strategies are continually reviewed, in particular by entering into fixed interest rate swaps and evaluating the refinancing of loans on the corporate Schuldschein loan market. These measures make it possible to actively manage interest rate risks and to benefit from favorable market conditions, which has a positive effect on the liquidity position.\n\nThe maturities of the undiscounted cash flows of the derivatives as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 mainly relate to the payment of a contingent purchase price liability (see section 6.3). The maturities of the undiscounted contractual cash flows from the liabilities to banks include the newly concluded loan for SAG of EUR 135,837 thousand, which is due on March 31, 2028, as well as the one for SFO of EUR 32,446 thousand, which will be repaid in 20 quarterly fixed installments starting on December 31, 2025, and the Rico Group's liabilities to banks of EUR 62,022 thousand, which are due from January 31, 2024 to July 31, 2030. SAG's loan is provided with an extension option of up to two years.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 11.3. Default and credit risk management\n\nCredit risks arise when products or goods manufactured in house are sold to customers on credit. The risk arises as soon as the Semperit Group no longer has access to the shipped products or goods; in the case of customized manufacturing, however, it begins even before production. A business partner check is performed for the customers and business information is obtained to minimize the risks. Customers undergo credit checks, first of all by means of credit reports, and the trade receivables are also protected to a very high degree by credit insurance in order to mitigate the risks.\n\nAccording to the Semperit Group's credit policy – it will also be applied in full to the newly acquired Rico Group from fiscal year 2024 onwards – every customer serviced by credit must have an approved credit limit. If limits are exceeded or payments delayed, deliveries are halted and only resumed after specific conditions have been met and the resumption of deliveries has been approved by authorized individuals specified in Semperit Group directives. Customer credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis and the credit limits adjusted accordingly, even for those customers with the best credit ratings.\n\nThe default risk associated with non-insured receivables from customers can therefore basically be considered minor, as customer creditworthiness is monitored continuously and the Group's diversified customer structure implies that risk is not concentrated with individual customers. However, the default risk is assumed to increase significantly if there are negative effects on credit ratings due to the occurrence of bankruptcy or the start of insolvency proceedings. Default is anticipated if recoverability is no longer seen as realistic and payment is therefore no longer expected. This resulted in write-offs of receivables of EUR 429 thousand in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 194 thousand).\n\nThe Semperit Group can be exposed to default risks relating to its bank deposits in the event that individual banks run into difficulties or another banking and/or financial crisis occurs. Such deposits are not or only partially secured by deposit protection funds. An investment guideline limits the amount of cash that may be held per bank and defines the financial instruments in which the excess liquidity may be invested. In case of bankruptcy of individual banks or occurrence of another bank and/or financial crisis, the Semperit Group might not be able to access this liquidity or these credit lines, or only partially or only with some delay. With regard to investments in quasi-liquidity money market fund units, the default risk is effectively on par with that of bank deposits but is significantly reduced due to the fund's status as a contractual investment fund and the diversification within the fund into different investment securities and issuers.\n\nIn addition, the Semperit Group conducts business activities in countries with capital controls or has restrictive agreements with joint venture partners. In countries with restricted cash transfers, the Semperit Group tries to limit the amount kept locally to the minimum necessary for business operations. The above-mentioned risks may have a negative effect on the company's financial position and financial performance in the event of restrictions being placed on the free availability of cash and cash equivalents, or on access to credit lines.\n\nThe default risk associated with financial assets is recognized through loss allowances. Determined on the basis of the risk of a total default of all debtors (without taking credit insurance into account), the maximum default risk in the corresponding measurement categories breaks down as follows:\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand                      | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents            | 112,671    | 106,631    |\n| Trade receivables                    | 25,580     | 16,302     |\n| Other financial assets – securities  | 6,224      | 5,388      |\n| Derivative financial instruments     | 98         | 233        |\n| Miscellaneous other financial assets | 1,743      | 2,464      |\n| Total                                | 146,316    | 131,018    |\n\n### 11.4. Interest rate risk management\n\nOperating resources, investments, and acquisitions in the framework of the Group's business operations are financed using debt, some of which bears variable-interest rates. Depending on what happens to interest rates, hedging transactions could have a significant influence on the Group's financial position and financial performance.\n\nThe risk associated with fixed-interest financial instruments is that market values can be negatively impacted by changes in interest rates. In the case of variable-interest financial instruments, the risk is that fluctuations in cash flows can adversely affect the balance of cash and cash equivalents and the planning of future cash flows.\n\nThe Semperit Group's financial landscape has recently undergone a significant change, as no negative interest is now charged on company deposits. At the same time, variable-interest financial liabilities currently pay higher interest rates. The Semperit Group pursues a strategy of active liquidity management in order to counter these new conditions effectively. The Semperit Group's investment policy is strictly adhered to at all times. The interest rate profile of the Semperit Group's interestbearing financial instruments is shown below:\n\n|                       | 12.31.2023        |                      |                   | 12.31.2022           |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| in EUR thousand       | Fixed<br>interest | Variable<br>interest | Fixed<br>interest | Variable<br>interest |\n| Financial assets      | 30,759            | 79,692               | 73,106            | 30,748               |\n| Financial liabilities | 45,934            | 182,038              | 52,460            | 150                  |\n|                       | 76,693            | 261,730              | 125,566           | 30,898               |\n\nThe interest rate risk sensitivity analysis focuses on the risk arising from variable-interest financial instruments. It is assumed that the variable-interest financial assets and financial liabilities have been outstanding for a full year as at the reporting date. When performing this sensitivity analysis, a change of 100 basis points is simulated. The effects of the simulations on the financial result are shown below:\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 12.31.2023 12.31.2022\n\nSensitivity to changes in interest rates by Sensitivity to changes in interest rates by\n\n| in EUR thousand                         | Balance | +100 basis<br>points | -100 basis<br>points | Balance | +100 basis<br>points | -100 basis<br>points |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Variable-interest financial assets      | 79,692  | 797                  | -205                 | 30,748  | 307                  | -158                 |\n| Variable-interest financial liabilities | 182,038 | -1,820               | 1,896                | 150     | -2                   | 2                    |\n|                                         | 261,730 | -1,023               | 1,691                | 30,898  | 306                  | -157                 |\n\nThe Semperit Group continually evaluates individual interest rate strategies by entering into fixedinterest rate swaps and/or prematurely refinancing loans on the corporate Schuldschein loan market.\n\n### 11.5. Currency risk management\n\nDue to its involvement in international trading activities in various foreign currencies, the Semperit Group is exposed to currency risks. Transaction risks exist at all Group companies, e.g., for those that purchase input factors in foreign currencies and/or sell products in a different currency. The principal currencies in continued operations in this context are USD, CNY, INR, PLN; in discontinued operations they were USD and MYR.\n\nThe most significant currency in the Semperit Group's continued operations is the USD at 14.8% (previous year: 14.3%) of revenue and 11.0% (previous year: 11.9%) of cost of materials.\n\nThe translation of foreign financial statements into the euro reporting currency resulted in currency translation differences (translation risk) amounting to EUR –5,878 thousand (previous year: EUR – 8,137 thousand), which were recognized in other comprehensive income. Of this, EUR –53 thousand was attributable to non-controlling interests (previous year: EUR 5 thousand). The foreign currency translation reserve has increased due to the reclassification of other comprehensive income to profit or loss following the deconsolidation of the companies in the (first) closing in the amount of EUR 23,541 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand), see section 2.9. The currency translation differences in the fiscal year 2023 (as in the previous year) were mainly due to changes in the USD exchange rate. The EUR/USD rate changed from USD 1.06660/EUR as of December 31, 2022 to USD 1.10500/EUR as at December 31, 2023 or an average rate of USD 1.08122/EUR in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: USD 1.05276/EUR).\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of subsidiaries not located in the euro area, and the contribution of these subsidiaries to the Semperit Group's earnings, are to a significant extent contingent upon the changes in the euro exchange rates of the functional currencies of these subsidiaries; the translation risk is not considered within the scope of the following disclosures pursuant to IFRS 7.\n\nThe following breakdown of the revenue, cost of materials, and personnel expenses of the Semperit Group's continued operations by material currency (as a percentage of the continued operations' revenue) shows that in the fiscal year 2023, 24.4% (previous year: 21.5%) of revenue or 31.1% (previous year: 27.1%) of the cost of materials and 36.1% (previous year: 38.0%) of personnel expenses were generated in foreign currencies. From this it can be derived that the currency risks on the selling and procurement sides are largely eliminated by natural offsetting effects. It should also be noted that the functional currency is usually the local currency (for exceptions, see section 1.3) and that personnel expenses are always in the local currency.\n\n| in % of revenue fron continued operations | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| EUR                                       | 75.6% | 78.5% |\n| USD                                       | 14.8% | 14.3% |\n| CNY                                       | 3.7%  | 3.7%  |\n| INR                                       | 2.4%  | 2.3%  |\n| PLN                                       | 1.8%  | 0.1%  |\n| CHF                                       | 0.6%  | 0.0%  |\n| GBP                                       | 0.4%  | 0.5%  |\n| SEK                                       | 0.3%  | 0.4%  |\n| THB                                       | 0.2%  | 0.2%  |\n| CZK                                       | 0.1%  | 0.0%  |\n| AUD                                       | 0.1%  | 0.1%  |\n\n| in % material expenses from continued operations | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| EUR                                              | 68.9% | 72.9% |\n| USD                                              | 11.0% | 11.9% |\n| CZK                                              | 6.4%  | 4.3%  |\n| CNY                                              | 3.9%  | 3.5%  |\n| INR                                              | 3.7%  | 3.5%  |\n| PLN                                              | 3.3%  | 2.0%  |\n| THB                                              | 1.9%  | 1.6%  |\n| HUF                                              | 0.6%  | 0.2%  |\n| CHF                                              | 0.2%  | 0.0%  |\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in % personnel expenses from continued operations | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| EUR                                               | 63.9% | 62.0% |\n| CZK                                               | 11.8% | 14.6% |\n| PLN                                               | 9.8%  | 9.4%  |\n| USD                                               | 4.9%  | 3.9%  |\n| HUF                                               | 3.6%  | 3.9%  |\n| CNY                                               | 2.5%  | 3.3%  |\n| THB                                               | 1.2%  | 1.7%  |\n| CHF                                               | 0.9%  | 0.0%  |\n| SGD                                               | 0.7%  | 0.5%  |\n| INR                                               | 0.7%  | 0.7%  |\n\nA significant portion of the Semperit Group's earnings are generated by subsidiaries that do not have their registered office in the euro area (see section 10.2).\n\nThe Group's financial management system aims to avoid currency risks as much as possible by coordinating payment flows. The table below shows the derivative financial instruments used to hedge against currency risks by group company, type of hedging transaction, and hedged currency. In the fiscal year 2023, the financial instruments consisted of forward exchange contracts to hedge parts of the operating business at SAC.\n\n| 12.31.2023                                       | Country  | Type of transaction | Currency | Hedge amount1 | Hedge rate2 | Fair value in EUR thousand 2023 | Range of remaining days to maturity |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Semperflex Asia Corp.

The fair values were shown in the consolidated balance sheet as other financial assets or other financial liabilities.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the purposes of currency risk management, sensitivity analyses were prepared for the measurement at the reporting date of monetary items that deviate from the functional currency. These analyses also present the effects on profit of hypothetical changes in exchange rates for each currency pair. Here, receivables and liabilities in the currency pair in question as at the reporting date are taken into account, as are the forward exchange contracts. No uniform change was assumed with regards to the range of exchange rate fluctuation; instead, appropriate fluctuation ranges for each currency pair were determined on the basis of historical fluctuations during the year. The following table shows the effects of the appreciation and depreciation of major foreign currencies versus the euro (EUR) and the US dollar (USD):\n\n|                           |

Other\n\n### 12.1. Related-party transactions with companies and individuals\n\nOutstanding balances and transactions between SAG and its subsidiaries were eliminated in the course of consolidation and are not further discussed here.\n\nB&C KB Holding GmbH is the direct majority shareholder of SAG, and B&C Privatstiftung is the controlling legal entity. B&C Holding Österreich GmbH is the indirect majority shareholder, which draws up and publishes consolidated financial statements in which the Semperit Group is consolidated. According to IAS 24, B&C Privatstiftung and all its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates are related parties of the Semperit Group.\n\nRelated parties of the Semperit Group include the members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards of SAG, the managing directors and Supervisory Board members of all companies that directly or indirectly hold a majority stake in SAG, and finally the members of the Executive Board of B&C Privatstiftung and the close family members of these Executive and Supervisory Board members and managing directors. In the 2023 fiscal year, there were free consultancy contracts between SAG (the Supervisory Board) and B&C KB Holding GmbH's managing directors: with Mr. Mathias Breuer until August 15, 2023 and with Dr. Markus Fürst from September 27, 2023.\n\nThe remuneration of members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is presented in the following table:\n\n|                                                          |                                 |                                | 2023  |                                 |                                | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| in EUR thousand                                          | Supervisory<br>board<br>members | Management<br>board<br>members | Total | Supervisory<br>board<br>members | Management<br>board<br>members | Total |\n| Short-term benefits                                      | 731                             | 1,626                          | 2,357 | 460                             | 1,924                          | 2,384 |\n| Benefits after termination of employment<br>relationship | 0                               | 163                            | 163   | 0                               | 135                            | 135   |\n| Other long-term benefits                                 | 0                               | 72                             | 72    | 0                               | 97                             | 97    |\n| Termination benefits                                     | 0                               | 1,325                          | 1,325 | 0                               | 0                              | 0     |\n| Total                                                    | 731                             | 3,186                          | 3,917 | 460                             | 2,155                          | 2,615 |\n\nThe short-term benefits include not only regular payments but also the short-term incentive (STI), which is due within one year.\n\nThe benefits upon termination of the employment contract relate to payments to the APK Pensionskasse AG pension fund. Payments made by SAG to the employee severance fund (Betriebliche Vorsorgekasse, BVK) on behalf of members of the Executive Board also constitute payments upon termination of the employment contract. In the 2023 fiscal year, these amounted to EUR 35 thousand (previous year: EUR 28 thousand). However, these payments were excluded from the table above in order to ensure that the presentation is consistent with the remuneration report.\n\nThe other long-term benefits relate to the long-term incentive (LTI). The termination benefit relates to the one-time severance payment made to Kristian Brok in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nPayments to former members of the Executive Board and their survivors totaled EUR 680 thousand in the fiscal year 2023 (previous year: EUR 695 thousand).\n\nThe following transactions were conducted with the companies mentioned below and the following balances existed as at the reporting date: In the 2023 fiscal year, the Group conducted transactions with unit-IT Dienstleistungs GmbH & Co KG totaling EUR 640 thousand (previous year: \n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nEUR 817 thousand). These transactions related to the purchase and maintenance of SAP licenses and were conducted at arm's length. There were outstanding liabilities to unit-IT Dienstleistungs GmbH & Co KG amounting to EUR 0 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 357 thousand).\n\nTransactions amounting to EUR 11 thousand were conducted with Grohs Hofer Rechtsanwälte GmbH in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 10 thousand). These transactions related to legal consulting services and were conducted at arm's length. There were outstanding liabilities to Grohs Hofer Rechtsanwälte GmbH amounting to EUR 0 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\nTransactions amounting to EUR 50 thousand were conducted with B&C KB Holding GmbH in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 50 thousand). These transactions related to management and other services, and internal charging, and were conducted at arm's length. There were outstanding liabilities to B&C KB Holding GmbH amounting to EUR 15 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\nTransactions amounting to EUR 161 thousand were conducted with Mr. Patrick Lackenbucher in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 215 thousand). These transactions related to consultancy services and were conducted at arm's length. The consultancy agreement with Mr. Lackenbucher was terminated with effect from June 30, 2023. There were outstanding liabilities to Mr. Patrick Lackenbucher amounting to EUR 0 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 15 thousand).\n\n### 12.2. Other obligations and risks\n\n### Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations\n\nThe constant changes and in some cases tightening of the rules in national and international tax law increase the demands on tax compliance to monitor and comply with these rules. Given this situation, there are tax uncertainties and tax-related contingent liabilities, especially for income taxes (e.g., with regards to the existence of tax loss carryforwards and from international transfer pricing rules) and transaction taxes. Such tax uncertainties and tax-related contingent liabilities exist due to liabilities under tax guarantees and tax exemptions from the sale and purchase agreement with Harps Global Pte. Ltd. also (still) for the discontinued operation's former subsidiaries. Detailed information on the specific financial impact would seriously weaken the position of the Semperit Group in asserting its interests in current legal proceedings and is therefore omitted pursuant to IAS 37.92. In addition, there are contingent liabilities due to (still existing) financial guarantees to the discontinued operation's former subsidiaries that were covered by a back-to-back guarantee from Harps Global Pte. Ltd.\n\nThere were liabilities from the use of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment not recognized in the balance sheet due to rental agreements and leases that are not reported in accordance with IFRS 16, as the option for short-term leases (i.e., up to 12 months) and low-value leased assets (i.e., up to a replacement value of around EUR 5 thousand) was exercised (see section 3.2).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023 there were also contractual obligations to purchase property, plant, and equipment amounting to EUR 15,082 thousand (previous year: EUR 9,671 thousand).\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Legal proceedings\n\nVarious Group companies are defendants in individual cases in which the plaintiffs allege that they suffered damage from the defendant's products. However, in light of current insurance coverage, management does not expect these proceedings to significantly impair the Semperit Group's financial position and financial performance. There were also legal proceedings and legal uncertainties in matters pertaining to employment and social law. Please see section 7.2 for all material legal proceedings that provisions have been recognized for.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 12.3. Events after the reporting date\n\nTrade receivables were sold for the first time in January 2024 as part of the new factoring program. As of the end of February 2024, trade receivables totaling EUR 12,499 thousand (previous year: n.a.) were sold. Please see section 4.2 for more details.\n\nIn the course of optimizing the Group's structure, the US companies Sempertrans USA, LLC, and Sempertrans North America Investments Corp. were merged with Semperit Industrial Products Inc. effective January 1, 2024.\n\nAs the parent company, SAG submitted the application on February 14, 2024 for an official assessment of the accession of the Austrian companies RICO Group GmbH, RICO-Elastomere Projecting GmbH, and Härtereitechnik Rosenblattl GmbH as additional Group members to the existing Group pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) as of the 2024 assessment year.\n\n### <span id=\"page-182-0\"></span>13. Approval of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared on March 18, 2024 and approved for submission to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has the task of examining the consolidated financial statements and explaining whether it approves the consolidated financial statements.\n\nVienna, March 18, 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nHola llor\n\nDr. Karl Haider CEO\n\nDr. Helmut Sorger CFO\n\nMr. Gerfried Eder\n\nCIO\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-183-0\"></span>Auditor's Report1\n\n### Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n### Audit Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of\n\n### Semperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding, Vienna, Austria\n\nand of its subsidiaries (the Group) comprising the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2023, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year then ended and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on our audit the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the legal regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and the financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2023 and its financial performance for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by EU, and the additional requirements under Section 245a Austrian Company Code UGB.\n\n### Basis for the opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 (in the following \"EU regulation\") and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n### Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the con-text of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n<sup>1</sup>) The publication or disclosure of the consolidated financial statements with our auditor's report may only be made in the version confirmed by us. This auditor's report relates exclusively to the German-language and complete consolidated financial statements including the Group management report. For deviating versions, observe the regulations of Section 281 (2) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB).\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow we describe the Key Audit Matters:\n\n### Acquisition of RICO Group – Purchase price allocation\n\nOn July 31, 2023 Semperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding acquired 100% of the shares of RICO Group GmbH. As a full-service provider for individual plastic and elastomer projects, the Rico Group's product portfolio ranges from the manufacture of injection moulds and advice on component development to the series production of customer-specific components. The group comprises 3 companies in Austria, one company in Switzerland and one company in the USA.\n\nAt the acquisition date, a purchase price allocation was carried out. The total amount of consideration at the acquisition date amounted to EUR 183,661 thousand. Taking into account the acquired net assets of EUR 134,303 thousand the goodwill amounts to EUR 49,358 thousand.\n\nThe acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are to be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date in accordance with IFRS 3. The identification and measurement of the acquired net assets is complex and requires a number of judgmental decisions and assumptions. In particular, the determination of the fair value of the acquired intangible and tangible assets is based to a large extent on asset-specific assumptions that require discretionary decisions and estimates by the Management Board. In order to determine the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities, the Management Board has in some cases commissioned external experts.\n\nThere is a risk to the consolidated financial statements that, due to the size and complexity of the business combination, the assets and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition were incompletely identified or not properly measured. In addition, there is a risk that the disclosures required by IFRS 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are incomplete or incorrect.\n\nThe corresponding disclosures of the Semperit Group are contained in the notes \"1.6 Company acquisitions\".\n\nThe following audit procedures were carried out by us:\n\n- Critical review of the concluded purchase agreement, in particular with regard to the presentation in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 3\n- Examination of the methodology used and the arith-metical accuracy of the calculation as well as the material input parameters for the valuation of the identified intangible assets with the assistance of our valuation specialists\n- Audit of the completeness of the acquired assets and liabilities that were included in the purchase price allocation.\n- Audit of the derivation of the projected revenues and results used for the measurement of the identified intangible assets with the plans submitted to the Supervisory Board and their reconciliation to the requirements of IFRS 3\n- Critical review of the appraisals prepared by external experts on the valuation of tangible assets (mainly real estate and machinery) and discussion with the external experts, as well as plausibility check of the material valuation parameters and assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external experts commissioned by the management\n- Verification of the completeness and adequacy of the disclosures in the notes\n\n### Impairment of assets\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the consolidated financial statements of Semperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding show EUR 447,498 thousand in property, plant and equipment and EUR 124,971 thousand in intangible assets – of which EUR 51,035 thousand were goodwill.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the course of the valuation of the assets, it must be assessed on an ongoing basis whether there are indications of impairment. Considering external and internal indicators according to IAS 36.12.\n\nFor the Hoses and Rico business units (= cash-generating units), a mandatory impairment test must be carried out annually due to the existing goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, an impairment trigger was identified for the Profiles business unit due to the decline in demand as a result of the weak construction industry in Europe.\n\nIn addition, an impairment reversal trigger was identified for the Belting business unit due to the changed market environment.\n\nFor the above-mentioned business units, the recoverable amounts as values in use as of September 30, 2023 were determined for the purpose of impairment testing. After a comparison with the carrying amounts, there was no need for impairment or reversal of impairment.\n\nIn the context of determining the value in use, significant assumptions and estimates are necessary, which are subject to significant uncertainties. Accordingly, there is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that an impairment or reversal is not taken into account or is not taken into account to an appropriate extent.\n\nThe corresponding disclosures of the Semperit Group are contained in the notes \"3.1 Intangible assets\" and \"3.2 Property, plant and equipment\"\n\nWe critically questioned management's assumptions and estimates, including the following audit procedures:\n\n- Assessment of the concept and design of the process for reviewing the recoverability of assets\n- Review of the planning documentation of the three scenarios and completion of a plausibility analysis of the key value drivers (sales, expenses, capital expenditure, changes in trade working capital and cash flow\n- Verification of whether the revenue and earnings forecasts are derived from the plans submitted to the Supervisory Board, and whether these items are in compliance with the requirements of IAS 36\n- Audit of the methodology applied, and the computational accuracy of the documentation and calculations provided, as well as assessment of the plausibility of the discount rate with the assistance of our valuation specialists for the purposes of calculating the business unit's value in use\n- Verification of the correct determination of the carrying amounts of the assets as a comparative value to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units\n\nVerification of the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes\n\n### Other information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the Group's management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, on the basis of the work we have done, we conclude that there has been a material misrepresentation of this other information, we are obliged to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this context.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Responsibilities of Management and of the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements under Section 245a Austrian Company Code UGB for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe date of our auditor's report.

The international group, headquartered in Vienna, produces and sells its products in more than 100 countries and is one of the leading suppliers in its sectors.\n\nThe main product categories are hydraulic and industrial hoses, conveyor belts, escalator handrails, profiles for windows, doors and facades, cable car rings, ski foils, products for railroad superstructures as well as toolmaking and the production of precision liquid silicone parts.\n\nSemperit operated 16 production sites in the past financial year and employed roughly 4,600 people at the end of 2023. The products were sold in the business-to-business field using its own distribution network in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australia.\n\n### **L E A D I N G S P E C I A L I S T F O R INDUSTRIAL ELASTOMER PRODUCTS**\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, as part of Semperit's strategic realignment, Semperit decided to focus on the identifiable potential in the industrial sector going forward and to complete its transformation to become a specialist for industrial elastomer products.\n\nThe restructuring steps taken in previous years have significantly strengthened resilience within the industrial sector and laid solid foundations for future growth. In the past financial year, this transformation was implemented through the sale of the medical business and a powerful divisional structure that is oriented towards Semperit's two main business models was introduced. The Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) division focuses on highly efficient production and cost leadership for industrial applications in connection with large-scale production, while the innovation- and technology-driven Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) division focuses on customized solutions and attractive niche markets. The new positioning enables the optimal scaling of the business for future profitable growth.\n\n### **F O C U S O N C U S T O M E R - O R I E N T E D SOLUTIONS**\n\nFor both divisions, the priorities are a significant increase in customer proximity, a market-oriented alignment of the entire organization and a stronger focus on customeroriented solutions. The goal is to serve existing and future markets faster, more effectively and more efficiently. In addition, the systematic and continuous improvement across all areas of the company is intended to further improve the Semperit Group's competitive position and sustainability. The organic growth potential for the existing divisions is coupled with a clearly aligned M&A strategy. The focus on the strategic M&A activities will be on profiting from key trends, improving the geographical footprint, broadening the range of business activities and driving automatization, digitalization and circular economy.\n\nAgainst this background, Semperit took an important growth step with the acquisition of the internationally active Rico Group in the financial year 2023, which gave Semperit a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking and expanded the portfolio in terms of products, processing technologies, automation and materials.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **200 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE FOR TOMORROW**\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/1 description: The image is a QR code with a blue background and a darker blue pattern. The QR code is square and contains a complex arrangement of small squares and larger squares in the corners. The pattern is designed to be read by a QR code scanner.\n\nThe Semperit Group story began all the way back in 1824. Semperit is taking its 200th anniversary in 2024 as an opportunity to highlight its centuries-long tradition as well as its path to a successful future in a number of ways under the motto \"200 Years Semperit – Experience for Tomorrow\". On the 200-year website www.200.semperitgroup.com/en, Semperit looks back on the company's history, which is a story of outstanding personalities and innovative ideas, of resounding successes and also of overcoming crises that threatened the company's existence. At the same time, solutions and people are presented who are already working on Semperit's future successes today. Visit our website to find out how the Semperit Group keeps its customers' technology and infrastructure running in the world of tomorrow with its products and solutions.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/3 description: The image shows a computer monitor displaying a website with the text \"A JOURNEY THROUGH 200 YEARS OF HISTORY\".

Two light blue hands are positioned at the bottom, palms up, as if cradling something. From between the hands, a plant stem emerges with two green leaves. Above the plant, there's a circular emblem featuring a light blue globe with a stylized 'S' shape in a darker blue shade. The emblem is encircled by a white line, with small arrowheads indicating a circular motion around it.\n\n# **SUSTAINABILITY AT SEMPERIT**\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/6 description: The image is a square QR code with a blue pattern on a dark blue background. The QR code is made up of small squares arranged in a grid pattern. There are three larger squares, one in each of the top corners and one in the bottom left corner, which are used for alignment.\n\nWithout sustainability in its corporate DNA, Semperit would not be 200 years old. And without sustainability as a strategically anchored basic principle, no bright future would be possible. Semperit is making small and large adjustments in implementation, from climate protection and sustainable supply chains to a healthy and safe working environment. The Semperit Group published its seventh independent sustainability report for the 2023 financial year. The report provides an overview of the various activities, developments and key figures in the context of the main topics and is divided into the sections of environment & climate protection, social affairs and governance (Environmental, Social, Governance – ESG). In addition to topics such as energy, greenhouse gas emissions, material use, health and safety as well as compliance and anti-corruption, it contains general information on the integration of sustainability in the Group and further climate-related information according to the TCFD – Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The Sustainability Report for 2023 and the reports from previous years can be accessed online on our website.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **FORE WORD FROM THE EXECUTIVE BOARD**\n\n### **DEAR READERS, DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,**\n\nThe past financial year 2023 was eventful and at the same time formative for the Semperit Group, as it marked the successful transformation into an industrial elastomer specialist.\n\nFollowing the sale of our medical business in late summer, from which you were able to benefit with an additional dividend, we are focusing on further developing and expanding our leading position in the core business for industrial elastomer products.\n\nWith the acquisition of liquid silicone specialist Rico, we immediately took an important growth step and now occupy a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking. This enables us to exploit the huge growth potential for silicone products in Western Europe and the USA.\n\n**E F F I C I E N T S T R U C T U R E F O R FUTURE GROWTH** I N D U S T R I A L E L A S TO M E R SPECIALIST.\n\n> As part of our enhanced strategy with a focus on our industrial core business, we have streamlined our organization and introduced a powerful divisional structure that is aligned with Semperit's two main business models. With the Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) division, we are a leading international supplier of hydraulic and industrial hoses (Hoses) and sealing profiles (Profiles). In these business units, we focus on highly efficient production and cost leadership for industrial applications in connection with large-scale production. With the Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) division, we are an internationally renowned supplier of customized and tailormade technical solutions based on elastomers. We are already one of the world market leaders in escalator handrails, conveyor belts and track underlays. We also cover the entire value chain in the field of liquid silicone – from prototype development and toolmaking to largescale production. In addition to liquid silicone (Rico), the SEA division, which is strongly driven by innovation and technology, also includes the Belting and Form units. With this new structure we are increasing our efficiency and focusing on even greater customer proximity. It also enables us to optimally scale our business for future profitable growth.\n\nT H E 2 0 2 3 F I N A N C I A L Y E A R M A R KS T H E S U C C E S S F U L T R A N S F O R M AT I O N O F T H E S E M P E R I T G R O U P I N TO A N\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/7 description: A man in a blue shirt is looking at the inside of a large metal ring. The ring has a series of holes drilled into it. The man is standing inside the ring, and his head and shoulders are visible. The background is blurry, but it appears to be a factory or industrial setting.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/0 description: The image shows a large industrial complex with several buildings, a road, and a grassy area. The buildings are a mix of old and new styles, with some having red brick facades and others having white or blue exteriors. The road leads into the complex and there are several vehicles parked in the area. The sky is cloudy and the overall impression is one of a busy industrial site.\n\n### **ESG PRIORITIES**\n\nBased on the sale of the medical business and our purely industrial focus, we also adapted our ESG targets to the new structure in the past financial year. In the environmental area, we are systematically continuing to reduce energy, waste and CO2 emissions at all our sites. In addition, we are giving top priority to the continuous improvement of our health and safety performance indicators. We are placing a new focus on diversity and inclusion and have set ourselves specific targets for increasing the proportion of women in management positions. We will also take an even more ambitious approach to screening our supply chain. In order to achieve all of these goals, we are making numerous small and large adjustments during implementation, from climate protection and sustainable supply chains to a healthy and safe working environment. You will find all the details about our ESG initiatives and the development of our key figures in our Sustainability Report 2023.\n\n### **ECONOMIC HEADWIND**\n\nAs expected, the business development of the Semperit Group in 2023 was characterized by a challenging market environment in which we performed very solidly and generated revenue of EUR 721.1 million (–7.5%) in continued operations. While Semperit Industrial Applications was confronted with the general economic slowdown and ongoing destocking by customers, the Semperit Engineered Applications division benefited above all from continued strong demand for conveyor belts and specialty products in the Form business. Our two divisions, which are partly subject to different cycles, therefore complement each other very well.\n\nIn anticipation of economic headwinds, we took early countermeasures in the form of cost reductions and intensified these once again in the middle of the year as a result of the downsizing of the Group following the sale of the medical business. Continued operations generated EBITDA adjusted for one-off expenses of EUR 81.7 million (–14.7%) or EUR 71.8 million unadjusted (–28.5%). Earnings after tax from continued operations were positive at EUR 24.9 million, while the loss from the discontinued and now sold business division had a significant negative impact, as expected. Earnings after tax therefore amounted to EUR –17.1 million.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **ROBUST FINANCIAL BASE**\n\nWe have a very robust balance sheet and financial base in our Group, whereby we proactively adjusted our financing to our strategic needs over the course of 2023. Following the acquisition of Rico and the sale of the medical business, our balance sheet structure is now more balanced between equity and debt with a solid equity ratio of 45.3% and net financial debt of EUR 115.2 million. Our liquidity position of EUR 112.7 million at the end of 2023 was very comfortable. In addition, we have access to an undrawn credit line of EUR 100 million.\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/2 description: A man in a white shirt and glasses is standing in a factory, looking to the right. He is standing behind a large, flat, black surface, possibly a conveyor belt or a sheet of material. The factory has blue walls and ceilings, with pipes and machinery visible in the background. There are fluorescent lights on the ceiling, and the overall lighting is bright.\n\n### **STRATEGIC GROWTH INITIATIVES**\n\nWhile we are countering the economic downturn by cutting costs and increasing efficiency, we are systematically pursuing our strategic growth initiatives. These include the construction of a highly automated, additional hydraulic hose production facility at our site in Odry in the Czech Republic, which is already Europe's largest hose factory, and the expansion of production in the liquid silicone sector at Rico at its headquarters in Thalheim near Wels. With the expansion in Odry, we are strengthening our position and our competitiveness as one of the top global players for hydraulic hoses. We are paying particular attention to a high degree of automation and the ecological sustainability criteria of the EU taxonomy. The capacity expansions in Thalheim will in turn enable us to further extend our technological lead in the production of injection molding tools for a high number of cavities per tool and in automation.\n\nIn 2023, we thus invested in the future and our competitiveness while improving our efficiency. Therefore, despite the currently still challenging economic environment, we look to the future with confidence, because our business model is healthy and resilient, and we have the ambition to constantly improve and to be able to serve existing and future markets even faster. We will prove this once again in the 2024 financial year, which is a very special year for the Semperit Group.\n\nI N 2 0 2 3 , W E I N V E S T E D I N T H E F U T U R E A N D O U R C O M P E T I T I V E N E S S W H I L E I M P R OV I N G O U R E F F I C I E N CY.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **EXPERIENCE FOR TOMORROW**\n\nIn 2024, we will celebrate the 200th anniversary of Semperit under the motto \"200 Years Semperit – Experience for Tomorrow\". The impressive history of our company is based on strong success factors such as globalization, innovative spirit and customer orientation. Together with the Semperit spirit, which allows us to always find a solution, this has made us a reliable partner in a world that never stands still. And not just since yesterday, but since 1824. We will successfully continue this legacy in the future. Because with our products and solutions, we will keep our customers' technology and infrastructure running in the world of tomorrow.\n\nWith this in mind, we also want to ask our employees worldwide to come forward in 2024. Because without our Semperit employees, our success would never have been possible. Our 200-year website will therefore publish historical and current success stories from the world of Semperit throughout 2024. Check back at regular intervals!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we thank you for the trust you have placed in us with your investment in our company and look forward to continuing on the path we have chosen with full commitment.\n\n### **THE EXECUTIVE BOARD VIENNA, MARCH 18 2024**\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/5 description: A man with short brown hair and a blue suit is smiling at the camera.

Around 1900, a wide variety of products are manufactured, including balloon envelopes.\n\n# 1824–1872 1872–1918\n\n# **FOUNDATION AND EARLY YEARS**\n\nIn **1824**, tailor Johann Nepomuk Reithoffer lays the foundations for today's company with his patent for waterproof fabrics. The first European factory for rubber products is established in Wimpassing, Lower Austria.\n\n# **A EUROPEAN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANY IS CREATED**\n\nThe merger of several rubber companies makes Semperit the largest rubber goods producer in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Semperit goes public on the Vienna Stock Exchange in **1890**.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/10 description: This image is a black and white portrait of a man sitting in a chair. He is wearing a dark suit with a white shirt and tie. His hands are clasped in his lap. The background is a plain white wall.\n\nIn 1872, 800 workers are already employed in the factory in Wimpassing. Every month, they produce 15,000 pairs of shoes, 10,000 dozen combs, 2,500 bales, 3,000 pounds of rubber products for technical purposes, 500 coats and skirts and 1,500 rubber threads. A large proportion of the products are already exported worldwide.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/12 description: The image shows three gloves of different sizes. The gloves are all the same color and style, but they vary in length. The gloves are arranged from left to right, with the shortest glove on the left and the longest glove on the right. The gloves are all pointing in the same direction, with the fingers pointing downwards. The gloves are all lying flat on a surface. The image is well-lit and the gloves are in focus.\n\nGloves have been manufactured in the Wimpassing factory since the 19th century.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/14 description: The image contains two separate images. The image on the left is a black and white drawing of a woman holding a large hoop. The image on the right is a black and white photograph of a long building with a smokestack.\n\nSemperit Österreichisch-Amerikanische Gummiwerke AG is founded in 1912. The company is internationally competitive and employs more than 3,000 people.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/17 description: The image shows a document with text written in a non-English language. The document has a yellow background and is surrounded by a decorative border. The text is arranged in several lines and appears to be a formal certificate or document. There are also some decorative elements on the right side of the document.\n\nThe Semperit share is one of the oldest shares listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe increasing motorisation in the interwar period causes a surge in growth for Semperit tyres. In 1929, tyre production is already Semperit's largest production branch.\n\nSemperit's General Manager Messner talking to employees.\n\n# **AUSTRIA'S SECOND LARGEST INDUSTRIAL GROUP**\n\nAfter the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, Semperit is able to regain a foothold through expansion and the establishment of new sites. In **1926**, Semperit is Austria's second-largest industrial group with 9,000 employees and nine factories. The age of tyres is dawning.\n\nThe economic crisis of the 1930s leads to a dramatic revenue decline. The wide variety of the production programme proves to be uneconomical. 40,000 items are produced in Wimpassing, which is the most extensive range on the entire continent. Following a reorganisation of the company, business recovers from 1936 onwards.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/21 description: The image shows a black and white photograph of a room with several large, dark, spherical objects suspended from the ceiling. The room appears to be a library or office space, with shelves visible in the background. A person is seated at a desk in the background. The spherical objects are the most prominent feature of the image, and they create a sense of surrealism or abstraction.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/9 description: In a black and white photograph, several women are working at tables in what appears to be a factory or workshop setting. The women are seen from the back, and they are wearing light-colored aprons or dresses. They are seated at individual workstations, each equipped with some sort of machinery or equipment. The room is filled with shelves and storage units, suggesting a busy and organized workspace. The overall atmosphere is one of industry and labor.\n\nSoccer production\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/11 description: A vintage black and white photograph shows a truck parked in front of a building. The truck has a flatbed and the name \"WIMPEY & CO\" is painted on the side. The building behind the truck has an arched entrance with text above it, though the text is difficult to read. The truck is parked on a street, and the overall scene has a historical feel.\n\n# 1918–1938 1938–1945\n\n# **SEMPERIT UNDER NATIONAL SOCIALISM**\n\nSemperit is integrated into the wartime economic system of the Nazi era. Forced labourers are employed. Despite the adverse circumstances, General Manager Franz Josef Messner is committed to above-average social benefits at Semperit. He is also active as a resistance fighter and is executed in the last days of the war in **1945**.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/15 description: The image shows a life raft. The raft is made of a light-colored material and is shaped like a horseshoe. There is a paddle resting on the raft. The raft is sitting on a wooden platform. In the background, there are two more life rafts.\n\nInflatable boats for military operations\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/17 description: The image shows four black and white photographs. The first photograph shows the production of latex bulbs. The second photograph shows a truck. The third photograph shows women working. The fourth photograph shows women dominating everyday working life in Wimpassing during the war.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/18 description: In a sepia-toned indoor shot, a woman is seated and working at a machine. The woman is positioned on the left side of the frame, facing towards the right, with her back partially visible. She is wearing a dark, long-sleeved top and a knee-length skirt. Her hair is dark and appears to be pulled back. She is seated on a stool or chair, and her hands are engaged with the machine in front of her. The machine is a complex piece of equipment with various components, including wheels and levers. It is positioned on a stand or table. The background is somewhat cluttered, with various objects and structures visible, suggesting a workshop or factory setting. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a vintage or historical feel to the image.\n\neveryday working life in Wimpassing during the war.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/0 description: The image shows a tall building with many windows. The building is surrounded by trees. The image is in black and white.\n\nThe new Semperit high-rise in Vienna becomes the symbol of an up-andcoming company that is an international flagship of Austrian industry.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/2 description: In a black and white photograph, four men in suits are standing together. The man on the left is wearing glasses. All of the men are wearing ties. There is a decorative wall behind them.\n\nSatisfied faces after the sale of the tyre division. From left to right: Semperit Tyre CEO Günther Sieber, Semperit CEO Franz Josef Leibenfrost, Continental CEO Helmut Werner, Creditanstalt CEO and Semperit Supervisory Board Chairman Hannes Androsch.\n\n## **RECONSTRUCTION IN POST-WAR EUROPE**\n\nAfter disassembling the plants as reparations to the victorious powers and thanks to substantial investments, partially from the Marshall Plan, Semperit gets started with modern production facilities. Shareholdings in Europe provide a boost to internationalisation. In **1965**, the Semperit Group exports goods to 100 countries around the world. 15,000 employees in 24 production and sales companies and an annual production of 158,000 tonnes underpin the Semperit Group's position as an international flagship in **1973**.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/7 description: This is a black and white, slightly blurred, aerial shot of a factory complex. The complex is composed of several buildings of varying heights and sizes. A tall smokestack rises from one of the buildings. In the background, there are rolling hills and a small town.\n\nDemand is huge after the war. Semperit produces in three shifts and is still unable to fully satisfy demand.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/9 description: The image shows the rear of an airplane. The tail and wings are visible. The airplane is parked at an airport terminal. A set of stairs is leading up to the plane.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the product range reaches unprecedented diversity. The products are advertised with a designated bus and are so valuable that air freight sometimes pays off.\n\n# 1945–1973 1973–1989\n\n## **OIL PRICE SHOCK AND YEARS OF RESTRUCTURING**\n\nSemperit's tyre business collapses due to the oil crisis of the 1970s. In **1985**, the tyre division is sold to Continental. After a difficult restart, product streamlining leads to initial restructuring successes and the development potential of technical products is accelerated. The takeover of a conveyor belt plant near Paris in 1988 makes Semperit the largest supplier of textile conveyor belts in Europe.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/14 description: The image shows a close-up of a machine with multiple blue gloves attached to it. The gloves are arranged in a circular pattern, and the machine appears to be in operation. The background is blurred, but it seems to be an industrial setting.\n\nThe previously highly profitable tyre business collapses along with the entire automotive market. Semperit repositions itself. Investments are made in a product range that is concentrated on gloves, hoses, moulded goods and conveyor belts.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/16 description: In an indoor shot, a person in a blue jumpsuit stands next to a large tire. The tire is black and has a deep tread pattern. The person is facing away from the camera and appears to be inspecting the tire. The background is a warehouse or factory setting, with boxes and equipment visible. The lighting is somewhat dim, creating a slightly grainy effect.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/17 description: In a monochrome outdoor shot, a vintage car is captured in motion on a dirt road, with a backdrop of trees. The car, a classic sedan, is equipped with auxiliary lights on its front, suggesting it may be a rally or off-road vehicle. The dirt road is uneven, and the car is kicking up dust as it drives. The trees in the background are dense, creating a natural, wooded environment. The image has a vintage feel due to the monochrome palette and the style of the car.\n\nSemperit is one of Austria's best-known brands in the postwar period and is omnipresent, for example at the \"Semperit Rally\", the first cross-Austrian rally event in post-war Austria.\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/19 description: The image shows a large ship docked at a port. The ship is red and black, and it is docked next to a large crane. The crane is also red, and it is used to load and unload cargo from the ship. The port is a busy place, with lots of activity. There are several other ships in the background, and there are also several buildings and warehouses. The sky is blue, and there are a few clouds.\n\nSemperit expands with conveyor belts.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/0 description: In the image, several workers are wearing surgical masks and caps while working on a production line. They are putting on white gloves. The workers are wearing light-colored uniforms.\n\nIn 1989, the first glove factory in Thailand starts operation together with the joint venture partner Sri Trang. This is followed by dynamic expansion. By the end of 1998, annual production has risen to 2.6 billion examination and protective gloves, making Siam Sempermed the largest global glove factory. The products are exported all over the world.\n\nInnovative strength is further enhanced with the new R&D centre in Wimpassing.\n\n# **ASIA PIONEER SEMPERIT**\n\nFrom **1989**, General Manager Rainer Zellner shapes the development of Semperit for almost three decades. Under his leadership, the Group becomes the cost leader in many areas and pursues a course of international growth. Semperit is one of the first Austrian companies to have production facilities in Asia.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/7 description: The image shows two separate scenes within the same frame. The first scene depicts a factory setting with workers in blue uniforms operating machinery. One worker is actively engaged with a machine that has a large red wheel. The second scene shows a woman in a blue uniform and cap, also in a factory environment, working with a machine that appears to be winding or processing a thin, flexible material.\n\nIn 1996, Semperit enters the Chinese growth market for handrails. A hose and moulded goods plant is also built in Thailand. Sales are globalised. The important US glove market is served by Sempermed USA in Florida.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/9 description: A woman in a blue uniform and cap is standing in what appears to be a factory or industrial setting. She is holding a long, flexible orange tube or wire in both hands, creating a large loop. The tube extends from a coil on the floor to her hands, and then arches upwards. The background includes industrial machinery and gray walls, suggesting an indoor environment.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/10 description: A man in a blue shirt and blue overalls is working on a machine with many cylindrical objects arranged in a circular pattern. The machine appears to be in an industrial setting, with green walls and other machinery visible in the background. The man is focused on his task, and his hands are positioned as if he is adjusting or manipulating something on the machine.\n\nParallel to the expansion into Asia, the Wimpassing site is modernised. Under reorganisation manager Rainer Zellner, all business areas achieve sustainable profitability.\n\n# 1989–1998 1998–2017\n\n# **RISING TO THE TOP LEAGUE OF THE INDUSTRY**\n\nThe focus is on internationalisation, innovation and cost leadership. Europe's largest hose factory in Odry, Czech Republic, becomes part of the Semperit Group in **1998**. The conveyor belt segment Sempertrans expands into Poland and takes over the Bełchatów conveyor belt plant in several stages. At the turn of the millennium, Semperit is present on three continents with 20 production sites and 6,000 employees.\n\nWith the acquisitions in the Czech Republic and Poland, Semperit has become one of the big players in the global hose and conveyor belt business.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/16 description: The image shows an industrial area with a large building in the background. There are pipes running overhead, and the ground is wet, possibly from rain. The sky is cloudy and overcast, suggesting a gloomy or rainy day. The overall impression is one of a functional, utilitarian space, likely part of a factory or industrial complex.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/17 description: The image shows a blurred factory interior with rows of large spools of cable in the foreground. To the right, there is text that reads \"At the turn Semperit threshold schillings consistent\".\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Semperit exceeds the revenue threshold of 5 billion Austrian schillings. The product portfolio is consistently competitive.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/19 description: A medium shot depicts a man in a blue uniform and a hard hat, holding a device in his hands, standing in what appears to be a factory or industrial setting. The man is looking upwards, seemingly inspecting or observing something above him. Large, dark-colored spools or reels are suspended from the ceiling, adding to the industrial atmosphere of the scene. The lighting is somewhat dim, but sufficient to illuminate the man and the surrounding equipment.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/0 description: Two men in suits are sitting at a table, with one man signing a document. The man on the left is looking at the document, while the man on the right is signing it. There is a blue abstract design on the wall behind them.\n\nWith the divestment of the medical business, Semperit is realising its transformation to become an elastomers specialist for the industrial sector and is focussing on the expansion of its industrial core business. Semperit CEO Karl Haider (right) signs the closing documents for the sale at the end of August 2023 with Haziq Bin Zairel Oh, CEO of the buyer Harps.\n\n# 2017–2023\n\n## **GLOBAL PLAYER SEMPERIT**\n\nSemperit implements the largest investment programme in the company's history and expands its production capacities worldwide in response to strong demand. After a phase of global growth, the strategic decision is made to focus on the Industrial Sector. Semperit divests its glove segment Sempermed. In **2023**, Semperit acquires the Rico Group, a global technology leader in liquid silicone and mould making, thereby strengthening its industrial core business.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/5 description: Two men wearing hard hats and safety vests are standing next to two signs. One man is holding a shovel and the other is holding a tool. The sign on the left has the text \"DEMONSTRATE & UNIQUE APPLICATIONS\" and the sign on the right has the text \"Aviation Fueling Solutions\".\n\nStart of construction for the expansion of hose production in Odry, Czech Republic. This will strengthen the company's position as global market leader for hydraulic hoses.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/7 description: A man in a blue shirt is standing inside a large, circular structure made of metal. The structure appears to be part of a machine or industrial equipment. The man is smiling and looking towards the right side of the frame. The metal structure has a number \"28\" written on it.\n\nCapacities are being expanded around the world. From Odry to Shanghai, from Bełchatów to Kamunting and from Deggendorf to Newnan.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/9 description: This is an aerial shot of a complex of buildings, likely an industrial or commercial park, set against a backdrop of fields and distant trees. The buildings are a mix of sizes and shapes, with some having red roofs and others with blue or gray. A large parking lot filled with cars is visible in the foreground, suggesting a busy working environment. The overall impression is one of a well-organized and active business area in a rural or suburban setting.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/10 description: The image shows an industrial autoclave with its door open. The autoclave is a large, cylindrical pressure vessel, and the open door reveals the interior, which contains a metal rack structure. The exterior of the autoclave is painted in a light color, and there are various pipes and machinery visible in the background, suggesting it is located in a manufacturing or industrial setting. The lighting is bright, highlighting the metallic surfaces and the overall scale of the equipment.\n\nWith Rico's expertise in liquid silicone and mould production, Semperit can tap into new, attractive markets and continue to grow, especially in North America.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **SUCCESS FACTORS OUR DNA**\n\nThis experience and our strong focus on our success factors enable us to actively shape the future.

But it always goes on, and there is always a solution – you can continue to rely on that in the future.\n\nImage /page/18/Picture/5 description: The image shows a meeting with three people. One person is standing and presenting to the other two people who are sitting at a table. There is a large screen behind them with a logo on it.\n\n# **SUSTAINABLE PARTNER**\n\nWithout sustainability in its corporate DNA, Semperit would not celebrate its 200-years anniversary. And without sustainability as a strategically anchored basic principle, no promising future would be possible for Semperit. In implementing this principle, we make small and large adjustments, from climate protection and sustainable supply chains to a healthy and safe working environment. This makes Semperit a sustainable partner and fit for future challenges.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **SEMPERIT ENGINEERED APPLICATIONS**\n\nWith our Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) division, we are an internationally sought-after supplier of customized and tailor-made technical solutions based on elastomers, including escalator handrails, conveyor belts and track underlays.

The ongoing war in Ukraine led to restraint on the part of international investors and thus to a more subdued share price performance on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Towards the end of the year, however, there was growing hope that the easing inflationary pressure would clear the way for key interest rate cuts. Corresponding signals from central banks also led to a year-end rally on the stock markets. Over the full year, the ATX Index gained 9.9% and the MDAX improved by 8.0%.\n\nThe Semperit share performed positively in the first half of 2023, with the signing of the contract for the sale of the medical business at the end of 2022 also having a supportive effect. At EUR 27.10, the share reached its high for the year on April 17, shortly before the Annual General Meeting approved the dividend and the then still conditional additional dividend, totaling EUR 4.5 per share. The second half of the year was characterized by a downward trend. Possible reasons for this were the sales of larger blocks of shares by individual investors as a result of the adapted Semperit business model (sale of the medical business) as well as increased sales following the payment of the additional dividend in September. The low for the year was EUR 13.10 on December 1, the closing price at the end of 2023 was EUR 14.16. Based on the closing price of EUR 19.82 per share for the 2022 financial year, this represents a decline of 28.6%; taking into account the dividends paid out, the total return is –5.9%. The start to the 2024 stock market year was generally positive, with the share also outperforming benchmark indices and shares. However, larger sales volumes at the beginning of February weighed on the share price again.\n\nMarket capitalization totaled EUR 291 million at the end of 2023 (EUR 408 million at the end of 2022). The average daily trading volume of Semperit shares in euros decreased accordingly in 2023 compared to 2022, amounting to EUR 291 thousand with around 15,000 shares (2021: EUR 529 thousand with around 24,000 shares).\n\n### Dividend\n\nThe dividend policy of the Semperit Group basically aims at a distribution of around 50% of earnings after taxes – assuming continued successful performance with no unusual circumstances.\n\nIn view of the positive earnings after taxes from continued operations – the relevant earnings and comparative figure for future business development – the Executive Board will propose a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share to the Annual General Meeting. A total of EUR 10.3 million therefore should be distributed. With a share price of EUR 14.16 at the end of 2023, this results in a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nA basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share plus an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share was distributed for the 2022 financial year following the fulfillment of the conditions precedent in connection with the (first) closing of the sale of the medical business. This corresponds to a total dividend yield of 22.7% in relation to the closing price of EUR 19.82 in 2022.\n\nHaving been listed since 1890, the Semperit share is one of the oldest on the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/2 description: The image is a bar chart comparing earnings per share (EPS) in EUR from 2018 to 2023. In 2018, the EPS was -4.13. In 2019, the EPS was -2.48. In 2020, the EPS was 9.06 and 1.50. In 2021, the EPS was 11.99 and 1.50. In 2022, the EPS was -0.27 and 4.50. In 2023, the EPS was -0.82 and 0.50.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) in EUR\n\nDividend per share in EUR; 2023 proposal to the AGM; 2022 base dividend of EUR 1.50, an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 was paid, which was linked to the successful sale of the medical business; see Dividend section for further details\n\n### Communication in the capital market\n\nThe Semperit Group intends to provide current and potential shareholders with a complete picture of the company's business performance through a transparent and prompt communications policy. The company also relies on different ways of conveying information. This should enable an accurate valuation of Semperit shares on the markets and facilitate a long-term relationship of trust with both shareholders and the general public.\n\nThe Executive Board and Investor Relations actively seek dialogue with players on the capital markets. As a result of the change in communication habits and in travel behavior after the pandemic, traditional activities such as roadshows or plant visits have shifted more to digital forms of communication. In 2023, Semperit took part in numerous investor conferences, some of which were held online format, while others took place on site, for example in Frankfurt, Munich, Algarve, Zürs and Vienna. Moreover, numerous meetings, conference calls and video calls were arranged to best cater to the requests of individual investors expressing an interest.\n\nEquity research and the ongoing dialogue with analysts are also important elements of the company's communications with the financial market. Analysts from the following institutions reported on Semperit during the 2023 financial year: Baader Bank, Erste Bank, Kepler Cheuvreux, and Raiffeisen Bank International. Meetings with analysts took place regularly again in 2023.\n\nIn addition, the Investor Relations website also plays an important role in communication on the technical side. In addition to financial reports and presentations, there is a share chart tool that allows for comparisons to be made with indexes and selected shares and provides detailed information on the share and other topics relating to the financial market.\n\nInvestor Relations Website: www.semperitgroup.com /ir\n\n### EPS and DPS\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Semperit share at a glance\n\n|                                             |              | 01.01. –<br>31.12.2023 | Change | 01.01. –<br>31.12.2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|--------|------------------------|\n| Price at balance sheet date                 | in EUR       | 14.16                  | -28.6% | 19.82                  |\n| Lowest price                                | in EUR       | 13.60                  | -15.8% | 16.16                  |\n| Highest price                               | in EUR       | 27.10                  | -9.7%  | 30.00                  |\n| Market capitalisation at balance sheet date | in EUR m     | 291.32                 | -28.6% | 407.77                 |\n| Number of shares issued                     | in units.    | 20,573,434             | –      | 20,573,434             |\n| Earnings per share (EPS)1                   | in EUR       | -0.82                  | n/a    | -0.27                  |\n| Dividend per share2                         | in EUR       | 0.50                   | -88.9% | 4.50                   |\n| Average trading volume/day3                 | in 1,000 EUR | 291.2                  | -44.9% | 528.6                  |\n| Average traded shares/day3                  | in units.    | 14,536                 | -39.0% | 23,812                 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Attributable to the shareholders of Semperit AG Holding\n\n<sup>2</sup> 2023: Proposal to the AGM of a dividend of EUR 0.5 per share.

This code contains common international standards and significant related regulations in this context, stipulated in the Austrian Stock Corporation, Stock Exchange and Capital Market Acts. The Austrian Corporate Governance Code is based on the EU recommendations on the tasks of supervisory board members and on the remuneration of executive board members and supervisory board members as well as on the principles set out in the OECD Guidelines for Corporate Governance. The code is aimed at ensuring responsible management and supervision of individual companies and groups, with the goal of creating sustainable and long-lasting value. The code seeks to create a high level of transparency for all company stakeholders.\n\nCompanies voluntarily commit to compliance with the guidelines set out in the current version of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code as amended. The version of the Corporate Governance Code that is applicable to the 2023 financial year was published in January 2023 and can be found online at www.corporate-governance.at.\n\n### Statement on corporate governance\n\nThe Semperit Group, as a publicly listed company that operates globally, hereby declares that it will voluntarily observe the Austrian Corporate Governance Code in its current version and that it also intends to observe the code in the future and justify any behavior to the contrary. Semperit AG Holding complies with all legally binding L-Rules (legal requirements). Unless otherwise declared, the C-Rules (comply or explain) will be observed by the relevant bodies and the company.\n\n### Dual management structure\n\nThe dual management structure of Semperit AG Holding as a publicly listed stock corporation consists of an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. Both bodies are strictly separated from each other in terms of personnel and functions and can therefore perform their different tasks independently. The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company, while the Supervisory Board is responsible for monitoring it.\n\n### Cooperation between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board are committed to managing the company in accordance with the principles of good corporate governance. This management takes place in an open dialogue between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as within these corporate bodies to ensure its continuous development. Among other things, the Executive Board's internal rules of procedure govern the Executive Board's ongoing reporting to the Supervisory Board. They also specify a catalogue of transactions and measures that, in addition to legal provisions, require the Supervisory Board's explicit authorization. The Supervisory Board monitors the Executive Board and supports it in managing the company, particularly when decisions of fundamental importance are to be made.\n\nThe strategic direction of the company is determined in close cooperation between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and is discussed in Supervisory Board meetings held at regular intervals.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Executive Board\n\n### Composition and function of the Executive Board\n\nAt the end of the 2023 financial year, the Executive Board consisted of three members: CEO Karl Haider, CFO Helmut Sorger and CIO Gerfried Eder.

The Board has full responsibility for managing the company for the benefit of the business while considering the interests of shareholders and employees as well as the public interest.\n\nThe Executive Board's internal rules of procedure regulate the allocation of business responsibilities and the principles of cooperation between members of the Executive Board. Decisions of primary importance are taken by the Board as a whole. The Executive Board is solely responsible for all communications that have a significant impact on how the company is perceived by its stakeholders. Legally binding regulations, the Articles of Association, and the internal rules of procedure for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board laid down by the Supervisory Board form the basis for corporate management.\n\n### Karl Haider\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) since 11 January 2022; term of office ends on 31 March 2025.\n\nKarl Haider, born in 1965, started his career as a chemical lab technician.

Overall attendance was 99%; only one member was absent from one meeting. Stefan Fida served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Birgit Noggler as Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board until the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023. Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting; he was elected as Chairman and Stefan Fida as Deputy Chairman at the constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board. The individual Supervisory Board meetings focused on the further development of the industrial strategy and the associated implementation of the new organizational structure, the acquisition of the RICO Group, the sale of the medical business and measures to reduce costs and increase efficiency.\n\nThe Audit Committee led by finance expert Birgit Noggler performs its duties in accordance with Article 92 Section 4a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and Rule 40 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. In 2023, the Audit Committee held four meetings, focusing particularly on the preparation of the adoption of the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2022, on the acquisition of the RICO Group as well as the sale of the medical business, on risk management, the internal control system, internal auditing, the compliance organization, IT security (cybersecurity), and the preparation of the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023.\n\nThe Nominating and Remuneration Committee was chaired by Stefan Fida until 25 April 2023, and Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was appointed Chairman at the constituent Supervisory Board meeting following the Annual General Meeting. In eight meetings, the Committee focused on the performance assessment and agreement of targets for the members of the Executive Board. Other focal points were the early departure of Kristian Brok as well as the succession to the Executive Board and the appointment of Gerfried Eder. In addition, the potential and succession issues of the second management level and initiatives for talent management within the company were discussed with the Executive Board.\n\nThe Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee, which was established in April 2023, held two meetings under the chairmanship of Thomas Cord Prinzhorn. The committee focused on supporting the strategy process, including the realignment of the organizational structure, as well as discussing strategic initiatives and growth potential. The committee also dealt intensively with the innovation portfolio and the KPIs of the innovation process.\n\nThe ESG Committee, which was also founded in April 2023, monitors the establishment and effectiveness of sustainability reporting, deals with defining ESG targets in Executive Board remuneration and supports the Supervisory Board with other ESG issues, particularly if these are relevant to the Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee. Under the chairmanship of Thomas Cord Prinzhorn, the committee held one meeting to discuss the updating of the ESG strategy and targets as a result of the restructuring of the Group and the implementation of new ESG regulations and standards (e.g., CSRD).\n\nThe Committee for Urgent Issues, headed by Thomas Cord Prinzhorn since 25 April 2023, did not hold any meetings.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the first half of 2023, the Supervisory Board completed a comprehensive self-evaluation based on both qualitative and quantitative assessment in accordance with C Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. In addition to a generally very positive evaluation result for the Supervisory Board's activities, specific measures to increase efficiency were also derived from this. These measures related, for example, to the areas of organization and working methods, information and communication or committee work and further training. An update of the quantitative evaluation is planned for the second half of 2024 in order to review the successful implementation of the measures developed and to identify further areas for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the Supervisory Board's work.\n\n### Composition of the Supervisory Board Committees1\n\n| Committee                                                          | Members                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Committee for Urgent Issues                                        | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (member and Chairman since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stefan Fida (Chairman until 25.04.2023)<br>Markus Stocker                                                                |\n| Nominating and Remuneration<br>Committee                           | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (member and Chairman since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stefan Fida (Chairman until 25.04.2023)<br>Markus Stocker                                                                |\n| Audit Committee                                                    | Birgit Noggler (Chairwoman, financial expert)<br>Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Member since 25.04.2023)2<br>Stephan Büttner<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker                          |\n| Strategy, Growth and Innovation<br>Committee<br>(as of 25.04.2023) | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Chairman)<br>Klaus Friedrich Erkes<br>Claus Möhlenkamp<br>Marion Weissenberger-Eibl<br>Birgit Noggler<br>Monika Müller<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker |\n| ESG Committee<br>(as of 25.04.2023)                                | Thomas Cord Prinzhorn (Chairman)<br>Stefan Fida<br>Birgit Noggler<br>Marion Weissenberger-Eibl<br>Michael Schwiegelhofer<br>Markus Stocker                                                |\n\n¹ As of 31 December 2023.\n\n<sup>1</sup> As of 31 December 2023. 2 On 25 April 2023, Thomas Cord Prinzhorn was elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting and elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board at its constituent meeting.

According to this, all members of the Supervisory Board declared their independence from the company and its Executive Board. In addition, pursuant to C-Rule 54 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the members Stephan Büttner, Claus Möhlenkamp and Marion Weissenberger-Eibl were not shareholders of the company with an investment of more than 10% each nor did they represent the interests of such shareholders in 2023. There is D&O insurance for the Supervisory Board. The associated expenses are borne by the company.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Remuneration of the Executive and Supervisory Boards\n\nIn accordance with Section 78c of the Stock Corporation Act and, as a result, in accordance with the amended reporting requirements in the Corporate Governance Code and AFRAC Statement 37 on the Compensation Report, Directive (EU) 2017/828 to promote long-term participation of shareholders was implemented in the 2019 Stock Corporation Law Amendment Act. Accordingly, the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board must be dealt with in a separate remuneration report and presented to the Annual General Meeting (please also refer to www.semperitgroup.com/investor-relations/reports-presentations).\n\n### Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance\n\nDirectors and Officers (D&O) insurance has been taken out for the members of the Executive Board and senior executives within the Group. The company bears the related costs. In case of damage, deductibles were agreed for the event that Executive Board members are found to be in breach of duty.\n\n### Managers' transactions\n\nThere were no proprietary transactions in the financial year. In general, transactions in shares or debt instruments of the company or related derivatives or financial instruments by members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are published in accordance with Art. 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation at https://issuerinfo.oekb.at and on the company's website.\n\n### Equal opportunities and diversity\n\nThe promotion of Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) is an essential part of Semperit's sustainability strategy. The vision for Diversity & Inclusion 2040 is to promote a collaborative and inclusive work culture in which all employees feel valued, have a sense of belonging, feel comfortable, can live their authentic selves and are respected as individuals. The intention is to ensure fairness in all aspects. Semperit wants to reduce unconscious bias and use the great diversity in the workforce to its advantage in order to benefit from the experiences and perspectives of people with different cultural imprints and other backgrounds (for details see also Sustainability Report 2023). Respect, diversity, and inclusion are integral and indispensable elements of the corporate culture of Semperit AG Holding and are always considered when filling vacancies. When proposals are made to the Annual General Meeting for filling Supervisory Board mandates and when nominating Executive Board members, special importance is attached to expertise and diversity because this contributes significantly to the level of professionalism and efficiency delivered through the work of the Supervisory and Executive Boards. In addition to professional and personal qualifications, aspects such as age, ethnic origin, gender, education, and experience are also factored in. The written version of a diversity concept of the Supervisory Board was adopted on 1 February 2018 and updated in the 2021 financial year.\n\nAt the same time, the topic of diversity and inclusion (D&I) is not only relevant for filling management positions, but for the entire Semperit Group. This applies to the existing workforce as well as to the recruitment and hiring of new employees. In addition to professional and personal qualifications, aspects such as age, origin, gender, education and experience are also taken into account, as is the case for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. A diversity and inclusion strategy was developed in 2022. In the course of various workshops, four dimensions and goals were defined that are crucial for Semperit in the area of D&I:\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Gender: In a step-by-step process, Semperit is pursuing the path to a more balanced gender distribution at all hierarchical levels of the Group. Each Semperit site is developing a local action plan with at least two defined initiatives to eliminate relevant local gender barriers. In addition, Group HR has been reporting on the current gender balance in Semperit's senior management on an ongoing basis since 2023. In the second half of 2023, a progress plan for a balanced gender ratio in senior management was drawn up, and in October 2023 the Executive Board defined an annual increase in the proportion of women as a target by 2030.\n- Age: By the end of 2025, Semperit will have ensured that there is equal treatment of all age groups both in guidelines and in corporate practice in the areas of recruitment, employee promotion and development. This goal is to be achieved through a change in corporate culture, which will in turn be initiated through the implementation of at least five defined initiatives focusing on the elimination of system barriers and prejudices against all age groups.\n- People with disabilities: Following a successful pilot project in Austria in 2022, initiatives to better identify and analyze the needs of employees with disabilities and to implement improvements were carried out at all Semperit sites in 2023. The approach is based on the identification of local system barriers at the site and their targeted elimination. Measure, cost and implementation plans were developed at all production sites in order to make the workplaces and the site more inclusive for employees with disabilities.\n- Culture and intercultural competence: By the end of 2025, Semperit will have strengthened intercultural competence through continuous awareness-raising communication measures and ensure that all employees have completed awareness training to eliminate prejudices with regard to culture, origin and inclusion.\n\nBuilding on this, \"D&I Councils\" were established for each dimension at the beginning of 2022 with representatives from various divisions, locations, age groups and hierarchical levels. The D&I Councils also work as think tank platforms where data is analyzed, ideas are exchanged, and initiatives are designed to promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce. The fact that D&I has become an integral part of Semperit's corporate culture is also reflected in numerous communication measures implemented in 2023. Examples include the D&I PC screensavers provided within the company or informative intranet and shop floor postings. In addition, Semperit offers information opportunities via a specially created \"D&I microsite\", where employees can also contribute their own ideas. In June 2023, the Executive Board and the upper management levels also signed a \"Diversity Charter\". This document underlines the importance of promoting a networked and inclusive culture at Semperit.\n\n### Advancement of women\n\nSemperit is committed to equal opportunities for all employees – regardless of age, gender, nationality, religion, skin color, or sexual orientation. A person's skills and potential are what counts. The gradual increase in the proportion of women in the Semperit Group, which – typical for an industrial company – is lower than in other sectors, is a central goal for human resources. The measures to promote women include flexible working models in the form of flexitime and part-time work as well as special agreements for part-time parental leave. These measures and the new ESG target introduced by the Executive Board in 2023, which will be applicable from 2024, are intended to contribute to a continuous increase in the proportion of women (for more details, see the 2023 Sustainability Report). In addition to the new target, the Executive Board has set another example in the fight against gender inequality and signed the UN-initiated Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs). These comprise a series of principles that provide companies with guidance on how they can pro\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nmote gender equality and the empowerment of women. As a traditional industrial company with a technical focus, the share of women was 27% across the Group in 2023 (2022: 23%). Since May 2017, Semperit AG Holding has met the quota for women on the Supervisory Board, which has been required by law since 2018. Overall, the share of women in management (Executive Board, Management Forum, department heads) was around 14% (2022: 13%).\n\n### Issuer Compliance Policy\n\nIn order to implement and ensure compliance with all relevant stock exchange regulations, Semperit AG Holding has issued its own Issuer Compliance Policy designed to prevent the misuse or dissemination of insider information. Compliance is monitored and administered by an Issuer Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Executive Board.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nBeyond issuer compliance, the Semperit Group has a compliance organization that covers all corporate units. A Group Compliance Officer receives support in fulfilling their responsibilities from central compliance team and local compliance coordinators working in the subsidiaries of the Semperit Group. The main focus is on ensuring compliance with regulations in the areas of anti-corruption, antitrust law, export control and sanctions as well as data protection. The Group Compliance Officer is also the deputy of the Issuer Compliance Officer.\n\nThe Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees and managers and is available in several languages, was updated and published in 2022. Its most important objectives are to avoid corruption, money laundering, human rights violations, insider trading, and breaches of competition law. In addition, it deals with aspects of data protection and export restrictions. These conduct requirements are further specified in thematic compliance guidelines. Employees receive in-depth and practical training with a focus on the matters referred to in the Code of Conduct. In addition, there is regular internal communication from the Executive Board and the relevant managers providing support on compliance-related topics. The Code of Conduct can be viewed online here: https://www.semperitgroup.com/company/compliance-code-of-conduct.\n\n### Whistleblower system\n\nIn order to support the above-mentioned targets of the Code of Conduct, the information hotline \"SemperLine\" was set up in January 2018. Employees as well as external stakeholders are welcome to report infringements of the Code of Conduct – also in an anonymous way:\n\nhttps://www.bkms-system.com/bkwebanon/report/clientInfo?cin=19semp16&c=-1&language=eng.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risk Management & Assurance\n\nThe \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department is responsible for the central coordination, moderation and monitoring of the structured risk process for the entire Group. The enterprise risk management process is based on the globally recognized framework concept of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and aims to identify, assess and manage risks at an early stage. In addition to fulfilling legal requirements (compliance), the strategic focus is on the early identification of negative developments in the strategic, operational, market and financial areas that could hinder the success of the Semperit Group. Relevant risks are identified and assessed in terms of their impact and probability of occurrence. Responsibilities are identified, measures are defined, and tracking is ensured. Elements of both the bottom-up and top-down approaches are combined to ensure that potential new risks are discussed at management level and, if relevant, included in reporting. As part of the enterprise risk management approach, the reporting period for risk assessment is one year in any case and – in line with medium-term planning – up to five years. ESG-relevant risks may have a different, longer observation period. The process is completed by reporting to the relevant stakeholders. Individual reporting takes place immediately after the respective risk update in the respective Group divisions. Comprehensive risk reporting on individual risks, including aggregation at Group level, is carried out at least once a year, and a quarterly progress report on current developments, changes and additions to the risk portfolio is submitted to the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board. The regular reporting process is complemented by an ad-hoc reporting process to draw attention to critical issues in good time.\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. audited and confirmed the functionality of the risk management system of the Semperit Group for the 2023 financial year in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nThe purpose of the internal control system of the Semperit Group is to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency and profitability of business operations, the reliability of financial reporting, and adherence to applicable laws and regulations. It also supports the early recognition and monitoring of risks from inadequate monitoring systems and fraudulent actions and is revised and expanded on an ongoing basis by the \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department together with the relevant specialist departments. The management of the relevant business units is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the internal control system and the risk management system. The Executive Board of Semperit AG Holding stipulates cross-divisional framework conditions and regulations that are applicable throughout the Group. Follow-up audits are undertaken at the various sites and at the headquarters on a regular basis to ensure sustainable implementation of these framework conditions and regulations.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n### External evaluation\n\nIn accordance with C-Rule 62 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the Semperit Group commissioned an external organization to evaluate its compliance with the stipulations contained in the code and the accuracy of the associated public reporting for 2022. This evaluation, which was performed by Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., did not identify any facts inconsistent with the declaration of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board found in the 2022 Corporate Governance Report with respect to its compliance with the C Rules of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code. In accordance with C-Rule 62, a new evaluation is planned for the year 2025.\n\nVienna, 18 March 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nKorda Ward\n\nKarl Haider CEO\n\nHelmut Sorger CFO\n\nGerfried Eder CIO\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/2 description: A portrait shot of a middle-aged man in a suit and tie.

On the one hand, the past financial year was characterized by the still challenging economic environment, in which our company held its ground very solidly and introduced cost-cutting measures at an early stage. On the other hand, important strategic decisions were made and the transformation of the Group into an industrial elastomer specialist was implemented as announced. This was achieved through the sale of the medical business with the first and important transaction closing at the end of August, in which you as shareholders were able to participate in the form of an additional dividend. The acquisition of the Rico Group, in turn, secured Semperit a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking. The new divisional structure, which is based on the two main business models, is also accompanied by a reduction in complexity and an increase in efficiency. Moreover, it is the ideal platform for further profitable growth.\n\nIn our function as the Supervisory Board, we accompanied and supported the Semperit Group and its Executive Board in this strategic transformation and all other projects, took on an active role as a sparring partner for the Executive Board and, as in previous years, performed the duties assigned to us by law and the corporate statutes with great care. The Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board comprehensively, continuously and promptly about developments on the markets and the effects of the challenging market environment on the course of business as well as countermeasures to ensure the Group's competitiveness, strategic growth projects and the company's assets, financial position and earnings situation, thereby fulfilling its duty to provide information at all times and in appropriate depth. A total of seven Supervisory Board meetings were held in 2023, with a total attendance rate of 98% by the shareholder representatives. In addition, there were 15 committee meetings with a total attendance rate of 100%. A detailed overview of the individual attendances and the committees can be found in the Corporate Governance Report from page 31 onwards. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board were also in regular contact between meetings, and several resolutions were passed by way of circulation. Cooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board was characterized by open discussions and constructive cooperation throughout.\n\n### Effective work in committees\n\nThe Audit Committee, chaired by financial expert Birgit Noggler, held four meetings in 2023. The focal topics were the preparation of the resolution on the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2022 financial year, deconsolidation of the medical business, risk management, the internal control system, internal auditing, the compliance organization, IT security (cybersecurity) and the preparation of the annual and consolidated financial statement audit for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Nominating and Remuneration Committee held eight meetings in 2023. It was chaired by Stefan Fida until the Annual General Meeting, and then by myself. Our focus was on the performance assessment and objectives of the Executive Board members as well as the early departure of Kristian Brok and the succession to the Executive Board with the appointment of Gerfried Eder. In addition, the potential and succession issues at the second management level and talent management initiatives were discussed with the Executive Board. The Committee for Urgent Matters did not hold any meetings.\n\nIn addition, we formed two new committees under my chairmanship in April: In the Strategy, Growth and Innovation Committee, we held two meetings to discuss the strategy process and the realignment of the organizational structure as well as strategic initiatives and growth potential. The committee also dealt intensively with the innovation portfolio and the control variables of the innovation process.\n\nThe ESG Committee held one meeting to discuss the update of the ESG strategy and objectives following the restructuring of the Group and the implementation of new ESG regulations and standards.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Changes to the Supervisory Board and Executive Board\n\nAt the end of the 134th Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023, Astrid-Skala-Kuhmann stepped down from the Supervisory Board at her own request, and the shareholders elected Marion Weissenberger-Eibl and me as new members of the Supervisory Board. In June, the Supervisory Board approved the early termination of the Executive Board contract of Kristian Brok, who left the company at his own request, and appointed Gerfried Eder as a new member of the Executive Board and Chief Industrial Officer with effect from 1 July 2023. We are convinced that the Executive Board team is ideally positioned to continue Semperit's successful course.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank Astrid Skala-Kuhmann and Kristian Brok for their professional work and support of the Semperit Group.\n\n### Approval of the 2023 annual financial statements\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2023, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (EY) was appointed as the auditor of the company's annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year. As a result of its audit, EY has issued an unqualified audit opinion on the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of Semperit AG Holding as of 31 December 2023. The management report and the group management report are consistent with the annual and consolidated financial statements. The non-financial reporting (sustainability report) for the 2023 financial year was also subjected to an independent audit by EY.\n\nIn its meetings held on 13 and 18 March 2023, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board dealt intensively with the annual financial statements including the management report, the consolidated financial statements including the group management report, the corporate governance report, the sustainability report and the auditor's reports, with the results of the audit being discussed in detail with the auditor. Based on the efficient audit process for the annual financial statements 2023, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual General Meeting to reappoint Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. as auditors for the financial year 2024.\n\nThe Supervisory Board examined the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the management report and the group management report, the corporate governance report and the sustainability report and concurs with the conclusions of the audit. The Supervisory Board formally approves the annual financial statements for 2023, which are consequently adopted in accordance with Article 96 para. 4 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The corporate governance report, the sustainability report, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report 2023 as well as the remuneration report have also been approved by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is following the recommendation of the Audit Committee and proposing Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. as auditors for the 2024 financial year to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Supervisory Board declares its agreement with the Executive Board's profit distribution proposal, according to which a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share should be proposed to the AGM. A total of EUR 10.3 million is therefore intended to be distributed.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees of the Semperit Group for their extraordinary dedication and commitment. Special thanks also go to you, the shareholders, customers and partners of Semperit for the trust you have placed in us.\n\nVienna, March 18, 2024\n\nSh. C. Porter\n\nThomas Cord Prinzhorn Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group Management Report\n\nWith effect from July 1, 2023, the planned adjustment of the organizational structure was carried out as part of the further development of the industrial strategy, and the previously existing segments of the Industrial Sector were divided into two divisions: the Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) division focuses on industrial applications through highly efficient production and cost leadership; this includes hydraulic and industrial hoses (the former Semperflex segment) as well as profiles (formerly part of the Semperseal segment). The Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) division focuses on customized technical solutions and comprises escalator handrails, cable car rings and other customerspecific elastomer products (the former Semperform segment), including elastomer sheets (formerly part of the Semperseal segment) and conveyor belts (the former Sempertrans segment). The Rico Group, a leading supplier of silicone injection molding tools and producer of liquid and solid silicone components, has also been part of this division since 1 August 2023.\n\n### Economic environment\n\nOverall, the 2023 financial year was characterized by headwinds for the global economy, although the global economy continued to slowly recover from the negative shocks of recent years, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the sharp increase in raw material and energy prices. However, the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, geopolitical uncertainties and the high inflation and interest rate environment remained among the main factors influencing global economic development. In the period following the pandemic, many companies began to reduce their inventories, which they had previously increased as a precautionary measure to ensure production and delivery during periods characterized by supply chain bottlenecks.\n\nIn its growth forecast published in January 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts global economic growth of 3.1% in 2023. It also forecasts 3.1% for 2024, and 3.2% for 2025. Although the forecast for 2024 has been raised by 0.2 percentage points compared to the October 2023 forecast, the estimate for the years 2024 to 2025 is below the historical average (2000 - 2019) of 3.8%.\n\nA growth rate of 2.5% was calculated for the USA for 2023, while 2.1% is currently expected for 2024 – unchanged from last October's estimate. In contrast, the growth forecast for the eurozone has been revised downwards for 2024 and now stands at 0.9% after 0.5% for 2023. In October 2023, GDP was still expected to increase by 1.2% in 2024. With regard to the major eurozone economies, the forecasts fell by 0.4 percentage points to just 0.5% for Germany and by 0.3 percentage points to 1.0% for France. The forecast for Italy remains unchanged at 0.7%. By contrast, the forecast for (primarily Asian) emerging and developing countries improved slightly: while a growth rate of 4.0% was still forecast for both 2023 and 2024 in the fall forecast, the forecast is now 4.1%. China is expected to grow by 4.6% in 2024, after 5.2% in 2023.\n\nAccording to the forecast published by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) in December 2023, there are hardly any signs of a recovery in the domestic industrial economy. The Austrian economy shrank by 0.8% in 2023. The negative factors were high inflation and global industrial weakness. WIFO is therefore assuming a delayed recovery in industrial production in Austria, which means that GDP should only grow by 0.9% in 2024.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nVarious raw materials such as butadiene, carbon black and natural rubber are important basic components\nfor the manufacture of polymer products. After the geopolitical environment led to a shortage of supply\nand sharp price increases for a number of raw materials in 2022, the situation eased in the 2023 reporting\nperiod. Exceptions to this were the prices for carbon black, which were primarily impacted by a supply\nshortage as well as energy and CO₂ surcharges. Below is an overview of the most important raw materials:\n\nImage /page/46/Figure/4 description: The image contains two line charts comparing the indexed prices of different commodities over time. Both charts share the same x-axis, spanning from 2020 to 2023, and the y-axis, labeled 'Indexed to 100'. The left chart plots the indexed prices of 'Butadiene Korea', 'Butadiene Europe', and 'TSR20'. 'Butadiene Korea' is represented by a dark blue line, 'Butadiene Europe' by a light blue line, and 'TSR20' by a gray line. The right chart plots the indexed prices of 'Brent' and 'HFO'. 'Brent' is represented by a dark blue line, and 'HFO' by a gray line. The source of the data is Reuters, Refinitiv Eikon, and the data is indexed to January 1, 2020.\n\nIndexed to January 1, 2020; source: Reuters, Refinitiv Eikon;\nBrent Crude, LCOc1 ICE Europe Brent Crude Electronic Energy Future (USD/bbl)\nHFO, Heavy Fuel Oil 1% NWE (USD/t)\nButadiene, PHAKE00 BD Korea, PHAKG00 BD Europe (USD/t)\nTechnically Specified Rubber, TSR20 SICOM (Usc/kg)\n\nCrude oil is an important raw material for synthetic rubber precursors such as butadiene, but also\nfor carbon black. Parallel to the decline in crude oil prices, the average prices for the basic raw mate-\nrial butadiene, which is relevant for both divisions, were lower in 2023 than in 2022, both in Asia (by\naround 13%) and in Europe (by around 30%). This was also reflected in the price trend for butadiene\nderivatives.\n\nIn the past, prices for the filler carbon black, which is used in both divisions, generally correlated\nstrongly with the development of heavy fuel oil (HFO), which was on average 17% cheaper in 2023\nthan in the previous year in line with the development of crude oil prices. However, a decoupling\nbegan towards the end of the first quarter of 2022, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and energy and CO2\nsurcharges had a significant impact. Overall, average carbon black prices in 2023 were therefore\nslightly higher than the average level in 2022.\n\nNatural rubber, which is particularly relevant for the Belting business, was traded around 11%\ncheaper on the commodity exchanges in Asia in 2023 than in 2022.\n\nThe price of iron ore, which is used in wire rod, was stable on average in 2023 compared to the\nprevious year but still 7% higher than the five-year average. Wire rod itself was traded below the\n2022 level on an annual average in both China and Europe.\n\nAfter supply chains normalized over the course of 2023, the attacks on shipping in the Red Sea\naround the turn of the year 2024 once again led to longer transport times and higher freight costs.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Revenue and earnings performance\n\n### Key figures Semperit Group\n\n| in EUR million                                                       | 20231 | Change  | 20222 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                                              | 721.1 | -7.5%   | 779.8 |\n| EBITDA                                                               | 71.8  | -28.5%  | 100.5 |\n| EBITDA margin                                                        | 10.0% | -2.9 PP | 12.9% |\n| EBITDA adjusted                                                      | 81.7  | -14.7%  | 95.8  |\n| EBITDA margin adjusted                                               | 11.3% | -0.9 PP | 12.3% |\n| EBIT                                                                 | 34.6  | -44.3%  | 62.1  |\n| EBIT margin                                                          | 4.8%  | -3.2 PP | 8.0%  |\n| EBIT adjusted                                                        | 44.5  | -31.9%  | 65.4  |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                                                 | 6.2%  | -2.2 PP | 8.4%  |\n| Earnings after taxes from continued operation                        | 24.9  | -35.2%  | 38.4  |\n| Earnings after taxes from discontinued operation                     | -41.9 | -4.6%   | -44.0 |\n| Earnings after taxes                                                 | -17.1 | n/a     | -5.6  |\n| Earnings after tax adjusted                                          | -8.1  | n/a     | 10.9  |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and<br>equipment3 | 277.0 | n/a     | 37.6  |\n| Employees (average)                                                  | 4,637 | 7.8%    | 4,300 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Adjusted for the following negative effects: one-off severance payments for changes to the Executive Board and for reductions in headcount (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –2.2 million; earnings after tax effect: EUR –2.1 million), one-off effects from the sale of the medical business (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –1.3 million; earnings after tax effect: EUR –1.3 million), transaction costs for Rico (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –3.3 million, earnings after taxes effect : EUR –3.2 million) and from profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation of the Rico Group (2023: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR –3.0 million; earnings after taxes effect: EUR –2.3 million).\n\n<sup>2</sup> Adjusted for the positive one-off effect of the net proceeds from the property sale in France in the Belting business (2022: EBITDA, EBIT effect: EUR 4.7 million; earnings after tax effect: EUR 4.0 million), for the negative effect of the net impairments in the former Sempermed segment and the Profiles business (2022: EBIT effect from continued operations: EUR –7.9 million; earnings after tax effect in total from continued and\n\ndiscontinued operations: EUR –12.3 million) and by the negative effect of transaction costs (2022: earnings after tax effect: EUR –8.2 million). <sup>3</sup> Excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Semperit Group performed solidly in a challenging market environment characterized by high inflation and a weak economy. Revenue of EUR 721.1 million was generated, which was –7.5% below the previous year's figure. Positive price effects could not offset lower sales volumes, as customers reduced their inventories and ordered more cautiously due to the economic situation – especially in the Semperit Industrial Applications division. This decline was only partially compensated for by the significantly higher earnings of the Semperit Engineered Applications division. In anticipation of this development, cost reduction programs were introduced at an early stage, which already had a positive effect of EUR 5.8 million and thus exceed the planned run rate of EUR 10 million per year. EBITDA from continued operations amounted to EUR 71.8 million (previous year: EUR 100.5 million), including one-off expenses of around EUR 9.9 million. These one-off expenses consisted of the transaction costs for the acquisition of the Rico Group, from profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation, from one-off severance payments for changes to the Executive Board and for reductions in headcount, as well as expenses in connection with the sale of the medical business (separation of IT systems). Earnings after tax from continued operations were positive at EUR 24.9 million, while the loss from the discontinued and now sold operations had a significant negative impact, as expected. Earnings after tax thus amounted to EUR – 17.1 million.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe continued operations of the Semperit Group recorded revenue of EUR 721.1 million (–7.5%) in the 2023 financial year. The two divisions, in which the former Industrial Sector has been reorganized, developed differently. While the difficult economic market environment in the Semperit Industrial Applications division (SIA, comprising Hoses and Profiles) led to a decline in sales volumes and thus revenue by –26.5% to EUR 330.8 million in the 2023 financial year, the Semperit Engineered Applications division (SEA, comprising Form, Belting and Rico) benefited primarily from the ongoing strong demand for mining products and the associated demand for conveyor belts as well as the demand for special products for formed parts. Revenue in the SEA division thus increased by 23.7% to EUR 351.0 million, of which EUR 37.2 million was attributable to Rico (since initial consolidation, for the months of August to December 2023). In Surgical Operations (production of surgical gloves in Wimpassing including packaging in Sopron), revenue fell as expected by –23.3% to EUR 42.1 million.\n\nInventories of own products decreased by EUR 11.0 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: increase of EUR 11.8 million), reflecting the focus on working capital management.\n\nOther operating income fell slightly to EUR 8.3 million (previous year: EUR 9.3 million) and includes income from the sale of emission certificates (EUR 0.9 million) and from research funding (EUR 1.8 million). In the previous year, this item included income from the sale of a property in France in the amount of EUR 4.8 million.\n\nCost of materials (including energy and purchased services) fell by EUR 79.5 million or 19.4% to EUR 330.7 million (previous year: EUR 410.2 million), primarily as a result of lower production volumes in the SIA division. Around two thirds of the reduction can be attributed to volume effects and around one third to the slight easing of the raw material price situation compared to 2022.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased to EUR 220.1 million in the 2023 financial year (+11.7% compared to EUR 197.1 million in 2022), primarily as a result of the Rico takeover. Other effects included inflationrelated wage and salary increases as well as one-off severance payments in connection with the changes to the Executive Board and the reduction in personnel overheads. This increase has already been partially offset by capacity-related adjustments to headcount.\n\nAt EUR 98.5 million, other operating expenses were 2.8% higher than in the previous year (previous year: EUR 95.8 million). This is primarily due to transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of the Rico Group (EUR 3.3 million) and a warranty claim for conveyor belts. In addition, there were higher IT-related expenses in connection with the sale of the medical business and the further development of IT systems as well as higher travel expenses following the end of the corona pandemic. By contrast, lower expenses for outgoing freight (EUR –7.5 million compared to the previous year) had a positive effect.\n\nThe cost-cutting programs introduced have already reduced expenses by a total of EUR 5.8 million, of which around 85% was attributable to personnel expenses and the remainder to other operating expenses.\n\nEBITDA in continued operations amounted to EUR 71.8 million (previous year: EUR 100.5 million) and the EBITDA margin to 10.0% (previous year: 12.9%). The Rico Group's operating contribution to EBITDA totaled around EUR 7.6 million. However, the profits recognized in advance of EUR 3.0 million as part of the purchase price allocation and transaction costs of EUR 3.3 million initially reduced this contribution to around EUR 1.2 million.\n\nAdjusted for special effects amounting to around EUR 9.9 million, EBITDA totaled EUR 81.7 million. These are transaction costs for the acquisition of the Rico Group, profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation, one-off severance payments for changes to the Executive Board and for reductions in headcount, as well as one-off expenses (IT) for the sale of the medical business. The adjusted EBITDA margin 2023 amounted to 11.3%. Adjusted EBITDA in the previous year was EUR 95.8 million and was adjusted for the positive one-off effect of EUR 4.7 million; the corresponding margin was 12.3%.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased to EUR 37.6 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 30.4 million), primarily as a result of the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group (EUR 7.0 million). EBIT from continued operations therefore amounted to EUR 34.6 million (previous year: EUR 62.1 million) or EUR 44.5 million after adjustment (previous year: EUR 65.4 million).\n\nThe financial result improved to EUR –8.7 million (previous year: EUR –10.4 million). Higher financing expenses as a result of new bank financing for strategic growth projects were offset by higher interest income and a change in the result attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\nTax expenses decreased to EUR 1.1 million (previous year: EUR 13.4 million). In the 2023 financial year, the effective tax rate for continued operations was therefore 3.7% compared to 22.9% in the comparative period. In particular due to the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses in the Austrian tax group in the 2023 financial year, the effective tax rate is very low in comparison. The effective tax rate relates to income taxes in relation to earnings before tax less the earnings attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\nEarnings after tax from continued operations amounted to EUR 24.9 million (previous year: EUR 38.4 million) and earnings after tax from discontinued operations were EUR –41.9 million (previous year: EUR –44.0 million). The latter included a reclassification of historical currency translation differences of EUR –23.5 million due to the deconsolidation.\n\nOverall, earnings after tax (from continued and discontinued operations) were negative at EUR –17.1 million (previous year: EUR –5.6 million). Earnings per share attributable to the shareholders of Semperit AG Holding thus amounted to EUR –0.82 in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR –0.27).\n\n### Discontinued operations\n\nDiscontinued operations were deconsolidated as of 31 August 2023, after the (first) closing of the sale of the medical business. Following the pandemic-related exceptional economic situation in the preceding years with comparatively high demand and price trends, revenue in discontinued operations fell significantly to EUR 108.4 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 324.2 million).\n\nEBITDA amounted to EUR –21.2 million, EBIT to EUR –19.7 million and earnings after tax from discontinued operations to EUR –41.9 million (previous year: EUR –1.6 million, EUR –28.0 million and EUR –44.0 million respectively).\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Dividend policy and treasury shares\n\nThe dividend policy of the Semperit Group basically aims at a distribution of around 50% of earnings after taxes – assuming continued successful performance with no unusual circumstances.\n\nIn view of the positive earnings after taxes from continued operations – the relevant earnings and comparative figure for future business development – the Executive Board will propose a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share to the Annual General Meeting. A total of EUR 10.3 million should therefore be distributed. With a share price of EUR 14.16 at the end of 2023, this results in a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nA basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share plus an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share was distributed for the 2022 financial year following the fulfillment of the conditions precedent in connection with the (first) closing of the sale of the medical business. This corresponds to a total dividend yield of 22.7% in relation to the closing price of EUR 19.82 in 2022.\n\nSemperit AG Holding did not hold any treasury shares as of 31 December 2023, or 31 December 2022.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Assets and financial position\n\n### Balance sheet\n\nThe development of the balance sheet structure as of 31 December 2023, can be summarized as follows:\n\n| in EUR million                              | 31.12.2023 | Share | 31.12.2022 | Share | Change  |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------|------------|-------|---------|\n| Non-current assets                          | 597.7      | 64%   | 316.6      | 38%   | +88.8%  |\n| Current assets                              | 339.6      | 36%   | 338.4      | 40%   | +0.4%   |\n| Assets held for sale                        | 0.5        | 0%    | 187.9      | 22%   | -99.7%  |\n| ASSETS                                      | 937.9      | 100%  | 842.9      | 100%  | +11.3%  |\n| Equity¹                                     | 425.3      | 45%   | 519.1      | 62%   | -18.1%  |\n| Non-current provisions and<br>liabilities   | 346.6      | 37%   | 115.9      | 14%   | +199.2% |\n| Current provisions and liabilities          | 165.5      | 18%   | 161.0      | 19%   | +2.8%   |\n| Provisions and liabilities held for<br>sale | 0.4        | 0%    | 46.9       | 6%    | -99.1%  |\n| EQUITY AND LIABILITIES                      | 937.9      | 100%  | 842.9      | 100%  | +11.3%  |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Incl. non-controlling interests\n\nThe balance sheet as of 31 December 2023, is heavily influenced by the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group. Non-current assets increased by 88.8% to EUR 597.7 million, which was primarily driven by additions to property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use assets) in the amount of EUR 188.8 million and intangible assets in the amount of EUR 121.3 million. Of this amount, EUR 125.8 million and EUR 120.9 million respectively (including goodwill of EUR 49.4 million) was attributable to the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group. The remaining additions to property, plant and equipment totaled EUR 63.0 million, which primarily includes investments in the modernization of the Wimpassing site (EUR +12.1 million) and in the Czech Republic, in particular the expansion of hose production in Odry (DH5 project; EUR +22.9 million). This was contrasted by regular depreciation and amortization amounting to EUR 37.6 million.\n\nCurrent assets increased slightly by 0.4% or EUR 1.2 million to EUR 339.6 million compared to 31 December 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents by EUR 6.0 million to EUR 112.7 million and in other assets by EUR 12.5 million (mainly due to the Rico Group) to EUR 23.8 million was contrasted by the reduction in inventories by EUR 17.5 million to EUR 110.8 million and the reduction in trade receivables by EUR 2.8 million to EUR 86.1 million. The (first) closing for the sale of the medical business took place on 31 August 2023; the Group companies in discontinued operations were deconsolidated on this date, which led to a reduction in the \"Assets held for sale\" item by EUR 187.3 million to EUR 0.5 million.\n\nEquity primarily reflects the dividend payments made in May and September in the amount of EUR 92.6 million.\n\nIn addition to the effects of the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group, the increase in noncurrent liabilities and provisions is mainly due to an increase in liabilities to banks of EUR 181.2 million for the expansion investment in the Czech Republic (DH5) and the acquisition of the Rico Group. In addition, non-current other financial liabilities increased by a total of EUR 30.9 million to EUR 49.8 million as a result of the acquisition of the Rico Group, primarily due to its lease liabilities and the present value of the deferred purchase price of EUR 3.9 million.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent liabilities and provisions are EUR 4.5 million or 2.8% higher at EUR 165.5 million, which is partly due to the acquisition of the Rico Group.\n\n### Net Financial Debt\n\n| in EUR million                                     | 31.12.2023   | Change      | 31.12.2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan                        | 38.4         | -26.8%      | 52.5         |\n| Liabilities to banks                               | 189.4        | n/a         | 0.0          |\n| <b>Financial liabilities</b>                       | <b>227.8</b> | n/a         | <b>52.5</b>  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 112.7        | 5.7%        | 106.6        |\n| <b>Cash and cash equivalents</b>                   | <b>112.7</b> | <b>5.7%</b> | <b>106.6</b> |\n| Net Financial Debt (+) / Net Financial Surplus (-) | 115.2        | n/a         | -54.2        |\n\nThe Semperit Group had net financial debt of EUR 115.2 million as of 31 December 2023, as financial liabilities (EUR 227.8 million) exceeded cash and cash equivalents (EUR 112.7 million) (31 December 2022: net cash surplus of EUR 54.2 million). The leverage ratio as the quotient of net financial debt divided by EBITDA was 1.6x as of December 31 (previous year: –0.6x).\n\nNew bank financing with a volume of up to EUR 360 million was concluded with effect from 31 March 2023. A financing agreement for a total of EUR 250 million consists of a loan of up to EUR 150 million and a framework credit line of EUR 100 million. In this financing agreement, Semperit AG Holding has undertaken to comply with three ESG key figures, which are also part of the sustainability strategy. This financing is provided by a consortium of six Austrian and international banks and replaces an earlier framework credit line of EUR 75 million. In July 2023, the loan of EUR 150 million for the acquisition of the Rico Group was drawn down. Of this amount, EUR 40 million was repaid in December. The second financing agreement for EUR 110 million was concluded particularly for the expansion investment at the Odry site. Of this amount, EUR 33 million was drawn down in the reporting period.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Cash flow\n\nThe cash flow statement is prepared jointly for the continued and discontinued operations; no distinction is made between the cash flows of the individual business units. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the discontinued operation are disclosed in the note.\n\nThe development of the liquidity situation in the 2023 financial year can be summarized as follows:\n\n### Cash flow\n\n| in EUR million                                       | 31.12.2023 | Change | 31.12.2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|------------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                 | 66.2       | 43.2%  | 46.2       |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                 | -131.4     | n/a    | -46.2      |\n| Cash flows from financing activities                 | 20.5       | n/a    | -82.1      |\n| Net increase / decrease in cash and cash equivalents | -45.2      | -41.7% | -77.6      |\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, cash flow from operating activities developed positively despite the lower result, which was primarily due to a significant reduction in inventories and a decrease in receivables.\n\nAt EUR 55.6 million, cash expenditures in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the 2023 financial year were slightly above the prior-year level (previous year: EUR 54.5 million). The largest investments were made in the Czech Republic with EUR 23.5 million (previous year: EUR 6.2 million), Austria with EUR 14.6 million (previous year: EUR 15.8 million), Germany with EUR 3.7 million (previous year: EUR 3.8 million) and Poland with EUR 4.9 million (previous year: EUR 3.5 million). The comparative figure for the previous year included investments in Malaysia amounting to EUR 17.3 million.\n\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to EUR –131.4 million (previous year: EUR –46.2 million) and was influenced in particular by the major corporate transactions (sale of the medical business and acquisition of Rico) in the 2023 financial year.\n\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR 20.5 million (previous year: EUR –82.1 million) and included the cash receipts from financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 190.0 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 0). In addition, in particular the dividends to the shareholders of Semperit AG Holding totaling EUR 92.6 million (previous year: EUR 30.9 million), dividends to redeemable non-controlling interests in subsidiaries amounting to EUR 6.5 million (previous year: EUR 5.7 million), the repayment of current and non-current financial liabilities amounting to EUR 58.6 million (previous year: EUR 39.0 million) and the repayment of lease liabilities with a volume of EUR 4.4 million (previous year: EUR 3.4 million) were considered.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Free cash flow1\n\n| in EUR million                                                                                                                                                                          | 2023  | Change | 2022  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                                                                                                                    | 66.2  | 43.2%  | 46.2  |\n| Interest paid                                                                                                                                                                           | -7.5  | n/a    | -2.8  |\n| Interest received                                                                                                                                                                       | 2.8   | n/a    | 1.2   |\n| Cash investments for maintenance and small growth projects<br>(intangible assets and property, plant and equipment)                                                                     | -36.2 | -33.7% | -54.5 |\n| Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment<br>and from the repayment of financial investments, investment<br>grants received, and payments made for the acquisition of | 0.9   | -86.8% | 7.2   |\n| financial investments                                                                                                                                                                   |       |        |       |\n| Free cash flow before the sale of companies                                                                                                                                             | 26.3  | n/a    | -2.8  |\n| Proceeds from business disposals net of cash disposed of                                                                                                                                | 85.3  | n/a    | 0.0   |\n| Free cash flow after the sale of companies                                                                                                                                              | 111.5 | n/a    | -2.8  |\n\n<sup>1</sup> The calculation includes continued and discontinued operations.\n\nFree cash flow is the net cash flow adjusted for interest payments that is available for strategic growth investments, dividends and the repayment of debt.

As expected, the effects of the recession intensified throughout the year; this led to a significant decline in revenue – mainly due to a significant drop in volume – and earnings.\n- Demand for hydraulic and industrial hoses and incoming orders were also affected by high inventory levels and customers' ongoing destocking. Ordering behavior was restrained, also based on the customers' low market demand. Due to short delivery times, there was no pressure for customers to order well in advance.\n- Demand for elastomer and sealing profiles remained low as a result of the weak construction sector. The downward trend from 2022 thus continued to a lesser extent in the reporting year.\n- The lower order intake led to a persistently declining order book, particularly in the first half of 2023. The level finally stabilized, albeit at a low level as expected.\n- Adjustments to personnel capacities were initiated at an early stage and have largely already been implemented. In addition, further savings potential was identified as part of an overhead cost project, and implementation has begun. This relates to third-party costs and, above all, further personnel costs.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Division Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA)\n\n### Key figures Semperit Engineered Applications\n\n| in EUR million                                                       | 20231 | Change  | 20222 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                                              | 351.0 | 23.7%   | 283.8 |\n| EBITDA                                                               | 50.5  | 35.8%   | 37.2  |\n| EBITDA margin                                                        | 14.4% | +1.3 PP | 13.1% |\n| EBITDA adjusted                                                      | 56.9  | 75.2%   | 32.5  |\n| EBITDA margin adjusted                                               | 16.2% | +4.8 PP | 11.4% |\n| EBIT                                                                 | 33.2  | 18.4%   | 28.1  |\n| EBIT margin                                                          | 9.5%  | -0.4 PP | 9.9%  |\n| EBIT adjusted                                                        | 39.6  | 69.5%   | 23.4  |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                                                 | 11.3% | +3.1 PP | 8.2%  |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and<br>equipment3 | 240.0 | n/a     | 9.2   |\n\n1 Adjusted for the negative effects of the transaction costs for Rico (2023: EBITDA and EBIT impact: EUR –3.3 million) and for profits recognized in advance in the purchase price allocation of the Rico Group (2023: EBITDA and EBIT impact: EUR –3.0 million).\n\n2 Adjusted for the positive one-off effect of the net proceeds from the sale of real estate in France in the Belting business (2022: EBITDA and EBIT effect: EUR –4.7 million).\n\n3 Excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16\n\n- Business development in the SEA division benefited significantly from the continued good economic situation for mining products and, as a result, from the high demand for conveyor belts and higher sales prices. Higher sales and earnings were also generated in the Form business. In particular, the Mountain Applications business, which includes ski foils and cable car upper rings, and the handrail business developed positively despite the economic headwind. This also reflects the firsttime consolidation and the results of the last five months of the Rico Group, which has been part of the Semperit Group since August. The Rico Group's revenue contribution for the months of August to December 2023 totaled EUR 37.2 million. Rico's operating contribution to EBITDA for five months amounted to around EUR 7.6 million. However, the profits recognized in advance as part of the purchase price allocation of EUR 3.0 million and the transaction costs of EUR 3.3 million initially reduced this contribution to around EUR 1.2 million.\n- The good overall capacity utilization, the related higher operating leverage and a slightly higher average price level due to a more advantageous product mix led to an increase in margins.\n- Demand in the late-cycle business with conveyor belts (Belting) continued to be determined by the effects of the positive price trend for mining products and the resulting high demand for conveyor and transport belts in 2023. Order intake continued to develop very well and was only just below the high level of the comparable period 2022. As a result of the continuous processing of orders, the order backlog also declined slightly.\n- Overall, demand for the individual products in the Form business showed a mixed picture. The railroad business remained stable at a high level, as did Mountain Applications. Products in the construction industry and related areas such as piping, sanitary and household, on the other hand, recorded a decline. Overall, incoming orders were just below the previous year's level. Although sales volumes were down, the product mix was significantly higher in terms of margins.\n- Demand for the Rico Group's products also varied depending on the product group. While demand from the healthcare and food sectors was stable and strong and remained at a high level in the mobility sector, the areas assigned to construction showed significant declines in some cases.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Surgical Operations\n\n### Key figures Surgical Operations\n\n| in EUR million                                                    | 2023   | Change  | 20221  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Revenue                                                           | 42.1   | -23.3%  | 54.9   |\n| EBITDA                                                            | -6.1   | 88.2%   | -3.3   |\n| EBITDA margin                                                     | -14.6% | -8.6 PP | -6.0%  |\n| EBIT                                                              | -7.0   | -29.1%  | -9.9   |\n| EBIT margin                                                       | -16.6% | +1.4 PP | -18.0% |\n| EBIT adjusted                                                     | -7.0   | -72.7%  | -4.1   |\n| EBIT margin adjusted                                              | -16.6% | -9.2 PP | -7.4%  |\n| Additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment2 | 1.4    | -42.9%  | 2.5    |\n\n1 Adjusted for the negative one-off effect of the net impairment of Surgical Operations (2022: EBIT effect: EUR –5.8 million). 2 Excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16\n\nFollowing the first closing of the sale of the medical business at the end of August 2023 (see Note 2), only the time-limited contract production agreed with the buyer (production and packaging of surgical gloves) will be reported in Surgical Operations.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Sustainability\n\nThe Semperit Group published its seventh independent Sustainability Report for the 2023 financial year. The document provides an overview of the various activities, developments and key figures in the context of the material topics and is divided into the areas of environment & climate protection, social and governance (Environment, Social, Governance – ESG). In addition to topics such as energy, greenhouse gas emissions, use of materials, health & safety and compliance & anti-corruption, it contains general information on the anchoring of sustainability in the Group and other climate-related information in accordance with the TCFD – Task force on climate-related financial disclosures. The Sustainability Report 2023 and the reports from previous years can be accessed online on the Semperit website.\n\n### Employees\n\nAt 4,576 employees (FTE, full-time equivalent), the headcount for continued operations as of 31 December 2023 was above the level as of 31. December 2022 (4,506). The year-on-year increase is due to the first-time consolidation of the Rico Group, while the reduction in headcount as part of the cost-cutting program had an opposite effect. The average number of employees for the year was 4,637 (average 2022: 4,300).\n\n### Research and development\n\nThe Research & Development (R&D) team of the Semperit Group is continuously working on the development of innovative materials and products as well as on the improvement of manufacturing processes. The innovation management system used across the Group is the core of all R&D activities, covering the systematic identification of potential, the selection of promising ideas, risk analysis with regard to the effects of products on people and the planet, and successful project management. In the 2023 financial year, R&D expenditure in continued operations (for personnel and other expenses) amounted to around EUR 18.0 million (previous year: EUR 17.7 million) and therefore around 2.5% of revenue (previous year: 2.3%).\n\nThe R&D team is divided into a central and several decentralized areas. The central area, which is working in the R&D Centre in Wimpassing, deals with fundamental projects in addition to material and central process development as well as the management of Group-wide activities. Decentralized teams in the business units work on product and process optimization – often in close cooperation with customers. In addition to the headquarters in Wimpassing, Semperit operates seven further research sites. Most production sites have by onsite laboratories, which carry out the daily quality assurance processes and are also involved in the R&D activities. In addition to integrated and structured processes, communication between the various departments and with important stakeholders, such as customers and university research institutes, is paramount.\n\n### Fields of activity in R&D\n\nIn addition to the optimization of production processes, the further and new development of products is at the heart of research and development work. The topic of resource and energy efficiency was also a focus in 2023. In addition to intensive work on the product carbon footprint model (CO2 footprint), cross-departmental workshops were initiated to develop ideas for more effective and efficient use of resources and to check their feasibility. The most promising approaches are further \n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\ndeveloped and implemented by the relevant departments. The Semperit Group is now able to calculate a carbon footprint for most of its products.\n\nThe Semperit Group relies on close cooperation with customers in research and development in order to be able to respond to their wishes and requirements in the best possible and most timely manner. In addition, the company is continuously working on expanding its product portfolio, for example with regard to environmental friendliness. Ecological advantages can include, for example, low material consumption during production and therefore lower weight in use and consequently a reduction in energy consumption during operation.\n\nThe Group is also driving developments in the area of bio-based elastomers. In this regard, the use of traditional natural rubber should be highlighted, which was expanded in 2023, especially in conveyor belts, hoses and molded products, and synthetically produced bio-based rubber as a substitute for the petroleum-based raw material. Products that contain up to 50% more ecologically sustainable raw materials have been developed, especially in the Form business.\n\nAmong other things, Semperit focuses on avoiding and replacing ecologically questionable or harmful additives. Since 2020, two Semperit products from the sealing profiles area have been evaluated according to the criteria of the material health category in the Cradle to Cradle Certified™ product standard and have been awarded a gold level material health certificate by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. Pollutant-free materials in residential and house construction are important topics that is being continuously worked on.\n\nHowever, it is not only the safety and health safety of the products that play a role in their use; negative ecological effects during the use phase can also be reduced. These are not serious in the case of Semperit products because, unlike car tires, there is no significant abrasion and thus no problematic release of microplastics. Nevertheless, the aim is to use certain material properties, such as low weight, low rolling resistance or high strength, to contribute to more efficient operation or a longer service life and thus to a lower environmental impact during the use phase of the products. The \"Silent Pad\", for example, which was developed for railroad superstructures, contributes to a reduction in noise emissions of around 3 dB when driving over the sleepers supported by it, thus improving the quality of life of local residents. Another best-practice example from railroad superstructures is an angled polyamide guide plate for fastening the sleeper to the rail. Material consumption was reduced by 25% while maintaining the same functionality.\n\n### Corporate innovation\n\nIn addition to traditional research and development work, Semperit places a special focus on the Group-wide innovation program. End-to-end transparency from the creation of an idea through its development to its market launch is highly relevant for effectively evaluating and managing the entire portfolio of ideas and projects. In order to achieve this goal, the foundations have been laid for the uniform measurement of the effectiveness of the innovation program. This includes the introduction of innovation KPIs and Group-wide targets, the measurement of which was continued in 2023.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Additional information\n\n### Corporate governance\n\nThe corporate governance report can be found online at www.semperitgroup.com/en/ir, under the Corporate Governance menu. The direct link is:\n\nwww.semperitgroup.com/en/ir/corporate-governance/corporate-governance-reports.\n\n### Disclosures pursuant to Section 243a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB)\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the share capital of Semperit AG Holding (SAG) amounted to EUR 21,358,996.53 and consisted of 20,573,434 no-par-value ordinary shares, each carrying equal rights in every respect.\n\nThere are no restrictions with regard to voting rights or the transfer of shares that go beyond the general provisions contained in the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. No shares were issued entitling the owners to special control rights.\n\nB&C KB Holding GmbH directly owned 50% of the shares in SAG as of 31 December 2023, and is the direct majority shareholder of SAG. The private foundation B&C Privatstiftung is the highest controlling legal entity. B&C Holding Österreich GmbH is the indirect majority shareholder which draws up and publishes consolidated financial statements in which the Semperit Group is consolidated. Employees who own shares are entitled to exercise their right to vote at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Executive Board consists of up to five people. Members of the Executive Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a maximum period of five years. Reappointments, for a maximum of five years, are permissible.\n\nThe following applies with respect to the appointment and revocation of Supervisory Board members pursuant to the Articles of Association: Unless a shorter term of office is specified, Supervisory Board members are elected until the end of the Annual General Meeting resolving upon the ratification of the actions of the Executive and Supervisory Boards for the fourth year after the election, not including the financial year in which the election took place. However, at least two members of the Supervisory Board shall resign each year at the end of the Ordinary Annual General Meeting. Members of the Supervisory Board who have resigned from the Supervisory Board since the last Annual General Meeting or have resigned from office with effect from the end of the respective Annual General Meeting shall be counted towards this figure.\n\nOtherwise, the members having to resign are determined as follows: First of all, members have to leave if their term of office has ended. If this does not apply to at least as many members required for two members to be determined, including other members who have left since the last Annual General Meeting or have resigned from office at the end of the respective Annual General Meeting, the members who have been in office for the longest will have to resign. In the event that the number of members eligible for departure is greater than required, the members will draw lots to decide who leaves. This procedure is also used to decide which members will depart if a decision cannot be made based on the above rules. The resigning members are immediately eligible for re-election.\n\nIf an elected member of the Supervisory Board retires from the Supervisory Board during their term of office, a substitute election shall only be held immediately if the number of elected Supervisory Board members falls below three. Substitute elections shall be held for the remaining term of office of the retiring Supervisory Board member unless the Annual General Meeting decides otherwise at the time of election. If a member is elected to the Supervisory Board by an Extraordinary Annual General Meeting, the first year in office is considered to be completed upon the close of the next Ordinary Annual General Meeting.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board may resign from office by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board without having to provide reasons, subject to a four-week period of notice.\n\nResolutions of the Annual General Meeting require a simple majority of the votes cast, unless mandatory law requires a larger majority. In cases where capital majority is required, it shall pass resolutions by a simple majority of the share capital represented at the passing of the resolution, unless mandatory law requires a larger capital majority.\n\nThe Executive Board was authorized by the Ordinary Annual General Meeting on April 25, 2023, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the nominal capital of the company within five years from the registration of the amendment to the Articles of Association with the commercial register – if necessary in several tranches – by up to EUR 10,679,497.23 by way of issuing up to 10,286,716 new no-par-value shares in bearer or registered form against cash and/or payment in kind and to determine the share type, the issue price, and the terms and conditions of the issue. The Executive Board was also authorized to issue convertible bonds with agreement from the Supervisory Board. This may be linked to a right of conversion or purchase or a mandatory conversion or purchase of up to 10,286,716 no-par-value shares in SAG. The share capital is conditionally increased according to Section 159 (2) (1) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act by up to EUR 10,679,497.23 by issuing up to 10,286,716 new no-par-value bearer shares.\n\nThe Ordinary Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2022 authorized the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to repurchase and, if applicable, retire own shares up to the legally permitted maximum of 10% of the share capital for a period of 30 months from the adoption of the resolution in the Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 65 (1) (8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. At the same Annual General Meeting, the Executive Board was also authorized – pursuant to Section 65 (1bb) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and with agreement from the Supervisory Board – to decide on a different type of sale than via the stock exchange or through a public offering, and to decide on a possible exclusion of the repurchase option (purchase right) on the part of shareholders. There is no share buyback program in place at present and SAG does not hold any treasury shares.\n\nCertain financing agreements contain contractual clauses regarding a change of control in the event of takeovers pursuant to Section 243a (1) (8) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\nThere are no compensation agreements pursuant to Section 243a (1) (9) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risk management\n\n### Basic principles of risk management (Enterprise Risk Management)\n\nThe Semperit Group's risk policy supports the efforts to achieve competitive advantages, thereby increasing the Semperit Group's enterprise value in the long term. Risk management serves to create robust operational processes. In addition to fulfilling legal requirements (compliance), the strategic focus is on the early identification of negative developments in the strategic, operational, market and financial areas that could be detrimental to the success of the Semperit Group. An essential integrative component here comprises environment, social and governance (ESG) topics as well as areas for securing the supply chains and ensuring on-time deliveries. The chosen systematic risk management process is also intended to increase risk awareness. The resulting findings are incorporated into strategic corporate development and daily operational work.\n\nThe Semperit Group manages risks by avoiding, reducing or transferring them, or creates a framework for the company to accept and thus bear risks. The Group-wide risk management is an integral component of planning and implementing the business strategy and serves as a sparring partner for the ongoing evaluation of target achievement. The risk policy is defined by the Executive Board. In accordance with the organization and the accountability structure, all Semperit companies are obliged to follow and implement the defined risk management process. Enterprise Risk Management is organizationally part of the \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department.\n\n### The enterprise risk management process\n\nThe Semperit Group uses coordinated internal control and risk management systems for early identifying and reducing material risks and negative deviations representing risks to the company as a going concern. These systems are based on Group-wide processes that serve to assess potential risks as early as possible before major business decisions are made. The internal reporting system facilitates more thorough monitoring of such risks in the course of business.\n\nThe Semperit Group's risk management is based on a comprehensive enterprise risk management approach (ERM approach) that is integrated into the business organization. The ERM approach is based on the globally recognized conceptual framework drafted by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), the \"Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework\". The ERM process aims at the early identification, assessment and control of risks, which could have a significant influence on the achievement of the Group's strategic, operational, financial, and social goals as well as goals related to governance and compliance, health, occupational safety and the environment (HSEQ and ESG).\n\nRisks are identified and evaluated along a structured process combining elements of both the bottom-up and top-down approaches. As part of the ERM approach, the reporting period for risk assessment is at least one year and – in accordance with medium-term planning – up to five years. ESG-relevant risks can have a deviating, longer observation period. With regard to climate risks in particular, assumptions are considered in decades and up to 80 years into the future in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe ERM is based on a net principle, according to which only risks remaining after the implementation of existing measures to mitigate or transfer risks are addressed. If potential negative deviations have already been accounted for in the consolidated financial statements, in the budget or in medium-term planning, they are no longer shown as risks. The progress made in implementing riskreducing measures is monitored on a regular basis and is broken down to the individual Group companies in the internal risk reporting.\n\nThe \"Group Risk Management & Assurance\" department is responsible for the central coordination, moderation and monitoring of the structured risk management process for the entire Semperit \n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nGroup. Relevant risks are prioritized from different perspectives and, in a further step, assessed with regard to their potential impact and their probability of occurrence. The bottom-up identification and prioritization process is supported by (remote) workshops with the management of the respective Semperit Group companies. This bottom-up element ensures that potential new risks are brought up for discussion at the management level and incorporated into the reporting, if relevant. These risks are coordinated with the business management (top-down). Individual reporting takes place immediately after the respective risk update in the respective Group businesses. At least once a year, a comprehensive risk reporting of the individual risks including aggregation is made at Group level, and a quarterly progress report on current developments, changes and additions to the risk portfolio is submitted to the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board. The regular reporting process is supplemented by an ad hoc reporting process to draw attention to critical issues in a timely manner.\n\nIntegrated risk management must also identify, assess and manage internal and external trends and effects in the field of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance). In order to address current and future issues, the Semperit Group conducts an annual ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Risk & Opportunity Assessment. In a comprehensive process that takes place in parallel with the traditional risk process, the ESG and Group Risk Management & Assurance departments identify and evaluate the main risks. This process will be integrated into the general risk assessment from the 2024 financial year onwards.\n\nIn addition to the assessment of risks with regard to their impact on the planned EBITDA figure, possible effects on liquidity have also been taken into account on the basis of a cash flow analysis since the 2023 financial year. This approach is used to assess the risk-bearing capacity, i.e., the maximum level of risk that the company can bear without jeopardizing its continued existence. Following the acquisition of the Rico Group as of 31 July 2023, the implementation of the risk management system also began there; it had not yet been fully integrated by the end of the 2023 financial year.\n\n### Organization of risk management and responsibilities\n\nTo monitor the ERM process and to further drive the integration and standardization of existing control activities in accordance with legal and operational requirements, risks, changes and developments in the risk management process are discussed in the Executive Board, Audit Committee and Supervisory Board meetings on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Group Risk Management & Assurance department is supported in the process by the individual Group companies and central functions. An update on the progress of measures is provided by the persons responsible for risks or measures. Insurable risks are covered by insurance policies as far as economically reasonable (see also \"Insurable risks\").\n\nThe legal framework and principles relevant to risk management are set forth in the Risk Management Guideline.\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. audited and confirmed the functionality of the Semperit Group's risk management system for the 2023 financial year in the 2024 reporting year in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risk report\n\nAs an internationally active corporate group, the Semperit Group is continuously confronted with new challenges posed by pronounced regional differences in global economic development. The countries in which the Semperit Group operates differ in terms of economic conditions as well as political, constitutional and social development. The success of the two divisions Semperit Industrial Applications and Semperit Engineered Applications and the five operating business units depends on the overall economic situation to varying degrees due to their strategic orientation.\n\nThe slowdown in macroeconomic development, consistently high inflation rates and the limited ability to pass on the associated additional costs to customers led to negative financial effects overall in the 2023 financial year. Political tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, availability (sourcing) as well as inflationary pressure and the price development of raw materials and energy also characterized the 2023 financial year. These uncertainties again posed challenges for the Semperit Group. However, thanks to its global presence and the different market dynamics of the five business units, the Semperit Group was able to address the risk accordingly.\n\nAt the time this management report was prepared, no risks were identified in connection with future developments that could threaten the continued existence of the Semperit Group either in isolation or jointly. Adequate insurance has been taken out for specific liability risks and damages when reasonable and cost effective. Selected individual risks that could have a significant negative effect on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group are discussed below. In addition to the risks listed here, further risks possibly exist, including strategic, operational, financial, and social risks, governance- and compliance-related risks, and health, safety, and environmental risks (HSEQ and ESG) as well as other internal and external risks that are currently unknown to the Semperit Group or which it is presently not aware of. If one or more known or unknown risks occur, this may have significant adverse effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation as well as the reputation of the Semperit Group.\n\n### Strategic risks\n\n### Transformation, governance and sustainability risks\n\nThe structure of the Semperit Group was significantly influenced by the first and major closing of the sale of the medical business and the acquisition of the Rico Group in 2023. The transformation into an industrial rubber and elastomers specialist was thus implemented. The definition of the refined new strategy and the adjustment of the organizational structure to this strategic realignment were accompanied by the risk management team identifying opportunities and risks. In order to perform management and control tasks, projects to optimize information flows were driven forward and processes were implemented, particularly in the areas of finance and IT. The risks relating to the implementation of transformation and governance measures, such as a longer implementation period, higher costs or a lower positive effect than originally estimated, were incorporated into the risk management system.\n\nFurthermore, the Semperit Group has committed itself to complying with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and achieving sustainability targets. Deviations from these goals can result in risks such as loss of reputation or higher interest rates.\n\nThe Semperit Group sees several opportunities in the introduction of the new divisional structure, which is based on the two main business models. These include a reduction in complexity and an increase in efficiency, which can lead to faster decisions, lower costs and an overall more effective way of working. Furthermore, the flexible organizational structure can strengthen the Semperit Group's innovative capability.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risks from technology development\n\nInnovative and disruptive technologies as well as regulations for industrial chemicals can have a significant impact on the Semperit Group's business areas and products. New technologies can lead to the displacement or replacement of Semperit products (e.g., the use of direct extrusion for window seals). With respect to environmental requirements, the significance of low-carbon products and circular economy will continue to increase. In addition, chemicals used by the Semperit Group could be added to the list of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) defined under the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). It is updated twice a year and must be taken into account in the selection of raw materials and in product development and production.\n\nIn order to ensure its competitiveness, the Semperit Group is continuously working on the development of innovative materials and products as well as on the improvement of manufacturing processes. Topics such as resource and energy efficiency, consideration of the life cycle perspective as well as health and environmental compatibility in product application are becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe innovation projects initiated in connection with the utilization of new raw materials, the introduction of new products and technologies can be associated with the investment of significant financial resources and cannot always be successful. If capital expenditures do not lead to the expected success or are not met with the expected market acceptance, it could lead to a negative influence on the financial performance. Existing patents and other intellectual property rights of the Semperit Group cannot completely prevent competitors from developing and selling similar products. Furthermore, not all trade secrets are patentable. In order to ensure appropriate secrecy, confidentiality agreements are agreed in service contracts or non-competition clauses.\n\n### Risks relating to customer needs and market trends\n\nThe competitiveness of the Semperit Group is based on the ability to recognize market trends in good time and the flexibility to adapt products, production and services to them in a timely manner. For example, EPDM (ethylene propylene diene rubber) seals in PVC windows are being replaced by alternative products such as thermoplastic elastomers. If market trends and potential substitute products are not recognized in time and no countermeasures are taken, this could have a major adverse effect on the earnings situation of the Semperit Group. In order to profitably exploit market trends with the development of new or sustainable products, Semperit works closely with customers and supports scientific research – with a focus on innovative materials, technologies and products. The aim of the research activities is to secure and further strengthen the market position of the Semperit Group in the long term and at the same time to become more attractive for sustainable investments, for example through the successive improvement of ESG rating results.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Operational risks\n\n### Investment and divestment risks\n\nIn the case of investments and divestments, the opportunities arising from corporate development and sustainable transformation are contrasted by numerous risks. These include transaction risks (market, liquidity, creditworthiness, inflation, currency, operational, regulatory, social and environmental risks, political and geopolitical risks as well as industry and company risks), the risk of cost remanence, misjudgments in the transaction process and legacy risks of all kinds. The mentioned risks were taken into account in the investment (acquisition of the Rico Group, expansion of the Odry site to include DH5 hose production, expansion of the Rico Group site in Thalheim) and divestment projects (sale of the medical business) by implementing each of them as separate projects, taking into account modern management disciplines (project management including risk management) and with external support. The risks arising from transaction processes were countered by structuring the contractually agreed guarantees and indemnities accordingly and by taking out W&I insurance. Longer-term risks, above all financial risks (liquidity and interest), were transferred to the risk management system. Furthermore, delays in growth projects can lead to strategic risks. Company acquisitions may result in the recognition of goodwill, which reflects intangible assets that cannot be recognized in the balance sheet, expected synergies and positive future prospects of an acquired company. Such goodwill must be tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is only recoverable if the original expectations can be realized or even exceeded. Otherwise, impairment losses in the form of extraordinary depreciation would result. Such an impairment risk naturally increases with the amount of goodwill and its share of Group equity. In order to confirm the recoverability of the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the Rico Group amounting to EUR 49.4 million, the management determined the recoverable amount of this business as at 30 September 2023. The recoverable amount was calculated as the value in use. The increased forecasting uncertainty caused by the economic slowdown and geopolitical crises was countered by considering alternative planning scenarios. Rico's products are used in particular in the automotive and medical technology industries as well as in the consumer and household goods industries.\n\nThe Semperit Group sees the acquisition of companies with complementary products or services as an opportunity to diversify its offering, expand its range of services and realize synergies. By acquiring the Rico Group or another company with advanced technologies and know-how, particularly in the area of production automation, the Semperit Group can strengthen its technological lead and accelerate innovation.\n\n### Value chain risks\n\nThe value chain of the Semperit Group covers all stages from research and development, through supply chain management and production to marketing and sales of products. In particular in raw material and energy supply, bottlenecks may arise along the value chain; likewise, production disruptions, scrap, quality defects in products/packaging/storage/ delivery may occur and thus lead to additional costs and delivery bottlenecks and/or delays. Moreover, this may result in reputational damage and loss of orders as well as potential product liability, occupational safety, compliance and environmental risks, which may have a negative effect on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe earnings position of the Semperit Group depends on the reliable and effective management of the supply chain for raw materials and mixes as well as on ensuring the appropriate cost-optimized logistics. Capacity limitations and supply shortages – also in the face of global disruptions in the transport chains – could lead to delays and additional costs as well as an increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to longer freight times. The most recent examples of this development are the rebel attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and the water shortage in the Panama Canal.\n\nPrice increases for raw materials, components, personnel costs and energy, for example due to market bottlenecks, could also have a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group. This also applies to delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a result of (economic, geopolitical, pandemic or climate-related) disasters, especially if it is not possible to develop alternative sources of supply in different countries or regions.\n\nActive management of the supplier portfolio and globally oriented and coordinated Group-wide purchasing and supply chain management counteract these risks.\n\n### Procurement risks\n\nThe Semperit Group purchases large amounts of raw materials such as rubber (natural and synthetic rubber), chemicals, fillers and both textile and steel reinforcing materials as well as energy (gas, electricity) for manufacturing its products. These raw materials can be subject to significant price volatility. If price increases, for example for raw materials, cannot be passed on to customers, or can only partially be passed on or with delay, this will lead to a negative impact on earnings. There are also monopolistic and oligopolistic supply situations for some raw material and chemical suppliers as well as energy and water suppliers, which means that the Semperit Group has only limited options for negotiations. Geopolitical unrest can significantly increase this risk.\n\nA supply shortage of individual raw materials or finished products, restrictions on imports, limitations due to geopolitical tensions or international restrictions and sanctions or the loss of an important supplier can lead to a production loss and a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\nThe management of appropriate safety stocks, multiple sourcing and reducing dependence on individual suppliers, the conclusion of long-term contracts and price escalation clauses with suppliers and the continuous monitoring of their sustainability performance counteract these risks.\n\n### Production and utilization risks\n\nThe Semperit machine park includes facilities which are essential for production and for which there are no adequate replacements. A long-term failure of one of these machines would lead to a (partial) loss of production and negative effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, further investments were made in the replacement of equipment that had been in use for a longer period and in the expansion of production facilities. In addition, the risk that production facilities may break down is counteracted by regular inspections, including preventive maintenance and servicing. As far as possible, such risks are optimized through technical preventive measures and insurance in an economically reasonable dimension.\n\nQuality problems may arise in Semperit products, which are caused by low-quality raw materials or result from the development or production of these products. Despite all efforts, the risk of operational downtimes, accidents, underutilization or overloading of production sites as well as limited availability of space for production, room to move and storage cannot be completely ruled out. Such risks may lead to delayed deliveries and, subsequently, to a potential loss of customers, with possible negative effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with the replacement of older production facilities, the Semperit Group sees opportunities in increasing the degree of automation of the production process and the associated efficiency gains.\n\n### Risks related to information technology (IT), cyber-attacks, and data protection\n\nThe majority of production and control systems as well as services are dependent on a functioning and error-free IT/OT (information technology and operation technology) landscape. The failure of essential servers and production scheduling units as well as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, non-availability, and unauthorized access to IT networks (cyber-crime) may lead to an irrecoverable loss of production volumes, quality impairment as well as delivery delays and loss of orders and thus be detrimental for the Semperit Group. Like other multi-national companies, the Semperit Group is also subject to the risk of cyber-attacks. In addition, the risk of cybercrime could continue to increase as a result of international conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and potentially result in the disclosure, falsification, espionage or loss of information, abuses of information systems or product faults, production losses and supply shortages. This would have negative effects on the reputation and competitiveness as well as the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group. The company continuously invests in resources for the further development of training measures and projects that serve to increase cyber security.\n\nAdditional risks are posed by IT/OT systems developed in-house and a wide variety of different systems in use requiring a large number of manual interventions or depending on specific persons, which could have a negative effect on data quality and processes. Ensuring the traceability of produced goods may not be possible due to faulty and non-existent systems. This risk is countered with strategic projects to standardize IT/OT processes and ERP systems.\n\nFraud and cyber-attacks (e.g., email fraud, fake president fraud, etc.) generally represent a major risk for the company, which is also countered with ongoing Group-wide awareness training as part of the \"Sempercyber\" project, ICS training (internal control system training) and projects in the area of payment security. The non-detection of such attacks or the failure of internal control systems cannot be completely ruled out and could therefore contribute to a deterioration of the business, financial position, financial performance, and profit situation.\n\nHandling sensitive/confidential data inappropriately or not in compliance with legal requirements (particularly with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR) may also represent a risk. A data protection organization has been set up based on the Group-wide data protection guidelines, and regular training courses are held.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Personnel risks\n\nThe Semperit Group's business performance will be largely determined by the recruitment of adequately qualified professional and managerial staff at the individual locations, their integration, further development, and long-term retention. Risks arising from the departure of key personnel should be countered by training internal successors in due time. The orientation of the Semperit Group with regard to social aspects such as diversity, inclusion and attractive work is becoming increasingly important. This applies to existing and potential staff and will be successively expanded through appropriate additional benefits and activities to increase employer attractiveness. Should this not be possible, it may lead to a risk of a deterioration of the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\nLabor shortages or restrictions on the admission of guest workers or outsourcing, state minimum wage regimes, strikes or outflow of know-how may lead to an impairment of production and to limitations in other business areas, thus also burdening productivity and the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation. The risk of a staff shortage is countered with substitutions, flexibilization, and preventive measures using shift models and remote working.\n\n### Financial risks\n\nAs an internationally active company, the Semperit Group is exposed to financial risks, which can have an impact in particular in the areas of capital, liquidity and financing risks, foreign currency and interest rate risks, as well as in the default risks of customers and banks. As required by IFRS 7.31, the financial risks and their management are described in detail in the notes under chapter 11.\n\n### Capital, liquidity and financial risks (capital management)\n\nCapital risk is the risk of capital tied in investments. Liquidity risk (also known as refinancing risk) refers to the risk of being unable to raise the necessary cash for possible payments or only at increased refinancing costs. Financing risk refers to the risk that financing instruments are not available or not available to the required extent and thus threaten to cause payment difficulties or even insolvency.\n\nMarket risks to which the Semperit Group is exposed include political and economic developments that negatively influence the financial markets all over the world. These may be, for example, more restrictive regulations for the finance sector, monetary policy of central banks or a limited availability of financial resources, including due to the consideration of sustainability aspects, e.g., in connection with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Changes in the credit ranking and limitations of the legal capacity of banks and other funders, changes in interest rates or restrictions on the use of financial instruments are risks, which may affect the company's scope of action regarding the taking up of financing operations or which impair the financing costs and deposit conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the Semperit Group is subject to corporate risks in capital management. For example, a deterioration of its own creditworthiness may lead to higher expenses for borrowings, or no further financing granted by creditors. An increase in credit risk premiums may also result in a negative change of the market values of financial assets due to uncertainty and risk aversion on the financial markets.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Foreign currency risks\n\nForeign currency risks can generally be divided in transaction and translation risks. Due to international trade relations and existing subsidiaries all over the world, the Semperit Group is exposed to both risks. Furthermore, in some countries there are capital controls that limit the Semperit Group in its freedom of action. Some national banks, for example, have restrictions on trade in currencies and hedging instruments.\n\n### Interest rate risks\n\nInterest rate risks arise from the change in interest rates, both for variable and fixed interest financing, in the form of interest change risks or cash value risks. The external financing of the Semperit Group exists primarily at the level of Semperit AG Holding. Since 2023, there has also been local financing at the Czech subsidiary Semperflex Optimit s.r.o. and within the Rico Group, which was newly acquired in the 2023 financial year. The majority of this financing has a variable interest rate, while a small portion has a fixed interest rate. According to the latest forecast, yield curves have already peaked, and interest rates are expected to fall in the near future.\n\n### Default risks of customers and banks\n\nThe Semperit Group is exposed to the risk of loss of orders or receivables on the part of customers. If the credit rating of Semperit customers deteriorates, their default risk increases. Credit risks and the risk of payment default are managed through standardized credit checks, defined credit limits and credit insurance. The default of a key business partner could have a negative impact on the results and the liquidity of the Semperit Group. This is particularly relevant for the Rico Group, as it has not yet been integrated into the Semperit Group's credit insurance program.\n\nIn addition, there are default risks in relation to the credit balances that the Semperit Group holds with banks. Although the risk of bankruptcy of individual banks or of another banking and/or financial market crisis tends to be low for the Semperit Group's partners, it would be associated with considerable potential effects. In the event of such a default, the Semperit Group may not be able to access this liquidity or credit lines or may only be able to do so partially or with a delay.\n\n### Tax risks\n\nThe group companies of the Semperit Group are subject to local tax legislation in the respective countries and have to pay income taxes as well as other (local) taxes and fees. Changes in tax legislation and regulations in these jurisdictions could lead to higher tax expenses. The constant change and, in some cases, tightening of tax regulations increases the demands on tax compliance to comply with and monitor these regulations. Inadequate controls in business processes or lack of documentation can lead to the violation of regulations in national and international tax law and result in negative findings in tax audits.\n\nUnused tax loss carryforwards could also be subject to tax audits and be questioned in part. The Semperit Group and its local companies are subject to regular tax audits by financial authorities which may entail negative findings.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Compliance risks\n\nThe constant tightening of international codes of conduct and laws increases the requirements for compliance and monitoring of these regulations. Inadequate controls in business processes or insufficient documentation can lead to the violation of applicable rules and jeopardize the company's reputation and economic success through compliance violations. Among other things, the Semperit Group counters this risk with a Group-wide Code of Conduct and continuous training for all employees worldwide in order to further increase awareness of non-compliant actions. The implemented whistle-blowing system also makes an important contribution by pointing out concerns and potential abuses regarding unethical or illegal behavior.\n\n### Regulatory risks and potential sanctions\n\nThe Semperit Group had or has business activities with customers and suppliers, which are subject to export and import control regulations or other forms of trade restrictions (for example through the USA and the EU). New or extended sanctions could lead to restrictions of the raw material supply and the existing business activities in these countries, or indirectly in other countries. In addition, the Semperit Group could be subject to claims or other measures by customers due to the termination of their business in countries, which are subject to sanctions.\n\nFor business activities in emerging countries, there are risks such as unrest, health risks, cultural differences, for example regarding employment relationships and business practices, volatility of the gross domestic product, economic and governmental instability and legal uncertainty, possible nationalization of private assets as well as imposition of currency restrictions and stricter environmental requirements.\n\n### Risks arising from cartel and corruption allegations\n\nProceedings against the Semperit Group regarding corruption and cartel allegations as well as due to other violations of laws could lead to monetary fines under criminal or civil law as well as to penalties, sanctions, court orders regarding future behavior, disgorgement of profits, to the exclusion from directly or indirectly participating in certain business transactions, to the loss of trade licenses or other restrictions and legal consequences. Part of the Semperit Group's business activities are conducted with state-owned companies. Investigations into corruption or cartel allegations or allegations regarding other legal violations could have a long-term impact on the Semperit Group's business, including even an exclusion from public and private-sector orders. Moreover, such investigations could also lead to the cancellation of existing contracts and loss of orders and customers, and proceedings against the Semperit Group could be initiated.\n\nDevelopments in ongoing or potential future investigations, such as the reaction to requests by the authorities and cooperation with the authorities, could distract the attention and resources of the management from other business matters.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Risks related to legal proceedings\n\nThe Semperit Group is, and will be in the future, confronted with different legal disputes and proceedings as part of its ordinary business activities. As a consequence of such litigation, the payments of damages, punitive damages, meeting other claims as well as criminal or civil sanctions, fines or disgorgements may be imposed on the Group. In addition, this may in individual cases result in the formal or informal exclusion from tendering procedures, or withdrawal or loss of business licenses or permits. Moreover, further proceedings may be initiated, and existing proceedings could be extended. Asserted claims from litigation are generally subject to interest payments.\n\nIn some of these legal disputes, negative decisions can be made against the Semperit Group, which may have significant effects on the business, financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the company.\n\nThe Asian markets are of major importance for the Semperit Group. These legal systems there are subject to regular changes, which could have negative effects on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the Semperit Group.\n\n### Occupational safety, health, and environmental risks (HSEQ)\n\nThe safety and health of employees are focal points of the corporate strategy with the aim of ensuring the protection of employees, further raising awareness of hazardous situations and continuously improving occupational safety.\n\nPresent or future occupational safety-related, health-related, and environmental or other state regulations, or changes of such regulations, could require adjustments of the operating activities of the Semperit Group and lead to a significant increase in operating costs. Moreover, there are risks regarding a possible occupational safety-related, environmental, and health-related incident, also when handling hazardous substances, as well as non-compliance with environmental, health- or occupational safety-related regulations, which could subsequently lead to severe accidents, staff absences, reputation loss and legal consequences. Environmental damage could result in losses for the Semperit Group which exceed the insured amount or are not covered by insurance. Such losses could have a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation.\n\n### Compliance risks with respect to corporate social responsibility (ESG)\n\nDue to existing local and international requirements as well as regulations in the area of environment, social and governance (ESG), risks that are not sufficiently known at the current time may arise. These can be based on legal requirements in the respective countries, but also on international requirements and, in addition to burdens on the business, financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the company, can also lead to reputational damage and loss of customers. A detailed description of ESG and climate change-related risks and opportunities can be found in the Sustainability Report of the Semperit Group (see www.semperitgroup.com/company/sustainability). It includes, for example, risks regarding the impact of climate change, the so-called transition effects on technologies, markets and regulations as well as rising energy costs and additional costs due to decarbonization efforts.\n\nTo counter these risks, the Semperit Group regularly undergoes external audits, for example those of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). In addition, the Semperit Group is a member of EcoVadis in order to be assessed with regard to its own performance in the fields of the environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement, and to subsequently improve further. Furthermore, since 2021 the Semperit Group has been a member of \"Together for Sustainability\" (TfS), an initiative of leading chemical companies with the goal of ensuring and successively improving sustainability along the supply chain and thus the environmental and social standards of the relevant suppliers.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Insurable risks\n\nAlthough the Semperit Group has concluded global insurance programs to cover the risks relevant to its business, for example with regard to fire, natural hazards and natural disasters, there is no guarantee that possible losses will be fully covered by these insurance policies, that the insurance companies will be liable for damages, or that the insurance coverage will be sufficient. In order to counteract this loss potential, the Semperit Group has taken further precautions in the form of additional insurance coverage, for example with regard to so-called earthquake or flood layers, which in some cases doubles coverage in addition to other existing insurance policies. In addition, critical business processes with a high potential threat are regularly examined as part of risk assessments and business continuity management, and preventive strategies and measures are developed to ensure that the company can continue to operate in the event of an emergency. The implementation of these measures is monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn this context, specific effects of climate change were also identified based on a climate risk analysis carried out in 2023 and included in the catalogue. This analysis identified immediate physical risks, such as acute events (storms and heavy rainfall), as well as chronic changes (rising sea levels). The consequences for the economy range from storm damage to buildings to temporary disruptions of global supply chains. Indirect physical risks were also identified. These are risks that can arise from the indirect or long-term effects of climate change, for example losses in production due to a shortage of water supply as a result of prolonged periods of drought. According to this analysis, none of the Semperit sites are currently exposed to a physical climate risk in the short term. In the medium and long term, water-related risks such as flooding and water shortages were identified at the Roha, Odry and Bełchatów sites. Projects for efficient water use and sustainable water management have been initiated to counter these risks.\n\nIn any case, Semperit ensures that the risk of insurable natural hazards is reduced as much as possible through regular exchanges with contracted insurers. Legal disputes that exceed the sum insured or are not covered by the insurance may result in additional losses for the Semperit Group. A further risk lies in the fact that it cannot be guaranteed that the Semperit Group will continue to receive adequate insurance cover at economically reasonable conditions in the future.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Market risks\n\n### Competitive environment\n\nThe global markets for the Semperit Group's products are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, production technology, product development and introduction times, customer service and financing conditions, and regarding shifts in market needs. The Semperit Group continues to be confronted with strong competitors, partially also from emerging countries, which have a more favorable cost structure, often also due to higher energy costs in Europe. Some industries in which the Semperit Group operates are undergoing consolidation, which could lead to increased competition and a change in the relative market position of the Semperit Group. Furthermore, it must be noted that suppliers are also increasingly becoming serious competitors for the Semperit Group. In order to further strengthen the competitiveness of the Semperit Group, projects with the goal to increase the strengthening of innovative power, reduce costs, improve efficiency, reduce waste and maintain sustainable energy management are being implemented.\n\n### Economic, political, and geopolitical environment\n\nFrom the Semperit Group's perspective there is currently an insecurity regarding the future development of the global economy. The global markets were recently considerably affected by geopolitical crises and their impact on the supply chain. Since February 2022, the development of the global economic climate has been significantly influenced by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the uncertainty in the energy sector due to generally higher or strongly fluctuating energy prices as well as high inflation. There is a risk that the global economy will recover more slowly than expected and that the negative impact particularly in Asia, Europe and the USA will continue. A slowdown in economic growth in Asia or even a collapse of the real estate market, the banking sector or the stock market represent further significant risks. In the euro zone, too, the cooling of the economic climate might continue. This could increase business volatility and represent risks for the financial markets. The investment climate could suffer a slump due to political upheavals in Eastern Europe, further independence movements inside and outside the European Union or because of sustainable successes of protectionist parties and policies that are hostile to business and the EU.\n\nA further intensification of the trade conflicts between the USA and China as well as USA and Russia and the consequences of a dispute with Iran, the tensions between China and Taiwan, and Japan as well as the further development of the Russia-Ukraine conflict could have negative effects on the business performance of the Semperit Group.\n\nA terrorist attack or a series of such attacks in large economies or along supply chains could impair the global economic activity.\n\nIf the Semperit Group is not able to further adjust its production and cost structures appropriately in the current economic development, there is a risk of a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance, and profit situation of the company.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Opportunities\n\nIn addition to monitoring risks, it is an essential part of corporate management to recognize opportunities in good time and make the best possible use of them for the company. Opportunity management as an entrepreneurial approach that aims to identify, record and utilize the positive aspects and opportunities in a business environment is aimed at managing the uncertainties associated with business activities.\n\nTo identify opportunities, the Semperit Group looks for possibilities to recognize potential for growth and improvement, for example through market analyses, innovations or partnerships. Potential opportunities are carefully evaluated and prioritized in order to use resources efficiently. Strategies developed on the basis of identified opportunities can result in the adaptation of business models, product developments or market entry strategies. Opportunity management is therefore a proactive approach that aims to not only minimize risks, but also maximize the positive potential for the Semperit Group.\n\nIn the long term, the management sees great potential in the further expansion of the core business as part of the strategic orientation of the Semperit Group as an industrial rubber and elastomer specialist.\n\n### Opportunities arising from the new organizational structure\n\nThe new divisional structure is oriented towards the two main business models of the Semperit Group, while at the same time reducing complexity and enabling business expansion. This can open up various opportunities for the Semperit Group, such as rationalizing processes and increasing efficiency.\n\n### Opportunities through acquisition\n\nThe acquisition of the Rico Group in the reporting year, its further growth steps and other potential acquisitions of companies with similar elastomer or complementary products and services may offer the Group the opportunity to gain access to new geographical regions and sales markets or to strengthen its presence in existing markets. This opens up new sales opportunities and the expansion of the customer base. The acquisition of the Rico Group, for example, has given Semperit a leading technological position in liquid silicone and high-end toolmaking. This goes hand in hand with servicing high-growth sectors such as healthcare and industrial household applications. In addition, synergy effects can be achieved through acquisitions by rationalizing redundant functions and resources, for example in the areas of sales, logistics and administration. The acquisition of a company with advanced technologies, such as the Rico Group or another company with advanced technologies and know-how, especially in the area of production automation, strengthens the technological lead of the Semperit Group, can accelerate innovation and provides access to highly qualified employees. Instead of developing new markets or products organically, an acquisition enables faster market entry. This is particularly important in fast-moving industries. As a further opportunity, a broader business base through acquisitions can help to diversify risk.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Opportunities through automation\n\nIncreasing the level of automation is a key component of the Semperit Group's strategic orientation. This is reflected, for example, in the construction of the DH5 hose production facility in Odry, where automation in production and internal logistics is intended to achieve a very high and consistent level of quality throughout the entire production process, and in the recent acquisition of the Rico Group. Increased use of automation technologies leads to cost savings, error reduction and time savings, which in turn improves responsiveness to customer requirements. Automated systems are often easier to adapt to fluctuating demand than manual processes, which is particularly advantageous in a volatile market environment. In addition, processing information in real time enables data-driven decision-making processes.\n\n### Opportunities through sustainability\n\nThe Semperit Group's commitment to sustainability can strengthen its reputation and market value. Consumers and stakeholders increasingly value companies that assume social and ecological responsibility. Sustainability is becoming an important decision-making factor for many consumers when purchasing products or services. Sustainable practices can therefore help to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the long term.\n\nIn order to drive the development of new or sustainable products and identify corresponding market trends, the Semperit Group is cooperating closely with customers and supporting scientific research – with a focus on innovative materials, technologies and products. The aim of the research activities is to secure and further strengthen the market position of the Semperit Group in the long term while at the same time becoming more attractive for sustainable investments, for example through the successive improvement of ESG rating results. In the production of sealing profiles, for example, the Semperit Group is working on a gradual increase in the reuse of recycled material.\n\n### Opportunities through innovation\n\nInnovations offer a variety of opportunities for the Semperit Group to achieve competitive advantages, promote growth and increase market success. Examples of innovative products that satisfy new market trends are the \"Hybrid Handrail\" and \"SemperSilentPads\". The former, a newly developed escalator handrail, consists of two materials (rubber and Smart Polymer) and combines the best of both material worlds. The SemperSilentPads are an innovative solution for a rail pad that significantly reduces noise compared to competitor products.\n\n### Opportunities through digitalization\n\nThe consistent implementation of digitalization projects will allow the Semperit Group to collect, store and analyze large amounts of cross-location data on production and financial processes. This will enable even faster reactions to market trends, changes in demand and external threats. Current major projects such as \"oneERP\" with the introduction of SAP S/4 Hana serve to harmonize the IT infrastructure. On the other hand, automation and digital back-office projects are being used to further increase efficiency.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Internal Control System (ICS)\n\nThe Semperit Group's internal control system is designed to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of its business activities, the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant statutory regulations. It also supports the early recognition and monitoring of risks deriving from inadequate monitoring systems and fraudulent actions and is improved and expanded on an ongoing basis by the Group Risk Management & Assurance department together with the relevant specialist departments. The management of the respective business unit is responsible for implementing and monitoring the ICS and the risk management system. The Executive Board of Semperit AG Holding stipulates cross-divisional framework conditions and regulations that are applicable throughout the group. Regular follow-up audits are performed at the locations to ensure the sustained implementation of the framework conditions and regulations.\n\nThe following principles form the basics of ICS:\n\n- Ensuring the accuracy of accounting and reporting\n- Compliance with internal regulations (limits of authority) and external laws and regulations\n- Increased payment security based on a predefined corset of payment transaction controls\n- Ensuring adequate implementation and segregation of duties\n- Ensuring the controls provided in the process\n- Auditability by independent experts\n- Protection of property\n- Recognition of potential operating risks and making losses visible that have already occurred\n- Improvement in operating effectiveness\n\n### Essential characteristics of the internal control and risk management system with regard to the financial reporting process\n\nThe key points of the existing internal control system and the risk management system with regard to the (consolidated) financial reporting process are summarized as follows:\n\n- With regard to the financial reporting process, the functions of accounting are separated from other areas of responsibility such as treasury.\n- The applied financial systems are protected against unauthorized access by appropriate IT facilities.\n- With regard to applied financial systems, standard software is widely used.\n- A guideline system (e.g., accounting guidelines, payment guidelines) has been implemented.\n- Received or forwarded accounting data will be examined for completeness and correctness, e.g., by means of random samples, by the responsible persons.\n- The dual-control principle is applied in accounting-related processes.\n- Accounting-related processes are examined on a random basis by internal audit.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter a solid performance in continued operations in the 2023 financial year, the Executive Board of the Semperit Group expects the market environment to remain challenging in the coming months. For the SIA division, no significant recovery in demand is expected in the short term, as the reduction of increased customer inventories will extend into the first half of 2024. In addition, demand from the relevant industries (including construction machinery and agricultural machinery such as tractors) continues to decline or is not yet showing any signs of recovery. For the SEA division, the good demand from the mining industry, healthcare and food sectors as well as the railway sector should continue, while demand for products linked to the construction industry and related sectors will be lower.\n\nIn addition, uncertainties due to geopolitical conflicts are still present and may quickly lead to adverse effects on the market environment.\n\n### Cost masures take effect\n\nIn anticipation of this development, countermeasures have been introduced at an early stage of the 2023 financial year. These include improvements to the product mix in the direction of higher-margin products, cost reduction programs and a streamlining of processes, accompanied by an increase in operating efficiency in order to be able to react flexibly to further market fluctuations. Defined and already established measures for savings include a run-rate of more than EUR 10 million, of which around EUR 5.8 million was already recognized in profit or loss in 2023.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Executive Board of the Semperit Group expects EBITDA to increase to around EUR 80 million for the 2024 financial year.\n\n### Dividend/distribution\n\nThe dividend policy of the Semperit Group generally aims at a distribution of around 50% of earnings after tax – provided that business development continues successfully, and no extraordinary circumstances occur.\n\nIn view of the positive earnings after tax from continued operations – the relevant earnings and comparative figure for future business development – the Executive Board will propose a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share to the Annual General Meeting. A total of EUR 10.3 million should therefore be distributed. With a share price of EUR 14.16 at the end of 2023, this results in a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Note\n\nThis outlook is based on the assessments of the Executive Board as of 18 March 2024, and does not take into account the impact of potential acquisitions, divestments, or other unforeseeable structural and economic changes during the remainder of 2024. These assessments are subject to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may result in actual events and outcomes differing from the statements made here.\n\nVienna, 18 March 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nHola Wall\n\nKarl Haider CEO\n\nHelmut Sorger CFO\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/10 description: The image shows a stylized signature above the name \"Gerfried Eder\" in blue text, followed by \"CIO\" in black text.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>\n\n| Consolidated financial statements                     | 8  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Consolidated income statement                         | 8  |\n| Consolidated statement of comprehensive income        | 8  |\n| Consolidated cash flow statement                      | 8  |\n| Consolidated balance sheet                            | 8  |\n| Consolidated statement of changes in equity           | 8  |\n| Notes to the consolidated financial statements        | 8  |\n| 1.

<span id=\"page-87-1\"></span>1. General\n\n### 1.1. General information\n\nSemperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding (SAG), a public limited company under Austrian law, is the parent company of an international industrial group (hereinafter: the Semperit Group). It is domiciled at Am Belvedere 10, 1100 Vienna, Austria, and it develops, produces, and sells highly specialized rubber products in the Semperit Industrial Applications (SIA) and Semperit Engineered Applications (SEA) divisions and in the Surgical Operations business. B&C KB Holding GmbH is the direct majority shareholder of SAG, and B&C Privatstiftung is the controlling legal entity. The Semperit Group completed its strategic realignment and transformation to an industrial rubber specialist by selling the Medical Sector, which initially excluded the Surgical Operations business, in August 2023. Please see section 2.1 for additional information on the divisions.\n\n### 1.2. Basic preparation principles\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023 were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), and Section 245a of the Austrian Commercial Code (Unternehmensgesetzbuch, UGB). The fiscal year comprises the period from January 1 to December 31. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on March 18, 2024 and approved for submission to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe reporting currency is the euro (EUR), with figures rounded to the nearest thousand, unless expressly stated otherwise. Rounding differences may occur when totaling rounded amounts and percentages through the use of automated calculation methods.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the former Medical Sector, which is now Surgical Operations and Examination Operations, was recognized for the most part under discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements (see section 2.9). As per the accounting rules under IFRS 5, Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the earnings after taxes of continuing and discontinued operations are shown separately in the consolidated income statement. The earnings from discontinued operations were reported as a separate item, including the earnings after taxes resulting from the measurement at fair value less costs to sell or from deconsolidation. This item also includes the recycling of any historical currency translation differences recognized in other comprehensive income relating to discontinued operations. Cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations were presented together in the consolidated cash flow statement. Cash flows from the operating, investing, and financing activities of discontinued operations are disclosed in the notes (see section 2.9). The disclosures in the notes explaining the consolidated income statement, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated balance sheet follow the presentation described here.\n\nWith the exception of the measurement of certain financial instruments, as well as provisions and deferred taxes, the consolidated financial statements were prepared based on amortized cost. Securities and derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The three levels in the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\n- Level 1: measurement based on quoted prices on an active market for a specific financial instrument\n- Level 2: measurement based on quoted market prices for similar instruments or on the basis of measurement models based exclusively on input factors that are observable on the market\n- Level 3: measurement based on models with significant input factors that are not observable on the market\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, no financial instruments were reclassified between the individual levels.\n\nThe amount of provisions corresponds to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the liabilities as at the reporting date. Deferred taxes that are expected to be realized are calculated based on the nominal amount of existing temporary differences between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base, using the tax rate that is expected to apply.\n\n### 1.3. Consolidation principles\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company and the financial statements of the subsidiaries controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control begins and until the date on which control ceases. Please see sections 1.6 and 10.1 through 10.2 for more detailed information on the scope of consolidation.\n\nAcquisition accounting involves offsetting the amortized cost of the equity interest in subsidiaries and the respective subsidiary's equity attributable to the investment. Receivables and liabilities between companies included in the scope of consolidation are eliminated during the course of the consolidation of intercompany balances. Foreign currency differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are presented in the other financial result. All income and expenses from intercompany transactions, such as deliveries of goods and services, Group financing, or profit distributions, are offset during the elimination of income and expenses. Depending on the underlying transaction, foreign currency differences from the elimination of income and expenses are presented in the cost of materials, other operating expenses, or other financial result. In addition, intercompany profits and losses from intragroup goods and services are eliminated.\n\n### Currency translation\n\nAssets and liabilities, including goodwill of subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements whose functional currency is not the euro, are translated at the mean exchange rate as at the reporting date; items in the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and the consolidated cash flow statement are translated using an average mean exchange rate for the fiscal year. The reference exchange rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) are generally used for currency translation. Currency differences resulting from this translation of subsidiaries' financial statements are recognized in the consolidated financial statements through other comprehensive income in the currency translation reserve and reclassified to the consolidated income statement upon the sale or other disposal of the subsidiary in question.\n\nPursuant to IAS 21, for some subsidiaries there are mixed factors and indicators for determining the functional currency. In management's judgment, attributes that give rise to a functional currency other than the local currency predominate at the following subsidiaries:\n\n- Semperit Industrial Products Singapore Pte Ltd., Singapore: US dollar\n- Sempermed Singapore Pte Ltd., Singapore: US dollar\n- Sempermed Kft., Sopron, Hungary: Euro\n\nAt Semperflex Optimit s.r.o., the Czech Republic, and Sempertrans Bełchatów Sp. z o.o., Poland, the assessment of the (mixed) factors and indicators for determining the functional currency results in the use of the local currency as the functional currency.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.4. Judgments and uncertainties in estimates\n\n### Judgments\n\nThe accounting policies set out in the IFRS provide users of the standards with various implicit and explicit options. The application of accounting policies is therefore subject to various exercises of judgment by management that can significantly affect the amounts recognized in the financial statements. The following judgments by management have a significant influence on these consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Determination of the functional currency of subsidiaries (see section 1.3)\n- Determination of sufficient indications of a need to recognize impairment losses or the reversal of impairment losses (see section 3.2)\n- Lease terms: assessment of whether the exercise of extension options or the non-exercise of termination options is reasonably certain; determination of any economic disadvantages resulting from an early termination (see section [3.2](#page-125-0))\n- Treatment of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries with termination options (see sections 6.1 and 10.2)\n- Classification of money market fund units as cash equivalents (see section 6.6)\n- Full consolidation of companies (see section 10.2): assessment of whether control over a subsidiary does or does not exist\n- Determination of whether the conditions for the presentation of non-current assets held for sale or discontinued operations have been met (see section 2.9 as well as the consolidated balance sheet)\n- Identification of intangible assets as part of a purchase price allocation for the acquisition of subsidiaries (see section 1.6)\n- Determination of whether the useful life of intangible assets is indefinite (see section 3.1)\n\n### Material estimates and assumptions\n\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future developments that affect the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, the disclosures on other obligations as at the reporting date, and the reporting of the income generated and expenses accrued during the fiscal year. The amounts ultimately realized may differ from the amounts recognized based on the decisions and assumptions that were made. Estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly and adjusted if necessary.\n\nThe following estimates and assumptions were made; more detailed explanations of these can be found under the respective item:\n\n- Intangible assets: the annual impairment test of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (see section [3.1](#page-120-1))\n- Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment: determination of the useful lives of assets with finite useful lives (see sections [3.1](#page-120-1) and 3.2)\n- Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment: indication-driven impairment testing of the assets, delineation and determination of costs to sell (see section 3.2)\n- Inventories: determination of net realizable values during inventory measurement (see section 4.1)\n- Trade receivables: determination of loss allowances (see section 4.2)\n- Financial instruments: determination of the fair values for which there is no active market (see section [6.4](#page-147-0))\n- Contract assets: determination of the stage of completion based on the total expected order cost for customer tools (see sections 2.2 and 8.1)\n- Tax uncertainties: recognition and measurement of actual and deferred income taxes in cases in which there is uncertainty about the amount of (recoverable) income taxes owed (see sections 2.8 and 9)\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profits against which unused tax loss carryforwards or tax credits can be utilized, or of tax planning opportunities that will create taxable profits in future (see sections 2.8 and 9)\n- Provisions for personnel: significant actuarial assumptions used in measuring provisions for pensions, severance payments, and anniversary bonuses (see sections 7.1 and 7.2)\n- Other provisions: significant assumptions about the probability of occurrence and extent (see section 7.2)\n\n### Effects of climate-related matters and risks\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the European Union's aim to use the \"Green Deal\" to create the framework required for a sustainable economic future led once again to the development of rules and regulations as well as action plans that are now being implemented step by step. Taking this into account, the Semperit Group enhanced its efforts to make entrepreneurial decisions in favor of environmental and social impacts. The Semperit Group used the \"30% by 2030\" initiative to bundle and accelerate all existing activities aimed at boosting efficiency, thus making a significant contribution to climate action. Its goal was to leverage process optimization to achieve a 30% increase in efficiency and a 30% decrease in resource and energy consumption and waste generation by 2030 relative to the baseline year 2019.\n\nDue to the sale of the Medical Sector and the acquisition of the Rico Group, the size of the Semperit Group and its impact on the environment and society changed in the 2023 fiscal year. The Semperit Group's management therefore examined the targets set in 2020 by conducting a materiality analysis in the fiscal year 2023 and adjusting them in line with the new circumstances and potential. The fact that the division with the comparatively highest potential to reduce energy, emissions, waste, and water consumption was discontinued, and that there is comparatively little, if any, remaining potential to make reductions in the continued operations, is one reason why this savings potential is now much smaller. In addition, there are \"only\" seven more years between the new baseline year 2023 and 2030 to realize this savings potential. From 2024, the adjusted targets will include a reduction in energy consumption by 5%, emissions by 10%, and waste by 7% by 2030. This work focuses chiefly on continual improvements in energy efficiency in production and also in facility management, as well as on reductions in waste, waste generation, and water consumption. In addition, further measures to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions are to be developed and implemented (e.g., installation of photovoltaic (PV) units and the continued promotion of electromobility in the fleet). Thanks to the demolition of the given thermal generation plants and measures aimed at reducing combustible heat capacities, for example, plants at the Austrian entity, Semperit Technische Produkte Gesellschaft m.b.H. (STP), and the Czech entity, Semperflex Optimit s.r.o. (SFO), have already fallen outside of the purview of the respective emission allowance laws (see section 3.1). Additional activities aimed at environmental protection and climate action concern measures specific to materials (e.g., recycling activities) or the use of secondary raw materials. Not every raw material used in a rubber mixture can be substituted by a secondary raw material, because a change in the formulation not only affects the finished product's material and product properties but also the process-related steps in manufacturing. Currently, the use of secondary raw materials is still limited for this reason – not least in view of their limited availability. Different kinds of vulcanized rubber are difficult to reuse due to the chemical crosslinking reaction that occurs when they are exposed to heat – i.e., long-chain rubber molecules are crosslinked by sulfur bridges; elastomeric product components must be subjected to a separate regeneration step. This distinguishes rubber from other materials such as steel, glass, paper, or cardboard. Recycling rubber and silicone is highly desirable from a circular economy perspective: in the Semperit Group, production waste and scrap are fed back into the production process to the extent technically possible. Nevertheless, what must be considered in this case is the fact that the extraction \n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nof secondary raw materials can be very energy-intensive and may also involve large quantities of chemicals. Product design also plays a major role in the potential recycling of old products. In addition to the rubber mixture, the Semperit Group's finished products often contain reinforcing materials such as ropes, wires, woven fabrics, and yarns. It is difficult to separate these materials at the end of a product's useful life. As the main component of the finished products from the Rico Group, silicone is considered non-recyclable for environmental and economic reasons based on the latest technological and scientific knowledge. Energy-intensive thermal recycling (incineration) generates sand, water, and carbon dioxide, which cannot be directly converted back into silicone or are only marginally returned to the production process. Despite this, it is possible to manufacture lubricating oil from silicone waste and silicone residue in production (with the help of an external partner). This downcycling will significantly reduce the amount of waste generated at Rico and enable the reuse of waste silicone in the production process.\n\nThe Semperit Group tracks developments and technological progress in the extraction of secondary raw materials, regularly tests newly available recyclates, and works to establish a supplier network for this, as well as to improve technical options through research and development conducted in cooperation with third parties. Thanks to technological advances, the Semperit Group was able to develop products in the Profiles business in the 2023 fiscal year that contain up to 70% regenerated vulcanized waste from the company's own profile production. This will make it possible to close the recycling gap in the construction industry in the future, as the market does not currently offer an option to recycle sealing profiles. While sealing profiles that are no longer needed were previously utilized for energy purposes, i.e., incinerated, the Semperit circularity profiles enable reuse as a secondary raw material for the first time – in keeping with the principle of a circular economy. The process of chemical crosslinking, which generates an insoluble and no longer deformable elastomer from the rubber compound, is reversed. The bridges formed during crosslinking are split and a deformable, soluble rubber compound is formed. In the next process step, 50% of the newly recovered raw material will be reused as the primary raw material for the total mass of a new EPDM compound. As with the recycled vulcanized profiles, the resulting compound containing 50% recycled content meets the standard requirements for elastomer materials DIN 7863-1. Semperit circularity profiles make a noteworthy contribution to the decarbonization of the construction industry and thus to climate action, with a product carbon footprint that is 47% lower than that of a conventional, comparable sealing profile and 26% lower than that of a standard Semperit Group profile.\n\nClimate-related matters and risks may affect the business medium-term financial planning, which may be used as the basis to determine the value in use for impairment tests. For example, this applies to the assumptions used to estimate the market development of the Belting business: it engages in the production and sale of transport and conveyor belts, which are used (among other things) in the mining of coal, ores, and rare earth metals, in the steel and cement industry, as well as in the civil engineering and transport industry. In order to meet various application requirements, the Belting business reinforces the belts either with textile or with steel cord carcasses. The market for transport and conveyor belts comprises the replacement business as well as new or expansion projects. In the medium to long term, the coal phase-out in Europe will lead to the replacement of both the coal infrastructure and related energy production in favor of non-fossil and carbon-neutral energy sources. The demand for transport and conveyor belts from the European coal mining industry will therefore decrease in the medium and long term. By contrast, the demand is growing from the heavy load sector (particularly for transport and conveyor belts reinforced by steel cord carcasses) in the mining industry in connection with the mining of ores (e.g., copper) and rare earths, which are increasingly needed for electrification purposes and sustainable power supplies. The mining industry also aims to reduce its carbon footprint through \"green mining\" initiatives. In this context, the traditional truck and shovel operation model is increasingly being replaced by transport and conveyor belt solutions. Furthermore, transport and conveyor belt solutions help counteract soil compaction resulting from \n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe use of heavy mining machines. The business medium-term financial planning accounts for sustainability issues related to energy consumption and emissions (e.g., improving energy efficiency, reducing emissions, improving the use of renewable resources to meet energy demands, etc.).\n\nThe medium-term financial plans include EUR 1.7 million in investments in photovoltaic units in the SIA division to speed up the relevance of solar energy in the energy mix and to produce up to 2.1 million kWh of electricity with it. Investments in circulation water treatment have also been factored in to reduce the SIA division's water requirements and mitigate water shortage risks. Finally investments in more modern and efficient lighting systems in the SEA division were planned to achieve up to EUR 0.7 million in annual energy savings and up to 10% savings in production energy. The same applies to aspects of the circular economy (e.g., choice of raw materials, use of available recyclates, efficiency of material use, improvements to waste management) and to environmentally friendly new product development (e.g., high-density window profiles and sound-reducing rail pads to lower environmental noise pollution arising from harmful excess noise). Planned climate-related measures aimed at improving earnings that are predicated on infrastructure improvements were explicitly taken into account in the determination of the values in use, provided they had been formally adopted and are being implemented. This applies, for example, to the plant expansion in Odry, the Czech Republic (see section 3.1). Future developments related to the potential expansion of the sustainable product portfolio, to the realization of potential in the economical recycling of vulcanized rubber, and to the use of replacement materials and technologies for vulcanized rubber products were only anticipated in part in the medium-term financial planning (e.g., use of recyclates) even though the Semperit Group is currently evaluating such measures. As far as the resilience of the corporate strategy underlying the medium-term planning with regard to various climate-related scenarios (including a scenario aimed at achieving the 1.5-degree objective of international climate policy) is concerned, the Semperit Group conducted a climate scenario analysis for the first time in the fiscal year 2023 in order to assess the potential effects and risks of future climate developments and enable well-founded decisions with respect to climate adaptation and investments. The climate scenario analysis helps prepare the sites better for climate change and to develop a sustainable corporate strategy and medium-term planning. The risk of the limited availability and increase in price of raw materials is reflected in medium-term planning. The transition to alternative energy sources and adaptation of production facilities and associated processes can also have an effect on mediumterm planning, and investments in photovoltaic systems have already been taken into account. The risk of flooding and droughts varies depending on the location over the medium and long term, and only affects certain locations. Mitigating structural measures have already been partially incorporated into medium-term planning as investments. The implications of the analysis will be incorporated into the current financial and strategic planning starting in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nCurrently, there are no inventories in the Semperit Group that are at risk of obsolescence or falling prices due to climate-related risks. Climate-related risks did not represent an indication of impairment and also did not result in any adjustment of the useful lives of intangible assets or property, plant, and equipment. The recognition of provisions for climate-related matters and risks is of minor importance to the Semperit Group. However, the topic of sustainability with its three key dimensions – environmental, social, and governance (ESG) – has also found its way into corporate and Group financing. The current regulatory and market-related developments with respect to sustainable finance first found their way into the terms and conditions of bank financing in the 2023 fiscal year. Three key performance indicators (KPIs) with quantitative targets up to 2030 have been identified and incorporated into bank financing:\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Reduction of energy consumption by 5% by 2030,\n- Improvement in occupational accident rate by 8% p.a.,\n- Integration of sustainability into the supply chain with more than 75% ESG-certified expenditure by 2030\n\nThe KPIs are reported to the bank via the Semperit Sustainability Report and are applied to determine the credit margin. Starting in the fiscal year 2025, the achievement of these targets will have a direct impact on interest rates from bank financing of up to +/– 6 basis points with a nominal value of up to EUR 360,000 thousand as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition, the ESG targets of occupational health and safety, energy efficiency, and waste reduction, as well as a target value for an ESG rating (CDP Climate Rating), are applied to achieving the target of long-term variable performance bonuses for management, whereby climate-related issues may have a direct impact on premium provisions (see section 7.2).\n\n### Macroeconomic influences\n\nThe indirect consequences of macroeconomic developments related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, in particular a mixture of high inflation and interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and a slowdown in macroeconomic developments, had a major impact on both Semperit Group divisions. The SEA division's Belting business benefited from the intensification of mining activities and, as a result, from the high demand for conveyor belts. In the SIA division's Hoses business, customer portfolio optimization programs resulting from the economic downturn led to customer ordering behavior that was outside the scope of usual practice, which resulted in a sharp decline in revenue. As at the end of December 2023, the Hoses business' order books were more than 50% lower than the figures from the same period in the previous year. In addition, the SIA division was impacted by the effects of a weak construction industry, especially in the Profiles business, which suffered from weak demand. Please see section 2.1 for more details on the individual divisions' performance. To offset this, EUR 5.8 million in savings were realized as part of the ongoing implementation of an overhead costs project, approximately 85% of which was attributable to personnel expenses and the remainder to other operating expenses.\n\nThe impact of trade conflicts and growing geopolitical tension on global procurement flows was negligible for key raw materials and auxiliary materials used in the production of the Semperit Group's products due to a wide range of optimization initiatives. On the whole, we observed a restoration of supply chains following the severe bottlenecks in the previous year, which ensured improved and reliable supplies in the 2023 fiscal year. These developments had a positive impact on freight costs and contributed substantially to ending the trend toward the highly precautionary building up of safety stock levels for materials critical for production.\n\nThe escalation of the conflict in the Middle East did not affect the Semperit Group in the fiscal year 2023. At the start of 2024, the attacks on shipping in the Red Sea led to a slight increase in delivery times and container costs. Both effects were much smaller than during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ramifications of the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East have so far been confined to shipping in the Red Sea. In principle, the Semperit Group established international multiple sourcing some time ago now and this mitigates the effects of crises.\n\nThe revenue for surgical glove production in Wimpassing, Austria, which for now remains part of the Semperit Group and thus within its continued operations despite the sale of the medical business, has decreased after the exceptional boom period during the pandemic with a comparatively high demand and price development. Despite savings in personnel and lower freight costs, the result remained negative due to the reduction of customer inventories.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nStagnant to slightly slowing economic performance is expected for the fiscal year 2024; this has already been anticipated accordingly in the medium-term financial planning, which may be used as the basis to determine value in use for impairment tests. The changed interest rate landscape mainly affects investment income, debt service for financial liabilities, social capital (i.e., provisions for pensions, severance payments, and anniversary bonuses), and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for impairment test purposes (see sections 7.1 and 3.1).\n\nAs part of the impairment tests, the increased forecasting uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was managed by considering alternative planning scenarios. The risk-free interest rate rose due to the central banks raising the key interest rates and changes in inflation expectations, whereas the market risk premium fell. The calculation of the weighted average cost of capital takes into account a risk-free interest rate of 2.7% (previous year: 1.6%), which is calculated on the basis of German federal securities with a 30-year term using the Svensson method. The market risk premium was assumed to be 5.8% (previous year: 7.9%), taking into account observable developments in market rates of return (see section 3.1).\n\nThe measurement of social capital reflects the changed interest rate landscape by applying the most recent interest rates based on the Mercer Yield Curve (MYC) on the reporting date that take into account the corresponding duration of the liabilities, derived from a spot rate yield curve on euro area bonds. The current wage and salary cost pressures were countered in the measurement of social capital by assuming salary increases in 2024 and 2025 in excess of those expected in the long term (from 2025). Please see section 7.1 for details on the measurement of social capital, including sensitivity analysis.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the financial position of the Semperit Group changed primarily due to the acquisition of the Rico Group, the first closing for the sale of the Medical Sector, the commencement of new bank financing, and the payment of dividends from a net cash surplus of EUR 9,424 thousand in the previous year to a net debt of EUR –192,411 thousand as at the reporting date.\n\nThe Semperit Group's financial liabilities currently consist of fixed-interest corporate Schuldschein loans and variable-interest bank financing (see section 6.2). Corporate Schuldschein loans do not bear any (negative) present value risk as interest rates rise, in contrast to the higher variable-interest bank financing. The effective interest rate on the corporate Schuldschein loans is below the current interest rate level and, given the current level of inflation, has a favorable effect on the Semperit Group's financial position (see section 6.4). The newly acquired variable-interest bank financing was concluded with a volume of up to EUR 360,000 thousand. Of this amount, EUR 110,000 thousand from the first loan and EUR 33,000 thousand from the second loan were utilized as of December 31, 2023 and recognized as a liability (see section 6.2). Both the newly acquired bank financing and the bank financing of the Rico Group, which was consolidated for the first time, are subject to fluctuations in the usual benchmark interest rates on the European money market. Please see section 11.1 for details on interest rate terms and requirements under credit law.\n\nIn the period from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, the three-month EURIBOR surged from 2.1% to 3.9%. Please see section 2.7 for the impact of higher interest rates on finance expenses and section 11.4 for details on the interest rate profile and sensitivities. At the time the annual report was prepared, the development of the three-month EURIBOR forward interest rate curve indicated that lower interest rates are expected between 2024 and 2030, which will have a favorable effect on the refinancing risk. Please see section 11.2 for details on liquidity management and maturities on financial liabilities. Due to its international trade relations, the Semperit Group is exposed to currency fluctuations that are strongly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Please see section 11.5 for details on the foreign currency risk profile.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.5.

acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in the Rico Group. As a one-stop-shop (OSS) provider of individual synthetics and elastomer projects, the Rico Group's product portfolio ranges from the manufacture of injection molding tools, to consulting on component development, all the way to mass production of customer-specific components. The Group focuses on the processing of elastomers, especially liquid and solid silicone. This involves producing the components in single, double, or multi-shot component injection molding processes. The technological market leadership of the Rico Group in the processing of liquid and solid silicone, the group's strong expertise in toolmaking and process automation to develop high-precision and highly complex customer solutions, its access to attractive markets, and its presence in the United States are the main reasons for this business combination. These factors determine goodwill as well as the tax synergies that will be realized through inclusion in the Austrian Group in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (Körperschaftssteuergesetz, KStG) (see section 12.3), as well as the acquired workforce. The closing of the acquisition of the Rico Group took place on July 31, 2023.\n\nThe final purchase price totaled EUR 184,329 thousand, which corresponds to a cash and debt free purchase price of EUR 197,500 thousand taking into account a customary price adjustment mechanism at the time the transaction was effected. The amount of cash and cash equivalents in the subsidiaries consolidated for the first time was EUR 15,004 thousand. According to the contractual agreements, the final purchase price is EUR 4,500 thousand to be paid three years after closing. A present value of EUR 3,832 thousand was taken into account in the purchase price allocation for the deferred purchase price in the total consideration and recognized as a non-current other financial liability. The transaction costs totaled EUR 3,350 thousand and were recognized in the SEA division's other operating expenses.\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Rico Group as of the acquisition date, the goodwill, and disclosures pursuant to IFRS 3.B64 (q) are as follows:\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand

area of toolmaking), and brand names. Customer relationships were measured using the residual value method, technologies using the excess profit method, and brand names using the license price analogy method. Please see section 3.1 for the subsequent measurement of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-99-0\"></span>2. Performance\n\n### 2.1. Segment reporting\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 8, segment reporting is based on internal reporting to the SAG Executive Board as the chief operating decision-maker, which decides on the allocation of resources to the businesses. Segment reporting comprises the two divisions SIA and SEA, plus the two businesses Surgical Operations and Examination Operations.\n\nAs part of the development of the Group's industrial strategy, both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of the Semperit Group adopted the Group's organizational structure effective July 1, 2023 and divided up until then existing segments in the Industry Sector into two divisions. From the former Medical Sector, Surgical Operations remain as a business – for the duration of the contract manufacturing agreement concluded with Harps Global Pte. Ltd. and/or Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.). The new divisional structure distinguishes between business models that focus on different customer groups and their specific technical and organizational requirements.\n\n- Semperit Industrial Applications: The Semperit Industrial Applications division will focus on industrial applications such as hydraulic and industrial hoses (the former Semperflex segment) and profiles (formerly part of the Semperseal segment). Its business model is characterized by cost leadership in the volume business, optimization of rubber compounds, manufacture of standard products with long life cycles, high standardization of products and processes, and relatively low product portfolio complexity.\n- Semperit Engineered Applications: The Semperit Engineered Applications division will focus on technical solutions tailored to customers' individual needs and comprises escalator handrails, cable car rings and other elastomer products built to customer specification (formerly the Semperform segment), including elastomer plates (formerly part of the Semperseal segment) and transport and conveyor belts (formerly the Sempertrans segment); the newly acquired Rico Group (see section 1.6) is also a part of this division. The Semperit Engineered Applications division's business model is characterized by a focus on industrial niches, the creation of products with a high degree of customer customization through the effective use of application-specific technologies and knowhow, and relatively high product portfolio complexity.\n- Surgical Operations and Examination Operations: In the fiscal year 2023, the former Medical Sector, the Sempermed segment, was divided into two businesses for internal segment reporting: Examination Operations, which comprise the production of examination gloves, the production of porcelain dip moldings used to manufacture gloves in Malaysia, and worldwide sales and distribution organizations, and Surgical Operations, which comprise the production of surgical gloves in Wimpassing, Austria, by STP and their packaging in Sopron, Hungary. The (first) closing for the sale of the Medical Sector to Harps Global Pte. Ltd. was effective from August 31, 2023. The Semperit Group thus separated itself from the Medical Sector, with the exception of Surgical Operations for the time being. The Semperit Group will continue this business for up to five years as a contract manufacturer until its final sale in a separate (second) closing. Consequently, Surgical Operations will remain under continuing operations for the time being.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe accounting policies applied in deriving the segment figures are identical to the Semperit Group's accounting policies. This does not apply to the presentation and measurement requirements in IFRS 5 for discontinued operations; these were not applied in internal segment reporting (see below).\n\nThe segment result is EBITDA. It is the result that is reported to the Executive Board for the purposes of allocating resources and performance measurement. Trade working capital and additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment are reported to the Executive Board as key performance indicators of the segment assets.\n\n### Segmentation by division and businesses\n\nThe segmentation by division and businesses is based on internal management and reporting that still includes the entire former Medical Sector in the fiscal year 2023, divided into the Surgical Operations and Examination Operations businesses.\n\n| 1–12 2023 in EUR thousand                                                                  |

production and/or sales operations in more than one segment are divided and allocated to the appropriate segment so that no additional eliminations are required. The Corporate Center consists of SAG, which is not operationally active, as well as of those parts of a service company in Singapore that are assigned to the Corporate Center. In addition, certain Corporate Center services are provided by operating companies. Corporate Center's internal charging and allocations have already been assigned to the segments, to the extent possible.\n\nAs far as Surgical Operations is concerned, the pre-packaged surgical gloves were sold by STP to the (formerly intra-Group) Singaporean Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) on August 31, 2023, both before and after the (first) closing for the sale of the Medical Sector; the latter will continue to sell the surgical gloves to external customers. As at August 31, revenue totaled EUR 24,245 thousand (previous year: EUR 45,825 thousand). As the revenue (of the continuing operation) and the cost of materials (of the discontinued operation) from this supply relationship still exist, the expense and income consolidation was not retained for this purpose. Taking into account the previous transfer prices up to August 31, 2023, this adjustment will result in a corresponding recognition of earnings in the respective business segments.\n\nThe consolidated income statement is thus extended in order to present the effects of the disposal of the Medical Sector as realistically as possible. In addition, all intra-Group charges between the continuing operation and the discontinued operation were eliminated in full. The primary expenses underlying the intra-Group charges were allocated to the divisions in accordance with the current contractual arrangements with Harps Global Pte. Ltd. In addition, EBITDA and EBIT were adjusted for the transaction costs of the discontinued operation in the amount of EUR 612 thousand (previous year: EUR 8,364 thousand). Transaction costs are presented in discontinued operations below earnings after taxes (see section 2.9).\n\nEBITDA in the \"Continuing operations\" column corresponds to EBITDA in the Semperit Group's consolidated income statement; the reconciliation to earnings before taxes can therefore be taken from the consolidated income statement. Please see section 2.9 for EBITDA related to discontinued operations. In addition to the revenue from the ongoing supply relationship between STP and Semperit Investment Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investments Asia Pte. Ltd.), the \"Adjustments\" column also includes the the suspension of scheduled depreciation and amortization that was not applied in internal segment reporting. Furthermore, the \"Adjustments\" column includes the transaction costs incurred, the effects of deconsolidation, and the reclassification of other comprehensive income to profit or loss, all of which, unlike internal segment reporting, are presented separately after tax in the discontinued operation's income statement.\n\nTrade working capital consists of inventories plus trade receivables, less current trade payables (also see section [4](#page-134-0)).\n\n### Geographic segmentation\n\nThe Group's activities are conducted primarily in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. In accordance with IFRS 8, the disclosures on revenue are presented by the customer's location and those on non-current assets and additions to intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment are presented on the basis of the Semperit Group companies' locations.

Revenue\n\nRevenue is recognized using the transaction prices assigned to the performance obligations. Deductions are made for agreed rebates, volume and cash discounts, and similar sales reductions, as well as for contractual penalties and expected returns. These sales reductions are based on contractual agreements. All available information and historical values are taken into account when estimating the variable price components. As a rule, the amount delineated as a transaction price reduction is the amount that is likely to be claimed based on agreements or historical values; these estimates are updated regularly.\n\nA refund liability is recognized for potential returns and expected refunds on the basis of contracts or historical values over the past three years. Assets from return claims (refund assets) are recognized at the original carrying amount less expected costs for the return of the products and are presented in inventories.\n\nThe agreed transaction price is normally charged upon delivery. Revenue from deliveries must generally be recognized when economic control is transferred to the customer and therefore refers to a given date in accordance with the Incoterms agreed for the delivery of the goods. In the Rico business, revenue from toolmaking is recognized over time. This is done by applying the cost-to-cost method, which best reflects the manufactured tools' degree of completion. In this way, the expenses already incurred for customer tools are set in relation to the expected total order costs and the pro rata margin is realized over time based on the degree of completion.\n\nWith the production of injection molding tools in the Rico business, part of the revenue is generated with an amortization component. These injection molding tools are sold to customers at a reduced sales price. Higher sales prices for the series production of customer-specific finished products will be charged in return. Both, the receivable from the amortization component and the revenue from the injection molding tool are recognized at the non-reduced sales price. The receivable from the amortization component is subsequently reduced based on the added margin of the products sold from series production.\n\nThe payment targets normally granted are between 14 and 90 days.\n\nFor practical reasons, revenue has not been adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component if the period between satisfaction of the performance obligation and payment by the customer is not more than one year. As in the previous year, no revenue was generated in the 2023 fiscal year from contracts that included a significant financing component and for which the period between satisfaction of the performance obligation and payment by the customer is longer than one year.\n\nSome contracts are agreements with several components that, in addition to the sale of certain products, also include additional performance obligations such as services. In accordance with IFRS 15, the consideration is allocated to the components in line with the relative stand-alone selling prices, where appropriate.\n\nContractually agreed warranties, which represent a separate and identifiable performance obligation, are recognized pro rata over the warranty period from the date on which control of the product sold is transferred.\n\nContract performance costs exist in the form of tool costs that are paid by customers but not transferred to them. The tools are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of IAS 16, and depreciated over a useful life of one to ten years. These tools are offset by contract liabilities, which are recognized in revenue over the useful life of the tools.\n\nContract initiation costs, if material, are capitalized when the contract term exceeds twelve months. As in the previous year, there were no instances of such cases in the fiscal year 2023.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is broken down by division and geographic region, which is determined by the recipient of the invoice, as follows:\n\n| 1–12 2023 in EUR thousand | Semperit<br>Industrial<br>Applications | Semperit<br>Engineered<br>Applications | Surgical<br>Operations | Group   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Western Europe            | 215,964                                | 164,252                                | 0                      | 380,217 |\n| Asia                      | 22,436                                 | 67,063                                 | 39,317                 | 128,816 |\n| Eastern Europe            | 48,015                                 | 39,256                                 | 0                      | 87,271  |\n| North America             | 40,173                                 | 46,167                                 | 0                      | 86,339  |\n| Africa                    | 760                                    | 17,865                                 | 0                      | 18,624  |\n| Central and South America | 1,698                                  | 11,456                                 | 0                      | 13,154  |\n| Australia and Oceania     | 1,740                                  | 4,920                                  | 0                      | 6,660   |\n| Revenue                   | 330,786                                | 350,978                                | 39,317                 | 721,081 |\n\n| 1–12 2022 in EUR thousand | Semperit<br>Industrial<br>Applications | Semperit<br>Engineered<br>Applications | Surgical<br>Operations | Group   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Western Europe            | 308,284                                | 122,495                                | 24                     | 430,803 |\n| Asia                      | 25,536                                 | 57,638                                 | 45,825                 | 128,999 |\n| Eastern Europe            | 64,711                                 | 33,711                                 | 0                      | 98,422  |\n| North America             | 62,956                                 | 23,899                                 | 0                      | 86,855  |\n| Africa                    | 2,586                                  | 11,600                                 | 0                      | 14,186  |\n| Central and South America | 5,086                                  | 11,327                                 | 0                      | 16,412  |\n| Australia and Oceania     | 1,762                                  | 2,411                                  | 0                      | 4,173   |\n| Revenue                   | 470,919                                | 263,081                                | 45,848                 | 779,848 |\n\nThe revenue for Surgical Operations relates essentially to the supply relationship involving prepackaged surgical gloves between the Austrian production company and the Singaporean sales company (see sections 2.1 and 2.9).

Earnings after taxes from discontinued operations\n\nOn December 16, 2022, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the Semperit Group decided to sell the Sempermed business to Harps Global Pte. Ltd., which is based in Singapore and maintains production activities in Malaysia. Please see section 2.1 for a description of the Sempermed business activities. A corresponding sale and purchase agreement (SPA) was also signed on December 16, 2022. The strategic decision of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on January 28, 2020 to dispose of the Medical Sector, to focus on the Industrial Sector in future, and to complete the transformation into an industrial rubber and elastomer specialist was thus implemented. Completion of the transaction was subject to regulatory approval under investment control and competition law and will be implemented in two steps:\n\nThe (first) closing for the sale of the Medical business took place on August 31, 2023, and included the sale of the 100% stake in Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.), Singapore and in Sempermed Europe GmbH (now HARPS Europe GmbH), Austria, as well as certain intellectual property rights held by STP. The cash and debt free sales price of EUR 108,000 thousand is subject to the customary price adjustment mechanism at the time the transaction is effected. The final sales price was EUR 124,234 thousand. The amount of cash and cash equivalents in the deconsolidated subsidiaries was EUR 38,982 thousand. This transaction separated the Semperit Group from Examination Operations and comprised a total of 12 subsidiaries (see section 10.1).\n\nThe (second) closing for the sale of the Medical Sector will include the sale of the operation housed by STP to produce surgical gloves in Wimpassing, Austria, and the 100% stake in Sempermed Kft., which packages them in Sopron, Hungary. However, this Surgical Operations business will be continued by the Semperit Group as contract manufacturers for Harps Global Pte. Ltd. or Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) until its final sale. A contract manufacturing agreement was concluded for this purpose, which provides for the delivery of defined quantities at cost plus. The term of this contract manufacturing agreement includes several renewal options and will be up to five years. The (second) closing will not occur for the sale of the Medical Sector until the contract manufacturing agreement has ended or after the conclusion of a couse agreement for the Surgical Operations business in Wimpassing, Austria. The sale price (cash and debt free) is EUR 7,000 thousand and is subject to customary price adjustment mechanisms at the time the transaction is effected. The requirements for presentation as a discontinued operation had not been met for Surgical Operations as at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and the carrying amounts of the related assets have not yet been recognized as part of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe income statement for the discontinued operation is presented below:\n\n| in EUR thousand                                                                         | 1–12 2023 | 1–12 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                                                                 | 108,376   | 324,155   |\n| Changes in inventories                                                                  | –3,774    | –38,316   |\n| Own work capitalised                                                                    | 216       | 784       |\n| Operating revenue                                                                       | 104,817   | 286,624   |\n| Other operating income                                                                  | 400       | 365       |\n| Cost of material and purchased services                                                 | –93,620   | –213,212  |\n| Personnel expenses                                                                      | –19,113   | –35,388   |\n| Other operating expenses                                                                | –13,722   | –40,036   |\n| Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)                 | –21,238   | –1,647    |\n| Depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets and property, plant and<br>equipment | 0         | –21,369   |\n| Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment                       | 0         | –45,220   |\n| Reversal of impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment           | 1,570     | 40,262    |\n| Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)                                               | –19,668   | –27,974   |\n| Finance income                                                                          | 189       | 727       |\n| Finance expenses                                                                        | –40       | –49       |\n| Other financial result                                                                  | 141       | –288      |\n| Financial result                                                                        | 289       | 390       |\n| Earnings before taxes                                                                   | –19,379   | –27,584   |\n| Income taxes                                                                            | –239      | –8,148    |\n| Earnings after taxes                                                                    | –19,618   | –35,731   |\n| Transaction costs recognized                                                            | –612      | –8,364    |\n| Income taxes on transactions costs recognized                                           | 0         | 143       |\n| Result from deconsolidation                                                             | 1,833     | 0         |\n| Reclassification of other income to profit/loss for the period                          | –23,541   | 0         |\n| Subtotal                                                                                | –22,320   | –8,221    |\n| Result from discontinued operations                                                     | –41,938   | –43,952   |\n| thereof attributable to the shareholders of Semperit AG Holding                         | –41,672   | –43,889   |\n| thereof attributable to non-controlling interests                                       | –266      | –63       |\n\nThe discontinued operation's revenue comprises all external revenue of the deconsolidated company's Medical business from the (first) closing – so including the revenue from the sale of surgical gloves. The pre-packaged surgical gloves have been and will continue to be sold by STP to Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) until further notice and in future too. As the revenue (of the continuing operation) and the material expenses (of the discontinued operation) from this supply relationship will continue to exist due to the contract manufacturing agreement, an incremental approach was selected for the presentation, but the income and expense consolidation was not retained for this purpose. This adjustment led to the accurate recognition of earnings in both operations and extended the consolidated income statement in order to present the effects of the disposal of the Medical Sector as realistically as possible. The cost of manufacturing the packaged surgical gloves as well as the revenue from the supply relationship between STP and Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) remained in continuing operations; the cost of materials and purchased services from the supply relationship between STP and Semperit Investments Asia Pte. Ltd. (now Harps Investment Asia Pte. Ltd.) as well as revenue with external customers remained under discontinued operations. In addition, all intra-Group charges between the \n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\ncontinuing operation and the discontinued operation were eliminated in full. The primary expenses underlying the intra-Group charges were allocated to the operations in accordance with the current contractual arrangements with Harps Global Pte. Ltd.\n\nThe effects of the transitional service framework agreement (TSFA) entered into with effect from August 31, 2023 were not reflected in the discontinued operation's presentation. Remaining overhead costs were recognized in continuing operations as before.\n\nThe cost of material and purchased services comprise the following:\n\n| in EUR thousand                      | 1–12 2023 | 1–12 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cost of materials                    | 68,032    | 165,089   |\n| Energy expenses                      | 23,849    | 45,291    |\n| Production-related maintenance costs | 1,531     | 2,533     |\n| Purchased services                   | 209       | 299       |\n| Total                                | 93,620    | 213,212   |\n\nPersonnel expenses comprise the following:\n\n| in EUR thousand                                                               | 1–12 2023 | 1–12 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wages                                                                         | 3,687     | 8,273     |\n| Salaries                                                                      | 11,078    | 20,433    |\n| Severance payments                                                            | 68        | 62        |\n| Retirement benefit expenses                                                   | 144       | 251       |\n| Statutory social security expenses and other compulsory wage-related payments | 2,256     | 2,764     |\n| Other social security expenses                                                | 1,879     | 3,604     |\n| Total                                                                         | 19,113    | 35,388    |\n\nThe average number of employees in Austria (full-time equivalents) was 23 in total (previous year: 23).

Consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nThe cash flow statement shall be prepared jointly for continuing and discontinued operations; no distinction is made between the cash flows of the individual businesses . Cash flows from the operating, investing, and financing activities of discontinued operations are disclosed in the notes (see section 2.9).\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities is determined using the indirect method. The measurement effects are presented under other non-cash expenses or income. These include, in particular, income from changes in exchange rates, the measurement of derivatives, reclassifications of (historical) foreign exchange rate differences in the consolidated income statement (recycling), as well as changes in loss allowances on inventories and trade receivables. Of the other non-cash income or expense of EUR –2,220 thousand (previous year: EUR 7,742 thousand), loss allowances on inventories accounted for a total EUR 937 thousand (previous year: EUR 5,955 thousand); of this, EUR –998 thousand (previous year: EUR 5,745 thousand) related to discontinued operations. A further EUR –2,309 thousand (previous year: EUR –519 thousand) was attributable to differences from foreign currency translation between Group companies and EUR –493 thousand (previous year: EUR 77 thousand) to loss allowances on trade receivables.\n\nThe cash flows from investing and financing activities are determined directly. Interest received is presented in the cash flows from investing activities, interest paid is presented in the cash flows from financing activities.\n\nAdditions of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment totaled EUR 66,177 thousand (previous year: EUR 53,870 thousand). Of this amount, EUR 4,326 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,802 thousand) relates to additions of right-of-use assets. Liabilities related to additions of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment increased by EUR 11,800 thousand (previous year: decrease by EUR 3,519 thousand), and prepayments increased by EUR 5,697 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,010 thousand). Capitalized interest on the assets in the amount of EUR 145 thousand (previous year: EUR 63 thousand) is shown in the cash flows from financing activities.\n\nThe non-current financial liabilities relate to bank financing in the amount of EUR 150,000 thousand for the acquisition of the Rico Group and EUR 33,000 thousand for the plant expansion at the site in Odry, the Czech Republic. In December 2023, EUR 40,000 thousand (previous year: n.a.) was repaid early from the above loan. In addition to the basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share, the dividend to SAG shareholders also includes an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share. In total, dividends of EUR 92,580 thousand were distributed to shareholders.

Non-current assets\n\n### <span id=\"page-120-1\"></span>3.1. Intangible assets\n\n### Acquired intangible assets\n\nAcquired intangible assets are recognized at cost and subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. The estimated useful life is normally in the range of one to fifteen years. Assumptions and estimates must be made when determining useful lives. Upon visible indications of a change in value, acquired intangible assets are tested for impairment (see section 3.2).\n\n### Internally generated intangible assets\n\nInternally generated intangible assets are recognized at cost. With regard to amortization and impairment testing, the explanation relating to acquired intangible assets above applies mutatis mutandis to internally generated intangible assets. Internally generated intangible assets essentially comprise software implementations and, to a minor extent, capitalizable development costs. The estimated useful life is generally eight years.\n\n### Intangible assets acquired through business combinations\n\nThe cost of intangible assets acquired through a business combination and recognized separately from any goodwill is the fair value of such assets at the acquisition date. These are specifically trademarks, technology-based intangible assets, and (non-) contractual customer relationships. The assumed useful lives are typically between five and 15 years for technology-based intangible assets and between one and 25 years for (non-) contractual customer relationships. Trademarks may be assumed to have an indefinite useful life and are subject to an annual impairment test. Otherwise, an impairment test is only performed for observable indications of a change in the value of intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations.\n\n### Emission allowances\n\nSTP and Semperflex Optimit s.r.o. (SFO) were originally subject to the respective emission allowance laws in Austria and the Czech Republic and received emission allowances free of charge from the government. The emission allowances were recognized at zero cost in the balance sheet (net method). Plants in STP (in 2020) and SFO (in 2021) fell outside of the scopes of the respective emission allowance laws due to the demolition of the respective thermal generation plants and measures aimed at reducing combustible heat capacities. The emission allowances held by the company STP were sold in the fiscal year 2022. The emission allowances held by the company SFO were sold in the fiscal year 2023 (see section 2.3). As at December 31, 2023, the Semperit Group held no emission allowances (previous year: 12,500 units).\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and additionally if there are indications of a possible impairment, provided that there are no circumstances that would allow forgoing the annual impairment test in accordance with IAS 36.\n\nIn the Semperit Group, the businesses are the lowest level (cash generating unit, CGU) at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The Hoses and Profiles business form the SIA division, and the Belting, Form, and Rico business form the SEA division.\n\nManagement determined the recoverable amount as at September 30, 2023 for the impairment test of goodwill in the amount of EUR 1,677 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,677 thousand) in the Hoses business (manufacture and sale of hydraulic and industrial hoses). The recoverable amount was calculated as value in use. The increased forecasting uncertainty due to a slowdown in economic development and geopolitical crises was countered by considering alternative planning scenarios (upside and downside scenarios). The products from the Hoses business are typically used in the agriculture, construction, food, and chemical industries and are exposed to their cyclical developments.\n\nFull customer inventories and the onset of a recession in the second half of fiscal year 2023 were the two main reasons for the drop in revenue in the 2023 fiscal year (see section 2.2). There are no signs of a significant recovery of the European market in the fiscal year 2024. The trend on the North American market is viewed more positively than that on the European market.\n\nThe planning scenarios differ from the base case scenario mainly in the assumptions for the different estimations of the market trend and consequently the annual growth rates in the production quantities. In addition, the downside scenario assumed a reduction in the gross margin by –150 basis points for the fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe key assumptions that were used in determining the recoverable amount of the Hoses business relate to the future development of the EBITDA margin. In the perpetual annuity phase (i.e., from fiscal year 2029), the EBITDA margin is around 23% (previous year: 22% from fiscal year 2028). The EBITDA margins in fiscal year 2028 differ only slightly depending on the planning scenarios and are around 23% (previous year: 22%). The planning was initially based on management's assumptions regarding the development of the markets, the market shares, and strategic product and customer initiatives. Management's medium-term planning is based on the continuation of the Hoses business successful niche strategy to focus exclusively on hose production and thereby distinguish itself from competitors who also produce or assemble fittings and lines or manufacture complete hydraulic systems.\n\nPlanned measures to improve earnings that require capacity expansion or infrastructure improvements as well as such measures that have yet to be sufficiently substantiated were not taken into account when determining the value in use. However, the new plant expansion in Odry, the Czech Republic, which is currently being implemented was taken into account: around EUR 110,000 thousand will be invested in hydraulic hose production over the next few years to expand capacity. Particular attention is being paid to meeting sustainability criteria and achieving a high degree of automation. In the fiscal year 2023, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board resolved to adjust the plant expansion plans in light of the economic slowdown: instead of the originally planned capacity increase of 32 million meters in hydraulic hoses, a capacity increase of \"just\" 24 million meters is now planned; the ramp-up of production facilities will be phased in from fiscal year 2025. In addition, the production of 3.6 million meters of flexible spiral hoses will be relocated from Wimpassing in Austria to Odry in the Czech Republic; the costs of this relocation of business activities were adequately covered by a restructuring provision. The adjustments to the plant expansion plans were taken into account in the impairment test. The new production plants are operated exclusively using green energy and are therefore low in emissions. The total water consumption at the Odry location will drop by around 40–50% after completion of the new production facilities, irrespective of the capacity \n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nexpansion. The capital expenditure on property, plant, and equipment is intended to maintain capacity; it roughly corresponds to planned depreciation. Changes to trade working capital are planned on the basis of revenue.\n\nThe cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2029 were extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%). The growth rate reflects the competition and the price pressure on the market as well as an assumption of moderate market growth. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was determined as the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model. A uniform peer group was assumed for the Hoses, Profiles, Belting, and Form business. The pre-tax discount rate calculated for the Hoses business is 10.5% (previous year: 12.3%). The after-tax discount rate is 8.8% (previous year: 9.5%).\n\nThe recoverability of the recognized goodwill was confirmed in the course of the impairment test for the Hoses business.\n\nManagement determined the recoverable amount as at September 30, 2023 for the impairment test of goodwill in the amount of EUR 49,358 thousand in the Rico business (manufacture of injection molding tools, manufacture of plastic parts, in particular, from liquid silicone and solid silicone in single, two, or multi-component injection molding, and their distribution). The recoverable amount was calculated as value in use. The Rico business products are used especially in the automotive and medical technology industries, as well as in the consumer and household goods industries. The increased forecasting uncertainty due to the economic slowdown and geopolitical crises was countered by considering alternative planning scenarios (upside and downside scenarios).\n\nThe planning scenarios differ from the base case scenario mainly in the assumptions for the different estimations of the market trend and consequently the annual growth rates in the production quantities (i.e., the plastic parts requested by customers and the sales of injection molding tools).\n\nThe key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount of the Rico business relate to the ramp-up of production facilities from the expansion of capacity, which the SAG Executive Board and Supervisory Board committed to in the course of the acquisition, the increased activity on the US market, and the future development of the EBITDA margin. In the perpetual annuity phase (i.e., from fiscal year 2029), the EBITDA margin is around 25% (previous year: n.a.). The EBITDA margins in fiscal year 2028 differ only slightly depending on the planning scenarios and are around 24% in the downside scenario and 26% in the upside scenario. The planning was based on management's assumptions regarding the development of the markets, the market shares, and strategic product and customer initiatives with respect to the production of injection molding tools, as well as advice on component development and the mass production of customer-specific plastic parts. Management's mediumterm planning focuses on consolidating and expanding its technological edge in the production of high-cavity injection molds, automation, and problem-solving expertise. In addition, the focus is on strengthening sales and expanding geographically in relation to this.\n\nPlanned measures to improve earnings that require capacity expansion or infrastructure improvements as well as such measures that have yet to be sufficiently substantiated were not taken into account when determining the value in use. However, the plant expansion in Thalheim, Austria, which is currently being implemented, as well as further capacity expansion with a total investment volume of around EUR 39,800 thousand by fiscal year 2028 were taken into account. The capital expenditure on property, plant, and equipment is intended to maintain capacity; it roughly corresponds to planned depreciation. Changes to trade working capital are planned on the basis of revenue.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe cash flows after fiscal year 2029 were extrapolated based on a sustainable growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: n.a.). The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was determined as the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model. A separate peer group was formed for the Rico business. The pre-tax discount rate calculated for the Rico business is 9.9% (previous year: n.a.). The after-tax discount rate is 8.3% (previous year: n.a.).\n\nThe recoverability of the recognized goodwill was confirmed in the course of the impairment test for the Rico business.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Development of intangible assets\n\nThe development of intangible assets is as follows:\n\n|

technology-based intangible assets of EUR 17,718 thousand (previous year: n.a.), and trademarks of EUR 9,848 thousand (previous year: n.a.), which were identified in connection with the allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of the Rico Group. Indefinite useful lives were assumed for the Rico Group's trademarks because the brand names are very well established in the respective product markets and have clear brand attributes. The Semperit Group will therefore continue to use the brand names for an indefinite period of time and continue to expand the new Rico business under these brand names. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of these trademarks totaled EUR 9,848 thousand (previous year: n.a.). The recoverability of the recognized trademarks was confirmed while conducting separate impairment tests. The impairment test was carried out methodically in line with the determination of fair value as part of the purchase price allocation (see section 1.6).\n\n### 3.2. Property, plant, and equipment\n\n<span id=\"page-125-0\"></span>Property, plant, and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nThey are amortized by allocating the cost less their expected residual value on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. Assumptions and estimates have to be made when determining the useful lives, which are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if necessary.\n\nThe assumed useful lives of each category of property, plant and equipment are within the following ranges:\n\n| Property, plant and equipment excluding right-of-use assets | Useful life<br>in years |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Technical plants and other operating buildings              | 2–50                    |\n| Technical equipment and machinery                           | 1–40                    |\n| Operating and office equipment                              | 1–46                    |\n| Vehicles                                                    | 2–25                    |\n\nThe assumed useful lives of the right-of-use assets included in property, plant, and equipment are within the following ranges:\n\n| Right-of-use assets                                          | Useful life<br>in years |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Land and buildings, including on land owned by third parties | 2–20                    |\n| Technical equipment and machinery                            | 2–5                     |\n| Operating and office equipment                               | 3–8                     |\n| Vehicles                                                     | 2–7                     |\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Impairment tests\n\nIf there are observable indications of impairment, items of property, plant and equipment are tested pursuant to IAS 36 as to whether the carrying amount of the asset or the cash generating unit in question exceeds the recoverable amount. An appropriate impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The assessment of recoverability and determination of the recoverable amount are subject to significant estimates and assumptions. In particular, these include assumptions about corporate planning, future inflation, and growth rates, as well as regarding foreign currency rates, the cost of capital rate used to discount future cash flows, the expected economic development of each individual cash generating unit, as well as with regard to the separate recoverable amounts for individual assets as the lower limit of an impairment loss.\n\nRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities were taken into account during impairment testing in accordance with IFRS 16. The carrying amount of the cash generating unit contains the right-of-use assets; it is reduced by the carrying amount of the lease liabilities. The recoverable amount as the total value of the cash generating unit includes the present value of the cash flows, which is reduced by the lease payments.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Development of property, plant, and equipment\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment developed as follows:\n\n|

11,060 thousand (previous year: EUR 4,079 thousand) relates to land (basic value).\n\nBorrowing costs were capitalized in the fiscal year 2023 as part of the cost of qualifying assets in the amount of EUR 285 thousand (previous year: n.a.) for the expansion of the production facility in Thalheim, Austria. In addition, EUR 141 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand) was capitalized as part of the expansion of a production hall in Odry, the Czech Republic. In both cases, the borrowing costs directly attributable to production were capitalized.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, property, plant, and equipment with a carrying amount of EUR 23,422 thousand (previous year: n.a.) in the Rico business were pledged as security for liabilities.\n\nA new production facility in the United States belonging to the Profiles business was opened in the fiscal year 2021. The ownership rights to the newly constructed production line of US-based Semperit Industrial Products Inc. were then conveyed to the Coweta County Development Authority, Georgia, in order to optimize property-related taxes. At the same time, the company purchased a municipal revenue bond issued by the Development Authority to finance the transaction and entered into a lease agreement for the use of the transferred production line. The nominal amount of the bond as at December 31, 2023 translated into EUR 7,025 thousand and was increased by investments of EUR 433 thousand made in the fiscal year 2023. The bond will be repaid with the lease payments. The business may transfer the bond to the Development Authority at any time, or at the latest at the end of the term, and thereby reacquire the ownership rights to the production line. There are no cash flows because the company is both the lessee and the bondholder. From an economic perspective, therefore, neither a sale-and-lease-back agreement nor a revenue bond was concluded or recognized. The production line for rubber gaskets will continue to be recognized in property, plant and equipment.\n\n### Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Semperit Group is a lessee in particular with regard to right-of-use assets related to land and buildings, office equipment, and motor vehicles.\n\nAs the lessee, the Semperit Group recognizes a lease liability for leases that must be recognized as an other financial liability and a right-of-use asset under property, plant, and equipment at the time the leased asset is made available to the company. The lease liability bears interest and is amortized on an annuity basis by the current payments; the right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life or lease term.\n\nThe option not to apply the lease accounting requirement to short-term leases (i.e., up to 12 months), to leased assets of low value (i.e., up to a replacement value of approximately EUR 5 thousand), and to intangible assets is exercised. The Semperit Group therefore does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these types of contracts; lease payments from these contracts are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe right-of-use assets from leases included in property, plant, and equipment developed as follows in fiscal year 2023:\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                             | Land and<br>buildings,<br>including on<br>land owned by |

The fair values of securities are determined using publicly available prices.\n\nThe derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss are forward exchange contracts.\n\nIn addition to operational measures, individual derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge foreign currency risks. They are measured at the current fair value. The fair value corresponds to the value that the respective Group company would receive or have to pay if the transaction were terminated on the reporting date. Positive fair values as at the reporting date are presented under other financial assets and negative fair values under other financial liabilities. If the requirements for hedge accounting are met, this is applied in part. Recognition is as described in section [6.4](#page-147-0) depending on whether it is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge.\n\n### Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nFor all financial assets not measured at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3.4. Assets held for sale and provisions and liabilities held for sale\n\nUnder IFRS 5, all those long-term assets and disposal groups that can be disposed of in their current condition and are very likely to be disposed of within 12 months due to the management's properly documented intention to dispose shall be classified as held for sale. Non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAssets and liabilities related to the production of examination gloves and the production of porcelain dip moldings for the manufacture of gloves in Malaysia, as well as to the worldwide sales and distribution organizations of the Medical Sector, form discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement and a disposal group in the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2022. The disposal group's assets shall be presented under the Assets held for sale item and the liabilities under the Provisions and liabilities held for sale item. All assets and substantially all liabilities of discontinued operations were disposed of as of the (first) closing of the sale of the Medical Sector on August 31, 2023. The Provisions and liabilities held for sale item includes liabilities that are expected to mature in summer 2024. Please see section 2.9 for the deconsolidation result realized in the fiscal year 2023.\n\nOn December 4, 2023, the Executive Board resolved to sell the property together with the building located on it belonging to Semperit Profiles Leeser GmbH in Dalheim, Germany, in the course of the merger of the company's operations with the Hückelhoven site. After the removal of the machinery and technical equipment in the fourth quarter of 2023, the property was in a condition that could be sold immediately under current and customary conditions and was therefore presented as held for sale for the first time as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe non-current assets held for sale, outside the discontinued operation's disposal group, by the Semperit Group are as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                                        | Business | Asset                                               | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Semperit Profiles Leeser GmbH,<br>Hückelhoven, Germany | Profiles | Land                                                | 158        | 0          |\n|                                                        |          | Buildings                                           | 373        | 0          |\n|                                                        |          | Other equipment, operating,<br>and office equipment | 11         | 0          |\n| Total                                                  |          |                                                     | 541        | 0          |\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>4. Trade working capital\n\nTrade working capital consists of inventories, current trade receivables, and current trade payables.\n\n### 4.1. Inventories\n\nInventories must be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, whereby, in the course of determining the net sales values, in particular realization risks related to obsolete or surplus inventories are taken into account. Utilization is determined using the moving average price method. Income and expenses from intercompany deliveries of inventories are eliminated unless they are of minor significance.\n\n| in EUR thousand                         | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Finished goods and merchandise          | 50,811     | 51,645     |\n| Raw materials, consumables and supplies | 42,182     | 58,568     |\n| Work in progress                        | 17,079     | 17,945     |\n| Prepayments                             | 662        | 9          |\n| Refund assets                           | 26         | 47         |\n| Total                                   | 110,760    | 128,214    |\n\n| in EUR thousand                 | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|---------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Inventories                     |            |            |\n| thereof at cost                 | 82,644     | 104,025    |\n| thereof at net realisable value | 28,116     | 24,189     |\n| Total                           | 110,760    | 128,214    |\n\nNet realizable values as part of the inventory measurement on the reporting date are determined based on specific customer contracts or, in the absence of such contracts, existing list prices; the relevant business management also assesses recoverable prices and market developments. These are evaluated regularly and adjusted as necessary. The net Inventory write-downs recognised as an expense were EUR 1,936 thousand (previous year: EUR 209 thousand).\n\n### 4.2. Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables, which essentially originate from revenue with the Semperit Group's customers, must be allocated to the AC (at cost) measurement category in accordance with IFRS 9 and are therefore measured at amortized cost less expected defaults.\n\nUnder a factoring program concluded on December 29, 2023, trade receivables from STP in Austria, SFO in the Czech Republic, and Sempertrans Belchatów Sp.z.o.o. (STB) in Poland can be sold to a German factoring bank until a maximum amount of EUR 75,000 thousand. The purchase price of the receivables sold is equal to the nominal value, so there is no earnings effect on derecognition. The delcredere risk is transferred to the factoring bank, but only the payment date risk and interest rate risk remained partially within the Semperit Group. The requirements for a complete derecognition of the trade receivables sold under the factoring program are met in accordance with IFRS 9. Interest on factoring is recognized in interest expense.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, trade receivables of EUR 0 thousand (previous year: n.a.) were sold to the factoring bank. In the fiscal year 2023, no interest expense was incurred for factoring (previous year: n.a.)\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n### The trade receivables comprise the following:\n\n|                           |        | 12.31.2023 |        |  |        | 12.31.2022 |        |  |\n|---------------------------|--------|------------|--------|--|--------|------------|--------|--|\n| in EUR thousand           | Gross  | Allowances | Net    |  | Gross  | Allowances | Net    |  |\n| Receivables not yet due   | 69,740 | -11        | 69,728 |  | 71,472 | -41        | 71,430 |  |\n| Up to 30 days overdue     | 10,596 | -1         | 10,595 |  | 12,884 | -134       | 12,750 |  |\n| 30 to 90 days overdue     | 5,100  | -5         | 5,095  |  | 2,995  | -44        | 2,951  |  |\n| More than 90 days overdue | 1,486  | -831       | 656    |  | 2,688  | -959       | 1,730  |  |\n| Total                     | 86,922 | -848       | 86,074 |  | 90,039 | -1,178     | 88,861 |  |\n\nInternal measurement guidelines are used to assess creditworthiness. When determining the extent of the impairment need, the Semperit Group assesses the defaults from the past four years by business and country groups and uses this analysis to create an impairment matrix based on time ranges.This impairment matrix is updated to include forward-looking macroeconomic variables. Payment defaults for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 as forecast by the credit insurer Allianz Trade were also taken into consideration in the calculation of the impairment matrix. The analysis of the past did not identify an elevated default risk for receivables that are overdue by more than 90 days. As a result, the Group does not deem overdue status of more than 90 days to be an indicator that a loss event has occurred, which would imply an allocation to stage 3 of the impairment model according to IFRS 9. Loss events are, for example, a significant downgrade of creditworthiness by credit rating agencies, the commissioning of collection services, or the insolvency of the customer.\n\nAs of the reporting date, the newly acquired subsidiaries belonging to the Rico business had not yet been integrated into the Semperit Group's credit insurance regime. Credit insurance, bank guarantees, secure payment terms, and bank acceptance drafts are in place for a significant portion of the remaining gross trade receivables (90.3% and 77.2%, including the Rico Group; previous year: 92.8%). The credit insurances include a deductible if a loss occurs. The maximum loss allowance recognized for a credit loss is the insurance deductible for these receivables. In the case of payments from credit insurance, the insured receivable is derecognized in accordance with the payment amount under other operating expenses. The payments from the credit insurance are presented in other operating income.\n\nReceivables not covered by credit insurance, or deductibles for receivables covered by credit insurance, are written down based on empirical values in accordance with the default risk categories in the impairment matrix (stage 2 of the impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9). Receivables allocated to stage 3 of the impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 based on an individual assessment of the creditworthiness of the relevant customers are also written down to the expected recoverable amount.\n\nWith the exception of the newly acquired subsidiaries belonging to the Rico business, the overdue receivables are essentially covered by credit insurance, as all subsidiaries with significant receivables hold credit insurance. With respect to the receivables not covered by credit insurance and to the deductibles for receivables covered by credit insurance, there is no significant concentration of credit risk as the customers are widely dispersed.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe impairment losses in level 2 amounting to EUR 101 thousand (previous year: EUR 22 thousand) are based on the following impairment matrix:\n\n### 12.31.2023\n\n|          | Not overdue | 1–30 days  | 31–90 days | >90 days   |\n|----------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Hoses    | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.01% | 0.00–0.17% | 0.00–0.14% |\n| Profiles | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.34% | 0.00–3.10% | 0.00–2.65% |\n| Form     | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.03% | 0.00–0.30% | 0.00–0.81% |\n| Belting  | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.07% | 0.00–0.20% | 0.00–0.06% |\n| Surgical | 0.00–0.00%  | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% |\n| Rico     | 0.00–0.00%  | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.07% | 0.00–0.30% |\n\n### 12.31.2022\n\n|          | Not overdue | 1–30 days  | 31–90 days | >90 days   |\n|----------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Hoses    | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.03% | 0.00–0.29% | 0.00–0.42% |\n| Profiles | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.27% | 0.00–2.50% | 0.00–2.14% |\n| Form     | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.05% | 0.00–0.44% | 0.00–1.18% |\n| Belting  | 0.00–0.01%  | 0.00–0.05% | 0.00–0.10% | 0.00–0.03% |\n| Surgical | 0.00–0.00%  | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% | 0.00–0.00% |\n| Rico     | n.a.        | n.a.       | n.a.       | n.a.       |\n\nThe ranges arise from the geographic regions where the revenue is generated.

In fiscal year 2023, trade receivables of EUR 429 thousand (previous year: EUR 194 thousand), which were not written down, were derecognized.\n\n### 4.3. Trade payables\n\nTrade payables must be allocated to the AC (atcost) measurement category in accordance with IFRS 9 and are therefore measured at cost.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of current and non-current trade payables totaled EUR 69,187 thousand (previous year:EUR 63,942 thousand).\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-139-0\"></span>5. Equity\n\n### 5.1. Share capital and reserves\n\n### Share capital\n\nThe share capital of SAG as at December 31, 2023 remained unchanged compared to the previous year at EUR 21,359 thousand. This is broken down into 20,573,434 fully paid-in no-par value ordinary shares of which each has an equal participation in the share capital. Each share is entitled to a voting right and to receive a dividend.\n\nThe Executive Board was authorized by the Annual General Meeting on April 25, 2023 with the agreement of the Supervisory Board to increase the share capital by 50% or up to 10,286,716 new no-par-value shares over the next five years following registration of the change to the Articles of Incorporation on the Company Register, through cash and/or non-cash contributions. The Executive Board was also authorized to issue convertible bonds with agreement from the Supervisory Board. This may be linked to a right of conversion or purchase or a mandatory conversion or purchase of up to 10,286,716 no-par-value shares (50% of the existing shares) in the company.\n\nThe Executive Board was authorized by the Annual General Meeting on July 27, 2022 to buy back and, if necessary, to redeem the company's treasury shares up to the legally permissible amount of 10% of the share capital for a period of 30 months from the date that the resolution was passed in the Annual General Meeting pursuant to Section 65(1) No. 8 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG) with agreement from the Supervisory Board. At the same Annual General Meeting, the Executive Board was also authorized, pursuant to Section 65(1b) Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to decide on a different type of sale than via the stock exchange or through a public offering, and to decide on an exclusion of the buyback option (purchase right) on the part of shareholders. There is currently no share buyback program.\n\n### Capital reserves\n\nThe capital reserves result primarily from the amount generated beyond the proportional amount of the share capital following the issue of shares (share premium). Capital reserves also include EUR 21,503 thousand in appropriated reserves as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 21,503 thousand). These may only be released to offset any net loss otherwise stated in the SAG annual financial statements under corporate law, unless there are any free reserves available to cover such a loss.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Revenue reserves\n\nRevenue reserves contain the retained results of the Semperit Group and the accumulated other comprehensive income (excluding currency translation differences).\n\nThe distribution of revenue reserves is as follows:\n\n### Revenue reserves\n\n|                            | Retained<br>earnings | IAS-19-<br>reserve | Total   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|---------|\n| in TEUR                    |                      |                    |         |\n| Balance as at 01.01.2022   | 526,990              | -14,774            | 512,216 |\n| Earnings after taxes       | -5,529               | 0                  | -5,529  |\n| Other comprehensive income |                      | 6,309              | 6,309   |\n| Total comprehensive income | -5,529               | 6,309              | 780     |\n| Dividend                   | -30,860              | 0                  | -30,860 |\n| Balance as at 12.31.2022   | 490,601              | -8,464             | 482,136 |\n| Balance as at 01.01.2023   | 490,601              | -8,464             | 482,136 |\n| Earnings after taxes       | -16,807              | 0                  | -16,807 |\n| Other comprehensive income |                      | -1,195             | -1,195  |\n| Total comprehensive income | -16,807              | -1,195             | -18,002 |\n| Dividend                   | -92,580              | 0                  | -92,580 |\n| Balance as at 12.31.2023   | 381,213              | -9,659             | 371,554 |\n\nRevenue reserves include, inter alia, the SAG statutory reserve of EUR 999 thousand (previous year: EUR 999 thousand), which may only be released to offset any net loss otherwise stated in the annual financial statements under corporate law. The fact that free reserves are available to offset the loss is no obstacle to the release for the purposes of offsetting the loss.\n\nThe IAS 19 reserve includes the effects of remeasurements of defined benefit plans due to severance payments and pensions.\n\n### Currency translation reserve\n\nThe currency translation reserve records translation differences resulting from converting the subsidiaries' financial statements from their functional currency to euros until the subsidiaries in question are sold or disposed of by other means.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, currency differences totaled EUR 17,662 thousand (previous year: EUR 8,137 thousand). Of this amount, EUR 23,541 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand) was reclassified, i.e., \"recycled\" to the consolidated income statement in fiscal year 2023. Hence other comprehensive income as at December 31, 2023 that will be recognized through profit or loss in future periods totaled EUR 10,891 thousand (previous year: EUR –6,825 thousand).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 5.2. Non-controlling interests\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, all non-controlling interests related to discontinued operations, namely Latexx Partners Berhad (LPB, Group share: 97.36%) and FormTech Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd (FTE, Group share: 69.88%). Both subsidiaries were deconsolidated on the occasion of the (first) closing of the sale of the Medical Sector. No dividends were distributed to the non-controlling interests in fiscal year 2023 (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\n### 5.3. Dividends and treasury shares\n\nThe shareholders are entitled to a distribution of SAG's net profit for the year. The Executive Board proposes a dividend of EUR 0.50 per share, meaning a total of EUR 10,287 thousand, which is still to be approved at the Annual General meeting and is therefore not yet recognized.\n\nDistributions for fiscal year 2022 were made in May and September 2023 and totaled EUR 92,580 thousand. A basic dividend of EUR 1.50 per share was paid in May 2023, and an additional dividend of EUR 3.00 per share was paid in September 2023.\n\nThe Semperit Group did not hold any own shares as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022 .\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-142-0\"></span>6. Net debt\n\nThe net debt of EUR 192,411 thousand (previous year: EUR –9,243 thousand) is made up of the liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests, financial liabilities, and other financial liabilities, less other financial assets (current), and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### 6.1. Liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests\n\n<span id=\"page-142-1\"></span>Shares of subsidiaries' net assets held by non-controlling shareholders are recognized as liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests if the respective shareholder has an unconditional termination right or a termination right linked to conditions whose fulfilment or non-fulfilment lies outside the control of the Semperit Group, or if the company in which the non-controlling shareholder owns an interest has a limited life span.\n\nThe liability was initially recognized at fair value. As IFRS do not provide any guidance on the subsequent measurement of such an obligation, the amount of the liability initially recognized is increased by the share in profit or reduced by the share in loss accruing at the measurement date in accordance with the option described in the statement issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW RS HFA 45). In this connection, this share of profit or loss also includes the share in other comprehensive income. In addition, any amounts reported directly in equity are included in the measurement of the liability. Dividends distributed to non-controlling shareholders reduce the liabilities. The amounts recognized as part of the subsequent measurement are recognized in the consolidated income statement and constitute finance expenses. This is disclosed separately as results attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.\n\nThe pro-rata cash flows relevant to measurement were derived from the latest medium-term financial planning to determine the fair value (stage 3) of the redeemable non-controlling interests of SAC, Thailand. The detailed planning period runs until the end of fiscal year 2028. The pro-rata cash flows relevant to measurement after fiscal year 2029 were extrapolated based on a sustainable growth rate of 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%). The growth rate reflected the competition and the price pressure in the market as well as an assumption of moderate market growth. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was determined as the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model. The after-tax discount rate is 9.8% (previous year: 10.5%). The main assumptions used in determining the fair value relate in particular to the market-dependent future development of the EBITDA margin.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nLiabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests changed as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying amount 01.01.                       | 18,907 | 17,536 |\n| Dividends                                    | −6,482 | −5,705 |\n| Share of annual income after tax             | 2,892  | 6,684  |\n| Currency translation differences             | −592   | 392    |\n| Carrying amount 31.12.                       | 14,725 | 18,907 |\n| thereof Semperflex Asia Corp.

Financial liabilities\n\nBoth corporate Schuldschein loans and liabilities to banks are initially recognized at their fair value net of transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost in accordance with the effective interest method.\n\nThey are derecognized if and when the underlying obligation is settled or terminated or has expired.\n\n| in EUR thousand             | 12.31.2023 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current | 12.31.2022 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | 38,392     | 37,970                 | 422                | 52,457     | 37,956                 | 14,501             |\n| Liabilities to banks        | 189,430    | 181,196                | 8,235              | 3          | 0                      | 3                  |\n| Total                       | 227,822    | 219,165                | 8,657              | 52,460     | 37,956                 | 14,503             |\n\n### Corporate Schuldschein loans\n\nBetween 2013 and 2016, SAG issued several corporate Schuldschein loans, some with fixed and some with variable-interest rates, in euros (EUR) as well as in the foreign currencies US dollars (USD), Polish zloty (PLN), and Czech crown (CZK).

Disclosures on financial instruments – liabilities\n\n<sup>1</sup> FVPL (at fair value through profit and loss); AC (at amortized cost).\n\n### Liabilities at fair value\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used in isolated cases to hedge against interest rate risks. The derivative financial instruments are accounted for either as cash flow hedges or as fair value hedges, provided both the prospective effectiveness measurements under IFRS 9 are carried out and the hedging strategy documentation requirements are met. There were no derivatives designated as hedging instruments, neither as at 31 December 2023 nor as at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe financial instruments measured at fair value are derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments on December 31, 2023 relate to a contingent purchase price liability from the M+R acquisition on January 4, 2021 (see section 6.3).\n\nThe fair values of the foreign exchange forward contracts are determined using accepted actuarial measurement models. Future payment flows are simulated using the yield curves published on the reporting date. In addition, the carrying amount is adjusted to take into account the credit risk of the respective counterparty. When doing so, positive exposures are measured considering the default risk of the counterparty, while negative exposures are measured considering the Group's own default risk. The contingent purchase price liability is calculated using the future development of the business activities of M+R and is discounted at a customary market cost of equity. It is measured at fair value through profit or loss and reported as a derivative in other non-current financial liabilities.\n\n### Liabilities at amortized cost\n\nThe fair values correspond to the carrying amounts for all financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of those stated below and the liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests (see section [6.1](#page-142-1)). Actuarial measurement models are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which no active market is available. The parameters relevant to measurement for determining fair value are based in part on forward-looking assumptions.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand             | Measurement<br>category<br>according<br>IFRS 91 | Level | Fair value<br>12.31.2023 | Fair value<br>12.31.2022 |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Liabilities                 |                                                 |       |                          |                          |\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | AC                                              | 3     | 37,445                   | 50,052                   |\n| Liabilities to banks        | AC                                              | 3     | 190,771                  | 3                        |\n\n<sup>1</sup> AC (at amortized cost)\n\nThe fair value of the corporate Schuldschein loans and fixed-interest bank financing was determined by discounting the contractual payment streams with current interest rates. The comparable interest rates on the reporting date were derived from capital market yields with matching terms and then adjusted for current risk and liquidity costs that are observable on the market, and determined in a range of 1.68–5.81% (previous year: 3.41–8.47%). These comparable interest rates were derived based on management's current assessment of the rating of the Semperit Group using a Moody's methodology.. The difference between the carrying amount and the fair value is the result of the significant volatility in the banks' refinancing costs (as part of the cost of corporate financing through banks) since the corporate Schuldschein loans were issued due to the measures taken by the European Central Bank (ECB), such as medium-term refinancing tenders for banks at extremely low interest rates and the ECB's quantitative easing measures, which led to considerably volatile risk premiums. In addition, several clauses in the corporate Schuldschein loan contract are worded in the Semperit Group's favor. For variable-interest bank financing, fair value is the carrying amount.\n\n### <span id=\"page-148-0\"></span>6.5.

Cash and cash equivalents\n\n| in EUR thousand        | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash on hand           | 15         | 7          |\n| Cash deposits in banks | 101,299    | 80,898     |\n| Short-term deposits    | 11,357     | 25,727     |\n| Total                  | 112,671    | 106,631    |\n\nShort-term investments are cash equivalents and consist of fixed-time deposits with a remaining term of no more than three months from the date of acquisition amounting to EUR 9,205 thousand (previous year: EUR 22,940 thousand) and of money market fund units of EUR 2,152 thousand (previous year: EUR 2,787 thousand). The fixed-time deposits are comprised of EUR 750 thousand in euros (previous year: EUR 20,000 thousand), EUR 4,896 thousand in Indian rupees (INR) (previous year: EUR 2,722 thousand), EUR 318 thousand in Chinese renminbi (CNY) (previous year: EUR 217 thousand), and EUR 3,240 thousand in Swiss francs (CHF) (previous year: EUR 0 thousand). These items enable the Semperit Group to meet short-term payment obligations and minimize the interest rate risk. As a result, they are not typically held for investment or other purposes.\n\nThe assessment of whether money market fund units are to be classified as cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7 requires discretionary judgment. Cash equivalents refer to short-term, highly liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are only subject to immaterial risks of fluctuations in terms of their value; equity investments are generally not classified as cash equivalents, unless they are such investments by their very nature. The investments made by the Semperit Group in the CIFM RMB money market funds were classified as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. This classification was based on an analysis of the fund characteristics and their integration into the Semperit Group's cash management or liquidity management. An assessment of whether the financial investment is highly liquid or not took into account the redemption options and the fund's liquidity. Given that classification as cash equivalents also requires the financial investment to be able to be converted directly into a payment amount already determined when the deposit is made, money market fund units cannot be classified as cash equivalents on their own as they can be traded at any time on an active market at the respective market price. As for assessing the immateriality of risks of fluctuations in terms of their value, the Semperit Group is continuously analyzing whether the variability of returns is small and comparable to the variability of returns for the money market interest rate, the \"PBOC (People's Bank of China) 7 Days Deposit Rate\". This assessment also takes into account the fund's rigorous investment policy, the weighted average fixed-interest period of the fund portfolio (well below three months), the fund's risk and volatility exposure, and its high diversification and issuer spread along with the fund's strong credit rating. The money market fund units are an integral part of the Semperit Group's payment and liquidity management measures.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 7. Provisions\n\n### <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>7.1. Retirement benefit expenses, provisions for pensions and severance payments\n\n### Retirement benefit plans – defined benefit plans\n\nIn the case of defined benefit plans, the cost of providing the benefit is calculated using the projected unit credit method (PUC); for this purpose, an actuarial assessment is carried out at each reporting date. All remeasurement results of plan assets and obligations, especially actuarial gains and losses, are reported directly in equity under other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe provision recognized in the balance sheet for defined benefit plans equals the present value of the benefits accruing to the employees on the reporting date, less the fair value of any plan assets required to settle the obligation as at the reporting date.\n\n### Pension commitments\n\nBased on an existing SAG and STP pension statute, company pensions are granted to employees who joined the company before January 1, 1991 in the form of a fixed amount, with this amount being dependent on the relevant employee's number of years of service. The statute stipulates that only retired former employees or their surviving dependents are now entitled to these pensions. The obligations of this statute are not funded by plan assets.\n\nA number of former members of the Executive Board have been granted pensions under individual pension agreements. These liabilities are not covered by pension plan assets either.\n\n### Severance payment commitments\n\nDepending on their length of service, most employees in Austria, France, India, Poland, Switzerland, and Thailand are legally entitled to a one-off payment, particularly on retirement.\n\nThe benefits due on retirement are considered to be payments due following termination of the employment relationship in accordance with IAS 19. These liabilities are not funded by plan assets.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Overview of the carrying amounts of the pension and severance payment provisions\n\nThe carrying amounts of pension and severance payment provisions are distributed across the individual countries as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                      | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Austria – pensions                   | 9,964      | 9,819      |\n| Austria – severance payments         | 12,948     | 12,913     |\n| Germany – pensions                   | 2,035      | 2,099      |\n| Switzerland – pensions               | 424        | 0          |\n| Other countries – severance payments |            |            |\n| France                               | 1,055      | 953        |\n| Switzerland                          | 211        | 0          |\n| Poland                               | 182        | 130        |\n| India                                | 157        | 148        |\n| Thailand                             | 565        | 578        |\n| Total                                | 27,542     | 26,641     |\n\n### Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe most important actuarial parameters for the defined benefit pension and severance payment plans are as follows.

Sensitivities were determined based on the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the provisions for pensions and severance payments, with one parameter changing in each case. The other parameters remained unchanged. If the change of the parameter results in a negative interest rate, then this is used for the calculation.\n\nThe impact of changes to these parameters – plus/minus one percentage point with regard to the interest rate and increases in wages and salaries, and plus/minus one year with regard to life expectancy – on the present value of pension obligations of EUR 18,359 thousand (previous year: EUR 11,999 thousand) and on the present value of severance payment liabilities of EUR 15,118 thousand (previous year: EUR 14,722 thousand) were as follows:\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nPresent value of obligation\n\n|                       |                        | (DBO) 12.31.2023         |                          | (DBO) 12.31.2022         |                          |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| in EUR thousand       | Change in parameter    | Increase in<br>parameter | Decrease in<br>parameter | Increase in<br>parameter | Decrease in<br>parameter |\n| Pensions              |                        |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Interest rate         | +/- 1 percentage point | 11,238                   | 14,295                   | 11,173                   | 12,952                   |\n| Increases in salaries | +/- 1 percentage point | 13,343                   | 11,757                   | 12,749                   | 11,343                   |\n| Life expectancy       | +/- 1 year             | 13,062                   | 11,965                   | 12,530                   | 11,485                   |\n| Severance payments    |                        |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Interest rate         | +/- 1 percentage point | 13,745                   | 16,400                   | 13,564                   | 16,041                   |\n| Increases in salaries | +/- 1 percentage point | 16,073                   | 14,087                   | 15,948                   | 13,628                   |\n\nPresent value of obligation\n\n### Retirement benefit plans – defined contribution plans\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense if the employees have actually completed the service obliging the company to make this contribution.\n\nSAG is required to contribute to a pension fund for all current members of the Executive Board. An amount fixed by contract is paid into a pension fund (APK Pensionskasse AG) each year. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 163 thousand (previous year: EUR 135 thousand).\n\nOne former member of the Executive Board and selected executives were granted pensions in the past that are covered by reinsurance policies with Generali Versicherung AG, with the pension entitlement matching the amount covered by the reinsurance. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 103 thousand (previous year: EUR 116 thousand).\n\nEmployees whose employment is subject to Austrian law and who entered into this employment relationship after December 31, 2002 are not entitled to severance payments from their employer. For these employees and all current members of the Executive Board, contributions amounting to 1.53% (previous year: 1.53%) of their wages or salaries were paid into a staff pension fund. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 895 thousand (previous year: EUR 852 thousand).\n\nFor employees in Singapore, contributions equivalent to a fixed percentage of the annual salary are paid into a pension fund. In fiscal year 2023, the expense for these contributions totaled EUR 105 thousand (previous year: EUR 72 thousand).\n\nSemperit Group employees are also entitled to country-specific state pension plans, which are usually financed on a pay-as-you-go (unfunded) basis. The obligations of the Semperit Group are limited to paying contributions when they are due. There is no legal or de facto obligation with regard to future benefits.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 7.2. Other provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized at the present value of the expected settlement amount based on management's best possible estimate of the uncertain obligation. This is done by taking account of unavoidable risks and uncertainties associated with a large number of events and scenarios as well as future events, insofar as there exist sufficient objective and substantial indications of their occurrence. However, discounting takes place only if the interest effect is material.\n\nIf it can be assumed that the amount required to settle the obligation will be completely or partially reimbursed by a third party, this reimbursement claim is recognized if and to the extent that it is virtually certain that such reimbursement will be received and the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nThe timings of the expected payment flows from other provisions (except anniversary bonuses) largely reflect the maturities outlined below.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the other provisions are as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                        | 12.31.2023 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current | 12.31.2022 | Thereof<br>non-current | Thereof<br>current |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Bonuses and other personnel provisions | 11,242     | 689                    | 10,554             | 13,419     | 470                    | 12,949             |\n| Guarantees                             | 7,579      | 0                      | 7,579              | 5,015      | 1                      | 5,015              |\n| Anniversary bonuses                    | 4,484      | 3,959                  | 525                | 3,342      | 2,882                  | 460                |\n| Miscellaneous                          | 8,161      | 4,825                  | 3,336              | 7,158      | 4,467                  | 2,691              |\n| Total                                  | 31,467     | 9,473                  | 21,994             | 28,935     | 7,820                  | 21,115             |\n\nThe other provisions changed as follows:\n\n| in EUR thousand                           | 01.01.2023 | Additions<br>due to<br>business<br>acquisitions | Additions | Currency<br>differences | Release | Use     | 12.31.2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Bonuses and other personnel<br>provisions | 13,419     | 5,371                                           | 12,047    | 10                      | -1,789  | -17,816 | 11,242     |\n| Guarantees                                | 5,015      | 253                                             | 7,733     | 220                     | -4,310  | -1,333  | 7,579      |\n| Anniversary bonuses                       | 3,342      | 842                                             | 907       | 1                       | -21     | -587    | 4,484      |\n| Miscellaneous                             | 7,158      | 695                                             | 1,675     | 280                     | -663    | -984    | 8,161      |\n| Total                                     | 28,935     | 7,161                                           | 22,362    | 510                     | -6,782  | -20,720 | 31,467     |\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Anniversary bonuses\n\nProvisions for anniversary bonuses are calculated using the PUC method in accordance with IAS 19, based on an actuarial assessment. Remeasurements (actuarial gains and losses) are recognized as personnel expenses in profit or loss for the period.\n\nProvisions for anniversary bonuses are established for employees in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic, whose entitlement to them is based on collective bargaining agreements. They are measured based on the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the provisions for pensions and severance payments.\n\nUndiscounted cash flows arise for the provision of anniversary bonuses as at December 31, 2023 of EUR 525 thousand (previous year: EUR 460 thousand) within one year and EUR 4,332 thousand (previous year: EUR 2,784 thousand) for up to ten years.\n\nThe average weighted duration of the present value of the anniversary bonus obligations is around 8 years (previous year: around 8 years). Sensitivity analyses were performed regarding the effect of significant actuarial parameters (interest rate, wage and salary increases). These resulted in the following effects on the present value of the provisions for anniversary bonuses:\n\n|                       |                        | Present value of obligation<br>(DBO) 12.31.2023 |                          | Present value of obligation<br>(DBO) 12.31.2022 |                          |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| in EUR thousand       | Change in parameter    | Increase in<br>parameter                        | Decrease in<br>parameter | Increase in<br>parameter                        | Decrease in<br>parameter |\n| Interest rate         | +/- 1 percentage point | 4,162                                           | 4,859                    | 3,112                                           | 3,609                    |\n| Increases in salaries | +/- 1 percentage point | 4,780                                           | 4,222                    | 3,558                                           | 3,153                    |\n\n### Guarantees\n\nThe provisions for guarantees are based largely on case-by-case assessments of the guarantee risks; guarantee provisions that are allocated on a portfolio basis derived from experience are of minor importance in the Semperit Group. Since guarantee claims may involve lengthy negotiations as well as legal proceedings, it is not possible to accurately predict when payments will actually have to be made.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Bonuses and other personnel provisions\n\nThe provisions for bonuses paid to employees (as per the Semperit Group Bonus Policy), managers (also as per a Long-term Incentive Plan based on long-term performance bonuses for the Executive Board), and Executive Board members (as per the remuneration policy) are recognized at the bestpossible estimated settlement amounts. The estimated settlement amounts take into consideration the expected achievements of Group targets as well as the current results from the performance evaluation. Long-term performance bonuses are distributed over several periods and accumulated; the anticipated vesting of the claims determines the end of the accumulation period. Due to a lack of materiality, there is no discounting of the long-term performance bonuses. Local bonus agreements also exist for employees and management staff, which provisions are also recognized for on the basis of the individually estimated and anticipated achievement of targets.\n\n### Other provisions\n\nThe remaining other provisions include a provision for tax proceedings relating to transaction taxes in Brazil in respect of the assessment years 2008–2010 in the amount of EUR 3,571 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,150 thousand). The duty (PIS/COFINS) is levied on the import and resale of goods in Brazil. A security was deposited in the 2017 financial year in connection with the resale PIS/COFINS to ensure that the case would continue through the relevant court system after appeals in the administrative proceedings were unsuccessful. As before, the provision in the amount of EUR 3,571 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,150 thousand) ) is offset by a corresponding demand for reimbursement of the security deposited with the civil court. For the assessment years 2011 and 2012, management is assuming that the period of limitation has expired.\n\nIn the case of disputed charges (including any interest on arrears) for the disposal of raw materials imported into Poland, there is a provision amounting to EUR 1,430 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,064 thousand). Furthermore, an environmental reserve of EUR 863 thousand (previous year: EUR 945 thousand) exists for a soil treatment obligation with a Polish subsidiary.\n\nOne subsidiary is involved in competition law proceedings. These lengthy proceedings are currently at a stage where the outcome is highly uncertain. The case is being heard before the authorities in consultation with local specialists, and the subsidiary in question is cooperating with the competent authorities and providing all the necessary assistance. For the anticipated costs and the associated risk, a provision in the most likely amount has been recognized in line with an assessment made by the Semperit Group. The amount is reviewed periodically in order to determine if it needs to be adjusted.\n\nDetailed information on the specific financial impact would seriously weaken the position of the Semperit Group in asserting its interests in current legal proceedings and is therefore omitted pursuant to IAS 37.92.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-160-0\"></span>8.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities of the same taxable entity are offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and there is a right to offset current tax liabilities against current reimbursement claims. The corporate group formed in Austria in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) is deemed to constitute a taxable entity for this purpose. In Germany, a corporate tax group exists between Semperit Profiles Deggendorf GmbH and Semperit Profiles Leeser GmbH. Deferred tax assets recognized more than five years in the past were written down.\n\nOf the loss allowances for deferred tax assets on temporary differences and loss carryforwards, a total of EUR 19,412 thousand (previous year: EUR 32,346 thousand) is related to the group of companies in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG), whose parent company is SAG. Due to the Austrian tax group's history of losses in the recent past, there are stringent IFRS requirements for reliable tax planning. The recognition of deferred tax assets (not covered by deferred tax liabilities) on temporary differences and loss carryforwards requires additional substantial evidence that, in the upcoming fiscal years, tax results will be generated that can be used for future tax relief. In view of the Austrian tax group's history of losses in the recent past and the uncertainties that exist primarily due to the slowing down of the economy and geopolitical crises, the Group's deferred tax assets are not eligible for recognition pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) on the basis of future taxable income. The acquisition of the Rico Group gives SAG management the option of including three additional Austrian subsidiaries in the Group in accordance with Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG). The application to join the Group pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) was submitted in February 2024 (see section 12.3). Taking the loss carryforward limit into account, this makes it possible to offset portions of the deferred tax liabilities that arose in particular from the purchase price allocation at RICO Group GmbH, RICO-Elastomere Projecting GmbH, and Härtereitechnik Rosenblatt GmbH with \n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\ndeferred tax assets on SAG's loss carryforwards. As a result, the loss allowance for deferred tax assets in the Group pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) was reduced by EUR 12,861 thousand. The remaining change in the loss allowance for deferred tax assets in Austria essentially applies to the loss allowance for non-current deferred tax assets.\n\nThe net amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities has changed by EUR 15,098 thousand. Of this amount, EUR –10,049 thousand was recognized as tax income (of which continuing operations: tax income of EUR –10,139 thousand; of which discontinued operations: tax expense of EUR 90 thousand), EUR –886 thousand as income taxes attributable to other comprehensive income from the remeasurement of performance-based plans, EUR –138 thousand related to the currency conversion of deferred tax from functional currency into the reporting currency, and EUR 26,175 thousand from business sales and acquisitions.\n\nAs at the reporting date, there were deductible temporary differences of EUR 10,419 thousand (previous year: EUR 21,561 thousand) as well as tax loss carryforwards of EUR 102,608 thousand (previous year: EUR 145,221 thousand) and unused tax credits of EUR 29,842 thousand (previous year: EUR 30,249 thousand) for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized. Of these unused tax losses and tax credits, EUR 17,887 thousand (previous year: EUR 11,924 thousand) expires within the next five years and EUR 26,463 thousand (previous year: EUR 27,943 thousand) within the next seven years. The major part of the remaining tax losses and deductible temporary differences can be carried forward without limit.\n\nIn the fiscal year, the surplus of deferred tax assets of EUR 3,254 thousand (previous year: EUR 4,302 thousand) is accounted for in tax jurisdictions with tax losses. Of this amount, EUR 3,218 thousand (previous year: EUR 3,924 thousand) relates to the German organization. The tax loss for the previous year resulted from impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. The other deferred tax assets of EUR 36 thousand relate to France.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities of EUR 29,146 thousand (previous year: EUR 42,263 thousand) were not recognized for taxable temporary differences of EUR 128,953 thousand (previous year: EUR 178,742 thousand) in connection with interests in subsidiaries as the parent is able to control when the temporary difference is reversed, and it is likely that the temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. There were also deductible temporary differences in the amount of EUR 4,001 thousand (previous year: EUR 4,218 thousand) for which deferred tax assets of EUR 920 thousand (previous year: EUR 116 thousand) were not recognized as it is unlikely that the temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Rules were published as part of the Framework for International Minimum Taxation. Directive 2022/2523 was finally adopted in December 2022 to implement the Directive within the EU Member States.\n\nThe Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (Mindestbesteuerungsgesetz, MinBestG), which entered into force in Austria on December 31, 2023, transposed the OECD Model Rules and the corresponding EU Directive on ensuring a minimum level of taxation for corporate groups (Pillar Two) into Austrian law. The Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (MinBestG) shall apply to the fiscal years beginning on December 31, 2023. B&C Privatstiftung, based in Vienna, is the ultimate parent company of the Semperit Group and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (MinBestG). Consequently, any additional taxes due to exceeding the legally enshrined turnover limits will have to be determined in future.\n\nIn some countries in which the Semperit Group operates, it is still unclear whether and when implementation will take place (e.g., the United States). The legal status of each jurisdiction is relevant to assessing a potential tax burden at the level of the ultimate parent company or other Group companies. Failure to comply with the minimum tax rate of 15% may result in the income inclusion rule \n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n(IIR) being applied in Austria, in the absence of a recognized national undertaxed profit rule (UTPR) being applied in that country.\n\nAn evaluation of the effects of the new minimum taxation rules for the Semperit Group as a subgroup of the B&C Group was conducted based on the CbCR values as at December 31, 2022. From today's perspective, given both the temporary safe harbor regulations and the minimum tax calculation, a stand-alone analysis of the Semperit Group's \"subgroup\" shows that neither the 2023 nor the 2024 fiscal year will have any material effects on the recognition and measurement of tax receivables and liabilities.\n\nThe new, mandatory exception to the accounting treatment of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the introduction of the Austrian Minimum Taxation Act (MinBestG) and/or comparable foreign tax laws was applied by the Semperit Group. Current taxes resulting from the implementation of Austrian and/or similar foreign tax laws were not recognized as at December 31, 2023 due to the lack of applicability.\n\n### Receivables from current income taxes\n\nReceivables from current income taxes result from refundable advance payments, in particular from SFO in the amount of EUR 2,496 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\n### <span id=\"page-165-0\"></span>10.

The Semperit Group's management has conducted and continues to conduct ongoing analysis of the subsidiary in order to determine whether control exists within the meaning of IFRS 10 and if consolidation would therefore be justified. On the basis of past and current analyses, the management of the Semperit Group remained, as at December 31, 2023, of the opinion that SAC should be incorporated into the consolidated financial statements of the Semperit Group as a consolidated subsidiary. This discretionary decision is based on the underlying contracts, an investigation of the relevant activities, and the facts and circumstances. The following points were evaluated:\n\n- The Chairman of the Board of Directors, who is appointed by the Semperit Group, has a casting vote.\n- The Semperit Group has a call option for the remaining 50% of shares in the Sri Trang Group, which can be exercised at a fixed price until mid-2026.\n- Purchasing, production, and sales are managed by the Semperit Industrial Applications division's management.\n- Two positions were established for local employees to implement the Semperit Group's right of control.\n- As at the reporting date, there were no indications of the Sri Trang Group effectively restricting the Semperit Group's exercise of control.\n\nNo significant non-controlling interests existed for the Semperit Group (see section 5.3). The minority interests in SAC were shown as redeemable non-controlling interests in the liabilities from redeemable non-controlling interests (see section [6.1](#page-142-1)).\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-170-0\"></span>11. Risk management\n\nAs a group with international operations, the Semperit Group is continuously confronted with new challenges resulting from global economic developments and their strong regional variations. The Semperit Group operates in countries with different economic framework conditions. In addition, these countries are going through different stages of political, constitutional, and social development. On account of the differences in their strategic orientation, the success of the Semperit Group's two divisions is dependent on the overall economic environment to varying degrees. As a result, the Semperit Group is exposed to risks.\n\nDue to its involvement in international trading activities in various foreign currencies, the Semperit Group is exposed to currency risks.\n\nIn principle, derivative financial instruments and natural hedges are used in the Semperit Group to hedge currency and interest rate risks. The risk management strategy aimed at hedging currency and interest rate risks is applied to individual cases and specific projects in both the long and short term. Cost-benefit/risk considerations play a decisive role here. . In part, currency risks arising for example from expected customer, investment, and dividend payments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are accounted for as freestanding derivatives.\n\n### 11.1. Capital risk management\n\nThe objectives of capital management are to ensure the company's ability to continue as a going concern, to enable growth-oriented organic and non-organic investment activities as necessary, and to allow for a compatible dividend policy. The financing structure, liquidity, and finance risk positions are managed centrally by the Semperit Group. Based on capital market principles, the long-term capital management additionally includes decisions regarding fixed or variable-interest borrowing and hybrid borrowing.\n\nIn connection with loan agreements, standard credit agreement clauses (financial covenants) exist that include termination by investors in case of non-compliance as well as adeterioration of agency credit ratings for the Semperit Group, which could therefore result in a potential negative effect on the company's financial position and financial performance, as well as credit agreement clauses (ESG key performance indicators) that may affect the rate of interest in the event of compliance or noncompliance.\n\nFrom a capital management perspective, the total capital of the Semperit Group consists of equity, including non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, redeemable non-controlling interests, and net financial debt defined in the financial covenants. Net financial debt of EUR 115,151 thousand (previous year: net financial surplus of EUR 54,171 thousand) corresponds to the sum of financial liabilities of EUR 227,822 thousand (previous year: EUR 52,460 thousand) from corporate Schuldschein loans and liabilities to banks less cash and cash equivalents of EUR 112,671 thousand (previous year: EUR 106,631 thousand).\n\nThe Semperit Group is not subject to any legal requirements with regard to minimum equity, minimum equity ratios, or maximum levels of gearing; however, it is subject to certain credit agreement stipulations. These relate to a maximum leverage ratio. This is the the quotient resulting from EBITDA and net financial debt. The Semperit Group should ensure that it does not exceed a leverage ratio of 3.5. A default would occur if a leverage ratio of 4.0 is exceeded twice. As at December 31, 2023, the leverage ratio is 1.6 (previous year: –0.6).\n\nSAG's new bank financing is variable interest and linked to the three-month EURIBOR. The newly concluded loan is due on March 31, 2028 and has an extension option of up to two years. The margins are linked to the leverage ratio (150 to 250 basis points if a leverage ratio of 3.5 is exceeded) and ESG key performance indicators (up to 6 basis points, see section 1.4). The general credit line has comparable terms and conditions in terms of the leverage ratio (120 to 220 basis points if a leverage \n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nratio of 3.5 is exceeded) and identical ESG key performance indicators. The bank financing of EUR 110,000 thousand for the new plant expansion in Odry, is linked to the one-month EURIBOR during the availability period (until September 30, 2025) and to the three-month EURIBOR from the first repayment date (December 31, 2025), plus a margin of 0.675%. This does not take any ESG key performance indicators into account and a default would occur in the same way as bank financing by SAG if a leverage ratio of 4.0 is exceeded twice.\n\nThe relevant financial covenants were complied with both as at December 31, 2023 and as at December 31, 2022.\n\n### 11.2. Liquidity risk management\n\nIn addition to continual liquidity planning, liquidity risk management also entails monitoring the applicable financial covenants as well as ensuring the availability of both drawdown options (from the framework credit agreement) and reserve liquidity. A cash pool in EUR is available for significant group companies.\n\nThe maturities of the undiscounted contractual cash flows from financial liabilities break down as follows:\n\n|                             | Total   | up to 1<br>month | 2 to 3<br>months | 4 to 12<br>months | 1 to 5<br>years | over 5<br>years |\n|-----------------------------|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| in EUR thousand             |         |                  |                  |                   |                 |                 |\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | 41,006  | 0                | 0                | 965               | 32,609          | 7,432           |\n| Liabilities to banks        | 230,307 | 342              | 936              | 15,392            | 180,623         | 33,014          |\n| Trade payables              | 66,510  | 46,539           | 17,265           | 1,855             | 851             | 0               |\n| Refund liabilities          | 1,280   | 4                | 110              | 1,165             | 0               | 0               |\n| Derivatives                 | 2,333   | 0                | 0                | 0                 | 2,333           | 0               |\n| Lease liabilities           | 67,046  | 541              | 1,171            | 5,052             | 20,673          | 39,609          |\n| Other financial liabilities | 12,265  | 5,226            | 1,140            | 476               | 4,843           | 581             |\n| Summe                       | 420,747 | 52,652           | 20,622           | 24,905            | 241,931         | 80,636          |\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand             | Total   | up to 1<br>month | 2 to 3<br>months | 4 to 12<br>months | 1 to 5<br>years | over 5<br>years |\n|-----------------------------|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Corporate Schuldschein loan | 56,269  | 0                | 0                | 15,261            | 32,927          | 8,082           |\n| Liabilities to banks        | 3       | 2                | 1                | 0                 | 0               | 0               |\n| Trade payables              | 63,942  | 42,580           | 16,427           | 4,882             | 52              | 0               |\n| Refund liabilities          | 867     | 7                | 15               | 845               | 0               | 0               |\n| Derivatives                 | 2,637   | 0                | 0                | 1                 | 2,636           | 0               |\n| Lease liabilities           | 22,368  | 309              | 602              | 2,603             | 9,846           | 9,009           |\n| Other financial liabilities | 5,734   | 4,090            | 1,298            | 196               | 150             | 0               |\n| Summe                       | 151,819 | 46,987           | 18,343           | 23,789            | 45,610          | 17,090          |\n\n12.31.2022\n\nA new EUR 100 million variable-interest general credit line was taken out in fiscal year 2023. This financing is provided by a consortium of six Austrian and international banks and replaces a previous general credit line of EUR 75 million. Please see section 11.1 for details on defined interest rate terms and the effect of defined ESG key performance indicators and leverage ratio on interest rates.\n\nThe Group Controlling department continually monitors compliance with the financial covenants associated with the financing operations and forecasts possible deviations in order to take timely risk minimization measures. In doing so, it proactively analyzes liquidity and cash flow trends to ensure that the agreed conditions are met and that potential financial shortfalls can be identified and addressed early on. In contrast to the newly concluded variable-interest bank financing, there is fixed interest on the existing corporate Schuldschein loans and some of the liabilities to banks. Please see section 6.2 for more details on maturities and interest rate terms.\n\nThe existing cash pool in EUR and the completion of the new factoring program on December 29, 2023 may improve the Semperit Group's liquidity. Please see section 4.2 for more details on the sale of receivables under the factoring program. The cash pool allows the businessesto optimally utilize liquidity surpluses, thereby helping to reduce financing costs, while the factoring program shortens the average receivable term and optimizes the liquidity position. These strategies, combined with a high level of trade receivables covered by credit insurance (see section 4.2), play a key role in protecting the Semperit Group from a potential liquidity shortfall and in maintaining financial stability. Individual interest rate strategies are continually reviewed, in particular by entering into fixed interest rate swaps and evaluating the refinancing of loans on the corporate Schuldschein loan market. These measures make it possible to actively manage interest rate risks and to benefit from favorable market conditions, which has a positive effect on the liquidity position.\n\nThe maturities of the undiscounted cash flows of the derivatives as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 mainly relate to the payment of a contingent purchase price liability (see section 6.3). The maturities of the undiscounted contractual cash flows from the liabilities to banks include the newly concluded loan for SAG of EUR 135,837 thousand, which is due on March 31, 2028, as well as the one for SFO of EUR 32,446 thousand, which will be repaid in 20 quarterly fixed installments starting on December 31, 2025, and the Rico Group's liabilities to banks of EUR 62,022 thousand, which are due from January 31, 2024 to July 31, 2030. SAG's loan is provided with an extension option of up to two years.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 11.3. Default and credit risk management\n\nCredit risks arise when products or goods manufactured in house are sold to customers on credit. The risk arises as soon as the Semperit Group no longer has access to the shipped products or goods; in the case of customized manufacturing, however, it begins even before production. A business partner check is performed for the customers and business information is obtained to minimize the risks. Customers undergo credit checks, first of all by means of credit reports, and the trade receivables are also protected to a very high degree by credit insurance in order to mitigate the risks.\n\nAccording to the Semperit Group's credit policy – it will also be applied in full to the newly acquired Rico Group from fiscal year 2024 onwards – every customer serviced by credit must have an approved credit limit. If limits are exceeded or payments delayed, deliveries are halted and only resumed after specific conditions have been met and the resumption of deliveries has been approved by authorized individuals specified in Semperit Group directives. Customer credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis and the credit limits adjusted accordingly, even for those customers with the best credit ratings.\n\nThe default risk associated with non-insured receivables from customers can therefore basically be considered minor, as customer creditworthiness is monitored continuously and the Group's diversified customer structure implies that risk is not concentrated with individual customers. However, the default risk is assumed to increase significantly if there are negative effects on credit ratings due to the occurrence of bankruptcy or the start of insolvency proceedings. Default is anticipated if recoverability is no longer seen as realistic and payment is therefore no longer expected. This resulted in write-offs of receivables of EUR 429 thousand in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 194 thousand).\n\nThe Semperit Group can be exposed to default risks relating to its bank deposits in the event that individual banks run into difficulties or another banking and/or financial crisis occurs. Such deposits are not or only partially secured by deposit protection funds. An investment guideline limits the amount of cash that may be held per bank and defines the financial instruments in which the excess liquidity may be invested. In case of bankruptcy of individual banks or occurrence of another bank and/or financial crisis, the Semperit Group might not be able to access this liquidity or these credit lines, or only partially or only with some delay. With regard to investments in quasi-liquidity money market fund units, the default risk is effectively on par with that of bank deposits but is significantly reduced due to the fund's status as a contractual investment fund and the diversification within the fund into different investment securities and issuers.\n\nIn addition, the Semperit Group conducts business activities in countries with capital controls or has restrictive agreements with joint venture partners. In countries with restricted cash transfers, the Semperit Group tries to limit the amount kept locally to the minimum necessary for business operations. The above-mentioned risks may have a negative effect on the company's financial position and financial performance in the event of restrictions being placed on the free availability of cash and cash equivalents, or on access to credit lines.\n\nThe default risk associated with financial assets is recognized through loss allowances. Determined on the basis of the risk of a total default of all debtors (without taking credit insurance into account), the maximum default risk in the corresponding measurement categories breaks down as follows:\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in EUR thousand                      | 12.31.2023 | 12.31.2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents            | 112,671    | 106,631    |\n| Trade receivables                    | 25,580     | 16,302     |\n| Other financial assets – securities  | 6,224      | 5,388      |\n| Derivative financial instruments     | 98         | 233        |\n| Miscellaneous other financial assets | 1,743      | 2,464      |\n| Total                                | 146,316    | 131,018    |\n\n### 11.4. Interest rate risk management\n\nOperating resources, investments, and acquisitions in the framework of the Group's business operations are financed using debt, some of which bears variable-interest rates. Depending on what happens to interest rates, hedging transactions could have a significant influence on the Group's financial position and financial performance.\n\nThe risk associated with fixed-interest financial instruments is that market values can be negatively impacted by changes in interest rates. In the case of variable-interest financial instruments, the risk is that fluctuations in cash flows can adversely affect the balance of cash and cash equivalents and the planning of future cash flows.\n\nThe Semperit Group's financial landscape has recently undergone a significant change, as no negative interest is now charged on company deposits. At the same time, variable-interest financial liabilities currently pay higher interest rates. The Semperit Group pursues a strategy of active liquidity management in order to counter these new conditions effectively. The Semperit Group's investment policy is strictly adhered to at all times. The interest rate profile of the Semperit Group's interestbearing financial instruments is shown below:\n\n|                       | 12.31.2023        |                      |                   | 12.31.2022           |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| in EUR thousand       | Fixed<br>interest | Variable<br>interest | Fixed<br>interest | Variable<br>interest |\n| Financial assets      | 30,759            | 79,692               | 73,106            | 30,748               |\n| Financial liabilities | 45,934            | 182,038              | 52,460            | 150                  |\n|                       | 76,693            | 261,730              | 125,566           | 30,898               |\n\nThe interest rate risk sensitivity analysis focuses on the risk arising from variable-interest financial instruments. It is assumed that the variable-interest financial assets and financial liabilities have been outstanding for a full year as at the reporting date. When performing this sensitivity analysis, a change of 100 basis points is simulated. The effects of the simulations on the financial result are shown below:\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 12.31.2023 12.31.2022\n\nSensitivity to changes in interest rates by Sensitivity to changes in interest rates by\n\n| in EUR thousand                         | Balance | +100 basis<br>points | -100 basis<br>points | Balance | +100 basis<br>points | -100 basis<br>points |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Variable-interest financial assets      | 79,692  | 797                  | -205                 | 30,748  | 307                  | -158                 |\n| Variable-interest financial liabilities | 182,038 | -1,820               | 1,896                | 150     | -2                   | 2                    |\n|                                         | 261,730 | -1,023               | 1,691                | 30,898  | 306                  | -157                 |\n\nThe Semperit Group continually evaluates individual interest rate strategies by entering into fixedinterest rate swaps and/or prematurely refinancing loans on the corporate Schuldschein loan market.\n\n### 11.5. Currency risk management\n\nDue to its involvement in international trading activities in various foreign currencies, the Semperit Group is exposed to currency risks. Transaction risks exist at all Group companies, e.g., for those that purchase input factors in foreign currencies and/or sell products in a different currency. The principal currencies in continued operations in this context are USD, CNY, INR, PLN; in discontinued operations they were USD and MYR.\n\nThe most significant currency in the Semperit Group's continued operations is the USD at 14.8% (previous year: 14.3%) of revenue and 11.0% (previous year: 11.9%) of cost of materials.\n\nThe translation of foreign financial statements into the euro reporting currency resulted in currency translation differences (translation risk) amounting to EUR –5,878 thousand (previous year: EUR – 8,137 thousand), which were recognized in other comprehensive income. Of this, EUR –53 thousand was attributable to non-controlling interests (previous year: EUR 5 thousand). The foreign currency translation reserve has increased due to the reclassification of other comprehensive income to profit or loss following the deconsolidation of the companies in the (first) closing in the amount of EUR 23,541 thousand (previous year: EUR 0 thousand), see section 2.9. The currency translation differences in the fiscal year 2023 (as in the previous year) were mainly due to changes in the USD exchange rate. The EUR/USD rate changed from USD 1.06660/EUR as of December 31, 2022 to USD 1.10500/EUR as at December 31, 2023 or an average rate of USD 1.08122/EUR in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: USD 1.05276/EUR).\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of subsidiaries not located in the euro area, and the contribution of these subsidiaries to the Semperit Group's earnings, are to a significant extent contingent upon the changes in the euro exchange rates of the functional currencies of these subsidiaries; the translation risk is not considered within the scope of the following disclosures pursuant to IFRS 7.\n\nThe following breakdown of the revenue, cost of materials, and personnel expenses of the Semperit Group's continued operations by material currency (as a percentage of the continued operations' revenue) shows that in the fiscal year 2023, 24.4% (previous year: 21.5%) of revenue or 31.1% (previous year: 27.1%) of the cost of materials and 36.1% (previous year: 38.0%) of personnel expenses were generated in foreign currencies. From this it can be derived that the currency risks on the selling and procurement sides are largely eliminated by natural offsetting effects. It should also be noted that the functional currency is usually the local currency (for exceptions, see section 1.3) and that personnel expenses are always in the local currency.\n\n| in % of revenue fron continued operations | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| EUR                                       | 75.6% | 78.5% |\n| USD                                       | 14.8% | 14.3% |\n| CNY                                       | 3.7%  | 3.7%  |\n| INR                                       | 2.4%  | 2.3%  |\n| PLN                                       | 1.8%  | 0.1%  |\n| CHF                                       | 0.6%  | 0.0%  |\n| GBP                                       | 0.4%  | 0.5%  |\n| SEK                                       | 0.3%  | 0.4%  |\n| THB                                       | 0.2%  | 0.2%  |\n| CZK                                       | 0.1%  | 0.0%  |\n| AUD                                       | 0.1%  | 0.1%  |\n\n| in % material expenses from continued operations | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| EUR                                              | 68.9% | 72.9% |\n| USD                                              | 11.0% | 11.9% |\n| CZK                                              | 6.4%  | 4.3%  |\n| CNY                                              | 3.9%  | 3.5%  |\n| INR                                              | 3.7%  | 3.5%  |\n| PLN                                              | 3.3%  | 2.0%  |\n| THB                                              | 1.9%  | 1.6%  |\n| HUF                                              | 0.6%  | 0.2%  |\n| CHF                                              | 0.2%  | 0.0%  |\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in % personnel expenses from continued operations | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| EUR                                               | 63.9% | 62.0% |\n| CZK                                               | 11.8% | 14.6% |\n| PLN                                               | 9.8%  | 9.4%  |\n| USD                                               | 4.9%  | 3.9%  |\n| HUF                                               | 3.6%  | 3.9%  |\n| CNY                                               | 2.5%  | 3.3%  |\n| THB                                               | 1.2%  | 1.7%  |\n| CHF                                               | 0.9%  | 0.0%  |\n| SGD                                               | 0.7%  | 0.5%  |\n| INR                                               | 0.7%  | 0.7%  |\n\nA significant portion of the Semperit Group's earnings are generated by subsidiaries that do not have their registered office in the euro area (see section 10.2).\n\nThe Group's financial management system aims to avoid currency risks as much as possible by coordinating payment flows. The table below shows the derivative financial instruments used to hedge against currency risks by group company, type of hedging transaction, and hedged currency. In the fiscal year 2023, the financial instruments consisted of forward exchange contracts to hedge parts of the operating business at SAC.\n\n| 12.31.2023                                       | Country  | Type of transaction | Currency | Hedge amount1 | Hedge rate2 | Fair value in EUR thousand 2023 | Range of remaining days to maturity |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Semperflex Asia Corp.

The fair values were shown in the consolidated balance sheet as other financial assets or other financial liabilities.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the purposes of currency risk management, sensitivity analyses were prepared for the measurement at the reporting date of monetary items that deviate from the functional currency. These analyses also present the effects on profit of hypothetical changes in exchange rates for each currency pair. Here, receivables and liabilities in the currency pair in question as at the reporting date are taken into account, as are the forward exchange contracts. No uniform change was assumed with regards to the range of exchange rate fluctuation; instead, appropriate fluctuation ranges for each currency pair were determined on the basis of historical fluctuations during the year. The following table shows the effects of the appreciation and depreciation of major foreign currencies versus the euro (EUR) and the US dollar (USD):\n\n|                           |

Other\n\n### 12.1. Related-party transactions with companies and individuals\n\nOutstanding balances and transactions between SAG and its subsidiaries were eliminated in the course of consolidation and are not further discussed here.\n\nB&C KB Holding GmbH is the direct majority shareholder of SAG, and B&C Privatstiftung is the controlling legal entity. B&C Holding Österreich GmbH is the indirect majority shareholder, which draws up and publishes consolidated financial statements in which the Semperit Group is consolidated. According to IAS 24, B&C Privatstiftung and all its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates are related parties of the Semperit Group.\n\nRelated parties of the Semperit Group include the members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards of SAG, the managing directors and Supervisory Board members of all companies that directly or indirectly hold a majority stake in SAG, and finally the members of the Executive Board of B&C Privatstiftung and the close family members of these Executive and Supervisory Board members and managing directors. In the 2023 fiscal year, there were free consultancy contracts between SAG (the Supervisory Board) and B&C KB Holding GmbH's managing directors: with Mr. Mathias Breuer until August 15, 2023 and with Dr. Markus Fürst from September 27, 2023.\n\nThe remuneration of members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is presented in the following table:\n\n|                                                          |                                 |                                | 2023  |                                 |                                | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| in EUR thousand                                          | Supervisory<br>board<br>members | Management<br>board<br>members | Total | Supervisory<br>board<br>members | Management<br>board<br>members | Total |\n| Short-term benefits                                      | 731                             | 1,626                          | 2,357 | 460                             | 1,924                          | 2,384 |\n| Benefits after termination of employment<br>relationship | 0                               | 163                            | 163   | 0                               | 135                            | 135   |\n| Other long-term benefits                                 | 0                               | 72                             | 72    | 0                               | 97                             | 97    |\n| Termination benefits                                     | 0                               | 1,325                          | 1,325 | 0                               | 0                              | 0     |\n| Total                                                    | 731                             | 3,186                          | 3,917 | 460                             | 2,155                          | 2,615 |\n\nThe short-term benefits include not only regular payments but also the short-term incentive (STI), which is due within one year.\n\nThe benefits upon termination of the employment contract relate to payments to the APK Pensionskasse AG pension fund. Payments made by SAG to the employee severance fund (Betriebliche Vorsorgekasse, BVK) on behalf of members of the Executive Board also constitute payments upon termination of the employment contract. In the 2023 fiscal year, these amounted to EUR 35 thousand (previous year: EUR 28 thousand). However, these payments were excluded from the table above in order to ensure that the presentation is consistent with the remuneration report.\n\nThe other long-term benefits relate to the long-term incentive (LTI). The termination benefit relates to the one-time severance payment made to Kristian Brok in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nPayments to former members of the Executive Board and their survivors totaled EUR 680 thousand in the fiscal year 2023 (previous year: EUR 695 thousand).\n\nThe following transactions were conducted with the companies mentioned below and the following balances existed as at the reporting date: In the 2023 fiscal year, the Group conducted transactions with unit-IT Dienstleistungs GmbH & Co KG totaling EUR 640 thousand (previous year: \n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nEUR 817 thousand). These transactions related to the purchase and maintenance of SAP licenses and were conducted at arm's length. There were outstanding liabilities to unit-IT Dienstleistungs GmbH & Co KG amounting to EUR 0 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 357 thousand).\n\nTransactions amounting to EUR 11 thousand were conducted with Grohs Hofer Rechtsanwälte GmbH in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 10 thousand). These transactions related to legal consulting services and were conducted at arm's length. There were outstanding liabilities to Grohs Hofer Rechtsanwälte GmbH amounting to EUR 0 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\nTransactions amounting to EUR 50 thousand were conducted with B&C KB Holding GmbH in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 50 thousand). These transactions related to management and other services, and internal charging, and were conducted at arm's length. There were outstanding liabilities to B&C KB Holding GmbH amounting to EUR 15 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 0 thousand).\n\nTransactions amounting to EUR 161 thousand were conducted with Mr. Patrick Lackenbucher in the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: EUR 215 thousand). These transactions related to consultancy services and were conducted at arm's length. The consultancy agreement with Mr. Lackenbucher was terminated with effect from June 30, 2023. There were outstanding liabilities to Mr. Patrick Lackenbucher amounting to EUR 0 thousand as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: EUR 15 thousand).\n\n### 12.2. Other obligations and risks\n\n### Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations\n\nThe constant changes and in some cases tightening of the rules in national and international tax law increase the demands on tax compliance to monitor and comply with these rules. Given this situation, there are tax uncertainties and tax-related contingent liabilities, especially for income taxes (e.g., with regards to the existence of tax loss carryforwards and from international transfer pricing rules) and transaction taxes. Such tax uncertainties and tax-related contingent liabilities exist due to liabilities under tax guarantees and tax exemptions from the sale and purchase agreement with Harps Global Pte. Ltd. also (still) for the discontinued operation's former subsidiaries. Detailed information on the specific financial impact would seriously weaken the position of the Semperit Group in asserting its interests in current legal proceedings and is therefore omitted pursuant to IAS 37.92. In addition, there are contingent liabilities due to (still existing) financial guarantees to the discontinued operation's former subsidiaries that were covered by a back-to-back guarantee from Harps Global Pte. Ltd.\n\nThere were liabilities from the use of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment not recognized in the balance sheet due to rental agreements and leases that are not reported in accordance with IFRS 16, as the option for short-term leases (i.e., up to 12 months) and low-value leased assets (i.e., up to a replacement value of around EUR 5 thousand) was exercised (see section 3.2).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023 there were also contractual obligations to purchase property, plant, and equipment amounting to EUR 15,082 thousand (previous year: EUR 9,671 thousand).\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Legal proceedings\n\nVarious Group companies are defendants in individual cases in which the plaintiffs allege that they suffered damage from the defendant's products. However, in light of current insurance coverage, management does not expect these proceedings to significantly impair the Semperit Group's financial position and financial performance. There were also legal proceedings and legal uncertainties in matters pertaining to employment and social law. Please see section 7.2 for all material legal proceedings that provisions have been recognized for.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 12.3. Events after the reporting date\n\nTrade receivables were sold for the first time in January 2024 as part of the new factoring program. As of the end of February 2024, trade receivables totaling EUR 12,499 thousand (previous year: n.a.) were sold. Please see section 4.2 for more details.\n\nIn the course of optimizing the Group's structure, the US companies Sempertrans USA, LLC, and Sempertrans North America Investments Corp. were merged with Semperit Industrial Products Inc. effective January 1, 2024.\n\nAs the parent company, SAG submitted the application on February 14, 2024 for an official assessment of the accession of the Austrian companies RICO Group GmbH, RICO-Elastomere Projecting GmbH, and Härtereitechnik Rosenblattl GmbH as additional Group members to the existing Group pursuant to Section 9 of the Austrian Corporation Tax Act (KStG) as of the 2024 assessment year.\n\n### <span id=\"page-182-0\"></span>13. Approval of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared on March 18, 2024 and approved for submission to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has the task of examining the consolidated financial statements and explaining whether it approves the consolidated financial statements.\n\nVienna, March 18, 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nHola llor\n\nDr. Karl Haider CEO\n\nDr. Helmut Sorger CFO\n\nMr. Gerfried Eder\n\nCIO\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-183-0\"></span>Auditor's Report1\n\n### Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n### Audit Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of\n\n### Semperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding, Vienna, Austria\n\nand of its subsidiaries (the Group) comprising the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2023, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year then ended and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on our audit the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the legal regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and the financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2023 and its financial performance for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by EU, and the additional requirements under Section 245a Austrian Company Code UGB.\n\n### Basis for the opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 (in the following \"EU regulation\") and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n### Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the con-text of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n<sup>1</sup>) The publication or disclosure of the consolidated financial statements with our auditor's report may only be made in the version confirmed by us. This auditor's report relates exclusively to the German-language and complete consolidated financial statements including the Group management report. For deviating versions, observe the regulations of Section 281 (2) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB).\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow we describe the Key Audit Matters:\n\n### Acquisition of RICO Group – Purchase price allocation\n\nOn July 31, 2023 Semperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding acquired 100% of the shares of RICO Group GmbH. As a full-service provider for individual plastic and elastomer projects, the Rico Group's product portfolio ranges from the manufacture of injection moulds and advice on component development to the series production of customer-specific components. The group comprises 3 companies in Austria, one company in Switzerland and one company in the USA.\n\nAt the acquisition date, a purchase price allocation was carried out. The total amount of consideration at the acquisition date amounted to EUR 183,661 thousand. Taking into account the acquired net assets of EUR 134,303 thousand the goodwill amounts to EUR 49,358 thousand.\n\nThe acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are to be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date in accordance with IFRS 3. The identification and measurement of the acquired net assets is complex and requires a number of judgmental decisions and assumptions. In particular, the determination of the fair value of the acquired intangible and tangible assets is based to a large extent on asset-specific assumptions that require discretionary decisions and estimates by the Management Board. In order to determine the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities, the Management Board has in some cases commissioned external experts.\n\nThere is a risk to the consolidated financial statements that, due to the size and complexity of the business combination, the assets and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition were incompletely identified or not properly measured. In addition, there is a risk that the disclosures required by IFRS 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are incomplete or incorrect.\n\nThe corresponding disclosures of the Semperit Group are contained in the notes \"1.6 Company acquisitions\".\n\nThe following audit procedures were carried out by us:\n\n- Critical review of the concluded purchase agreement, in particular with regard to the presentation in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 3\n- Examination of the methodology used and the arith-metical accuracy of the calculation as well as the material input parameters for the valuation of the identified intangible assets with the assistance of our valuation specialists\n- Audit of the completeness of the acquired assets and liabilities that were included in the purchase price allocation.\n- Audit of the derivation of the projected revenues and results used for the measurement of the identified intangible assets with the plans submitted to the Supervisory Board and their reconciliation to the requirements of IFRS 3\n- Critical review of the appraisals prepared by external experts on the valuation of tangible assets (mainly real estate and machinery) and discussion with the external experts, as well as plausibility check of the material valuation parameters and assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external experts commissioned by the management\n- Verification of the completeness and adequacy of the disclosures in the notes\n\n### Impairment of assets\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the consolidated financial statements of Semperit Aktiengesellschaft Holding show EUR 447,498 thousand in property, plant and equipment and EUR 124,971 thousand in intangible assets – of which EUR 51,035 thousand were goodwill.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the course of the valuation of the assets, it must be assessed on an ongoing basis whether there are indications of impairment. Considering external and internal indicators according to IAS 36.12.\n\nFor the Hoses and Rico business units (= cash-generating units), a mandatory impairment test must be carried out annually due to the existing goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, an impairment trigger was identified for the Profiles business unit due to the decline in demand as a result of the weak construction industry in Europe.\n\nIn addition, an impairment reversal trigger was identified for the Belting business unit due to the changed market environment.\n\nFor the above-mentioned business units, the recoverable amounts as values in use as of September 30, 2023 were determined for the purpose of impairment testing. After a comparison with the carrying amounts, there was no need for impairment or reversal of impairment.\n\nIn the context of determining the value in use, significant assumptions and estimates are necessary, which are subject to significant uncertainties. Accordingly, there is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that an impairment or reversal is not taken into account or is not taken into account to an appropriate extent.\n\nThe corresponding disclosures of the Semperit Group are contained in the notes \"3.1 Intangible assets\" and \"3.2 Property, plant and equipment\"\n\nWe critically questioned management's assumptions and estimates, including the following audit procedures:\n\n- Assessment of the concept and design of the process for reviewing the recoverability of assets\n- Review of the planning documentation of the three scenarios and completion of a plausibility analysis of the key value drivers (sales, expenses, capital expenditure, changes in trade working capital and cash flow\n- Verification of whether the revenue and earnings forecasts are derived from the plans submitted to the Supervisory Board, and whether these items are in compliance with the requirements of IAS 36\n- Audit of the methodology applied, and the computational accuracy of the documentation and calculations provided, as well as assessment of the plausibility of the discount rate with the assistance of our valuation specialists for the purposes of calculating the business unit's value in use\n- Verification of the correct determination of the carrying amounts of the assets as a comparative value to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units\n\nVerification of the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes\n\n### Other information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the Group's management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, on the basis of the work we have done, we conclude that there has been a material misrepresentation of this other information, we are obliged to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this context.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Responsibilities of Management and of the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements under Section 245a Austrian Company Code UGB for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe date of our auditor's report.
