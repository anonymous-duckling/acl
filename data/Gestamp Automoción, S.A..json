In the design, development and manufacture of parts for vehicles, Gestamp remains faithful to its commitment to producing vehicles that are safer - with a view to keeping passengers and pedestrians safe - and lighter, while reducing CO2 emissions during the vehicle's service life.\n\nGestamp views sustainability as a way of creating long-term value in a bid to boost the growth strategy and enable all stakeholder groups to gain a competitive edge.\n\nAs the interests of its stakeholder groups figure ever more prominently in its long-term vision, Gestamp subjects all its operations to certain environmental, social and governance-related criteria. This approach gives Gestamp an essential competitive edge and enables the company to take its place among the major players of the sector.\n\n## DOUBLE MATERIALITY ANALYSIS\n\nIn 2023, with the guidance of an external consultant, Gestamp conducted a double materiality analysis based on GRI standards, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the reporting standards (ESRS) developed by EFRAG.\n\nThe primary aim of this analysis is to identify and assess the main positive and negative environmental and social impacts of the company's activities (impact materiality) and the related risks and opportunities that may arise for the company (financial materiality). It can then set out to define its management model, strategy and action plan accordingly.\n\nTo this end, according to a particular methodology (see Annex: Double Materiality Methodology) involving a qualitative assessment of Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IROs), it was possible to identify and assess, by way of a bottom-up approach, sub-topics, on the one hand, and the most relevant ESG topics for the company, on the other hand. The company's materiality matrix has been produced on the basis of the results:\n\nImage /page/53/Figure/19 description: This image is a materiality matrix, plotting different environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors based on their impact and financial materiality. The x-axis represents financial materiality, and the y-axis represents impact materiality. The matrix is divided into four quadrants: High Impact Materiality, High Materiality, Low Materiality, and High Financial Materiality. Several ESG factors are plotted on the matrix. 'Water' is in the top left quadrant. 'Responsible supply chain' is in the top center. 'Occupational health and safety', 'Business conduct', 'Own workforce', 'Product innovation and quality', 'Climate Change', and 'Circular economy' are in the top right quadrant. 'Affected communities', 'Pollution', and 'Biodiversity and ecosystems' are in the bottom left quadrant. The image also includes a legend indicating the colors used for environmental, social, and governance factors, as well as a symbol for the scope of materiality.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

As such, while analysis granularity is greater in 2023, the number of material topics fell from 20 to 8 (12 fewer), meaning that it is possible to identify those that are particularly relevant for the company.\n\nThese matters are addressed in the **8 strategic pillars** which form the cornerstone of the company's ESG strategy, and in the ambitious targets it has set for the next few years.\n\nInformation about the company's ability to manage the most relevant impacts, risks and opportunities for Gestamp in 2023 is detailed in the various chapters of this report.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/14 description: The image shows a view looking up into a canopy of green trees.

The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing a different aspect of ESG. The sections include Business Conduct, Climate Change, Circular Economy/Product Innovation and Quality, Biodiversity and Ecosystems/Pollution/Water/Circular Economy, Occupational Health and Safety, Affected Communities, and Own Workforce. Each section contains specific goals and metrics related to that aspect of ESG. For example, the Business Conduct section includes goals such as \"Deployment of the third party due diligence policy in more than 60% of countries (80% off total turnover)\" and \"Implementation of Human Rights due diligence program.\" The Climate Change section includes goals such as \"62% of the energy used by Gestamp in 2025 will be renewable\" and \"45% reduction of tCO2e in scopes 1&2 in 2025.\" The diagram also includes images of people and symbols related to each section, such as a handshake for Business Conduct and a recycling symbol for Circularity.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The study has concluded that, although 67% of the plants are located in an area close (<5km) or adjacent to a protected natural environment, given the characteristics of Gestamp's production processes, the direct impact on ecosystems is very low.\n\nImage /page/94/Figure/14 description: This image shows a world map with several countries colored in dark blue. The text on the image indicates that these countries have plants located in an area close to or adjacent to a protected natural environment. There are also three labels on the map: \"Gestamp Llanelli\" in Europe, \"Gestamp Betim\" in South America, and \"Gestamp Palau\" in Africa. These labels are connected to gray dots, which the legend indicates are plants with a risk of affecting the natural environment.\n\nAccording to the internal risk assessment, the highest potential risk is considered to occur in plants with industrial surface treatment processes that discharge their water into public channels. Only 8 plants of the Group meet these conditions and, through internal audits, the necessary controls are carried out to guarantee that they have implemented an environmental accident/incident prevention plan that minimizes the occurrence of a possible event.\n\nIn parallel, as part of Gestamp's commitment to biodiversity protection, the company is voluntarily participating in two external initiatives:\n\n#### [EUROPEAN COMMISSION EU BUSINESS @ BIODIVERSITY PLATFORM](https://green-business.ec.europa.eu/business-and-biodiversity_en)\n\nFor many years, Gestamp has worked with pioneering companies to develop tools that help integrate biodiversity into different business models which are currently in place. The work focuses on three main areas:\n\n- **•** Natural capital: helping integrate biodiversity into decisions of the company.\n- **•** Innovation for Biodiversity and Business: developing tools for assessment and sharing and identifying opportunities and best practices.\n- **•** Financial Institutions: forum for dialogue between financial institutions to integrate biodiversity and natural capital into trends in financial activities.\n\n#### PARTICIPATION IN NATURE BUSINESS AMBITION\n\nIn 2023, Forética launched the business leadership initiative Nature Business Ambition in which Gestamp participates, in order to boost ambition, promote action and build alliances to help towards the recovery of nature and biodiversity as key factors in achieving a \"Nature positive\" planet by 2030:\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/24 description: The image contains two logos side by side. The first logo is the word \"forética\" in blue, with a stylized \"é\". The second logo is a green speech bubble containing a white leaf.

ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION](#page-59-0)\n\nIn order to comply with the climate and energy objectives proposed by the European Union for 2030, and in turn, achieve the Neutrality objective of the European Green Deal by 2050, it is essential that investments are directed towards sustainable projects and activities. In this way, the economy, companies and society in general will become more resilient to current and future climate and environmental consequences. This is why a common language and a clear definition of what is sustainable is needed.\n\n[4.1 Road to Neutrality](#page-60-0)\n\nIn this sense, and to face this challenge, the European commission published a classification system called the EU Taxonomy (Regulation (EU) 2020/852), which aims to decarbonize the economy by defining what it considers as environmentally sustainable economic activities. As of today, said Regulation establishes the classification criteria for the activities defined for two of the six proposed environmental objectives, Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change:\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION\n\n6 CLEAN WATER\nAND SANITATION\n\n14 LIFE\nBELOW WATER\n\nPROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF WATER AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/17 description: The image shows three icons representing sustainable development goals.

This delegated act on climate taxonomy establishes the technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation and for determining whether this causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives.\n- **•** On July 6th, 2021, Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 was published, which in article 8 in particular specifies the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by companies subject to the NFRD (Non-Financial Reporting Directive).\n- **•** Lastly, on March 9th, 2022, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 was published which amends the previous Delegated Regulations and includes, subject to strict conditions, relevant nuclear and gas related activities in the list of economic activities covered by EU taxonomy8.\n- **•** On June 27th, 2023, it was published:\n- **-** Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, which supplements Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical selection criteria to determine under what conditions an economic activity will be considered contributes substantially to the rest of the objectives of the taxonomy and to determine whether said economic activity does not cause significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, and which modifies Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.\n\t- **-** Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485, which modifies Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 establishing additional technical selection criteria to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to contribute substantially to mitigation or adaptation to climate change, and to determine whether that economic activity does not cause significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives.\n\nAccording to article 8 of the Regulation, in 2023 companies must report:\n\n- **•** Eligibility and alignment in accordance with Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 the objectives of Mitigation and Adaptation of Climate Change.\n- **•** Eligibility of new activities included in the Environmental Delegated Regulation and the amendment to the Climate Delegated Regulation.\n\nThe regulations establish a series of economic activities (eligible activities). For an activity to be considered aligned, it must contribute substantially to one of the environmental objectives (mitigation or adaptation to climate change), not cause significant harm to any of the remaining environmental objectives and comply with minimum social safeguards.\n\nLikewise, the most relevant information must be included in relation to compliance with the regulations, the accounting policy and qualitative information that allows contextualizing the results obtained and facilitating the understanding of the KPIs.\n\nIn 2023 it has not been identified activities associated with other objectives beyond Climate Change Mitigation. However, in 2024 a review of the activities will be carried out as a result of the integration of Gescrap in the development of Non-Financial Information.\n\n#### SCOPE OF THE REPORT\n\nThe scope of the analysis has included all the Gestamp Group's operating plants included in the scope of this non-financial information report (see chapter *[About this Report](#page-208-0)*).\n\n8Gestamp does not carry out activities related to nuclear energy and fossil gas contemplated in the Complementary Climate Delegated Regulation. For this reason, no related information is presented considering the templates of Annex XII of the Delegated Disclosure Regulation.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Gestamp Compliance Assessment**\n\nGestamp, in an exercise of transparency and in compliance with the new regulatory requirements under the scope of application of the NFRD, carried out during 2021 the evaluation of the eligibility of its activity based on the criteria defined in the \"European green taxonomy\". In this initial exercise, Gestamp was positioned as eligible as defined in activity 3.3. of Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport, since it is an essential part of the manufacturing of the vehicles indicated in the technical selection criteria for said activity. However, automotive components were not explicitly mentioned in that description.\n\nDue to the uncertainty regarding the application of the regulations and after having carried out the exercise internally, the European Commission published a Q&A on February 2, 2022 specifying that the activity of companies supplying automotive components was not eligible according to activity 3.3. Manufacturing of low-carbon technology vehicles for transportation described in the Taxonomy. For this reason, Gestamp finally concluded that it did not have activities associated with those considered eligible from the point of view of the Regulation.\n\nDuring 2022 Gestamp again carried out the eligibility exercise for its activities taking into account the following factors:\n\n- **•** The latest EU FAQ from December 2022 which, in a generic way, indicates that for the activities of 3.1-3.6, the components can be counted if they fit the selection criteria.\n- **•** Component manufacturers are one of the main actors in the transition towards sustainable mobility, accounting for 70% of the value of the vehicle, 90% of the production cost and 58% of investments in sustainable mobility come from automotive component suppliers, according to CLEPA data.\n- **•** The public position regarding the Taxonomy of other companies in the sector and sector associations such as CLEPA (European Automotive Suppliers Association) with its # FairTaxonomy movement).\n- **•** The recognition that the eligibility of Gestamp's activities would mean for investors.\n\nFinally, during 2023, the European Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Union Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 of June 27, 2023, which modifies Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 establishing additional technical selection criteria to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation, and to determine whether that economic activity does not cause harm significant to any of the other environmental objectives. Gestamp has carried out an analysis of the activities that this modification includes.\n\nIn this sense, within the study carried out, two additional activities have been considered to those finally reported as eligible according to the technical selection criteria:\n\n| Activities studied and their adaptation to the technical selection criteria<br>of the Taxonomy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Eligibility Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 3.3.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### KPI CALCULATION METHODOLOGY\n\nGestamp has avoided double counting of activities during the analysis process by considering only one eligible activity, since the production of the same part could have fit into several activities.\n\nRegarding the calculation process, the accounting data was taken from corporate financial systems, and the report thereof was additionally confirmed with plant teams. These calculations do not include intercompany transactions, so double accounting has not occurred in this sense either.\n\n**Capex**\n\n#### **Sales**\n\nRepresents the proportion of net business volume derived from products or services contemplated by the Taxonomy. The turnover KPI offers a static view of the company's contribution to environmental objectives. Calculation of %:\n\n- **•** Numerator: net amount of turnover that is associated with the economic activities carried out by the company that are taxonomically eligible.\n- **•** Denominator: Considers the total volume of the net amount of the company's turnover as stated in note 3.23 of the Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\nRepresents investments in fixed assets of an activity that is contemplated in the Taxonomy. Capex offers a dynamic and prospective view of companies' plans to transform their business activities. Calculation of %:\n\n- **•** Numerator: association of the CaPex intended for the selected taxonomic activity\n- **•** Denominator: includes the additions of tangible and intangible assets during the year before depreciation, amortization and possible new valuations, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, corresponding to the year of the company, excluding changes in fair value. Additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations will also be included.\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/21 description: The image shows a person holding a pen and pointing at a document with a graph on it. The graph shows a line chart with multiple lines, and the person is pointing at one of the lines with the pen. The document is white, and the graph is in color. The person's hand is visible, and they are wearing a striped shirt.\n\n#### **Opex**\n\nRepresents the proportion of operating expenses associated with activities contemplated by the Taxonomy:\n\n- **•** Numerator: Direct costs considered by the Regulation associated with taxonomic activities\n- **•** Denominator: non-capitalized direct costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repairs, as well as other direct expenses related to the daily maintenance of tangible fixed assets by the company or a third party to whom activities are subcontracted and that are necessary to guarantee the continued and effective operation of said assets.\n\nIn the case of the Opex calculation, because the direct costs considered by the Regulation are not relevant compared to the total operating costs of the year, they have not been included as part of the report following the recommendations of the European Commission.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

In this sense, although the figures are not representative today, the percentage of eligible sales has doubled compared to last year. Likewise, due to the development of regulations and the integration of Gescrap in the 2024 Annual Report, as well as Gestamp's commitment to the development of more sustainable mobility and the circular economy, exponential growth is expected in the coming years of these indicators.\n\nGestamp will continue working on this analysis to be able to provide eligibility and alignment figures that are more in line with the reality of your business.\n\nImage /page/103/Figure/14 description: The image shows two donut charts.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nSince our beginnings as local stamping suppliers, we have worked together with our customers, accompanying them in their globalisation, helping them to develop increasingly safer and more efficient vehicles, and offering them innovative solutions to the many and diverse challenges presented by the automotive sector.\n\nThis has helped us become a key player in the automotive sector, being a global reference in the development and manufacturing of metal components, with an international presence in 24 countries and a diverse and multicultural team of more than 40,000 people.\n\nGlobal vehicle production has grown by 9.7% in 2023, consolidating its recovery despite economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. The commitment, performance and efficiency of our teams has allowed us to achieve good results in 2023, taking advantage of market opportunities. Accordingly, our revenue rose to EUR 12.27 bn, up 14.4% on the previous year and our EBITDA increased by 13.4%, reaching EUR 1.37 bn. This growth highlights the success of a business strategy based on geographical diversification, an innovative and unique product portfolio, and a focus on creating long-term value by leading the transition towards electric vehicles.\n\nThese results also support our long-term vision of integrating sustainability in the core of our business model. To this end, we have developed an ambitious ESG strategic plan until 2025, which not only establishes objectives for all the areas that we consider essential for this correct performance, but also strengthens our firm conviction that sustainability represents a cornerstone of our business strategy.\n\nThe development of environmental, social and good governance aspects is integrated transversally in our business strategy. Starting with the development of lighter parts, which help increase the autonomy of the electric vehicle, reduce CO2 emissions and optimise the use of raw materials. Another key pillar of our ESG plan is to promote the circular economy, closely collaborating with our entire value chain to use our high-quality scrap as a secondary raw material for the production of low-emission steel. In this regard, in 2023, agreements have been reached with our suppliers Tata Steel UK, SSAB and Arcelor Mittal to promote low-emission steel.\n\nThe commitment to local communities in which Gestamp is present has always been a key part of our social strategy. We are aware of our role of contributing to the development of communities through the generation of quality employment and the implementation of Social Action initiatives that positively impact society. As a result, in 2023 we have developed around 229 initiatives with 464,827 beneficiaries.\n\nAll of this structured in a strong governance model supported by the Board of Directors, the ESG Commission and the ESG Committee, which ensure that sustainability is addressed comprehensively and effectively throughout the organisation. What's more, the new regulatory requirements on transparency, such as the CSRD, serve as a tool to be able to show the market how sustainability has always been part of Gestamp.\n\nBeyond our determined commitment to sustainability and the positive economic performance during the year, the group continues to invest decisively in strengthening our long-term strategic positioning through product innovation and the digitalisation of our processes.\n\nIn this way, we are committed to innovation and technology as a driving force for developing solutions that help in the transition towards cleaner mobility that is safer for people, and to help address challenges within the industry. Gestamp is a technology company that already has the capabilities to offer a product portfolio that will be key in the new architecture of the car of the future, products that combine weight efficiency, passenger safety and the most competitive cost.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to our Industry 4.0 model, we are developing more efficient and flexible production plants that continuously improve operations management and provide operational flexibility through the digitalisation of all our processes.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue working in the Group on using all the means at our disposal to reaffirm our commitment to sustainability and contribute to the achievement of Agenda 2030 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/22 description: The image shows a signature on the left and the name and title of a person on the right.

This improvement in rigidity also contributes to improving the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle.\n\nIn addition to what has been mentioned, other highly relevant aspects to take into account in the development of products are comfort and durability.\n\nWe can group the family of products that Gestamp works on into three large groups:\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/17 description: This image shows various car parts and their names. The parts are divided into three categories: Chassis, Mechanisms, and unnamed. The Chassis category includes structural assemblies, bumper systems, closures, gigastampings, battery boxes, and Class A. The Mechanisms category includes cross car beams, underbody, and upperbody. The unnamed category includes subframes, links, control arms, rear twist systems, hinges, powered systems, and door checks.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp. The word \"Gestamp\" is written in a bold, dark blue font. To the right of the word is a square containing a stylized graphic of a curved line with a circle at the end, also in a lighter shade of blue.\n\n2023\n\n#### [BODY IN WHITE \\(BIW\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0VrPV1zszM)\n\nBody-in-White products (or BIW) form the structure that supports the vehicle and protects the driver and other passengers.\n\nIt participates in crash safety, aerodynamics, weight distribution and general structural integrity, in addition to defining the aesthetics of the vehicle.\n\nThe body must be designed so that, in the event of a crash, deformation occurs appropriately and the maximum amount of kinetic energy is transformed into deformation work. Certain parts have to absorb a large amount of energy in the event of an impact.\n\nIt is here, in the bodywork, where the use of hot stamping is key to lightening the vehicle and, in turn, exceeding the increasingly demanding safety regulations.\n\nGestamp has been revolutionizing the design and manufacturing of parts in this technology, being able to integrate functionality through solutions in which the latest generation materials are used.\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/8 description: The image shows a close-up, low-angle shot of stacked metal beams or structures, possibly in an industrial setting. The beams are arranged in a repeating pattern, with each layer slightly offset from the one below it, creating a stepped effect. The metal has a dull, gray-blue tone, and the lighting is somewhat dim, casting shadows that emphasize the depth and texture of the structures. The beams are perforated with numerous small holes, adding to the visual complexity and suggesting a functional design. The overall composition is abstract and emphasizes the geometric patterns and industrial aesthetic of the scene.\n\nThe chassis comprises the under body of vehicles and includes systems, frames and related parts, such as front and rear axles and couplings, control arms and integrated couplings, which connect the body and the powertrain of a vehicle and support its weight.\n\nThese structures are essential for the dynamics, performance and safety of vehicles and have a particular influence as regards noise, vibrations, driving and impacts.\n\n#### [CHASSIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnfKSSPhQo) [MECHANISMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFht8noscp8)\n\nThese are mechanical components, such as hinges for doors, bonnets and boot doors, door checks and door hinges, which enable users to open and close a vehicle's bonnet, side doors, rear doors and boot, as well as pedal systems and hand brakes. Mechanisms also include powered systems that allow vehicle doors to open and close electrically and by means of remote activation. These components afford important functionalities and play a significant role in safety and comfort.\n\n[6. Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[5. Social Dimension](#page-107-0)\n\n[2.

With our sights set on the long term, here at Gestamp we strive to continuously improve our processes and operations in order to be efficient at all levels. In a competitive sector, such as the automotive sector, standing out from the rest is necessary. Our operations and management have to be excellent.\n\nImage /page/15/Figure/13 description: The image shows three numbers and their corresponding descriptions.

The third number is +750, and its description is \"PEOPLE actively working\".\n\n## TRANSFORMATION PLAN\n\nIn order to prepare for the future and the changes forced upon us by the world, as well as market uncertainty, Gestamp launched ATENEA two years ago, a comprehensive, ambitious transformation plan for continued growth and improvement which addresses key issues arising from the company's rapid growth.\n\nThis project remains a key milestone for the future of the Group and aims to build on everything that has made Gestamp successful in the past, in order to stay competitive in the future.\n\nThe transformation programme seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate functions and operational layers in processes, systems, organisation and culture.\n\nThe programme was launched in September 2021 with 45 initiatives, signifying the first steps of this model of excellence. This live project saw the launch of a second wave of 25 initiatives at the start of 2022, this time put forward by the organisation and led by talent from all regions. Since then, the launch of initiatives has continued as required by the organisation and its different functions, with a total of 92 initiatives launched over the two years of the programme. The transformation plan has, therefore, become a programme driven and led by the organisation itself.\n\nThere are currently 48 initiatives underway, with multidivisional teams working together to design the best solution, with an expected impact of nearly 80% in plants and divisions. A total of 79 of the Group's plants are currently involved and more than 750 people are actively working on the ATENEA programme.\n\nThis ambitious plan is part of Gestamp's strategy and will be crucial for overcoming the challenges of the future, aiming to ensure operational excellence in its factories and the transition towards corporate functions with greater added value.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/21 description: The image shows a Newton's cradle, a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy using a series of swinging spheres.

For those reasons, the industry is a pioneer in the application of quality systems throughout the value chain. Gestamp's customers demand flawless products in the required quantity and by the agreed deadline to ensure both the quality of the final product and its proper functioning.\n\n#### **Quality Systems**\n\nAll of Gestamp's production plants have developed and maintained a quality management system with the international certifications required by Gestamp's customers. These certifications are mainly in accordance with IATF 16949 (99% of Gestamp's production plants with at least one year of records), with the remaining 1% representing a single plant that only supplies customers who do not require this certification.\n\nThe management systems of each and every one of the plants are based on Gestamp's minimum quality management system, known as GQS (Gestamp Quality System), which ensures a minimum degree of uniformity across all of them.\n\nThis management system aids Gestamp's continuous improvement by focusing on the customer and promoting prevention over detection, resulting in fewer defects and less waste in the supply chain, in a safe and sustainable manner.\n\nHowever, sometimes incidents may arise among clients, in which case predefined response mechanisms are activated and measures are taken so that the causes that produced these incidents are not repeated. These mechanisms are common in the automotive sector, such as troubleshooting methods, such as 8D, including root cause investigation methods such as 5W, 5M or Ishikawa or warranty management methods, including NTF Non-Trouble Found, to name a few. These methodologies are a standard in the sector, accepted and required by all clients.\n\nThese management systems are ever-evolving, capable of adapting to industry changes and seeking continuous improvement. In 2023, work continued to define and roll out the new system for managing costs of quality, launched in 2021, with extensive use of available IT tools. Two new sprints were added to those already developed in 2022 related to the costs of selection and rework processes with Gestamp resources and supplier charges.\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/19 description: The image shows a close-up of a machine with a robotic arm and a laser beam. The robotic arm has a black circular head with the word \"QUISS\" printed on it in yellow letters. A red laser beam is emitted from the center of the head, directed towards a metallic surface. The machine is made of metal and has various components such as wires, cables, and sensors. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a factory or industrial setting.\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/20 description: The image shows a close-up view of the engine compartment of a vehicle.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Customer-Oriented Quality**\n\nGestamp is committed to building solid, long-lasting relationships based on trust with customers. To achieve this, continuous dialogue is encouraged, which serves to better identify and meet their needs.\n\n#### ANNUAL MEETINGS\n\nAnnual meetings are held at the highest level with customers in order to review short-term results and forecasts; longer-term prospects, trends and opportunities are also discussed at these meetings. Moreover, the development of common strategies, new technologies and any needs raised by the customer are considered.\n\n#### DAY-TO-DAY RELATIONS\n\nDirect contact is maintained with the customer regarding day-to-day activities, in both the industrialisation phase and the mass production phase. During the industrialisation phase of new products, constant contact is maintained with customers, with particularly close monitoring of those projects that are considered strategic in order to ensure an appropriate response.\n\nOur production plants maintain daily contact with the facilities of our customers. This contact is more operational in nature, seeking to provide a flexible response to the requirements and needs of the customer, and resolve any issues that may arise on a day-to-day basis.\n\n#### CUSTOMER AUDITS\n\nThe customer, in turn, visits the plants from time to time to carry out audits and contribute towards continuous improvement, together with periodic assessments which allow Gestamp to determine its level of quality in comparison with the customer's other suppliers, and to take measures in areas where there may be room for improvement.\n\nEach customer decides on the frequency of these audits, which is usually yearly, but can be adapted according to the circumstances. Gestamp always works with the customer by arranging these visits, providing the information required to ensure the audit is conducted properly.\n\nImage /page/18/Picture/21 description: In a well-lit industrial setting, three men are working with metal components. The man on the left wears a two-tone shirt, safety glasses, and orange gloves, standing near a metal surface. The man in the middle, wearing a gray shirt and gloves, is positioned near several metal components. The man on the right, wearing ear protection, is also working with the metal components. Above them, a screen is mounted on the wall. The scene suggests a manufacturing or assembly process.\n\n#### **Monitoring and Internal Control**\n\nMonitoring the quality performance of parts delivered to customers is undertaken through internal audits on products, processes and systems, as well as through the use of indicators at all levels of the organisation (plants, regions, divisions and corporations).\n\nThe incidents that occurred during the year were resolved between the automotive manufacturers and the Group, which successfully managed the incidents within the optimal time frames. This ensured that end users did not face any inconvenience and no vehicle in the possession of an end user was recalled for a revision for any reason relating to the products supplied by the Group in 2023.\n\nThe manner in which said incidents were handled was the key element in resolving them. As such, there was no need to resort to the insurance guarantees that the Group has taken out.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Handling of Safety-Critical Components**\n\nGestamp has a specific directive for handling safety-critical components, understood as those that, according to the VDA (Verband Der Automobilindustrie), contain a safety or regulatory feature, i.e. that could pose an immediate risk to the life and limb of the occupants or a breach of current legislation. Some examples include the vehicle's steering, suspension or impact resistance in the event of a collision. This directive also outlines the specific requirements for maintaining records associated with this type of component, which are key to taking potential action should any adverse events occur. Furthermore, there are other company-wide directives that form part of Gestamp's quality management system, specifying minimum requirements so that design and manufacturing processes can manage factors that may affect safety-critical features in the most effective way possible.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/13 description: A woman wearing a dark blue t-shirt with the word \"Gestamp\" and a logo on the back is standing in what appears to be a factory or industrial setting. She has curly brown hair and is wearing gray protective sleeves on her arms. The background is predominantly yellow, with various pieces of machinery and equipment visible. There are also safety signs on the wall. The overall lighting is bright, and the focus is on the woman and the text on her shirt.\n\n#### **Project Quality**\n\nIn order to adequately manage risk right from the project phase, the company's project quality department is leading a company-wide initiative related to risk prioritisation based on an FMEA cycle (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), one of the most powerful standards in the industry.\n\nTo this end, an ambitious programme is underway to fine-tune its use, in terms of both method and through the development of an IT tool, which will improve the detection and analysis of potential faults in product design or the production process, as well as their causes. It will also allow for the relevant measures to be taken later in the phases of mass production control.\n\nThe tool's development was completed in 2022 and it was launched in 2023 for start-up projects, reaching a total of 1,753 active users in the new system with 270 open projects, including 21 design FMEAs, 1,045 process FMEAs and 811 control plans by the end of 2023. Furthermore, standardisation has also continued for primary technologies (hot and cold stamping, welding, painting, machining and bonding) to be reused across all plants, thus capitalising on all the expertise that already exists within Gestamp.\n\n> 1,753 270 in the new system\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/19 description: The image shows two numbers and their corresponding labels. The number 1,753 is labeled as \"ACTIVE USERS\", and the number 270 is labeled as \"OPEN PROJECTS\".\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp. The word \"Gestamp\" is written in a bold, dark blue font. To the right of the word is a square containing a stylized graphic of a curved line with a circle at the end, also in a lighter shade of blue.\n\n#### **Process Quality**\n\nThe Process Quality department provides an organisationwide set of standards and methods linked to the most critical technologies and production processes within the Group, focusing in particular on special processes (those in which the part has to be destroyed to ensure that the product is up to standard, such as parts involving arc welding).\n\nIts aim is to align all of Gestamp's production activity with the customer's quality requirements and international standards in order to maximise the quality and efficiency of said activity. Thus, Gestamp ensures compliance with the customer's requirements throughout every process, from the early phases of production to delivery of the final product. In 2023, a\n\nspecific department for Quality 4.0 was set up, with the aim of increasing the added value of 4.0 tools. A number of projects are set to be deployed over the next few years, one of which relates to merging product and process characteristics for chassis and battery box products.\n\nSo far, in addition to the production process standards defined in previous years such as arc welding, hot stamping, leather pieces, resistance welding and painting, specific processes have been added for the manufacture of battery boxes, such as machining and bonding. Work has also been carried out on subprojects stemming from the main projects. During 2023, the major chassis plants were also audited according to the reference framework\n\ncreated the previous year, including system aspects and all the relevant technology.\n\nIn 2023, part of the certification process of the main previously indicated technologies of the plants has been resumed, prioritizing the evaluation of the chassis plants. In 2024, it is planned to continue evaluating the implementation of the already defined standards in production plants.\n\n#### INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEMS\n\nImage /page/20/Figure/10 description: The image shows a diagram of control systems.

Furthermore, more than 50 projects have been virtualised, ranging from sophisticated production lines to entire factories. Also, 9 applications have been developed for maintenance, logistics, quality and energy efficiency tasks, which facilitate day-to-day plant management.\n\nGestamp has been able to develop these projects thanks to the work of multidisciplinary teams made up of experts in industrial and technological operations, digital developers and new professional profiles specialising in data management. This has ensured greater knowledge in the areas of digital technology, IoT, big data and virtualisation, as well as in other fields such as artificial intelligence, collaborative robots, resource orchestration, computing, etc. The majority of these technologies are being used in projects currently under way.\n\nThanks to the experience we have gained over the years, the Digital Factory is now a reality at Gestamp. A Digital Factory where everything is connected—products, machines, systems and people—, sharing information in real time in a transparent way and ensuring that the factories can operate efficiently at all times.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/16 description: The image shows a robotic arm in an industrial setting. The arm is orange and black, and it is positioned next to a large white machine. There is also a blue and silver machine on wheels in the background. The floor is light gray, and the walls are white. The image is well-lit and in focus.\n\nGestamp is currently in the process of evolving and structuring all the technologies that are moving towards the concept of smart manufacturing.\n\nAbove all, this means ensuring integration and standardisation among them, so that they come together in an environment governed to perfection. This will allow us to design and deploy a longer-term strategy.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"Gestamp\" in a bold, sans-serif font.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nMeanwhile, in 2022 and 2023 greater impetus was given to all aspects related to change management, the creation of digital culture and the strengthening of teams and structures designed specifically to implement the strategic digitalisation plan. This involves a major effort in terms of training and transforming professional profiles that specialise in digital systems, defining positions and duties allocated across the various regions and plants, and fostering a robust community within Gestamp that upholds its strategy and governance on a global level.\n\nIn terms of new developments, tremendous effort is going into systematising and standardising relationships with both strategic and service partners in order to streamline all these efforts and boost progress on the roadmap towards a smart factory.\n\nIn addition, by combining experience in digitalisation and advanced engineering, Gestamp has developed a new concept of flexible assembly, allowing for the production of different products on the same line. Thus, we are moving one step closer to digital industrialisation, evolving from product-specific and linked systems to generic and individual systems where movements are carried out by AGVs (guided vehicles) instead of static robots.\n\nWith all this, in 2023, significant effort has gone into advancing the creation of a federated digital ecosystem, where the i4.0 community has increasingly clear standards for the contribution, development and implementation of digital tools. As such, the degree of customisation and closeness to the needs of each plant has significantly increased, meaning the acceptance and adoption of such tools has also increased.\n\nOn the other hand, Gestamp has also clearly driven forward the tools and structures needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and apply it to the most ambitious industrial challenges,\n\nin terms of efficiencies, energy consumption and quality. In 2024, supported by all the developments in 2023, the aim is for Gestamp to be able to successfully apply these technologies in multiple contexts, setting off on the path towards industryspecific AI in a fully regulated environment, keeping knowledge and property within the organisation.\n\nAll this allows Gestamp to deal with the uncertainties that the automotive industry is facing and to be more adaptable to change. Gestamp is actively working on a model of a connected, smart, virtualised, safe and scalable factory that can be flexibly, swiftly and efficiently adapted to the constantly changing needs of the industry.\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/18 description: The image shows a diagram that illustrates the transition from a digital factory to a smart factory.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### LIGHT WEIGHTING AND REDUCED EMISSIONS\n\nGestamp is continuously working to develop lighter vehicles. Weight reduction is one of the company's main areas of research. It is one of the most demanded requirements in the automotive sector due to the need to improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nChassis and body components are essential for meeting emissions targets, as they make up around 70% of the vehicle's total weight.\n\nAlso, as part of the electrification trend in the industry, the increase in vehicle mass due to batteries has reinforced the importance of lightweighting. Weight affects the range of the electric vehicle, and until the full decarbonisation of the electricity grid takes place, its consumption will continue to play an important role in the CO2 emissions of vehicles during the use phase.\n\nTherefore, Gestamp provides innovative solutions to offer the best weight reduction results and meet the most stringent requirements of the sector. Extensive experience in hot stamping technology and the development of multi-material solutions have led to various alternatives for lighter vehicles.\n\nIn order to take into account the environmental impact of, for example, weight reduction, life cycle analysis (LCA) of products is carried out as a strategic element in the design phase. As explained in the Circular Economy chapter, the carbon footprint of the different processes carried out at Gestamp and the materials used in the production phase are some of the main variables analysed in the study. For example, it has been found that the lightening of parts and the use of a smaller amount of raw materials are two of the factors that most influence the reduction of the carbon footprint. This is due to the high impact\n\nof the extraction phase of the materials used, in addition to the use phase of the vehicles explained above.\n\n#### COMFORT\n\nDriving experience, comfort and dynamism are some of the key aspects that users take into account. Gestamp develops solutions that improve comfort and convenience when using the vehicle, such as components that reduce the noise and vibration of the vehicle, electrical systems that allow doors and trunks to be automatically raised and held or doors opened with the greatest safety thanks to a complete system of sensors that avoid impacts against obstacles.\n\nThe main criteria for a user's vehicle purchase include driving experience, comfort and dynamics. This is leading to a rise in demand for components such as electric liftgate systems, noise and vibration reducing components, electric door systems, power assist steps and noise reducing tyres.\n\nAt Gestamp we have been working on these components for many years and we are at the forefront within the sector. Originally and to date, they are components that are mounted on high-end vehicles and SUVs, but it is expected that in the coming years they will become a standard in all types of cars.\n\nImage /page/26/Picture/22 description: A light blue car is driving on a road.

Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n#### GESTAMP'S EV CONCEPT\n\nElectrification is an unstoppable trend for the automotive sector, with diverse factors driving it forward, the most important of which is the growth in urban populations and the improvement in the air quality there.\n\nGestamp's strategy remains to constantly accompany its customers in order to offer them the best innovations for their vehicles and, in the case of electric vehicles (EV), to help them in the transition to electric vehicles.\n\nThe Technology and Innovation Office teams develop different solutions for the electrification of different mobilities.\n\nThe Electric Vehicle area and Gestamp's R&D teams are offering various solutions, such as the new electric battery box, chassis components integrating the new electric motors. These components meet traditional specifications like durability, rigidity, and strength, but they need to be optimised in terms of noise transmission and energy absorption during collisions due to the specific architecture of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, innovations in the use of different materials are being pursued to reduce weight and provide more suitable solutions for new electric platforms. The motto is: the right materials in the right place.\n\nThe impact behaviour is different in a battery electric vehicle (BEV), mainly due to the higher weight and low centre of gravity of the battery system. In addition, the higher mass of the batteries also contributes to the potential energy of the vehicle in case of a collision. Gestamp has developed a wide range of body in white products to increase safety and protect battery passengers in the event of a collision.\n\nIt should be noted that the company has collaborated in different types of mobility beyond electrification itself. Thus, projects have been developed for cars that cover long distances, small cars for cities, and concepts referred to as \"urban people mover\" and \"last mile delivery\".\n\nImage /page/27/Picture/9 description: The image shows a mechanical assembly, possibly part of a vehicle's chassis or drivetrain.

To the right of the word is a blue square containing a white graphic that resembles a stylized \"G\" or a curved line with a circle at the end.\n\n2023\n\n#### **Gestamp's main innovations**\n\n#### GESTAMP LABORATORY FOR THE VALIDATION OF AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS\n\nG-Lab, Gestamp's virtual laboratory for the validation of automotive products, is an R&D programme that develops digital prototypes of its own vehicles in order to validate the behaviour of new body in white components and technologies.\n\nThis is the most relevant safety-focused project at Gestamp, as G-Lab is based on prevention as the main pillar throughout the design, development and manufacturing process of vehicle components.\n\nG-Lab was created with the aim of obtaining the best results in virtual validation of all types of collisions and impact scenarios for the different vehicle segments. For this reason, the program allows for full vehicle collision simulations during the co-development process with customers.\n\n[2. Gestamp Group](#page-4-0)\n\n[1.

Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nInternal capacities for undertaking vehicle crash simulations\n\nThanks to G-Lab, Gestamp offers the best body in white solutions in new mobility scenarios, focusing on safety, lightness and sustainability. These models offer the possibility to perform much of the development and testing in the virtual environment and thus accelerate the design, testing and approval phases.\n\nGestamp has numerous virtual models of combustion engine vehicles (ICE), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV). These models allow the impact of new technologies, new designs or materials on the body and chassis to be predicted and assessed in terms of weight, performance and cost.\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/15 description: The image contains three views of a silver car that has been damaged in a collision.

The hood is mounted on a blue platform, and there are various wires and cables connected to it. The lighting in the scene is bright, highlighting the metallic surface of the hood and the surrounding equipment.\n\n#### NEW MATERIALS\n\nIn a bid to develop new, lighter and safer products, Gestamp is researching new materials. The company believes that the kind of structural materials used will gradually change in the years to come, with an increase in the use of aluminium, carbon fibre, new high-strength steels and multimaterial hybrid structures.\n\n- **•** High and ultra-high-strength steels: The application of Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) and Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) helps to reinforce vehicles to protect the passenger compartment in the event of an accident.\n- **•** Aluminium: The use of aluminium allows weight reduction in high-end models by applying aluminium solutions in the cladding parts and doors of the vehicle. Gestamp already manufactures battery cases with the most advanced crash alloys.\n- **•** Composite materials: Some manufacturers have used composite materials to reduce the weight of high-end vehicles and improve their efficiency. Due to the great need to reduce the weight of electric vehicles, more and more applications of these materials are being found.\n- **•** Multi-material structures: Companies such as Gestamp are investing in new technologies and machinery to create multi-material structures as part of the existing manufacturing process and value chain. This formula supports the philosophy of the right material in the right place and opens up a wide range of innovations to respond to the lightweighting of parts to meet the need to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Letter from the Chairman](#page-2-0)\n\n[INDEX](#page-1-0)\n\n[4. Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n#### TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nGestamp's R&D teams are constantly developing new technologies in line with customer needs in order to increase performance or reduce weight. One example is the launch of new advanced cold-formed steels with improved strength properties, which enable weight reduction by applying the knowledge and experience gained in the forming and development of chassis products. Development teams focus on innovative design approaches to deliver optimised highperformance products; from increasing service life by design and minimising weight through in-house optimisation tools coupled with manufacturing expertise to achieve 10-15% mass reduction, to the introduction of new paint processes to improve corrosion protection.\n\nIn the hot-stamping field, development of the new Ges-Multistep technology continued, optimising the process for different types of steel, including zinc materials with a new improved anti-corrosion coating.\n\n## New processes have also been developed that allow hot stamping of material with 25% higher strength.\n\nThis material is manufactured using a laser post-treatment that gives it sufficient ductility to obtain the best results in impact tests.\n\nThree partial cooling methods have been employed to obtain different mechanical properties across a part and achieve better shock performance. And new degrees of hardness/absorption have been achieved that allow for even better deformation control.\n\nGestamp has managed to produce parts with \"soft zones\" that have different degrees of hardness and absorb the force of impact, with different production processes:\n\n- **•** During forming: in the die/forming tool.\n- **•** After forming: post-treatment by alternative heat source, laser, induction, Ges-Softbend.\n- **•** Before forming: in the heating furnace.\n\nWith these developments, Gestamp has become the most advanced hot stamping supplier in the market, offering a wide range of materials with different resistance and coating features.\n\nBeyond steel, Gestamp has managed to bring hot stamping technology to aluminum. The need to reduce the weight of vehicles has led some manufacturers to increasingly use aluminum in some components, such as doors, and in chassis components for large and high-end vehicles.\n\nThe low level of formability and the high elastic recovery of this material in the conventional cold stamping process has motivated the R&D department to process hot stamping, where design pieces very similar to those made of steel are achieved, but much lighter and with almost zero elastic recovery.\n\n- **• Multistep**\n- **• 2000 Mpa & Soft Zone Bkt**\n- **• Hotstamping Aluminium**\n- **• Furnace Soft Zone**\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/19 description: The image shows a car frame with different parts highlighted in different colors. The text on the left side of the image lists \"Alu Multimaterial\" and \"Alu Extrusion\".\n\nGestamp's current hot stamping lines can be used for both materials by only modifying the process parameters. Gestamp has ended 2023 with a total of 106 hot stamping lines.\n\nFor the manufacture of battery boxes, new aluminum extrusion processes have been developed in which large section profiles with high ductility are produced. This makes it possible to manufacture boxes with very light frames to protect the battery.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n#### **Product development**\n\nProduct innovation at Gestamp comes from the application of new technologies to create lighter, more efficient components.\n\n#### BODY IN WHITE\n\n#### **Extreme Size Parts**\n\nGestamp has created two product families, GES-GIGASTAMPING tm and GES-ENERCONT tm. There is a clear growing trend among all original part manufacturers to develop extreme size parts, fully in tune with the challenges of electric vehicles.\n\nGestamp's leadership in hot stamping technology has enabled it to create new products of much larger sizes than those that currently make up the body in white. Thanks to the reduction in the number of components, the complexity of assembly processes on manufacturers' production lines is also reduced, minimising their internal production costs.\n\nThese extreme size parts are designed to improve vehicle weight and carbon footprint while maintaining safety.\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/9 description: The image shows a red car chassis on a white background. The chassis is the frame of the car, and it is made of metal. The chassis has a sunroof. The chassis is missing the engine, wheels, and other parts of the car.\n\nWith different mobility possibilities in mind, Gestamp has created GES-ENERCONT tm, a family of energy containers. In the case of long-haul vehicles, Gestamp has developed a compact solution with a design that is valid for both steel and aluminium in which energy capacity has been maximised.\n\nThis product from the *Extreme size parts* family and manufactured with hot stamping technology offers a single cell solution. Thinking about urban mobility, Gestamp has created a light and compact solution that not only uses aluminum, but also composite materials.\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/12 description: The image shows the body of a car in a factory.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### CHASSIS\n\n#### **Use of carbon fibre reinforced composites in chassis products**\n\nIn the Chassis project, Gestamp has partnered with Ford (lead), the NCC and the University of Nottingham to reduce the weight of three components in a Ford Transit, the best-selling van of all time. These include the front subframe, the front lower wishbone, and the rear solid axle. The result is a 40 % component weight reduction at an affordable cost. This represents a saving of more than 30 kg on the current steel components. In this project, Gestamp used its own in-house topology and material optimisation tools to generate the new chassis concepts, placing the right material, with the optimal component geometry, in the most advantageous position.\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/14 description: A close-up shot captures a welding robot in action, emitting bright sparks and smoke. The robot's arm, metallic and cylindrical, extends downwards towards a dark, angular metal structure. The welding point is a burst of intense light, surrounded by a cloud of blue smoke and scattered sparks. The background is blurred, suggesting a workshop or factory setting.\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/15 description: The image shows a car chassis. The chassis is made of metal and has a complex structure. It is designed to support the weight of the car and to provide a stable platform for the suspension and other components. The chassis is also designed to protect the occupants of the car in the event of a collision.\n\nThe opportunity to explore new innovative ideas to reduce mass in chassis products consolidates Gestamp's current market leadership position in steel and aluminum chassis structures and is a further example of Gestamp's continued drive to utilize innovation as a means of progress and remain at the forefront of innovation in the sector while working closely with clients.\n\nIn 2023 Gestamp closed a very ambitious project launched together with a client to develop a lighter, stiffer and safer front lower control arm.\n\nThe study used the product of the front lower control arm, an important component of an automobile suspension system that stabilizes the vehicle when in motion, placing extreme demands on formability, strength, stiffness and fatigue properties. It had to work perfectly in the event of a head-on collision. The challenge was to develop and produce a low control arm with high strength steel grades that did not previously exist on the market. After six years of design and development with our client, we achieved the cost targets, the weight target (a 16% weight reduction in the part) and the CO2 target. The result, a new Docol® 1000 CP steel grade.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Gestamp shares this commitment and supports the drive towards electrification with greener and lighter products for electric vehicles (EV).\n\nApart from steel, the application of other materials and combinations of materials are playing a more important role in the development of lightweight automotive parts. Aluminium is by far the most widely used non-ferrous metal in the world and possibly one of the most sustainable materials used in the global automotive industry today.\n\nHistorically, aluminium has been used for over a hundred years to produce lightweight bodies for performance and agility. However, lightweight chassis design has been driven by the rise of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), especially in China, and aluminium is a lightweight metal that can be applied to offset the weight gain caused by lithium-ion batteries. With typical weight reductions of up to 30% compared to the equivalent steel chassis structure, aluminium is seen as a key factor for sustainable lightweighting.\n\nGestamp recognises that the electrification of the automotive industry represents the fastest path to zero emissions; in anticipation of this shift in the global market, Gestamp launched a strategy to independently develop and validate in-house aluminium chassis design and manufacturing competencies.\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/16 description: A close-up shot reveals a silver metal frame structure, possibly part of a vehicle chassis or industrial equipment, mounted against a backdrop of blue and white panels.

GDP growth has been better than expected at the beginning of 2023 - the IMF forecasted a +2.9% YoY growth in its January 2023 WEO - as a result of the resilience shown by major economies such as China and United States. Over 2023, tight monetary policies in main geographies have helped to bring inflation closer to central banks' target, which has been the key macroeconomic topic of the year. Looking ahead, risks to the outlook now seem to be more balanced but there is still some uncertainty arising from geopolitical risks and persistently high core inflation. As a result, the IMF now expects a GDP growth in 2024 at same levels as in 2023 at +3.1%, 0.2% higher than the October 2023 WEO projections, with a modest rise to +3.2% YoY in 2025.\n\nWithin the auto sector, 2023 has closed with a record growth of market production volumes following strong estimates' revisions by S&P Global Mobility (former IHS), mainly in Asia, throughout the year. According to the S&P Global Mobility update as of February 2024 volumes grew by +10.2% in Gestamp's footprint during 2023 reaching 82.1 million vehicles, already above the 80.7 million units produced in 2019, but still below 2017 peak levels. Once again, Gestamp has outperformed the market on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact from raw materials by 6.4 percentage points (in Gestamp's footprint – IHS data as of February 2024).\n\nDuring 2023, Western Europe and Eastern Europe were the two regions showing the strongest production growth (+14.1% and +11.3%, respectively), followed by Asia with a +10.3% growth, North America (NAFTA) growing at +8.3% and South America (Mercosur) at +3.6%.\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility (as of February 2024), 2024 is expected to be a transition year in terms of global light vehicle production within a context of a progressive recovery of 2017 peak levels (85.8 million vehicles in Gestamp's footprint). Following an extraordinary growth in 2023, market\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility data as of February 2024, global light vehicle production volumes in 2024 are expected to slightly increase versus 2023 at 82.2 million units in countries within Gestamp's production footprint.\n\nproduction volumes in Gestamp's footprint are expected to slightly increase in 2024 to 82,2 million units and are expected to surpass peak levels only by 2027 with 86.1 million vehicles.\n\nMoreover, since after the summer of 2023 S&P Global Mobility has been slightly revising downwards its Electric Vehicle (EV) penetration estimates (S&P Global Mobility as of January 2024 expects 26.3 million EVs produced by 2025 with a market penetration of 29% versus the 26.8 million units expected for 2025 in May 2023) and growth in the EV market now looks more saw-tooth shaped. However, automotive industry fundamentals for the medium term remain focused on the electrification trend as the world continues moving towards a sustainable mobility. China, Europe, and North America continue to be the main promoters of this EV trend, with EV penetration rates expected to reach 65%, 54% and 35%, respectively, by 2027. Gestamp continues to work closely to its clients with a leading positioning in this powertrain transition through its focus in Technology and Innovation and its unique value proposition.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/38/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Uncertainty at macro level is expected to persist mainly arising from the geopolitical risks (Israel-Palestine and Ukraine-Russia wars, together with tensions between China, Taiwan and Unites States and an intense electoral year with presidential elections taking place in significant countries such as United States, Russia, India and Mexico) and a higher for longer inflationary pressure. More specifically for the auto market, 2024 is expected to be marked by: i) limited auto production growth, with ii) EV penetration still on the rise but with a saw-tooth shape and iii) declining steel prices but still above normalized levels.\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility data as of February 2024, global light vehicle production volumes in 2024 are expected to slightly increase versus 2023 at 82.2 million units in countries within Gestamp's production footprint. By region, S&P Global Mobility expects production volumes to grow in 2024 in NAFTA (+2.4%) and Asia (+0.1%), while Mercosur (-1.2%), Eastern Europe (-1.2%) and Western Europe (-2.4%) are expected to see volumes slightly declining.\n\nLooking at Gestamp's operations, the Group's main focus for 2024 will be to preserve its growth profile by: i) mitigating the potential EV volatility, ii) keep using our technology and innovation capabilities to be at the vanguard, and iii) implementing a disciplined capex strategy to capture future growth; as well as to ensure the company's profitability by: i) further implementing efficiency improvements, ii) reinforcing its flexibility to mitigate potential volatility and iii) focusing on the NAFTA region restructuring plan.\n\n## For 2024, Gestamp expects revenues for the auto business to outperform market production volumes.\n\nIn this context, the Group is determined to continue reinforcing its financial and strategic positioning. For 2024, Gestamp expects revenues for the auto business to outperform market production volumes growth in the low-single digit range with a flat reported EBITDA margin when compared to 2023. As for Gescrap, the Group expects similar revenues and EBITDA in 2024 versus 2023. Regarding Free Cash Flow and leverage targets, Gestamp expects to generate positive Free Cash Flow (FCF defined as Net Debt reduction excluding acquisitions and dividends) in the range of the €200 million and reach a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0-1.5x. Gestamp is strongly committed on delivering on this guidance.\n\nOn June 20th, 2023 Gestamp celebrated its second Capital Markets Day in which presented its long term strategy for the 2022-27 Plan explaining the Group's positioning as Partner Supplier for its clients towards a more sustainable mobility. Gestamp's Strategic Plan is based on seven key pillars, which are: i) growth ambition, as market production volumes recover with increasing EV penetration and outsourcing levels; ii) being a trusted partner for both traditional clients and new comers; iii) using its technology and innovation capabilities to be differential; iv) keep improving the operational excellence, in order to v) grow in a profitable way; vi) maintain a disciplined balance sheet\n\nprofile; and vii) lead the circular economy in the automotive sector supported by its latest acquisition, Gescrap.\n\nDuring the Capital Markets Day the Group provided its financial targets for 2027, which include: i) revenues outperforming the market by mid-single digit during the period, with EV related sales reaching more than 50% of total sales of parts by 2027; ii) a 150-190 basis points increase in EBITDA margin; iii) net debt to EBITDA ratio standing in the range of 1.0-1.5x throughout the period; iv) a ROCE improvement of 350 basis points; and v) maintaining current dividend policy based on a 30% pay-out of annual net profit.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

This strategy is considered an area of particular importance as it has to be perfectly aligned with the basic principles of its business strategy, but at the same time it is an essential part of the Group's concerns within the framework of its sustainability policy.\n\nFiscal Policy revolves around four basic pillars:\n\n- **•** Responsibility in decisions and actions in fiscal matters.\n- **•** Tax contributions where the activities take place. Gestamp's aim has never been to relocate activities or profits to particular jurisdictions for purely fiscal reasons.\n- **•** Transparency in all the information that Gestamp provides to shareholders, the market and the different stakeholders with which it is associated; this information is also accessible, transparent and reliable.\n- **•** Cooperation with the different public administrations of the countries where Gestamp has an industrial presence and always subject to solid values of professionalism, collaboration, good faith, mutual trust and mutual respect.\n\nAt Gestamp, tax matters are managed in an orderly and professionalised manner in order to guarantee both due and timely compliance with all tax obligations and the effective management of tax risks.\n\nTo this end, Gestamp, on the one hand, has an appropriate, expert and integrated organisation with sufficient technical competence at corporate, divisional and local level, which enables it to manage and ensure due compliance with its tax policies and, on the other hand, it applies the most effective procedures, systems and internal controls to ensure that the tax function is carried out appropriately.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/20 description: In this high-angle shot, a group of business professionals are gathered in what appears to be an office setting. The composition of the image suggests a meeting or collaborative discussion, with the individuals positioned in a way that encourages interaction.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nThe bodies at Gestamp that are competent and responsible for the fiscal area include the Board of Administration, the Audit Committee, the Risk Committees, the Fiscal Area of the Legal Advice and Tax Department, and the Internal Audit and Risk Management Department.\n\nIn particular, the Fiscal Area of the Legal Advice and Tax Department is in charge of preserving and developing all the principles and values of Gestamp in the area of taxation and of overseeing their fulfilment, defining and establishing the required control mechanisms. It also provides information on fiscal risks and their management to the Internal Audit and Risk Management Department which, in turn, follows up and monitors said risks, including them in the Group's Comprehensive Risk Management System and informing the Audit Committee of them.\n\nINFORMATION ON CORPORATE TAX EXPENSES, PROFIT BEFORE TAXES AND SUBSIDIES BY COUNTRY\n\n|                | Corporate tax expenses |       | Profit before taxes |        | Subsid.

The framework of this agreement will be the Spanish stock markets.\n\nThis agreement stipulates the conditions in which the financial intermediary will operate for the account of the issuer, buying or selling own shares of the latter, with the sole objective of favouring the liquidity and regularity of their listing, and it will have a duration of 12 months, deemed to be tacitly extended for the same period, unless indicated otherwise by the parties.\n\nThe amount earmarked to the cash account associated with the agreement is €9,000 thousand.\n\nDuring 2023, the Board of Directors of the Parent company decided to launch a share buyback programme in order to provide the Parent Company with sufficient treasury shares to enable it to deliver shares of the Company to certain employees of Gestamp Automoción, S.A., beneficiaries of the current longterm incentive programme, for a maximum amount in cash of €15 million and a maximum number of shares of 3,000,000.\n\nThe period during which the Programme is authorised is from September 6th, 2023 to December 20th, 2023. This period may be extended with the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Parent Company if the Parent Company has not acquired the maximum number of shares by the specified date.\n\nOn December 18th, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Parent Company agreed to extend the duration of the Programme until May 10th, 2024.\n\nAs a consequence of the above, on September 4th, 2023, the liquidity contract signed with JB Capital Markets, S.V., S.A.U. was temporarily suspended and resumed on January 18th, 2024 after the repurchase of the 3,000,000 shares established in the repurchase programme had been completed.\n\nTreasury shares as of December 31st, 2023 represented 0.55% of the share capital of the Parent Company (0.08% as of December 31st, 2022) and comprised 3,169,656 shares (460,513 shares as of December 31st, 2022), at an average acquisition price of €3.765 per share (€3.482 per share as of December 31st, 2022).\n\nThe movements in 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n#### Number of own shares Thousands of Euros\n\n| Balance at December 31st, 2021 | 676,492     | 2,716    |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|----------|\n| Increases/Purchases            | 7,674,278   | 26,249   |\n| Decreases/Sales                | (7,890,257) | (27,362) |\n| Balance at December 31st, 2022 | 460,513     | 1,603    |\n| Increases/Purchases            | 5,962,440   | 23,337   |\n| Decreases/Sales                | (3,253,297) | (13,006) |\n| Balance at December 31st, 2023 | 3,169,656   | 11,934   |\n\nThe sale price of treasury shares during 2023 detailed in the table above amounted to €13,502 thousand (€27,279 thousand as of December 31st, 2022), generating a positive result of €495 thousand (negative result of €83 thousand as of December 31st, 2022), which has been recognized under Unrestricted Reserves (Note 17.2).\n\nImage /page/46/Picture/15 description: Three people are gathered around a table, seemingly collaborating on a project.

Gestamp decided to distribute on an annual basis a total dividend equivalent to approximately 30% of the consolidated net profit for each year, but in two payments, anticipating part of the payment via an interim dividend:\n\n- I. A first payment, through the distribution of an interim dividend, that will be approved pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors to be adopted in December of each year and paid between January and February of the following year.\n- II. A second payment, through the distribution of an ordinary dividend, that will be approved by virtue of a resolution of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting at the time of approval of the annual accounts and will be paid between the months of June and July of each year.\n\nIn line with our policy, in December 2023, the Board of Directors approved the distribution of an interim cash dividend in January 2024 against 2023 financial results. The payment took place on January 10th, 2024 for a gross amount of €0.07 per share.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

In this regard, the conditions for contracting to commercial suppliers relating to industrial activity for the manufacture of parts located in Spanish territory included payment periods equal to or less than 60 days in both 2023 and 2022, as stipulated in Transitional Provision Two of the aforementioned law.\n\nIn accordance with such Law, the following information corresponds to the Group companies that operate in Spain:\n\n| 2023                                |                |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Average payment period to suppliers | 42 days        |\n| Total payments made                 | €4,597 million |\n| Total payments pending              | €698 million   |\n\n#### 2022\n\n| Average payment period to suppliers | 43 days        |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Total payments made                 | €3,393 million |\n| Total payments pending              | €618 million   |\n\nThe monetary volume paid in 2023 in a period less than the maximum established in the late payment regulations, for companies based in Spain, is 1,083,610 thousand euros (673,169 thousand euros in 2022) corresponding to 62,251 invoices (42,027 invoices in 2022).\n\nFor reasons of efficiency and in line with common business uses, the Group's Spanish companies basically have a supplier payment schedule, whereby payments are made on fixed days which, at the main companies, are twice a month.\n\nIn general, in 2023 and 2022, payments made by Spanish companies to suppliers under agreements entered into after the entry into force of Law 15/2010, did not exceed the legal deferral limits. The payments made to Spanish suppliers in 2023 and 2022 that exceeded the established legal deadline have been, in quantitative terms, of scant relevance and are derived from circumstances or incidents outside the established payment policy, including mainly the closing of agreements with suppliers in the delivery of goods or provision of the service or specific handling processes.\n\nAlso, at December 31st, 2022 and 2021, no amounts were pending payment to suppliers located in Spain that exceed the legal payment term.\n\n#### **Subsequent Events**\n\nThere are no significant subsequent events after December 31st, 2023.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-49-0\"></span>03 ESG Perspective\n\n- 3.1 [ESG at Gestamp](#page-50-0)\n- 3.2 [ESG Strategy](#page-53-0)\n- 3.3 [ESG Criteria Ratings](#page-58-0)\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [3.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n# STRATEGY\n\nThe automotive and components manufacturing sector is faced with a great deal of climate challenges as a result of the Paris Agreement; at a European level the climate-neutral targets for 2050 set out by the European Green Deal; the Fit for 55 package of measures to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030; the ban on manufacturing combustion-engine cars from 2035; and the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) of various countries.\n\nFurthermore, these regulatory frameworks highlight the need to proceed with a fair transition model, endeavouring to not leave anyone behind.\n\nIn addition, climate change gives rise to an increase in temperatures and extreme weather phenomena, as well as loss of resources, which must be taken into account by companies in the industry in order to mitigate their impact.\n\nGestamp considers climate change risk in the Corporate Risk Map and it carries out a specific analysis on Climate Change risks and opportunities affecting business in order to:\n\n**•** Anticipate and adapt to the climatic risks that affect business, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it may offer.\n\n**•** Measure the financial impacts of climate change according to different scenarios and possible futures in the short, medium and long term.\n\nDuring 2023, a climate scenario analysis was conducted in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the EU Green Taxonomy. In this way, Gestamp has identified the **main opportunities** presented by climate change for the company and a total of **47 physical and transition risks** in different time horizons: short (0-5 years), medium (6-15 years) and long term (16-30 years).\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/19 description: This is an aerial shot of a winding road cutting through a dense forest.

Once climate risks and opportunities have been identified, they are assessed according to a series of specific criteria, the results of which are used to establish controls.\n\nThe climate risks identified in the various areas of the company influence the overall strategy of Gestamp and are included in the overall risk management, with measures being established to manage these risks as follows:\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/22 description: A close-up shot captures the side of a car parked on an asphalt road, with the road stretching into the distance. The car's tire and part of its body are visible on the left side of the frame. The asphalt road is textured and appears to be well-maintained. In the background, there are hills and mountains under a partly cloudy sky, adding depth to the scene.\n\n- **• Products and services:** Gestamp has boasted a strategy for products and services related to climate change since electric vehicles entered the market. For the rolling out of electric vehicles, in 2018 Gestamp set up a new business unit devoted to electric vehicles whose task is to develop the best solutions to adapt its products to the new technical demands of electric cars.\n- **• Value chain:** the company's processes regarding supply chain consider 2 key lines: 1) Participation in working groups together with customers to seek projects that guarantee CO2 emission reductions throughout the useful life of vehicles. 2) Collaborate with suppliers to align with the scope 3 reduction targets and achieve a supply chain with a lower climate footprint.\n\nSome examples in 2023 are:\n\n- **-** ArcelorMittal Europe Flat Products and Gestamp, have signed a \"circularity agreement\". The agreement includes jointly designing and implementing a circularity scheme that encourages steel recycling between Gestamp and ArcelorMittal, and ultimately passing on the benefits of the agreement to automobile manufacturers.\n- **-** Tata Steel and Gestamp have signed an agreement aimed at almost doubling the percentage of recycled steel in components supplied to the automotive sector. The initiative will allow Gestamp to pass on to vehicle manufacturers the benefits of increasing recycled material, as well as reducing the associated carbon footprint.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in blue text below three horizontal blue lines.\n\n[1.

Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n**• Investment in R&D:** Customers seek lighter parts which allow them to lower the weight of end vehicles so as to be able to reduce emissions per km. In this sense, the mission of the R&D Department is to develop innovative solutions that enable the weight of the parts to be reduced, thus contributing to a reduction in the overall weight of the vehicle. This approach results in lower fuel consumption, thus reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Gestamp also supports the approval of new materials (low-emission, recycled, etc.) and favours co-development throughout the value chain for the design of the product required for the mobility of the future.\n\n**• Operations:** In 2023, Gestamp has defined a roadmap, in accordance with the ESG 2025 Plan, to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement and the requirements of its customers. These measures include energy efficiency actions (see \"Metrics and targets\" in the \"Road to neutrality\" section of this chapter) to reduce consumption and electrify their facilities. In this vein, Gestamp boasts a renewable energy supply strategy by means of three channels:\n\n**-** Signing of long-term renewable energy supply agreements, PPAs (power purchase agreement). In 2023, in the Indian perimeter, the extension of the solar PPA has been signed at the Chennai plant, and work has been done so that the Pune plant has an operational solar PPA in 2024. At the same time, the negotiation of a 15-year contract for the supply of 49 GWh of wind energy to plants in Mexico by the company Elawan.\n\n**-** Purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (EACs). In 2023, production plants in the United Kingdom, the Nitra plant in Slovakia and Hardtech in Sweden have used green energy with guarantees of origin, while in Poland the electricity company made green certificates available. Likewise, renewable energy certificates were purchased for part of consumption in Germany, the Czech Republic, China, Mexico and the USA.\n\n**-** Energy self-consumption. In 2023, 25.5 GWh of photovoltaic solar energy will be self-consumed from plants in China, Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain and Portugal. During this year, a total of 13 solar self-consumption plants have been launched, 11 in Spain, 1 in Portugal, 1 in Bulgaria and 2 in Turkey. The deployment in these countries will end next year. Additionally, a contract has been signed with EDF for the installation of solar covers in 7 plants in Germany and work has been underway on solar self-consumption agreements in France, the United Kingdom and Japan that are expected to be launched next year.\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/16 description: A close-up shot of the rear of a gray car parked on the side of a road.

Each plant reports its energy consumption levels in a database and, based on this information, the carbon footprint of each centre and the overall footprint are calculated according to GHG Protocol and IPCC procedures.\n\nAll Gestamp production processes need a source of energy in order to function. Therefore, the different sources of energy consumed at the facilities are comprehensively tracked: Electricity,\n\nThe distribution of energy consumption globally is divided into 60% electricity, 35% natural gas and\n\nEnergy consumption by fuel type (GJ) 2021 2022 2023 Electricity 3,762,902 3,977,471 4,167,390 Natural gas 2,604,914 2,358,550 2,388,841 LPG 282,400 335,083 338,281 Diesel 26,342 25,985 23,153 **Total energy consumption 6,676,588 6,697,089 6,917,665 Renewable energy consumption\\* 347,915 1,329,133 1,735,762 % of total consumption 5% 20% 25%** Electricity is the main type of energy consumed by the Group, given that its plants use electricity as an energy source for most of the production processes, and also to power the facilities. Natural gas is used mainly for air conditioning in buildings, so consumption is usually seasonal. In addition, some production plants use it in processes like hot stamping and in painting lines. The other fuel types are linked primarily to the fleet of forklifts at the plants.\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/14 description: A man wearing a black t-shirt with the word \"Gestamp\" on the back is working with a machine.

In the case of electricity, they are requested directly from the supplier of each plant (if not available, the country's electricity emission factor provided by the International Energy Agency is taken). For Scope 3, DEFRA, CEDA and Sphera sources are combined for aluminium and steel consumption. The % are always referred to total emissions, so they do not have to add up to 100 as a whole. In the breakdown of Scope 1 into the different fuel types, only the main fuels are taken into account. There are other sources of Scope 1 emissions that are taken into account in the total but have not been disaggregated.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in blue, with three horizontal blue lines above it.

In terms of Energy Efficiency, in the last years a global initiative has been launched to optimize and reduce the energy consumption and to be environmentally responsible. Each production plant is working individually and together with other plants to implement measures to rationalize the consumption and to make sure all the technologies and equipment are working in the most efficient way from an energy point of view.\n\nThe commitment to emissions reduction, environmental protection, equipment performance optimization and operational excellence, drive this initiative in Gestamp Group. The Energy Efficiency project aimed at making improvements through several areas:\n\n- **•** Analysis of consumption and knowledge of the energy performance of the individual productive assets and facilities\n- **•** Study of good practices implemented in the Group\n- **•** Research into new improvement channels\n- **•** Sharing of all acquired knowledge.\n- **•** Setting of aims and the involvement of all organizational levels of the company.\n\nTo achieve those aims, the instantaneous consumption of electricity and gas of the equipment are monitored to create a model of its performance. Based on those consumption patterns, algorithms to identify quantify and notify deviations, are created.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The graphic consists of two curved lines that start thin and become thicker as they curve around to form a hook shape. At the end of the hook is a small circle. The lines are white, and the square is dark blue.\n\n2023\n\nIn 2023, over 47 plants formed part of the Energy Efficiency initiative. A total of 9% of the plants included in this scope were certified under the energy management system standard ISO 50001. For the remaining plants included in the initiative, it is worth saying that the strategy used regarding\n\nSpecific Energy Efficiency measures were identified and implemented at each of these plants to optimize the functioning of equipment and to reduce its electricity and natural gas consumption. Furthermore, standard documents related to shut-down protocols and other good practices were launched globally. Shut down protocols were followed in the production assets during non-working periods which resulted in significant improvement in energy KPIs and a reduction of non-essential energy consumption. These initiatives together enabled the Group to achieve a reduction of almost\n\nAdditionally, a 16 GWh energy savings has been achieved in plants which are out of scope of energy efficiency initiative through continuous application of shut-down protocols and energy efficiency\n\nJust to reinforce the Energy Efficiency initiative and the shut-down protocols application, an Energy Efficiency audit program was also globally announced to all divisions and launched in a pilot plant at the end of 2023. This audit program will continue being implemented during 2024 with the aim of identifying non-standard practices which correction will result in additional energy efficiency\n\nFrom a global perspective within the group, a 51 GWh energy savings were achieved in 2023.\n\nenergy efficiency is based on the requirements from ISO 50001 guidelines.\n\n#### **Results achieved in 2023**\n\n35 GWh.\n\nbest practices.\n\nsavings for the plants.\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in blue, with three horizontal blue lines above it.

Furthermore, new objectives for 2024 were defined based on the potential energy efficiency actions that could be implemented in each plant, as seen in the table below:\n\n|             | Total MWh  | Emissions avoided |\n|-------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Target 2024 | 48,950 MWh | 12,025 tCO2       |\n\n#### LONG-TERM EXPECTED OUTCOMES\n\nFrom 2024 forward, Gestamp will keep working to optimize consumption at the plants involved in the project, endeavoring to find ideal consumption levels for production and auxiliary equipment. The dynamics of responsible consumption at the plants will be consolidated by implementing an energy performance standard at the plants. In this way, and by monitoring energy consumption, the plants will be capable of standardizing the expected performance, assessing, and predicting deviations by using energy production indicators for equipment and energy management.\n\nEnergy-related best practices are being integrated and consolidated in a cross-disciplinary manner across all the Group's teams strategies: ESG, R&D, new construction, expansions, Operations, etc.\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/17 description: The image shows a tunnel-like structure made of metal sheets.

The diagram is circular, with arrows indicating the flow of materials. The process starts with raw material extraction, which leads to steel production. Steel production also receives materials from other sources of pre-consumer scrap and pre-consumer scrap. The steel is then used in manufacturing, which leads to the use phase of the car. After the use phase, the car is sent to scrap collection and processing, which also receives materials from other sources of scrap. The scrap is then sent back to steel production as cropst-consumer AP, completing the cycle.\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/14 description: The image shows a field of wind turbines against an orange sky with clouds. The turbines are silhouetted against the sky, and their blades are turning. The sky is a mix of orange and white, and the clouds are scattered throughout the sky.\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/15 description: The image shows a field with several wind turbines in the background. The sky is a gradient of orange and yellow, suggesting it is either sunrise or sunset. The field is mostly dark, with some patches of grass visible in the foreground.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/76/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Seeking the generation of new materials with a high percentage of recycled content to mitigate this impact becomes especially relevant.\n\nThis is why Gestamp identifies the high value of its commitment to the circular economy and for a model based on:\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/14 description: The image shows a simple illustration. A small, filled blue circle is positioned above a black, blocky shape that resembles a pedestal or a simplified building. The circle appears to be floating or suspended above the blocky shape.\n\n**INCREASE IN RECYCLED MATERIAL**\n\nDevelopment of partnerships that promote \"closing the loop\" projects.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/17 description: The image shows a blue pushpin.\n\n#### **EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES**\n\nDeveloping production processes that promote the efficient use of resources (raw materials, water and energy).\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/20 description: The image shows a blue and white icon of a trash can with a warning sign on it and a gear next to it. The trash can is outlined in blue, and the warning sign is a blue triangle with an exclamation point inside. The gear is also blue and is located to the right of the trash can.\n\n#### **WASTE MANAGEMENT**\n\nDevelopment of waste management processes that enhance the availability of secondary raw materials.\n\nHowever, Gestamp faces significant challenges related to the so-called \"green\" steel. Its availability is directly related to decarbonisation strategies and the investments of the main suppliers, which entails additional costs. Approval is also required to ensure that they meet the strict technical and quality requirements of customers. Similarly, there are obstacles to the acquisition of aluminium and other composite materials, which although used to a lesser extent by the company, present the same difficulties in terms of availability, costs and approval requirements.\n\n## AENOR CERTIFICATION: CIRCULAR ECONOMY STRATEGY\n\nGiven the challenges of defining priorities in the circular economy, AENOR has developed a certification of the Circular Economy Strategy Management Model. This model provides organisations with a reference framework that helps determine the relevance of the aspects to be addressed and identify their contribution to international circular economy principles. In this regard, Gestamp has worked during 2023 on obtaining the AENOR Circular Economy certification, demonstrating its firm commitment to innovative practices in this area.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for AENOR ESTRATEGIA.

An example of this are the agreements signed in 2023 with [Tata Steel](https://www.gestamp.com/Medios/Prensa/Comunicados-de-prensa/2023/Gestamp-y-Tata-Steel-firman-alianza-para-aumentar-casi-al-doble-el-acero-reciclado-en-su-produccion), [SSAB](https://www.gestamp.com/Medios/Prensa/Comunicados-de-prensa/2023/Gestamp-y-SSAB-inician-una-alianza-para-utilizar-acero-libre-de-fosiles) and [Arcelor Mittal](https://www.gestamp.com/Medios/Prensa/Comunicados-de-prensa/2023/ArcelorMittal-y-Gestamp-firman-un-acuerdo-de-circularidad).\n- **•** Collaboration with customers to align with their expectations and requirements.\n- **•** Approval and validation of new materials with a high recycled material content, in a collaborative environment between steel mills, the customer and Gestamp.\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/18 description: The image shows a dense forest from an aerial perspective. The canopy is lush and green, with varying shades indicating different types or ages of trees. The trees are closely packed together, creating a continuous blanket of foliage. Some tree trunks are visible, appearing as thin, light-colored lines amidst the greenery. The overall impression is one of a healthy and thriving forest ecosystem.\n\n#### EXAMPLE OF GREEN STEEL APPROVAL\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp has begun carrying out the first tests with new, more sustainable materials thanks to the alliances forged with steel suppliers. In this sense, a steel with a high content of recycled material (>75%) and produced with renewable energy through an electric furnace (EAF) has been tested for the manufacture of a component of the chassis division. The first tests have proved successful, determining that this new material does not affect the proper performance of the part.\n\nThanks to the analysis of the product's carbon footprint (*cradle-to-gate*), it has been determined that with this material we could reduce the equivalent CO2 emissions of the component by up to 63%.\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/22 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing the carbon dioxide emissions of green steel and conventional steel. The y-axis is measured in kg CO2 eq. The bar for green steel has a value of 11.93, while the bar for conventional steel has a value of 32.38. A note below the chart states that the result assumes all the stamped parts in green steel. For the analyzed part the result is 16.39 kg CO2 eq. achieving approx. 50% of reduction.\n\nAlthough steel is the Group's main raw material, and most of the actions have been focused on this material, work is also in progress on signing agreements with aluminium suppliers to comply with the emission reduction and circularity requirements of customers, particularly projects related to battery boxes for electric vehicles.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

This integration allows greater control over the management of metals, obtaining better traceability, and promoting and enabling their use in the production of low-emission steel and with a high content of recycled material.\n\nIn this regard, and thanks to the integration of Gescrap, Gestamp seeks to promote the availability of high-quality scrap in the automotive sector. An example of this is the agreement established with Tata on the mass balance where the amount of scrap supplied by Gestamp will be counted as part of the recycled steel material of the final product. In this way, the percentage of recycled material associated with the steel supplied to Gestamp has risen to 30% (from 17%), without it affecting quality, strength or conformability.\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/14 description: The image shows the logo for Gescrap.

The metal object is in the foreground and is the main focus of the image. There are some papers and a notebook on the table as well.\n\n#### **Gestamp in the vehicle life cycle**\n\n1\n\nVEHICLE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STAGE\n\nThrough our R&D departments, technological developments and customer and supplier collaboration, Gestamp offers solutions to reduce the weight of the parts it manufactures (one of the key factors in the commitment to the decarbonisation of the automotive sector). At this stage, the selection of production processes associated with manufacturing also plays a fundamental role.\n\nLikewise, it becomes necessary to integrate, from the initial design conception phase, the possibilities of the materials used at the end of the useful life of the vehicle, in order to facilitate its recovery (ecodesign).\n\n2\n\nMANUFACTURING STAGE Gestamp uses environmental and social criteria to select its suppliers.\n\nAs a Tier 1 supplier of automotive components, Gestamp focuses its manufacturing activity on:\n\n- **•** Optimising the consumption of raw materials and natural resources.\n- **•** Optimising production processes and logistics.\n- **•** Energy efficiency.\n- **•** Correctly managing waste generated.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Analysis of product life-cycle as a strategic element**\n\nIn an environment where a common language becomes necessary when measuring the impact of a product on the environment and society, Gestamp is committed to life-cycle analysis as a differentiating factor in the development of its parts. These analyses:\n\n- **•** Provide a global perspective of the complete life-cycle of products in the development phase.\n- **•** Make it possible to show the impact on use and end of useful life, which is decisive when codesigning a part.\n- **•** Help highlight and reliably quantify the Group's circular strategy.\n\nDespite the fact that the analyses carried out to date have focused on the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and on intermediate analyses of the product's life cycle (Cradle-to-Gate & Gate-to-Gate), Gestamp is considering the possibility of including other categories of future environmental impact such as resource depletion and toxicity. Gestamp also aims to promote the complete analysis of the product life cycle (Cradle-to-Grave) in the coming years. For this, Gestamp has an internal PCF tool (Product Carbon Footprint) which carries out these analyses.\n\n#### PCF GESTAMP TOOL\n\nGestamp has developed an automated carbon footprint calculation tool for the parts that it manufactures, mainly focused on the Chassis and Body in White divisions, although it plans to expand its scope to Tooling and Edscha. This tool has as its main input a complete database called Life Cycle Inventory adapted to Gestamp's main production processes and the most used raw materials. During its building, a detailed analysis of all production processes was carried out together with the energy efficiency team and its real-time consumption monitoring tool. Likewise, with highly relevant departments in the company, such as the purchasing department, which has worked on obtaining information on suppliers and raw materials; and the engineering and commercial departments, which knew the technical detail of the parts to be analysed.\n\nDuring 2024, the aim is to certify the calculation methodology behind the PCF tool, as well as the inventory on which it is based.\n\nImage /page/82/Figure/20 description: The image shows a diagram of the life cycle of a product, from cradle to grave. The diagram is divided into three sections: Cradle, Gestamo Gate, and Grave. The Cradle section includes the raw material extraction and material manufacture stages. The Gestamo Gate section includes the auto-parts manufacture stage. The Grave section includes the final product assembly, use stage, and end of life stages. The diagram also includes information about the emission factor material, logistics and material information, Gestamp production information, and scope 3 and scope 1 & 2.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION](#page-59-0)\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group had 94% of its plants certified according to the ISO 14001:2015 and/or EMAS standard. During the year, 2 new certifications have been achieved: Gestamp Pune II and Gestamp Wroclaw; and the certifications of Gestamp Kaluga and Gestamp Saint Petersburg have been lost due to the situation of these plants due to the war in Ukraine.\n\n[4.1 Road to Neutrality](#page-60-0)\n\nEach plant is audited both externally and internally every year. In order to carry out internal audits, the Group encourages cross audits in which two specialists from two plants audit a third plant in order to share experiences, replicate solutions, propose improvements, etc. This project is currently implemented in plants in Spain, Portugal, Germany and Brazil.\n\nFurthermore, internal audits have been carried out in all plants that are included in the scope of the Zero Waste certification.\n\nAs a new measure implemented in 2023, internal audits have been carried out on the environmental information reported by the plants on the ENVRA platform. Through the verification of invoices and internal documents, it has been verified that the data on water, energy and waste consumption is correct and accurate. These audits have been carried out both electronically (plants in Spain) and in person (USA, France) and will be progressively extended over the next few years until they cover 100% of the Group.\n\n#### **Resources earmarked for environmental prevention: people, provisions and guarantees**\n\n[4.2 Cicularity](#page-75-0) **[4.3 Environmental Management](#page-84-0)**\n\nGestamp has a professional team dedicated to complying with environmental requirements both at the corporate level and at each of the production plants. Environmental technicians report quarterly to the corporate team, who monitor and evaluate the indicators.\n\nAll investments in systems, equipment and facilities in relation to the protection and improvement of the environment, as well as any expenses incurred with regard to the protection and improvement of the environment are set out below:\n\n|                                               | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Environmental investments<br>(thousands of €) | 4,520 | 5,046 | 6,918 |\n| Environmental expenses<br>(thousands of €)    | 1,685 | 1,965 | 2,295 |\n\nRegarding environmental risks, Gestamp makes financial provisions to cover their implementation. Additionally, the company has guarantees in the form of insurance that can cover the occurrence of environmental risks:\n\n- **•** Environmental Liability Insurance.\n- **•** Third-Party Liability Cover for Sudden and Accidental Pollution in the General Third-Party Liability policy.\n\nDuring 2023, three environmental incidents have taken place in the USA that have affected the exterior surface of the factory; But in none of the three cases has it been necessary to activate the guarantees of the Environmental Liability Insurance that the Group has contracted. In 2022, there were no environmental incidents that caused the Environmental Liability Insurance to be activated.\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/24 description: Two men are standing in front of a large industrial machine.

At plants where surface treatment processes take place, such as painting or galvanising parts, or hydroforming processes, there is an industrial use of water. Only 29% of the Group's centres have such a process.\n\nTo monitor the development of water consumption, we use the Water Consumption Index, WCI, which measures the m3 of consumed water/€100,000 of added value. The significant variation experienced in this index depends on the part being painted, which directly relates to the projects being worked on with the customer at any given time.\n\nThe painting of skin parts, which will eventually be placed on the outside of vehicles, involves certain quality requirements that make it essential to frequently change the baths on the cataphoresis lines. As such, there is a considerable increase in water consumption. Conversely, the baths can be reused in the treatment of structural parts, which entails a low water consumption and a reduction in the WCI.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group's level of activity has increased and yet a reduction in water consumption can be seen as a result of the saving measures implemented in the production centers. In this way, the Water Consumption Index has been reduced compared to the previous year.\n\n| Water consumption according to the source (m3) | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Public Network                                 | 1,383,704 | 1,584,713 | 1,570,338 |\n| Surface Water                                  | 0.241     | 0.240     | 0         |\n| Underground Water                              | 255,162   | 206,835   | 183,212   |\n| Total                                          | 1,639,107 | 1,791,788 | 1,753,550 |\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/19 description: A close-up shot captures a hand emerging from the water, with the fingers extended upwards.

Gestamp works to reduce all this consumption by identifying and implementing good practices.\n\nTo a lesser extent, representing 2% of total consumables, products such as oil, paint and chemicals necessary as auxiliary materials for the development of productive activity are used in plants.\n\nEfficiency in processes, quality, product and tool design are fundamental in order to optimise and reduce raw material consumption. Therefore, Gestamp monitors all of this every quarter by means of different management systems of the Group controlled by the plants, divisions and corporate from different perspectives, in addition to the environmental perspective, such as the areas of finance, purchasing, quality and the technical office, with the ultimate goal of achieving operational excellence.\n\n| Consumo de Materias Primas y Materiales Aprovisionados (% Tn) | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Steel                                                         | 97%       | 96%       | 96%       |\n| Aluminium                                                     | 2%        | 3%        | 3%        |\n| Other procured materials:                                     | 1%        | 1%        | 1%        |\n| Paint                                                         | 0.05%     | 0.05%     | 0.1%      |\n| Oil                                                           | 0.05%     | 0.06%     | 0.09%     |\n| Binder agent                                                  | 0.09%     | 0.03%     | 0.06%     |\n| Welding wire                                                  | 0.26%     | 0.19%     | 0.34%     |\n| Electrodes                                                    | 0.01%     | 0.01%     | 0.01%     |\n| Chemical products                                             | 0.09%     | 0.06%     | 0.14%     |\n| Welding gases                                                 | 0.44%     | 0.60%     | 0.001%    |\n| Steel consumption per region (Tn)                             | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n| Europe                                                        | 1,485,081 | 1,540,072 | 1,667,939 |\n| North America                                                 | 1,112,524 | 541,567   | 541,748   |\n| South America                                                 | 250,737   | 282,541   | 321,024   |\n\nAsia 188,349 274,452 293,752 **Total 3,036,691 2,638,632 2,824,468**\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/18 description: The image shows a row of large, silver metal coils.

Of this total, 28,095 tons would correspond to non-hazardous waste and 28,395 tons to hazardous waste.\n\nOf the total of non-hazardous waste, 95% corresponded to scrap metal. Scrap metal is a waste product that is 100% recyclable. Its reintroduction into the steel production process contributes to closing its life-cycle in accordance with the circular economy model.\n\n#### **Hazardous waste**\n\nIn the hazardous waste category, the most frequently generated type is contaminated water, sludge, used oils and contaminated materials (cloths and gloves stained mainly with oil).\n\n| Types of waste generated (Tn) | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hazardous Waste               | 23,289    | 24,034    | 28,395    |\n| Non-Hazardous Waste           | 23,222    | 26,982    | 28,095    |\n| Scrap                         | 998,309   | 959,696   | 1,051,236 |\n| Total                         | 1,044,820 | 1,010,712 | 1,107,726 |\n\n#### **Non-Hazardous Waste**\n\nThe most frequently generated non-hazardous waste categories are wood, solid urban waste and paper/cardboard:\n\n|                                      | 2021  | 2022  |       | 2023    |                                       |                                   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|---------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Type of waste (%)                    | %     | %     | %     | Tonnes  | Waste not<br>intended for<br>disposal | Waste<br>intended for<br>disposal |\n| Wood                                 | 33%   | 31%   | 33%   | 9,161   | 8,724                                 | 437                               |\n| Solid urban waste                    | 25%   | 25%   | 27%   | 7,460   | 2,230                                 | 5,230                             |\n| Paper/cardboard                      | 13%   | 11%   | 13%   | 3,657   | 3,450                                 | 207                               |\n| Non-hazardous sludge                 | 4%    | 4%    | 8%    | 2,346   | 1,833                                 | 513                               |\n| Other non-hazardous metals           | 12%   | 12%   | 6%    | 1,767   | 1,759                                 | 8                                 |\n| Other non-hazardous waste            | 8%    | 2%    | 4%    | 1,204   | 192                                   | 1,012                             |\n| Plastic containers                   | 3%    | 3%    | 4%    | 1,157   | 1,104                                 | 53                                |\n| Non-hazardous oil                    | 2%    | 2%    | 2%    | 638     | 630                                   | 8                                 |\n| Process furnace waste                |       | 1%    | 0.3%  | 72      | 27                                    | 45                                |\n| Inert waste                          |       | 9%    | 2%    | 634     | 469                                   | 165                               |\n|                                      | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  |         |                                       |                                   |\n| Type of hazardous waste              | %     | %     | %     | Tonnes* | Waste not<br>intended for<br>disposal | Waste<br>intended for<br>disposal |\n| Polluted water                       | 69%   | 74%   | 74%   | 20,881  | 17,482                                | 3,399                             |\n| Used oil                             | 8%    | 4%    | 4%    | 1,134   | 1,077                                 | 57                                |\n| Sludge                               | 8%    | 8%    | 8%    | 2,367   | 444                                   | 1,923                             |\n| Other waste                          | 6%    | 1%    | 1%    | 299     | 10                                    | 289                               |\n| Contaminated material                | 3%    | 3%    | 4%    | 1,177   | 584                                   | 593                               |\n| Used oil filters                     | 0%    | 0%    | 0%    | 77      | 2                                     | 75                                |\n| Blasting dust                        | 2%    | 2%    | 1%    | 368     | 224                                   | 144                               |\n| Cutting oil                          | 1%    | 3%    | 2%    | 698     | 587                                   | 111                               |\n| Welding powder                       | 1%    | 1%    | 1%    | 152     | 36                                    | 116                               |\n| Contaminated packaging               | 1%    | 1%    | 1%    | 375     | 141                                   | 234                               |\n| Chemical products                    | 1%    | 1%    | 1%    | 331     | 25                                    | 306                               |\n| Others                               | 1%    | 1%    | 3%    | 834     | -

During 2023, the business volume prior to the COVID and chip crisis has recovered. New projects have been started in several plants and this means a greater generation of waste during the first stages of the projects as a consequence of the modifications in the plant lines, which then stabilizes when entering production. Even so, thanks to the Circular Economy model implemented in the Group, it has been possible to maintain the Waste Production Index at a level similar to that achieved the previous year.\n\nRegarding the Waste Management Index, the increase observed is due to the general increase in costs. Due to generalized inflation, during 2023 spending on waste management has increased more than added value.\n\n| Waste Production Index Evolution                                               | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Waste Production Index (tonne of waste/€1,000 million euros of<br>added value) | 17   | 15   | 16   |\n\n \\* Having increased the added value (11%) compared to last year, and maintaining the trend in the generation of total waste, the reduction in the index becomes more notable.\n\n| Waste Management Index Evolution                                                                         | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Waste Management Index (cost of waste management in thousands of euros/€10 million euros of added value) | 19   | 19   | 21   |\n\n#### **Zero waste certification**\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp continued to maintain the AENOR Zero Waste certification which it obtained in 2021, highlighting its Circular Economy model, capable of reintroducing the waste it generates back into the value chain.\n\nThe Zero Waste Regulation takes into account two types of certifications:\n\n**•** Zero Waste. Recovery of more than 90% of waste (excluding scrap metal)\n\n**•** Towards Zero Waste. Recovery of more than 60% of waste (not taking scrap metal into account)\n\nThe verification, which has been carried out online and in person at all the plants within the certification perimeter in India and Brazil, has proven that the waste management systems of 63% of the Group's plants meet the requirements for the existence of complete traceability of waste. This monitoring includes, from its generation to its delivery to a manager for its recovery, ensuring the non-existence of waste with final destination to landfills and verification of the legal requirements associated with the waste management process.\n\nOut of the percentage of verified plants, 15% obtained the Zero Waste certification (more than 90% of waste) and the remaining 48% meet the requirements for Towards Zero Waste (more than 60%).\n\nThe follow-up audits also highlighted the high level of collaboration and involvement of all participating staff in the process of implementing the scheme, the tidiness and cleanliness of the waste storage areas in all the plants audited, and the integration of some specific requirements of the Zero Waste Management System into the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems.\n\nImage /page/93/Figure/25 description: The image shows a comparison of zero waste initiatives. The first section, labeled \"ZERO WASTE,\" indicates that 16 plants are involved. Of the waste produced, 98% is scrap, with 100% recycling and material recovery. The remaining 2% is other waste, with >90% recycling and material recovery. The second section, labeled \"MOVING TOWARDS ZERO WASTE,\" indicates that 51 plants are involved. Of the waste produced, 98% is scrap, with 100% recycling and material recovery. The remaining 2% is other waste, with >60% recycling and material recovery.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-108-0\"></span>Image /page/108/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

As such, we strive to provide them with the training and tools needed for their professional growth, focusing on upskilling and reskilling to develop their talent regardless of age, gender, race or nationality.\n\nThe continuous growth and internationalisation of Gestamp has given rise to significant challenges in terms of culture, organisation and human resource management. The constant adaptation of the organisational structure to the growing needs of the Group, as well as workforce resizing, process standardisation, training in new technologies, talent management and the fostering of the corporate culture have all played a key role for Gestamp.\n\nThe double materiality assessment that was performed identified several impacts, risks and opportunities linked to the material topic **Company employees**:\n\n#### IMPACT\n\n| Development of the technical skills of our employees through adapted and<br>continuous training                                                                | + | Image: Green triangle  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|------------------------|\n| Safeguarding of rights in relation to freedom of association or alternative measures                                                                           | + | Image: Green triangle  |\n| Establishment of a robust due diligence process that allows for the prevention,<br>mitigation and remedy of potential human rights violations.                 | + | Image: Green triangle  |\n| Increase or zero reduction in the employee gender gap.                                                                                                         | - | Image: Yellow triangle |\n| Operational difficulties and issues with project continuity due to low talent retention and high staff turnover.                                               |   |                        |\n| Fines, sanctions and strikes arising from breaches in relation to trade union activity and employee association, affecting the company's image and reputation. |   |                        |\n| Reputational damage and administrative sanctions due to a lack of due diligence regarding human rights in suppliers, subcontractors and company employees.     |   |                        |\n| OPPORTUNITIES                                                                                                                                                  |   |                        |\n| Attraction of specialist and qualified staff due to new talent attraction plans that cover the company's new needs and safeguard its future development.       |   |                        |\n| Increase in worker motivation due to policies and plans to boost motivation.                                                                                   |   |                        |\n\n#### RISKS\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nImproved reputation thanks to how the company's commitment to defending and respecting human rights is received by stakeholders.\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/21 description: The image contains two icons.

The corporate training team has worked with educational institutions such as Comillas Pontifical University, the University of Deusto and several professional training centres and business schools to develop programmes that help meet the Group's needs in relation to highly specialised profiles.\n\nIn response to business demand on both a corporate and global level, Gestamp continues collaborating with the University of Deusto – giving classes on the Master's in Automotive Design and Manufacturing course – and Comillas Pontifical University, with its Chair for Connected Industry.\n\nIn 2023, the corporate selection team has mainly worked on the 3 following talent attraction initiatives:\n\nFirstly, in collaboration with the corporate communication team, the selection team has sponsored **Formula Student** teams from the University of the Basque Country, Comillas Pontifical University in Madrid, the Technical University of Catalonia, Carlos III University in Madrid and Poznan University of Technology in Poland. 1 3\n\nAs part of this sponsorship, as well as providing financial support for each team to help them meet the financial and/or functional costs of their project activities, Gestamp has appointed a technical adviser from the Group as a mentor to guide and support each team through the vehicle design and manufacturing process. This has meant that the different teams can get to know Gestamp, learn about our technologies, products and processes and be supported by our R&D, I4.0 and Advanced Engineering areas.\n\nSecondly, the corporate selection team, in collaboration with the internal communication and culture team, has worked on the launch of **monthly newsletters**. These newsletters feature the job vacancies published on the internal portal Gestamp Jobs with the aim of boosting talent attraction and internal mobility. The newsletters have different themes and mainly focus on vacancies within a specific department or geographical area with a high volume of recruitment, such as the USA. 2\n\n3\n\nThirdly, in collaboration with the **ICEX Vives grants**, a global talent attraction and recruitment programme has been launched under which Gestamp has hired 50 recent graduates to work in production engineering, industrial engineering, processes, quality, logistics, control, etc. in various plants across Europe, the UK and the USA. Under this programme, 50 young people have started their professional career at Gestamp with a 12-month ICEX grant and subsequent commitment to remain at a foreign plant for a total of 2 years. As a brief summary, the number of positions offered per country were as follows:\n\n| 6<br>GERMANY        | 2<br>HUNGARY        |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 8<br>FRANCE         | 4<br>BULGARY        |\n| 7<br>UNITED KINGDOM | 23<br>UNITED STATES |\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n## **Recruitment and selection**\n\nAfter the design and roll-out of the **Corporate Selection Policy** in 2022, 2023 saw the launch of reinforcement sessions and a weekly **audit** on the regions focusing on the onboarding process. The aim of the audit is to measure the extent to which this process is being fulfilled in accordance with the Corporate Selection Policy.\n\nWe also began to **incorporate the CID perimeter** in the Recruiting and Onboarding modules of the global selection tool (**SAP SSFF**) that was introduced in 2022. This perimeter could not be created and incorporated in 2022 because the corresponding taxonomy module was not finished.\n\nLastly, to measure the level of implementation of the global selection tool (SAP SSFF), a monthly audit was launched to audit the total number of hires performed each month in the tool following the procedure set out in the Corporate Selection Policy. Currently, the level of hires performed in accordance with the corporate procedure stands at 70%.\n\nAs an additional initiative linked to this point, in 2023, corporate selection KPIs were defined and automated, a structured control panel was developed and a global governance model was launched.\n\nThe aim of this control panel is to help our HR teams to quickly understand the status of the selection processes within their scope, providing them with a top-level overview of the key performance indicators (KPIs). Below follows a brief summary of the defined indicators:\n\nInternal\n\nexternal hires\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/17 description: The image shows a blue icon of a person with a circular arrow around them.

As such, personal and professional development is nurtured through a training model with the following key aims:\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/13 description: The image contains text describing Gestamp's view on the importance of people's talent and ability to work in a team. It states that these qualities are essential for Gestamp's success and that personal and professional development is nurtured through a training model with key aims.\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/14 description: A group of people are sitting around a table in a meeting room.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Talent development**\n\nThe process of developing and retaining talent is essential for the Group to have the best professionals and ensure the success of its strategy.\n\nThe company's growth in new markets and geographical areas has meant developing and providing career opportunities for employees in the organisation both in and away from their place of origin.\n\nIn addition, Gestamp has created a talent pool of highly trained professionals, leading to an increase in the internal promotion rate in 2023, rising to 93% in the case of division directors and country managers. In the case of plant managers, the internal promotion rate is 76%. This figure is somewhat lower due to the emergence of new markets where local hiring is more advisable. If we look at mature areas, such as Spain, France and Portugal, the internal vs external promotion rate jumps to 84.2%.\n\nIn 2023, as part of the Atenea Transformation Plan, Gestamp continued to work on strengthening the talent management programme on a uniform basis across all regions. Thus, the Group's talent is identified by a combination of two variables: employee performance and potential. In order to do this, an assessment process is carried out for a large section of the organisation, the results of which are reviewed on a yearly basis by the heads of each organisation and their Human Resources teams.\n\nIn 2023, this was launched for all employees classed as office staff, with a success rate of 97%. In this regard, all managers and HR teams have been trained to guarantee full understanding and proper implementation of the initiative.\n\n#### **Performance appraisal**\n\nAt Gestamp, work has been done to shift the performance system towards a waterfall goal-setting meritocratic method that uses strategic priorities to link employee performance to the achievement of the Group's strategic objectives.\n\nThis system increases transparency, gives employees a clearer idea of what is expected of them and allows them to focus their work on achieving said objectives. As part of this system, the performance appraisal consists of a series of individual goals set at the start of the year by the manager of each employee based on the priorities set by the Group, a personal improvement goal and a series of leadership skills that will vary depending on the individual's role within the organisation. At the end of the year, each manager evaluates each goal and each skill, producing a final performance rating. Meetings are then held with the area managers to review and confirm the results of the appraisals and to draw up action plans where necessary.\n\nTo reward our employee's hard work, motivate them and align our interests, the evaluation of the individual goals set at the start of\n\nthe year by the manager of each employee will be reflected in a percentage of the employee's annual variable remuneration, which consists of the following elements and relative weightings:\n\n- **•** Financial goals, with a relative weighting of 50%\n- **•** Strategic goals, with a relative weighting of 25%, including ESG goals\n- **•** Individual goals, with a relative weighting of 25%\n\nTo make sure that these goals are achieved, feedback is used by managers as a key management tool. As such, in 2023, we launched a communication and training campaign to develop a culture of feedback and achieved 92% participation across all managers in the organisation.\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/26 description: A woman wearing safety glasses and a dark blue t-shirt with a logo on it is standing in a factory.

The number of employees who participated in training activities was 323,060 and the average number of training hours per employee was 28.\n\n| Average training hours                    | 2021      | 2022        | 2023      |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| Total number of training hours            | 1,094,712 | 1,146,150.5 | 1,226,762 |\n| Average direct workforce                  | 40,494    | 41,616      | 43,893    |\n| Average hours of training per<br>employee | 27        | 27.5        | 28        |\n\n#### FOSTERING A CULTURE OF LEARNING\n\nAfter designing and launching the Corporate Training and Development Policy in 2022, several initiatives were carried out in 2023 to strengthen a culture of learning, knowledge sharing and collaboration among employees and the implementation of practices and tools that promote learning and continuous improvement.\n\n#### **Online learning campus update**\n\nTo continue promoting learning at Gestamp, in March 2023, we rolled out the new Gestamp Global Learning platform across the entire organisation. The aims of this update to our learning platform were to improve user experience, offer new programmes that are aligned with our global objectives and quality standards and to ensure that all Gestamp staff have access to a broad range of training programmes at any time and from any location.\n\nIn line with this idea of \"Anytime & Anywhere\", a mobile app was created so that all users, regardless of their role at the organisation, can access the training programmes. Through this mobile app, we can break down the barriers to training faced by some users who do not have access to a computer or the internet as the app allows for offline training.\n\n#### **Integration of LinkedIn Learning training content**\n\nTo further boost learning and development opportunities for Gestamp staff, in April 2023, the LinkedIn Learning training catalogue was added to our online learning platform. This catalogue includes over 16,000 courses in 13 different languages and is accessible from any device.\n\nThe content is applicable across a range of areas, in addition to specific Gestamp content, and it is delivered by leading experts in current areas of interest. In addition, the content consists of videos that are under 5 minutes long, offering the flexibility to continue learning \"in the flow of work\".\n\nIn 2023, a total of 1,500 licences were purchased.\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/23 description: The image shows four LinkedIn Learning courses. The first course is titled \"Fundamentos de Inteligencia artificial: Redes neuronales\" and has a duration of 1h 30min. The second course is titled \"Fundamentos de Inteligencia artificial: Machine Learning\" and has a duration of 1h 30min. The third course is titled \"TensorFlow esencial\" and has a duration of 3h 30min. The fourth course is titled \"Trabajo colaborativo con Microsoft: SharePoint, Teams, Grupos y Viva\" and has a duration of 1h 30min.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Cross-cutting knowledge aside, our priority is the **processes and technologies that help us stand out on the market and that will help meet future business** \n\nThanks to this model, our staff can find what they need at any time and can reach out to experts in any area of knowledge\n\nTo implement this transfer of knowledge, the Technological Knowledge Transfer Committee was created with business representatives and facilitated by the training and development\n\nteam. The key actions of this committee are:\n\n## ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in a dark blue sans-serif font, with three horizontal lines above it.

The third chart, titled \"TOTAL EXTERNAL TRAINING HOURS VS INTERNAL\", shows percentages of 26% and 28%.\n\nEmployees are mainly trained in the workplace, which is a highly practical approach as it guarantees they develop knowledge of the Group's industrial processes and allows them to constantly adapt to technological innovation and customer requirements in areas such\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, Gestamp's plants continued to focus on staff training and development, delivering a total of 1,200,795 hours of training. A total of 304,651 employees took part in this training, with each employee completing an average of 27.4 hours of in-\n\n#### **Global programmes**\n\nIn addition to the training reflected in these figures, we also ran **global training programmes led by the Corporate Training and Development team**, amounting to a total of 25,967 hours of training with 22,842 participants.\n\nSome of the highlights of the global training programmes are:\n\n#### GES-GIGASTAMPING® TRAINING\n\nAs on other occasions, thanks to the continued collaboration between the training team and the Office of Technology and Innovation (TIO, Spanish acronym), we identified the need for an internal training workshop on hot stamping for extreme size parts: GES-Gigastamping®.\n\nThe workshop focused on product design, simulation and dies. It covered the entire stamping process and closed with Gestamp Mason's experience of manufacturing these parts.\n\nAnother key element was the opportunity for participants to expand their network of contacts within the Group and to identify experts in different fields. Given the size of the Group and the range of locations, this aspect is essential for sharing experiences and improving practices.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the Gestamp Technology Institute, Gestamp Group's training centre of excellence, saw over 120 people complete this exciting training workshop.\n\n#### 2022 MOE: Office staff MOI: Indirect labour 2023\n\nMOD: Direct labour\n\nplant training.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The programme has spanned a total of 265 hours.\n\nIt has been delivered by an external provider and monitored at all times by internal staff. It has also included regular progress meetings with the students.\n\nTen people started the programme, of which eight have already joined Gestamp and are working on projects in Madrid and Boroa.\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/20 description: A group of about a dozen people are standing in a factory.

As such, our Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out a series of rules and regulations in line with the relevant legislation in force, ethical standards and social responsibility.\n\nTo ensure that all staff are aware of the Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, we have designed online training available in the 16 languages used in the Group. This training is compulsory for all existing staff or newly hired staff since November 2023. It provides an understanding of the pillars of the Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy and the protocols to be followed in the event of any form of harassment in the workplace.\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/14 description: The image shows a course introduction page with the title \"Hello!\" and the text \"Welcome to this new course about Gestamp's equality, diversity and inclusion policy.

This programme aims to ensure that our plant directors have the right level of skills, a global culture and a shared leadership approach.\n\nIt has been adapted specifically to our needs and developed by Gestamp in collaboration with the Hult Ashridge business school. Feedback from participants in the first edition of the programme informed the design of this second edition to create a highly refined programme.\n\nThe learning plan started in May 2023 with 27 participants and will finish in March 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, in October 2023, we launched the first edition of the \"**Leadership Development Programme**\". The aim of this programme is to develop and promote a solid foundation in leadership and to strengthen the skills of Gestamp professionals, equipping them to take on more senior roles in the future.\n\nThis programme, developed by Gestamp in collaboration with the Hult Ashridge business school, focuses on the development of key leadership skills, promotion of strategic thinking and enhancement of interpersonal skills, training leaders who can excel in complex business environments.\n\nA total of 96 participants with different profiles and from 14 different countries were selected take part in this first edition of the programme, which will run until June 2024.\n\nIn terms of our commitment to developing female talent, as in previous years, we took part in the Promociona executive development programme run by the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE).\n\nLastly, the 2023 training programme for members of the Board of Directors was aligned with the company's strategic objectives and structured around ESG, electric vehicles, cybersecurity and the Criminal Risk Prevention Plan. It consisted of 5 online sessions with e-learning content that could be accessed through the Gestamp Global Learning online campus.\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/25 description: A group of about 30 people are standing on a staircase.

While these benefits are managed locally and will vary depending on the country where the employee works, the company is working on a proposal to ensure access to a minimum level of benefits in all countries, thereby improving the Group's employee value proposition.\n\nGestamp is constantly looking for ways to continue offering programmes that are adapted to the local conditions in each country, raising up its employees to empower them and support them according to their different needs.\n\nIn 2023, we organised initiatives that focused on our employees' physical and emotional wellbeing, supporting the different cultures and customs in each country. These initiatives took place in a range of different locations, always in line with local customs, and included sports activities, family days, volunteering, mental health awareness activities and cultural activities. All these activities shared the common goal of promoting healthy lifestyles, teamwork and commitment. In addition, various employee benefit programmes were implemented in a range of countries, considering the specific needs of each group and market. These benefits included a flexible remuneration plan, physiotherapy, annual health checks, employee assistance programmes, discount packages for savings on day-to-day expenses, etc.\n\nThe percentages of Gestamp Group employees with access to some of the main benefits are presented below:\n\n| Benefit                   | % of employees with access to the<br>benefit |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Health insurance          | 72%                                          |\n| Life insurance            | 74%                                          |\n| Pension plan/Savings plan | 56%                                          |\n| Wellbeing benefits        | 68%                                          |\n\nThe employee value proposition will continue to be a central theme in Gestamp's 2024 benefits strategy.\n\nSeeking to improve the employee experience and our commitment to sustainability, seeking to generate a positive impact on employees throughout the Group.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/123/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

This capacity to move talent provides flexibility and agility when executing projects.\n\nThere are two types of groups:\n\n- **•** Personnel with short-term assignments: professionals who move for periods of 3 to 12 months.\n- **•** Personnel with long-term assignments: professionals who, due to the particular circumstances of the project and the country, move for periods of 1 to 5 years (maximum) and, in most cases, with their families.\n\nOnce the ultimate goal has been achieved, these employees return to their original work centres, leaving the project in the hands of local employees, who take with full or near-full responsibility for its management.\n\nWe have a Corporate Policy that aims to establish, order, define and oversee the regulations and guidelines that govern employee expatriation within the Group, regardless of the country of origin and/or destination country.\n\nIn 2023, we had a total of 67 expatriate employees working abroad for over a year, providing international support.\n\n#### PERSONNEL WITH LONG-TERM TRANSFERS PER COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND DESTINATION\n\n| Country        | Origin | Destination |\n|----------------|--------|-------------|\n| Brazil         | 1      | 1           |\n| Bulgaria       | -      | 4           |\n| China          | -      | 14          |\n| France         | 2      | 2           |\n| Germany        | 4      | 4           |\n| Hungary        | -      | 1           |\n| India          | -      | 2           |\n| Morocco        | -      | 2           |\n| Mexico         | 2      | 6           |\n| Poland         | -      | 5           |\n| Russia         | 1      | 2           |\n| Slovakia       | -      | 3           |\n| Spain          | 50     | -           |\n| Sweden         | 1      | -           |\n| United Kingdom | 4      | 1           |\n| Turkey         | -      | 2           |\n| USA            | 2      | 18          |\n| Total          | 67     | 67          |\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Flexibility and work-life balance measures**\n\nGiven the nature of the business, at Gestamp's production plants, groups classified as Direct and Indirect Labour have to work in shifts. However, Gestamp promotes shift rotation with the aim of facilitating the adjustment of working hours to workers' specific needs.\n\nFor office-based workers in many regions, remote work measures have continued to be employed, in addition to other measures that promote flexibility and a good work-life balance, such as flexible working hours.\n\nIn 2023, 109 of Gestamp's work centres (103 in 2022) implemented measures related to improving the work-life balance.\n\n#### **Collective bargaining agreements and freedom of association**\n\nAt Gestamp, labour relations are managed in accordance with union and labour legislation that applies to each geographical area. With union representation in each production plant, all aspects relating to union, labour and employee contractual relations are negotiated.\n\n## 66% of employees are protected by a collective agreement.\n\nIn 2023, 66% of employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement (67% in 2022). There are specific Occupational Health and Safety Committees in most production plants. In 2022, 93% of plants had employee consultation and participation mechanisms in place relating to occupational risk prevention (3% less than in 2022 since Turkey is not excluded).\n\nIn certain geographical areas, where required due to historical, cultural or legal obligations, we have inter-centre committees that complement the in-plant negotiating framework.\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/20 description: A man wearing safety glasses and gloves stands in a factory.

The most common channels are the local and corporate intranet, the internal newsletter, the satisfaction and organisational climate survey, the suggestion box and the information channels.\n\nEmployees also have access to established communication channels at the Compliance Office through which they can report or submit queries regarding the Code of Conduct. The Group has a corporate intranet that provides information on the most significant matters relating to the organisation on a corporate, divisional, plant and individual level.\n\n100% Scope of the consolidation perimeter.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"Gestamp\" in a bold, dark blue font.

These surveys were aimed at a total of 43,674 employees, which corresponds to 98.67% of the total Group workforce at the end of the year. The average number of employees satisfied with the Organization has been 79.14%.\n\n*To reach this figure, the results were standardised to come up with a global satisfaction score given that each work centre conducted a specific survey for its workforce.* \n\n#### **Absenteeism**\n\nThe absenteeism rate at Gestamp is stable and has improved compared with the previous year, standing at 4.4%. The total number of absenteeism hours in 2023 was 3,477,290, representing an average of 6.6 absenteeism hours per month per employee. These absenteeism hours include absences due to common illness (67.3%), work-related accidents and illnesses (15.9%), accidents on the way to/from work (0.4%) and absences without a valid reason (10.8%).\n\n#### TOTAL HOURS OF ABSENCE BY REGION\n\n|                |                         | 2022       |          |                         | 2023       |          |  |\n|----------------|-------------------------|------------|----------|-------------------------|------------|----------|--|\n| Region         | Scheduled hours of work | Abs.

In addition, the amounts have been converted to euros using the average exchange rate for 2023. By including the exchange rate variable, the differences between remuneration may be due to macroeconomic variables that are not linked to the Gestamp remuneration policy.\n\nThis calculation method is the same as the method used for the past two years and therefore the data is comparable.\n\n#### **Average remuneration by professional category broken down by gender in 2023 for the whole Group**\n\nJust as in 2022, to calculate the average remuneration for 2023, we have chosen to calculate it by category. This allows us to obtain uniform collectives from a responsibility point of view, an aspect which is directly linked to our employees' remuneration.\n\n|                     | 2023    |         |         | 2022    |         |         |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Global Gestamp      | Men     | Women   | Total   | Men     | Women   | Total   |\n| Directors (1)       | 177,972 | 144,648 | 173,565 | 166,985 | 119,232 | 160,185 |\n| Middle managers (2) | 79,529  | 74,807  | 78,529  | 73,027  | 67,910  | 72,043  |\n| All other employees | 26,796  | 22,540  | 25,943  | 25,206  | 21,461  | 24,486  |\n| Total               | 29,795  | 24,955  | 28,826  | 27,982  | 23,523  | 27,126  |\n\nAverage remuneration data includes theoretical total annual wages.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nThe gender pay gap is the clearest indicator in terms of methodology when analysing the difference in salary between men and women. It is calculated by taking the average remuneration of each country (including fixed salary and variable remuneration, extrapolated to full-time hours and for the whole year). The calculation per country takes into consideration the relative size of each country by dividing it among all eligible employees. This allows us to achieve a reliable global indicator of the difference in salary between men and women.\n\n| 7.90% | 6.60% | 7.83% |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n\nThe result of the salary gap calculation is 7.9% for total remuneration (fixed remuneration + variable remuneration).\n\nThe same calculation method was used in financial year 2022.\n\nThe 2022 salary gap calculation is based on the great effort made by the company in implementing its own unique global professional classification system, named Gestamp Group Grading System (G3S). The system was fully introduced by the end of 2022, reaching a maximum level of classification detail. In 2023, classification audits were performed to ensure the quality of the data and reflection of the organisational changes in the classification system. The work performed in 2022 and the revisions in 2023 have given us an up-to-date, robust and reliable database for comparing positions with the same level of remuneration.\n\nThe analyses were based on the active workforces at 31 December 2023 in 21 countries (Argentina, Germany, Brazil, China, South Korea, Slovakia, Spain, USA, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Czechia, Russia, Sweden, Taiwan and the UK). In 2023, Russia was added to the analysis, while it was excluded in 2022 given the geopolitical situation. As a result, the scope covers 97.1% of the Gestamp workforce (excluding joint ventures) and a total of 38,001 employees. In 2022, the scope covered 36,468 employees. Joint ventures were excluded from the calculation because Gestamp is not responsible for managing their remuneration.\n\nFollowing the methodology used in 2022, the analysis does not include interns, expatriate workers, cases of long-term leave, partial retirement and companies that do not use the SAP HCM system. These exclusions make up the difference between 97.1% of the Gestamp workforce and 100% of the Gestamp workforce.\n\nThe gender pay gap calculation is made using the theoretical annual remuneration, extrapolated to full-time hours. This information is automatically extracted from the SAP HCM system. To reaffirm the quality of the data and review of eligible employees, all information has been validated with the local HR teams. The automated extraction of the entire database was possible thanks to efforts to improve data quality in recent years. These improvements include the interconnection between payroll systems and the definition of salary additions across the Group.\n\nThe method, aligned with the method used in 2022, compares employees in positions with the same level of remuneration according to the Gestamp classification system (G3S). The levels of remuneration are used to define the salary bands. This allows the policy to be linked to objective criteria and guarantees there is no discrimination of any kind.\n\nThe following table shows the workforce broken down by gender for the past three years. If we compare this year with the previous year, there is a clear improvement in the number of women, rising from 19.20% of total employees in 2022 to 20.18% in 2023.\n\nIn terms of women holding positions of responsibility, according to the Gestamp Global Grading System (G3S) methodology, 13.66% of management and 21.46% of medium-level positions are held by women. In the case of middle management, there has been a significant increase in the presence of women, rising from 18.80% in 2022 to 21.46% in 2023, surpassing the total percentages of women in the organisation.\n\n|                             |        | Women  |        |        | Men    |        |  |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--|\n| Professional Classification | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2023   | 2022   | 2023   |  |\n| Directors                   | 13,66% | 14,30% | 15,30% | 86,34% | 85,70% | 84,70% |  |\n| Middle managers             | 21,46% | 18,80% | 20,40% | 78,54% | 81,20% | 79,60% |  |\n| All other employees         | 20,20% | 19,30% | 18,60% | 79,80% | 80,70% | 81,40% |  |\n| Total                       | 20,18% | 19,20% | 18,60% | 79,82% | 80,80% | 81,40% |  |\n\nScope: Gestamp workforce, excluding joint ventures.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/130/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n## DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\nGestamp promotes diversity, recognising it as a key competitive advantage for its business, while it gives priority to equity and inclusion in its people management model. Gestamp respects the rights of equality and non-discrimination on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, social origin, ethnic origin, age, disability and religion, among others. This is provided for in the company's Code of Conduct and the sixth goal of the UN Global Compact, which the Group has complied with since 2008.\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp approved an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy that promotes equal opportunities, non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion of all Gestamp Group employees, in accordance with the legislation in force in each country and following international good practices. This includes the provisions of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) approved by the UN, specifically SDG 5: Gender Equality and SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities.\n\nIn 2024, as part of the Strategic ESG Plan, we are planning to create a Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion plan for the whole Group. With this plan, we aim to perform a deeper analysis of diversity across the different geographical regions and to strengthen the areas of action for specific groups.\n\n#### **Gender diversity**\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp has worked on the geographical expansion of its gender equality policies through the following actions:\n\n- **•** Approval of the Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, the aim of which is to create a positive environment that facilitates and promotes equal opportunities, non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion of all Group employees.\n- **•** Implementation of the Equality Plan at the Gestamp management companies. Each plan is aligned with Group and legislative criteria and is managed and implemented on a local level. Similarly, the Corporate team has worked on communication campaigns, training on the Equality Policy and the sexual harassment prevention protocol, among other actions, to support implementation on a local level.\n\nAt Gestamp, women represent 20% of the Group's total workforce.\n\nThe automotive industry clearly has plenty of work to do to reach gender parity, due in part to the traditional masculinisation of the sector and the continued underrepresentation of women in STEM careers (science, technology, engineering and maths).\n\nGestamp strives to increase the proportion of women in its workforce. This effort is reflected in the percentage of female recruits, which grew from 22% in 2018 to almost 27.5% in 2023. This shows a positive trend, thanks in large part to the measures included in the Equality Plans at Group level and the awareness of the Group's HR teams.\n\nIn terms of women holding positions of responsibility, 13.3% of management and 21.0% of mediumlevel positions are held by women. In the average remuneration analysis, we have chosen to group by category rather than by type of labour as this allows for a better reflection of the pay reality by creating homogeneous groups in terms of responsibility, which is reflected in remuneration.\n\nIt's not always easy to find women in selection processes for certain common positions in the automotive sector, such as die-makers, welders and maintenance specialists. Even so, at some work centres, there is almost an equal ratio of women to men.\n\n| Region         | Female | Male  | Total 2022 | Female | Male  | Total 2023 |\n|----------------|--------|-------|------------|--------|-------|------------|\n| Asia           | 467    | 2,555 | 3,022      | 420    | 1,762 | 2,182      |\n| Eastern Europe | 267    | 535   | 802        | 337    | 526   | 863        |\n| North America  | 1,591  | 3,117 | 4,708      | 1,336  | 2,737 | 4,073      |\n| South America  | 262    | 1,298 | 1,560      | 225    | 1,138 | 1,363      |\n| Western Europe | 569    | 1,699 | 2,268      | 618    | 1,575 | 2,193      |\n| Total Gestamp  | 3,156  | 9,204 | 12,360     | 2,936  | 7,738 | 10,674     |\n| %              | 25.5%  | 74.5% | 100.0%     | 27.5%  | 72.5% | 100.0%     |\n\nIn 2023, 27.5% of new hires were women, which is 7.5 percentage points higher than the percentage of women on staff (20%)\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Below the globe is a laurel wreath. To the right of the UN Global Compact logo is the text \"TARGET GENDER EQUALITY\" in white, sans-serif font. On the right side of the logo is a circle made up of different colored segments, each representing one of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n#### **BEST PRACTICES**\n\n#### **GESTAMP PARTICIPATES IN THE 4TH TARGET GENDER EQUALITY ACCELERATOR PROGRAMME.**\n\nThe Target Gender Equality accelerator programme, organised by the UN Global Compact, provides companies with support in defining and reaching ambitious business objectives in order to promote gender equality. This initiative is run in collaboration with the Global Compact Local Networks and helps companies set targets and develop capacity-building actions to increase women's representation and leadership.\n\n#### **BEST PRACTICE IN FOSTERING FEMALE TALENT IN INDIA.**\n\nIn its plants in India, Gestamp has started the 'Gender Equality Vision 2020-2025' programme with the aim of reaching a 20% female workforce by 2025. In the context of an inclusive workplace, this plan has been created to guarantee the recruitment, training and development of female professionals, implementing policies to ensure a workplace that is safer and has the utmost respect for female talent.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Cultural and geographical diversity**\n\nGestamp sees its heterogeneous workforce as an opportunity for the Group to find better solutions to the current global challenges.\n\nGeographical and cultural diversity is one of the distinctive features of the Gestamp workforce: Over 40,000 professionals with 95 different nationalities work across 24 countries. In each country where the company operates, there is an average of 13 nationalities at each geographical location, while the countries with the greatest cultural and geographical diversity are: Germany, Spain, the UK and France, with 46, 42, 32 and 27 different nationalities in each workforce, respectively.\n\nThis geographical diversity is incredibly enriching for Gestamp, a company that is committed to hiring local talent as a key source of creativity and innovation. In addition, this helps develop an increasingly more inclusive Group in terms of country of birth, culture, race and sex. Gestamp works to find points of cooperation between people from different cultures and to make the joint project and shared identity their own.\n\n#### NATIONALITIES OF GESTAMP EMPLOYEES\n\nImage /page/132/Figure/16 description: This bar chart shows the number of speakers of different languages.

This interaction between different generations is very enriching for Gestamp because it encourages innovation in problem solving, as each generation brings a different perspective.\n\n**[See Annexes: Average number of employees by contract type, age and gender](#page-201-0)** \n\nImage /page/133/Picture/14 description: Three men are gathered around a piece of machinery. One man is wearing an orange safety vest and pointing at the machine. The other two men are wearing red shirts and looking at the machine. The machine is purple and has various pipes and tubes attached to it.\n\n#### **Functional diversity**\n\nGestamp Group companies directly hire people with disabilities to their workforce to facilitate their entry to the job market, and they also outsource products and services to special employment centres.\n\nThe number of employees with a disability across the entire Group in 2023 was 952 (941 in 2022), representing 2.2% of the Group's workforce, with 206 people with disabilities hired via goods and services.\n\nFor adaptations or the construction of new facilities, Gestamp hires local engineers that prepare the projects in accordance with local regulations, complying with all accessibility requirements. Furthermore, in order to make information more accessible, the Gestamp website meets all Level A criteria established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).\n\nImage /page/133/Picture/19 description: A woman wearing safety glasses, a dark blue shirt with a white logo, and gray gloves is working in a factory.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n[6. Governance](#page-155-0)\n\nGestamp's approach to prevention has evolved over time: while the company once focused on the standard practice of controlling accident rates, it now has an ambitious management system all of its own. Its system sets out safety criteria in relation to working conditions and management requirements at 100% of Gestamp's production centres. It is even more stringent than the requirements of local legislation in some countries.\n\nIt is also used to assess health and safety performance and provides a road map for continuous improvement.\n\nThe following principles are included in **[Gestamp's Occupational Health and Safety Policy](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Sustainability/Commitments/Health%20and%20safety/Politica-de-Salud-y-seguridad-en-Gestamp-(pdf).pdf?ext=.pdf)**:\n\n- **•** Health and safety issues must be integrated into daily tasks and decision-making both in the design phase of the workplaces themselves, of each system to be used or of each piece of work equipment, as well as during their operation for the performance of the activity.\n- **•** Preventing occupational accidents and diseases is the essential aim of this Policy. It is achieved by preventing and minimising the risks to the health and safety of people. The company therefore undertakes continuous improvement and actions based on risk analysis.\n- **•** Complying with the legislation of all countries in which the Gestamp Group operates. However, the internal Health and Safety Policy is the Gestamp Group's standard, as it goes beyond what is required by law in most cases.\n- **•** Risks that are important due to their severity, that is, those that may lead to serious accidents, must be prevented or minimised using technical means.\n- **•** By establishing suitable regulations and procedures, as well as training, we can control risks that we have not been able to prevent.\n- **•** Under no circumstances should activity be placed before safety.\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/16 description: In an indoor shot, a man wearing safety glasses, earplugs, and gloves is working in a factory.

The badge has a scalloped edge and is attached to two ribbons.\n\n#### **Experience**\n\nCreation os manuals and supporting documents. Safety standards, management guides, detailed specifications, good practices.\n\n#### **GHSS features**\n\nThe GHSS Management System is integrated at all organisational levels and implemented at 100% of production plants operated by Gestamp, meaning that it regulates the activities of 47,099 employees (41,608 internal and 5,491 external employees) or 95% of all employees.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/16 description: The image shows an icon of two people. The person in the front is wearing a hard hat.\n\n#### **Professionalism**\n\nAn extensive team of professionals dedicated to prevention, from corporate level to the plants to provide their opinions when undertaking improvement and starting new projects. Experts in working and prevention management conditions that seek best practices and solutions and define the direction of the system.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/19 description: The image shows a right triangle with a solid blue outline. A dashed blue line forms the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n\n#### **Measurement**\n\nGestamp Health & Safety Indicator (GHSI) is an internal tool designed by us and adapted to the particularities of the company's activity, reaching higher levels of demand than those required by international standards. It enables us to analyse 78 factors equally in all the Group's plants\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/22 description: The image is completely white and contains no discernible content or features.\n\n#### **Integration**\n\n**Communication**\n\nCollaboration with other corporate departments so that Helath and Safety is another aspect to consider in new projects. Full integration is sought: layout design, machinery and facility purchasing, training, and corporate policies. The Health and Safety team regularly participates in audits and collaborative projects with strategic areas of the Group such as Industry 4.0, Standardisation, Purchasing and Sustainability.\n\nComputer applications and web communities that support the system. The applications allow control of everything related to the GHSI: quartely reviews, audits and reports; while the web communities generate discussion forums and document repositories and share information with all of the Group's plants.\n\n#### RESPONSIBILITY AND FUNCTIONS AT ALL LEVELS\n\nPlants must manage health and safety with the same level of knowledge and standards that they use in their core business.\n\nThe model is supported by senior management. Each year a Leadership Meeting is held, where the overall targets for improvement are established based on the Indicator. In addition, the results are submitted to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, along with a progress report on the corporate plans and other important matters.\n\n| Group Managers<br>they manage the global numbers<br>for each plant of division.                                     | Image: Person with globe               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Division Managers<br>Overview of the situation.

It is a robust system that is implemented across the entire Group, and recognised at all organisational levels. The Gestamp Group has gone another year without recording a fatal accident, which is a milestone for an industrial group.\n\nTaking into account the robustness of GHSS and the organisation's commitment to Health and Safety, in 2022 a decision was made to certify the system under the international standard ISO 45001.\n\nIn record time, almost 100% of the Group's plants have achieved ISO 45001 certification through the multisite model (except for the 4 plants located in Russia, due to the war in Ukraine).\n\nThis achievement has been possible thanks to having a prior system such as GHSS, fully implemented across the organisation, demonstrating Gestamp's firm commitment to Health and Safety, as well as the continuous work and effort of every team.\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/16 description: The image is a logo for ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Internal auditing systems**\n\n#### FULL ON-SITE PLANT AUDITS EVERY TWO YEARS (2-5 DAYS) QUARTERLY REMOTE AUDITS\n\nWhen a plant enters the system, a full audit is conducted on site at the plant. In addition to assessing the safety conditions and prevention management in place at the plant, this is used to provide safetyrelated training to the parties that are directly responsible in this regard.\n\nOnce it is part of the system, these audits are repeated every two years in order to ensure that the indicator continues to reflect the actual safety situation at the plant. They also allow the Group to verify on-site whether the improvements made and approved remotely each quarter have been consolidated, to refresh safety standards and to get first-hand feedback from the plants.\n\nFace-to-face audits were cancelled during 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, and resumed in 2022. Audit rates returned to normal in 2023, with 50% of plants being audited every two years, and despite the prolonged suspension of audits, the system has continued to operate to a satisfactory standard in the Group.\n\nThese are audits of factors that the plant aims to improve; they are conducted remotely through the use of an internally developed IT application.\n\nThe plants must report their improvements in the first 15 days of each quarter. The improvements are first validated by the Division-level prevention managers, who act as advisors, then move on to the audit phase.\n\nThe criteria followed are exactly the same as for full audits and the same auditors review them. The difference is that only the improvements proposed by the plants, which have been validated by their advisors, are audited. To guarantee the use of uniform criteria, there is a guide linked to the indicator that outlines the criteria.\n\nIn addition, other documents are also being produced that provide further details on the criteria of certain factors of the indicator, such as hygiene risk management, subcontractor management, working at a height, maintenance of metal shelving and management of lifting devices, to name a few.\n\n828 **FACTORS** reviewed in the year\n\nImage /page/140/Picture/22 description: A high-angle shot captures a group of four individuals gathered around a light-colored table, seemingly engaged in a collaborative work session.

Participation in sector associations and forums.\n- **•** Comparative analysis activities with other companies.\n\n#### SAFETY ALERTS\n\nSerious accidents and incidents with implications on prevention within the Group are used as an awareness-raising measure.\n\nThe investigation carried out by the plant, together with a video or photographs of the event are shared via the prevention web community. This information is completely anonymous. The important thing is not where it happened, but that it happened at a Group work site, and we must prevent the situation from repeating itself in another.\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/14 description: A man wearing a face mask, ear protection, and gloves is working on a machine in a factory.

Corporate provides support and monitoring to production plants, focusing on certain factors of the GHSI indicator: specific training, definition and modification of equipment and work sites, machine malfunctions and maintenance.\n\nCorporate and divisional teams work together with production plants to create supporting documents to meet the proposed objectives, and to follow up closely with quarterly meetings to check on the implementation of the factors.\n\n#### Steps taken in 2023:\n\n- **• Plan Launched Globally:** To mark the World Day for Safety and Health, a communication campaign was launched through One Gestamp and material was also provided locally by Corporate.\n- **• Corporate publications of assistance:** Guides and procedures were prepared and published for all the factors included in the Plan, except for \"Definition of machinery and installations\", which is expected to be addressed in early 2024.\n- **• Regular meetings between Corporate and Divisions/ Regions to keep track of improvements:** In 2023, a total of 34 meetings were held. Plans are in place to arrange further meetings, the frequency of which depends on the extent to which the improvement is taking effect.\n\n#### **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**\n\nGestamp has set up a task force to coordinate the task undertaken by different corporate departments - of replacing forklift trucks with AGVs in the production areas of plants.\n\nOn the basis of the work undertaken by the task force, it will be possible to:\n\n- **•** Factor safety criteria into the design of logistics flows, in the case of new projects, or into the adaptation process being undertaken by Operations\n- **•** Factor safety criteria into the Industry 4.0-based plant simulation\n- **•** Identify and assess current safety criteria and adapt them to new conditions arising from the introduction of the AGVs. They relate to storage, movement of loads and workstation design, all of which respectively have a bearing on the plant layout design.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/25 description: A woman wearing a navy blue t-shirt with the word \"Gestamp\" on it, blue gloves, and blue arm sleeves is working with a metal frame.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Artificial intelligence**\n\nGestamp Corporate is analysing various AI-based solutions to increase employee Safety:\n\n**• ErgoIA** is biomechanical software that has been developed by the Biomechanics Institute of Valencia. It uses artificial intelligence to assess ergonomic risks.\n\nThe system analyses recorded videos and issues ergonomic risk reports automatically, which reduces the time spent on the assessment of repetitive tasks and unnatural postures by up to 80%.\n\n**• Cameras incorporating AI technology** to help and assist the operation of forklift trucks. Particularly in areas of poor visibility or during reverse manoeuvres.\n\n#### **Safety Radars**\n\nSafety radars can be integrated into most of Gestamp's processes to improve safety levels in:\n\n- **• Access protection:** Prevent access to danger zones.\n- **• Machinery reset prevention:** Stop machinery from starting unexpectedly while the operator is in a danger zone.\n- **• Anti-collision:** Prevent collisions when machinery is in motion, involving the operator, other machinery or suspended loads.\n\nThe radars have been tested in 3 plants across Spain, focusing on different uses, and plans are in place to deploy them at other European plants. The tests at these pilot plants enable us to identify and determine other uses.\n\nPublications are issued and duly updated to inform all other plants of the test results.\n\n#### **Psychosocial Risk Assessment**\n\nFollowing the addition of the new factor to the group indicator in 2022, psychosocial assessments have been carried out at several plants.\n\nThe importance of psychosocial factors for workers' health has been increasingly recognised. Changes in organisations, current globalisation processes and exposure to psychosocial risks have become more frequent and intense, making it appropriate and necessary to identify, assess and control them in order to prevent the associated risks to health and safety at work.\n\nIn order to monitor plant implementation more exhaustively and encourage improvement, a new factor has been created to define Gestamp's psychosocial assessment model.\n\n#### **Training**\n\nVarious corporate training initiatives have been carried out:\n\n- **• Training for Plant Managers**: The purpose of this training initiative is to involve the Group's Management Team, regardless of level, in Health and Safety management in order to prioritise the resources needed to implement the necessary preventive strategy.\n- **• Training for plant health and safety (H&S) professionals:**  Check-lists are created and published for every factor in order to facilitate the simulation/self-audit undertaken by H&S officials in respect of the GHSS factors related to Working Conditions and Prevention Management.\n\n#### **Publications**\n\nBesides the guides relating to the factors included in the 2025 Plan, plants were able to refer to the following documents published in 2023:\n\n- **• New documents:**\n- **-** Press Line Safety Standard.\n- **-** Works with Risks of Fire.\n- **-** New Machinery Directive 2023/1230 Compliance Guide.\n- **• Document reviews:**\n- **-** Ergonomic Assessment Procedure.\n- **-** Matrix Machinery Safety Guide.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>Image /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Responding to the needs of society and contributing to the improvement of people's quality of life is essential in order to grow as a company.\n\nGestamp's social action must reflect its commitment to society and must contribute to generating a positive impact on the communities and environments where it operates.\n\nGestamp seeks to align its social contribution with its business activity, through medium and long-term social projects in the communities in which it operates, reinforcing trust between those communities and the company, and enhancing its positive contributions.\n\nGestamp's **[Social Action Policy](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Sustainability/Sustainability%20at%20Gestamp/2022_11_07-Politica-de-accion-social_Gestamp.pdf?ext=.pdf)** establishes the strategies followed by the group's social initiatives: commitment to local communities, alignment with local communities and being sustainable over time.\n\nGestamp collaborates in local initiatives promoted by both economic (business, technology, innovation clusters and associations) and social and environmental organisations (road safety, education, environmental awareness, socio-economic development, among others).\n\nAs part of the **ESG Strategic Plan**, objectives have been established in the Social Contribution area with 2025 in mind, linked to the Social Action strategy and to Gestamp's support for the local communities where it has a presence, with the intention of generating a positive impact.\n\nImage /page/145/Figure/19 description: The image shows a table with two columns: Description and Level of achievement. The first row in the Description column is \"Reach a minimum annual social action figure (€1.3M).\" The corresponding row in the Level of achievement column shows that in 2023, the figure was 1.13M€, and in 2025, the figure was 1.3M€. The second row in the Description column is \"Achieve at least 70% annual alignment of the group's global initiatives with the strategic areas of Social Action.\" The corresponding row in the Level of achievement column shows that in 2023, the alignment was 81.55%, and in 2025, the alignment was 70%. The third row in the Description column is \"Conduct socio-economic impact studies in markets where Gestamp operates.\" The corresponding row in the Level of achievement column shows that in 2023, 1 country was analyzed, and in 2025, 2 countries were analyzed.\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/20 description: In a well-lit classroom setting, a group of approximately ten students, predominantly female, are seated at a long table, attentively listening to a male instructor.

Inclusive education is a human right that improves people's quality of life, facilitates access to decent work and favours their economic progress and that of their families.\n\nGestamp's Social Action Area promotes initiatives aimed at combating school dropout rates, extracurricular support, equal opportunities and access to education for vulnerable groups.\n\nIn addition, emphasis is placed on technical training projects and the promotion of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) vocations, with a greater focus on those groups that are less represented in these areas of knowledge.\n\nSDGs related to EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/16 description: The image contains three icons representing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). From left to right, the first icon, in red, represents \"Quality Education\" and features an open book and a pencil.

Turkey and Morocco suffered major earthquakes that were very destructive. In both cases, the solidarity and quick reaction of Gestamp's plants was exemplary, especially in the locations closest to the disaster areas.\n\nIn addition, at a global level, the corporate Social Action team set up channels of collaboration through the NGO **[World Central](https://wck.org/es-es)  [Kitchen](https://wck.org/es-es)**, so that all Group employees had the opportunity to make donations in a safe manner, with the guarantee that the aid would reach the affected area.\n\nIn both cases, Gestamp undertook to contribute the same amount raised by employees, doubling the donation.\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/16 description: The image shows a map icon with a location pin on it, next to the text \"Earthquake: TURKEY MOROCCO\".\n\n€20,215 €5,152 **TURKEY MOROCCO**\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The handshake is surrounded by a few small blue dashes.\n\n**Collaboration:** Gestamp works with institutions, non-governmental organizations, private companies, educational and other entities for the effective development of its social action. Relationships and collaborations with public or private institutions are aimed at combining efforts to support the community.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/16 description: The image shows a calendar icon with an hourglass in front of it. The calendar has three circles on top, and the hourglass is filled with a blue gradient.\n\n**Long term:** Gestamp's social action initiatives and its relationship with communities, as well as its business activities, are intended to be permanent in the medium and long term.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/18 description: The image shows a group of three people represented by simple line drawings. The figures are arranged in a cluster, with one figure slightly in front of the other two. All three figures are wearing collared shirts and ties. The lines are blue, and the image has a clean, minimalist style.\n\n**Employee involvement:** social action initiatives provide the opportunity to channel concerns over solidarity and commitment, which is why Gestamp encourages volunteering among its employees.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/20 description: The image shows a stylized eye icon. The eye is outlined in a dark blue color, and the iris is a lighter blue circle within the eye.\n\n**Ethics and Transparency:** Gestamp takes an ethical and transparent approach to its collaborations with other bodies, so that these collaborations are not exploited for purposes contrary to the applicable legislation at any given time. The Group's established procedures for third party due diligence shall be applied.\n\n![map pin icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/material-design-icons/master/maps/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_place_24px.png)\n\n**Adapting to local needs:** For every project it undertakes, Gestamp is committed to initiatives that are flexibly adapted to the local needs and demands of the communities in which it operates.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/24 description: The image shows a blue and purple rocket ship taking off. The rocket ship is angled slightly to the left and has a small window near the top. There are clouds of smoke coming from the bottom of the rocket ship, indicating that it is in motion.\n\n**Leaving an impact:** the ultimate goal of\n\nGestamp's social action is to create a positive impact on the local communities where it operates and to contribute towards improving people's quality of life, beyond its own business activity.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/27 description: A group of approximately 30 people are posing for a photo in front of a dark brown wall. The group consists of both men and women, mostly young adults, and they are arranged in a semi-circle, with some kneeling in the front and others standing behind them. To the left of the group, there is a large, light blue teardrop-shaped flag with white designs on it. Next to the flag, there is a white sign with blue writing on it. To the right of the group, there is a small, striped booth with a triangular flag hanging from it. The floor is light gray with blue dotted lines on it.\n\n#### **Collaboration with non-profit organisations**\n\nTransparency in Gestamp's collaboration with Associations and Non-Profit Organisations is essential for the proper functioning of the projects and their sustainability over time.\n\nTo monitor and measure the impact of the initiatives that Gestamp carries out, the Business for Social Impact (B4SI) methodology is taken as a reference. Furthermore, in 2023, with the aim of strengthening the impact measurement system, Gestamp once again has the consulting firm Mas Business, from the LBG Group. In this way, a double verification of the measurement of the impact of Social Action is guaranteed.\n\nWith the intention of improving impact measurement and better analyzing the social impact of the initiatives carried out by Gestamp, this year the number of beneficiaries of social projects has been incorporated into the reporting campaign. With the initiatives carried out in 2023, a total of 464,827 direct beneficiaries have been impacted.\n\nIn 2023, a total of 229 social and non-profit activities have been identified in which the company has worked together with 187 collaborating entities and in which a total of 1,565 employees have participated voluntarily, the total value being of the contribution of 1,126,291.67 euros.\n\nBy type of contribution, the majority of activities were made as a monetary contribution (89.6%), followed by contributions in kind (7.7%) through volunteer actions carried out by Gestamp employees. The contribution in kind has represented 2.7% of the contributions.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/152/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Putting this commitment into practice, the company is actively involved in a range of initiatives geared towards social, economic and technological issues, in the form of business clusters and associations.\n\nEstablishing alliances and fostering understanding between the different actors in society and the sector is fundamental to creating a sustainable business ecosystem. This is how Gestamp sees it, and its participation in organisations and institutions is very active.

Riberas, Executive Chairman of Gestamp, renewed his position for two more years as Chairman of the Spanish Association of Automotive Suppliers (SERNAUTO), a position he has held since 2021, with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of component manufacturers and continuing to consolidate the Spanish supplier industry both inside and outside Spain.\n\nThe commitment to innovation has always been a constant at Gestamp and is reflected in its participation in organisations such as the University Institute for Automotive Research and the COTEC Foundation. Gestamp is constantly innovating in order to strengthen its position as a technological leader and to guarantee the sustainability, efficiency and competitiveness of its production processes and products.\n\nKnowledge transfer is also a priority in the business model, where the Group collaborates in various educational and dual vocational training programmes.\n\nParticipation in technology partnerships helps in the process of transferring knowledge of a new technology, which is the usual mechanism by which the organisation adapts to the requirements of new projects. These new projects also end up fostering socio-economic development as a whole.\n\nGestamp holds the presidency of the Spain-China Council Foundation and the vice-presidency of the main automotive clusters, and actively participates on the boards of directors of the main bilateral chambers of commerce.\n\nThe institutional relations area seeks to show different institutional audiences Gestamp's contribution to society, collaborating in the development of public policies and regulations as a corporate citizen, with ethics, transparency, integrity and professionalism in our institutional dialogue.\n\nFurthermore, Gestamp is registered in the EU Transparency Register and abides by the rules and principles set out in Annex I of the Interinstitutional Agreement.\n\nImage /page/153/Picture/21 description: A close-up shot depicts a stack of hands, creating a sense of unity and teamwork.

During these, suppliers must implement an action plan approved by Gestamp with the aim of improving the quality of both the product and the service provided. In 2023, 27 different suppliers participated in\n\n### ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/3 description: The image shows three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, with the word \"INDEX\" written below them.

This policy sets out the underlying principles that are to govern it, which include the following:\n\n- **•** Equal treatment and transparency. This principle states that the selection of directors shall be transparent and free from implicit bias, so as to guarantee the same opportunities for all qualified candidates.\n- **•** Diversity. This principle states that diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, backgrounds, nationalities, age and gender shall be encouraged, in order to enrich the decision-making process and to bring different perspectives to discussions on matters within the Board's competence.\n\nThe Board of Directors' Knowledge, Skills, Diversity and Experience Guide sets out the knowledge, skills, diversity and experience that the Board of Directors as a whole must possess such that it serves as a reference and support tool for the Board of Directors' Selection Policy.\n\nThis guide, approved on 14 December 2017 by the Board of Directors at the proposal of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, develops the aforementioned principles and establishes that, for the purposes of selecting candidates and re-electing directors, and in the event of equal knowledge and experience, diversity is to be encouraged, thus preventing discrimination on the grounds of gender, age, culture, religion\n\nand race. It also establishes that the composition of the Board of Directors is to be in accordance with the demographic reality of the markets in which the Company operates.\n\nIn pursuit of this principle of diversity, and of gender diversity in particular, the Board of Directors' Selection and Diversity Policy establishes the Board's duty to ensure that the Company's diversity measures encourage a significant number of women in senior management positions within the Company, in accordance with the provisions of Recommendation 14 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies.\n\nAs a whole, the Board must possess the knowledge, skills and experience needed to guarantee the adequate governance of the Company in line with its activities, including its main risks, ensuring that it has effective capacity for independent and autonomous decision-making in the Company's interest. For the purposes of defining the skills, knowledge and experience that, as a whole, are deemed most appropriate for the Board of Directors and to verify the suitability of a candidate for a vacancy on the Board, the Nomination and Compensation Committee approves a competency matrix for the Board of Directors. The current Board of Directors' competency matrix is as follows:\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/20 description: A conference room is shown with a long wooden table surrounded by chairs.

On the same date, the results of their evaluation were submitted to the Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee. After analysing the results, each of the Committees issued a report on the evaluation. In addition, the Nomination and Compensation Committee, aided by the\n\nexternal consultant, prepared an action plan that was presented at the first meeting of the Board of Directors in 2024 together with the reports issued by each of the Committees.\n\nAlthough the results of the 2023 evaluation were positive, the action plan arising from the process includes a series of recommendations about operational aspects of the Board of Directors, which are to be implemented in 2024.

Good governance and transparency. The Board of Directors shall adopt any measures required to ensure good governance and transparency in the remuneration received by the Directors so as to guarantee the trust of investors and shareholders.\n\n[7.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nGestamp carries out its activities in multiple countries, markets and regulatory, political and socioeconomic environments and due to this the company is exposed to strategic, operational, financial, reputational and compliance risks, which must be mitigated in the most effective way possible.\n\nDuring 2023, the risks detected by the company are in line with those of the previous period, also taking into account the consequences derived from the ongoing international conflicts, which have generated an impact for companies and countries around the world.\n\nThese factors have led to the reinforcement of internal measures and policies to mitigate the different consequences derived, among others, from price increases and discontinuities in the supply of raw materials and energy.\n\nBelow are some of the main risks identified and the management measures established by the company:\n\nImage /page/177/Picture/15 description: The image shows an industrial robotic arm in an industrial setting.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/12 description: The image contains text describing the ability to adapt to drops in volumes, flexibility of production and absorption of associated costs, and uncertainty of sales volume forecasts.\n\nGestamp has been working for years on Industry 4.0 and digitalization projects aimed at making production more flexible and absorbing costs.\n\nGestamp's Smart Factory model allows us to face market uncertainties, with a new component assembly concept that makes it possible to adjust the installed production capacity to the real volumes of the different vehicles at all times.\n\nMultiple indicators of maximum sensitivity are also available for detecting situations of non-immediate adaptation.\n\nGiven the impossibility of anticipating events that could substantially alter vehicle sales volumes, Gestamp works to try to reduce the impact of this risk on the business. Among other measures, there are: the optimization of the cost structure to balance variable and fixed costs, the aforementioned Smart Factory model for the implementation of flexible production processes or the establishment of binding contractual clauses against drops in volumes, where may be possible.\n\n#### **Profitability deviations in the industrialization and production phases of the projects.**\n\nGestamp has GPCS (Gestamp Product Creation System), a system that regulates and collects all the procedures to be carried out in the study and pricing phase of the projects, serving as a repository of all the documentation of the different parts of the process, including that associated with risks. In this system, the different milestones of each project, their review points and those responsible are defined. This system is disseminated and implemented globally in the Group. Additionally, there is a global database that includes the history of incidents and lessons learned for consultation when preparing each new Business Case.\n\nFinally, for each launch and its corresponding Business Case, a deviation analysis is carried out and they are monitored from a specific corporate control department.\n\n#### **Volatility risks and supply management**\n\nMost steel is purchased through \"re-sale\" contracts agreed upon directly by automakers. For the rest of raw material supplies, Gestamp negotiates with steel suppliers purchase prices aligned with the agreements closed by customers.\n\nNumerous controls are carried out associated with the management of the logistics chain and daily controls of the stock level in conjunction with production forecasts. Gestamp has designed a long-term energy purchase strategy with PPA contracts (Power Purchase Agreement) with the aim of reducing the impact of price volatility.\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/23 description: The image shows a blue badge with a star in the center. The badge has a jagged edge and a ribbon hanging from the bottom.\n\n#### **Incidents related to the quality of Gestamp products**\n\nGestamp has a global quality management system that is the basis of the plants' systems, certified by internationally accredited independent organizations and also audited regularly by both clients and the internal quality audit team. Additionally, it develops quality standards with the best practices of the different plants to be implemented in all of them, with a special focus on manufacturing processes, as well as various computer tools that help with the effective deployment of work methodologies in the quality environment. typical of the automotive sector.\n\n#### **Cybersecurity risk and critical information leak**\n\nImplementation of the strategic cybersecurity plan in the plants and divisions, with various measures ranging from the reinforcement of barriers to access to information, to alert systems for intrusion attempts, phishing, malware, etc. or ongoing employee awareness activities. Update and reinforcement of liquid asset protection procedures. Classification of information by level of criticality and design of adequate protection.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The podium has a flat top with a raised edge, and a tall, thin stand. The microphone is attached to the top of the podium and has a small, round head.\n\n#### **Political and economic instability in the various countries in which Gestamp operates**\n\nGestamp monitors the geopolitical situation in all the countries in which it operates to evaluate and incorporate the effects of potential instability into the Group's forecasts and strategic and operational decisions and designs mitigating measures in this regard. Likewise, related factors and indicators are taken into account in the award of each new relevant project in countries with significant risk, through ad hoc reports and are shared in the committees responsible for making the decisions, as well as their mitigating measures.\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/16 description: The image shows an icon of two people, one wearing a hard hat and the other wearing a suit. To the right of the icon is the text \"Di er\".\n\n#### **Difficulty in identifying, selecting and retaining trained professionals in line with an environment of technological change and global growth**\n\nGestamp currently has a people management model that allows it to identify, on a homogeneous and consistent basis, the existing talent in the organization. This, together with other management tools such as training and development programs, mobility plans, and compensation programs, contributes to the development and growth of talent. Furthermore, based on the Group's strategic priorities, both in terms of growth and development and adoption of new technologies, it allows planning the talent needs in number and characteristics, for those environments where it is necessary.\n\n#### **Sufficient ESG objectives in the company's business model and their adequate achievement.**\n\nGestamp has established a long-term ESG 2025 strategic plan that has been designed to be in line with the risks identified in the Group and in line with the expectations of the different stakeholders. Governing bodies and ESG policies have been defined that determine the company's governance in this field, as well as multidisciplinary working groups at both the corporate and divisional levels. Finally, continuous monitoring activities are carried out.\n\n#### **Inadequate definition of the technological strategy**\n\nGestamp participates in co-developments with clients and multiple digitalization and Industry 4.0 initiatives. Additionally, a specific technological innovation roadmap has been defined for electric vehicles and other technologies. The activities are supervised and directed by the R&D Committee.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Regular assessment of foreign exchange exposure by geography and making hedging decisions. Monthly monitoring of its impacts. Establishment of contractual clauses with third parties for indexation of exchange rate variations.\n\n#### COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\nImage /page/180/Figure/17 description: The image shows a document with a seal on it. The document is white with blue lines, and the seal is blue with a white center.\n\n**Compliance risks associated with the various legislation and regulations to which the Group is subject.**\n\nContinuous monitoring of all regulatory changes that may affect Gestamp. There is a complaints channel with continuous activity and monitoring and regular reporting to the Group's Audit Committee.\n\nLikewise, the Group has a Criminal Risk Prevention Model, as well as a Criminal Risk Prevention Manual and the codes and policies associated with it, which are approved and reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors.\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/21 description: A close-up shot captures a wooden gavel resting on a black base, positioned in front of a brass scale of justice.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n**ESG risks**\n\nGestamp is aware that ESG risks are closely linked to the geographical location of its plants and the complexity of the automotive sector value chain. For this reason, through the ESG 2025 Strategic Plan, it also seeks to contribute to mitigating these risks with a double direction: towards the company and towards its stakeholders and environment.\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Management and the ESG Management have created a matrix that crosses Gestamp's risks with the areas of the ESG Strategic plan with a double objective: to ensure that the Risk Map is aligned with the company's new ESG strategy and know the degree of contribution of the different areas of the ESG Plan to the mitigation of the company's risks.\n\n#### LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTION OF THE ESG PLAN TO THE TOP 20 IDENTIFIED RISKS\n\nImage /page/181/Figure/15 description: The image shows a series of icons representing different areas of focus. From left to right, the icons are: a tree for Environmental Targets, a person with stars for Talent, a car for Circularity, a heart for Health & Safety, a building for Social Contribution, three people for Ethics & Good Governance, a cloud with CO2 for Road to Neutrality, and three circles connected in a loop for Supply Chain Responsible Management. The icons are arranged in a line, with some icons in a light blue circle and others in a light gray circle. To the right of the icons, there is text that describes the areas represented by the icons. The text indicates that the light gray circles represent areas that contribute to risk mitigation, while the light blue circles represent areas that, in addition to contributing to risk mitigation, are a source of competitive advantage.\n\nAfter analyzing this matrix, the following conclusions have been obtained:\n\n- Firstly, the most mature plan areas, that is, those in\n- which the company has been working for the longest time, meet their objective of mitigating risks such as the safety and health of workers, risks related to the quality of the parts supplied or risks of compliance and accountability.\n- In addition, the plan reinforces areas that mitigate risks related to the environmental, social and ethical 1 2 3\n\t- management of the supply chain or non-alignment with clients' ESG expectations or talent attraction and retention.\n- And mainly, the plan not only contributes to\n- mitigating risks, but also transforms some of them\n- into opportunities and competitive advantage, such as alignment with clients' climate change objectives or introducing the concept of circularity.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/182/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"Gestamp\" in a bold, dark blue font.

For more information see the Criminal risk prevention section.\n\nIn line with this commitment, Gestamp has a Compliance Department that operates through different bodies: the Ethics Committee, the Compliance Office and the Regulatory Compliance Unit. The Compliance Department supports the Board of Directors and, in particular, the Audit Committee, the supervisory body of the Code of Conduct, the Whistleblowing Hotline and the Group's internal control programmes.\n\nThe Compliance Policy establishes the governance structure of the Compliance Department: while the Ethics Committee, with the support of the Compliance Office, acts within the scope of the Code of Ethics and the Whistleblowing Hotline, the Regulatory Compliance Unit is limited to developing and monitoring the compliance programmes implemented in the Group.\n\nAdditionally, the Sustainability Committee monitors and oversees those aspects related to Human Rights such as the Policy, which was approved at the end of 2022 by the Board of Directors.\n\nImage /page/183/Picture/17 description: A slightly angled shot shows a white wall with the word \"Gestamp\" in silver, sans-serif letters.

This document is the common reference framework for the ethical and respectful behaviour of the members of the governing bodies and employees contractually linked with the Group companies or with any of the subsidiaries in which the parent company holds, directly or indirectly, the status of majority partner.\n\nIt contains the Rules of Conduct based on the Corporate Principles and on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact relating to human rights, labour standards, environmental standards and the fight against corruption.\n\nOn 7 May 2018, the Board of Directors of Gestamp Automoción, S.A. approved the current version of the Code of Conduct in order to adapt and update its content to meet the requirements arising from the new listed company status of the Group's parent company.\n\nThe **[Code of Conduct](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/About%20Us/Code%20of%20Conduct/Code-of-Conduct-ES.pdf?ext=.pdf)** can be found on the Group's website and Intranet and is available to both employees and third parties (suppliers, clients, local communities, etc.) in any of the 18 languages used by the Group.\n\n#### TRAINING\n\nAll Group employees and members of the governing bodies must have completed the introduction course on the Code of Conduct at least once. It also forms part of the induction plan for new employees, where they are given the document and asked to adhere to it. The Code of Conduct training can be carried out in the following ways:\n\n- **• Online training:** through the Gestamp Corporate University.\n- **• Face-to-face training:** For cases where the employee does not have access to an electronic device that allows them to carry out said online training.\n\nImage /page/184/Picture/20 description: Two copies of a document titled \"Código de Conducta\" are stacked next to each other. The document has the \"Gestamp\" logo at the top, followed by the title in large, bold letters. Below the title are four circular icons representing different aspects of conduct.

Therefore, special controls for human rights have been incorporated into the Group's supplier management platform: ESG risk prediction tool, self-completed questionnaire for suppliers and templates for identifying conflict minerals. (Further information: Responsible supply chain\n\n#### management).\n\nGestamp also has a whistleblowing hotline for employees and people linked in any way to the Group (employees, clients, suppliers, collaborators, partners, shareholders and investors and local communities, among others) which considers matters directly or indirectly related to human rights. (See Code of Conduct section).\n\nAs a result of the diagnosis, Gestamp has identified the need to strengthen some of its human rights violation protection measures such as:\n\n- **•** Annually update the identification and assessment of real and potential human rights risks.\n- **•** Ensure that the Human Rights policy is transferred to all Human Resources procedures and processes.\n- **•** Prepare a remediation protocol.\n\nFurthermore, Gestamp's plants in the United Kingdom have a specific internal policy called Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement to comply with the regulations, of an eminently criminal nature, existing in the UK (Modern Slavery Act).\n\nAdditionally, in its activities in Germany, Gestamp as implemented the Law for due diligence of the supply chain (LkSG).\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/193/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

This model, including the Criminal Risk Map and Criminal Risk Prevention Manual, is regularly revised and updated.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, work continued on updating and improving the Criminal Risk Prevention Model by extending the scope of evaluation processes for the design and effectiveness of controls, as well as establishing corrective measures for any shortfalls detected. In terms of promoting a culture of compliance within Gestamp, training on criminal risk prevention has continued, adapted to the risk profile for the professional activity of each employee. Likewise, a notice about the Gift Policy was sent to all employees, which detailed the fundamental aspects of the standard in order to promote greater awareness of it.\n\nFinally, in order to achieve better coordination and supervision of the control framework established on an international level, work has continued on revising the risks and controls set locally, with corrective action proposed where necessary.\n\nImage /page/193/Picture/15 description: The image is a blurry, abstract shot of an electronic display.

These illegal activities stunt economic and social development, undermine the rule of law and, from a business perspective, are detrimental to the market and corporate reputation.\n\nOn 17 December 2018, the Gestamp Board of Directors approved the Anti-Corruption and Fraud Policy, which expands on the internal regulations regarding corruption, fraud and bribery already established in the Code of Conduct. The Policy is applicable to directors, managers and employees who are contractually bound to the Group's companies, as well as any third parties that liaise with the Group.\n\nThe aim of this Policy is to send a strong and clear message of opposition to all forms of corruption, fraud and bribery and to explicitly state our commitment to avoiding said conduct within the organisation.\n\nTo this end, it establishes certain guidelines for action and the rules applicable to the performance of any business-related activity conducted within the Group in relation to:\n\nImage /page/194/Figure/16 description: The image shows five icons related to unethical behavior. The first icon depicts a briefcase with two hands shaking inside, labeled \"Corruption.\" The second icon is a money bag with a dollar sign on it, labeled \"Fraud and bribery.\" The third icon is a gift box with a bow, labeled \"Gifts and tokens of appreciation.\" The fourth icon shows a hand holding two coins with dollar signs, and the fifth icon is a podium.\n\nDonations or aid Political activity\n\nThe Group is also aligned with major international standards on corporate responsibility and anti-corruption, including the Tenth Principle of the UN Global Compact, the recommendations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, among others.\n\nCorruption, fraud and bribery also form part of the catalogue of risks found in the Group's Criminal Risk Prevention Model and, therefore, controls designed to prevent them from materialising have been introduced. This includes due diligence measures established to identify and manage the integrity risk associated with certain partners, customers and suppliers that Gestamp engages with based on its normal operations.\n\nAlthough the training given on criminal risk prevention has been adapted to the risk profile for the professional activity of each employee, all participants took the module on the prevention of corruption and bribery.\n\nWith respect to political activity, the Group does not take part in any activity of this kind, nor does it show support for, make financial contributions or give donations of any kind to political parties or their members.\n\nThis includes due diligence measures established to identify and manage the integrity risk\n\n#### PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM\n\nIn accordance with the legislation applicable in the jurisdictions where Gestamp carries out its usual activities, the Group is not obliged to comply with anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing legislation.\n\nNevertheless, the Criminal Risk Prevention Model includes money laundering and terrorism financing within the catalogue of risks that the Group is exposed to as a result of its usual activity, therefore specific measures are in place to prevent them from materialising.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Compliance in terms of Competition**\n\nOur Code of Conduct establishes measures aimed at avoiding any conduct that could illegally restrict free competition in the markets in which Gestamp operates. It does so by forbidding engagement in secret agreements on prices or terms of sale with competitors, secret agreements on waiving competition, the submission of sham bids, client sharing and other market segmentation standards.\n\nFurthermore, the Crime Prevention Model stipulates the analysis, identification and regular assessment of risks linked to the perpetration of offences related to conduct that restricts free competition, and also defines effective controls for preventing the possibility of such offences being committed.\n\nGestamp has not been involved in any legal proceedings in the last 5 years nor have any fines been imposed for anti-competitive practices.\n\n#### **Conflicts of Interest**\n\nBeyond the Code of Conduct applicable to all employees and persons connected to them, in order to avoid conflicts of interest, **[Article 22 of the Board Regulations](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Shareholders%20Investors/Corporate%20Governance/Corporate%20Rules/Reglamento%20del%20Consejo/2021_03_29-Reglamento-CdA-(Modificacion-Comision-ESG).pdf?ext=.pdf)** stipulates that directors are required to inform the Board of Directors of any circumstances that may lead to a direct or indirect conflict of interest as soon as they become aware of such circumstance.\n\nIn any event, each member of the Board of Directors must abstain from attending and participating in deliberations and votes (including by means of proxy vote) concerning matters in which they or a related party, as defined in the applicable law, have a direct or indirect conflict of interest.\n\nAdditionally, directors should abstain from engaging in commercial or professional transactions that may lead to a conflict of interest, without having first informed and received approval from the Board of Directors, which shall request a report from the Audit Committee.\n\n#### **Internal Code of Conduct Concerning Securities Markets**\n\nThe **[Internal Code of Conduct Concerning Securities Markets](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Shareholders%20Investors/Corporate%20Governance/Corporate%20Rules/Codigo%20Conducta/Reglamento-Interno-de-Conducta-(pdf).pdf?ext=.pdf)** determines the standards of conduct and action to be followed by those to whom they are addressed, including, but not limited to, the members of the Board of Directors, senior management, employees or external advisors who have access to insider information belonging to Gestamp, as well as those involved in handling, using and disseminating insider information, all for the purpose of fostering transparency, protecting the interests of investors with regard to Gestamp securities and avoiding any situation that potentially qualifies as market abuse.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Intellectual and industrial property**\n\nThe company considers intellectual and industrial property rights, and the implementation of the related trade secrets and knowhow, to be integral to the competitive advantage of our business. Therefore, Gestamp focuses its efforts and invests resources in submitting, registering, maintaining, monitoring and defending our intellectual and industrial property rights.\n\nThese intellectual and industrial property rights cover both the technologies, processes and products encompassed in Gestamp's core business, as well as those technologies aimed at optimising and increasing the flexibility and efficiency of processes and the quality of the products in the area of Industry 4.0.\n\nMany of the technologies and processes that we use stem from the knowledge, experience and skills of our scientific and technical personnel. In some cases, these technologies and processes are patented and protected through intellectual and industrial property rights, while others are protected through trade secrets. To protect our trade secrets, know-\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Gestamp has more than 1,300 patents, utility models and corresponding applications.\n\nhow, technologies and processes, we formalise confidentiality agreements with employees, clients, suppliers, competitors, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators that prevent confidential information from being disclosed to third parties.\n\nGestamp protects its pre-existing intellectual and industrial property rights and does not transfer them to any collaboration partners, clients, suppliers, competitors or third parties. Where development agreements are formalised, we assert ownership over intellectual and industrial property rights that may arise in relation to those agreements and which are connected to or based on company know-how, trade secrets, technology and processes.\n\n#### TACKLING THE ISSUE OF COUNTERFEIT PARTS\n\nThe use of original/authentic parts is a pre-requisite for the proper functioning and maintenance of vehicles throughout their service life.\n\nBeyond the law's prohibition of using counterfeit parts, Gestamp is aware of how a counterfeit component can compromise the integrity of a vehicle in terms of safety and performance.\n\nGestamp has identified two stages in its manufacturing process in which there is a potential risk of counterfeit parts making their way into the value chain. Although there is a low likelihood of this happening, the company has established measures to reduce the risk to a minimum:\n\n- **•** Acquisition of counterfeit parts in the purchasing process: as a first class supplier, most of the goods acquired by the company are materials; nevertheless, where a final product is acquired, suppliers must guarantee that there is no risk of selling counterfeit products to Gestamp.\n- **•** Withdrawal of defective parts: the company takes care to ensure that non-compliant products that are not undergoing checks or repairs—and therefore must be discarded—are rendered unusable prior to disposal, to prevent their potential return to the supply chain as a counterfeit part.\n\nGestamp has built and maintains quality management systems that have the international certifications required by customers, above all the IATF 16949 standard. These management systems aid Gestamp's continuous improvement by focusing on the customer and promoting safe, sustainable prevention through detection, resulting in fewer defects and less waste in the supply chain.\n\nThe aim is to bring the whole of the company's manufacturing activity in line with the quality expectations of customers and with international standards, to ensure the maximum quality and efficiency of manufacturing processes, and to comply with customers' specifications throughout these processes until the delivery of the final product.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/197/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp. The word \"Gestamp\" is written in a bold, sans-serif font in a dark blue color.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Personal Data Protection**\n\nGestamp is committed to the protection of personal data. Therefore, within the Group we are constantly adapting and boosting our resources to comply with the personal data protection legislation in force in the regions where Gestamp operates and/or carries out personal data processing activities.\n\nIn this regard, Gestamp has a **[Data Protection Policy](https://www.gestamp.com/data-protection-policy)** aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (GDPR), which sets out guarantees and principles, as well as the main obligations and rights in terms of personal data protection at Gestamp Group companies. This Data Protection Policy is the core of Gestamp Group's commitment to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to personal data protection.\n\nGestamp continually strives to implement any and all mechanisms that are required in order to ensure that personal data remain secure and to prevent tampering, loss, or unauthorised processing or access, even in regions that are beyond the scope of application of this GDPR, by adapting the Data Protection Policy to local laws. As such, Gestamp Group standards are applied across all regions in which we operate, are present and/or conduct personal data processing activities. Since these standards are based on the GDPR, in several regions they are stricter than national regulations.\n\nMoreover, the Group has conducted a risk assessment of the corporate applications that process personal data, to evaluate the security measures implemented, and it has developed a procedure for the execution of privacy impact assessments (PIA) that determines the level of risk entailed whenever data\n\nare processed with a view to establishing the most appropriate control measures to limit this risk.\n\nFurthermore, the training of our employees is crucial to the success of any new project. Therefore, to ensure compliance with and implementation of the GDPR, the Group has offered faceto-face training sessions for certain corporate services employees who regularly work with personal data, thus providing them with theoretical and practical information about how to apply the GDPR. In addition, there is an online data protection training course available to employees free of charge and accessible at any time.\n\nImage /page/197/Picture/18 description: A medium shot depicts an office setting with a man working at a desk in the foreground and a meeting room visible through a glass wall in the background. The man, who has a beard and is wearing a headset, is focused on a computer screen. His desk is cluttered with papers and office supplies, including a red document holder. Behind him, a glass wall separates his workspace from a meeting room. Inside the meeting room, a woman in a patterned dress is standing near a whiteboard, seemingly in the middle of a presentation or discussion. A conference table and chairs are arranged in the center of the room. The word \"Gestamp\" is visible on the glass wall, possibly indicating the name of the company. A projector is mounted on the ceiling of the meeting room. The overall lighting is bright, and the color palette is dominated by neutral tones, with accents of blue and red.\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/198/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

On this basis, Gestamp is able to identify the aspects that it should prioritise and those that should serve to underpin its ESG strategy and governance model.\n\nThe analysis conducted during the 2023 reporting period was divided into 3 phases:\n\n- **• Phase 1 -** Context analysis and understanding of Gestamp's value chain.\n- **• Phase 2 -** Identification of topics, sub-topics and material IROs.\n- **• Phase 3 -** Assessment and weighting of material IROs.\n\nThis analysis will be reviewed annually and updated at least e zo years. These times are pending review based on the new regulations and applicable standards.\n\n# PHASE 1 - CONTEXT ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING OF GESTAMP'S VALUE CHAIN\n\nA context analysis has been conducted to identify and develop a clearer understanding of Gestamp's business activities, based on internal and external sources:\n\n#### INTERNAL SOURCES::\n\n- **•** 2022 Materiality analysis.\n- **•** Gestamp's 2022 Annual Report.\n- **•** ESG Risk Map.\n- **•** Analysis of Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.\n- **•** Other information identified as relevant by business units.\n\nImage /page/210/Picture/27 description: The image shows a blue icon of an arrow pointing to the right, enclosed in a bracket. The bracket is open on the left side, and the arrow is pointing towards the right.\n\n#### EXTERNAL SOURCES:\n\n- **•** Relevant sector-based reports\n- **•** Information about competitors in the public domain.\n- **•** Standards/recommendations: SASB, GRI, TCFD, WEF, EFRAG,\n- **•** ESG Analysts: MSCI, S&P, Sustainalytics, Ecovadis, FTSE.\n- **•** Regulations and recommendations of regulators: EU Taxonomy, CNMV, etc.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/211/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n# PHASE 2 - IDENTIFICATION OF TOPICS, SUB-TOPICS AND MATERIAL IROS\n\nFor the purpose of classifying the Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IROs) that will be identified and assessed, first of all the topics identified on a preliminary basis as being the most relevant have been listed for ease of understanding and in the interests of facilitating analysis. As such, the new EFRAG Standards of the CSRD and all resources identified during the context analysis have been taken into consideration.\n\nThe identified material topics are divided into more specific sub-topics which increase granularity and show how the topics correspond to the company's activities.\n\n3\nFinally, a preliminary list of approximately 100 impacts, risks and opportunities related to every sub-topic and material topic have been identified. Prioritised according to relevance, only those considered to be the most relevant have subsequently been assessed. All the sources consulted during the context analysis have been used to this end.\n\n#### IMPACT\n\n1\n\n2\n\nThe effect that the entity's processes, activities, products, services and relations have on people or the environment over time. The effect may be:\n\n- **•** Current or potential, depending on whether it is happening at the present time or may happen in the future.\n- **•** Positive or negative.\n\n#### RISK\n\nAny uncertain environmental, social or governance-related events or conditions which, should they occur, may have a material negative impact on the company's business model and strategy.\n\n#### OPPORTUNITY\n\nAny uncertain environmental, social or governance-related events or conditions which, should they occur, may have a material positive impact on the company's business model and strategy.\n\n## PHASE 3 - ASSESSMENT AND WEIGHTING OF MATERIAL IROS\n\nGestamp has involved its four principal stakeholder groups in the assessment of IROs. Information has been gathered via surveys, including questions on topics and sub-topics for employees and associations, as well as special surveys on IROs for relevant departments (representing customers and suppliers and providing their business vision). A trend analysis conducted for regulatory bodies and the financial community has also identified the topics that they currently prioritise.\n\nImage /page/211/Figure/25 description: The image shows a diagram with icons and text labels representing different stakeholders and methods of analysis. From left to right, the stakeholders are: Employees, Customers, Suppliers, Civil Society and Opinion Makers, Regulatory Bodies, and Financial Community. The first four stakeholders are grouped under the heading \"SURVEYS\", while the last two are grouped under the heading \"TREND ANALYSIS\".\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/212/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Letter from the Chairman](#page-2-0)\n\nOn the basis of the results, the IROs have been assessed in their respective material topics and subtopics, according to the following criteria:\n\nImage /page/212/Figure/4 description: This image shows a diagram of impact and financial materiality. The impact materiality section is divided into positive and negative impacts. The positive impact section is divided into real and potential impacts. The real impact is calculated as Scale + Scope. The potential impact is calculated as (Scale + Scope) x Likelihood. The negative impact section is divided into real and potential impacts. The real impact is calculated as Scale + Scope + Remediability. The potential impact is calculated as (Scale + Scope) x Likelihood. The financial materiality section is divided into risk and opportunity. The risk is calculated as Scale x Probability. The opportunity is calculated as Scale x Probability. The timeframe for impact materiality is short term, medium term, and long term. The timeframe for financial materiality is potential. Scale is the magnitude of IRO if it occurs. Scope indicates the level of impact on population and geographic area. Likelihood indicates the probability of the IROs occurring. Remediability is the difficulty of repairing or offsetting a negative impact.\n\n[4. Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n[5. Social Dimension](#page-107-0)\n\n[2. Gestamp Group](#page-4-0)\n\n[3. ESG Perspective](#page-49-0)\n\n[6. Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nThe primary material aspects in terms of IRO are assessed according to a double materiality matrix produced on the basis of the above.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nSince our beginnings as local stamping suppliers, we have worked together with our customers, accompanying them in their globalisation, helping them to develop increasingly safer and more efficient vehicles, and offering them innovative solutions to the many and diverse challenges presented by the automotive sector.\n\nThis has helped us become a key player in the automotive sector, being a global reference in the development and manufacturing of metal components, with an international presence in 24 countries and a diverse and multicultural team of more than 40,000 people.\n\nGlobal vehicle production has grown by 9.7% in 2023, consolidating its recovery despite economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. The commitment, performance and efficiency of our teams has allowed us to achieve good results in 2023, taking advantage of market opportunities. Accordingly, our revenue rose to EUR 12.27 bn, up 14.4% on the previous year and our EBITDA increased by 13.4%, reaching EUR 1.37 bn. This growth highlights the success of a business strategy based on geographical diversification, an innovative and unique product portfolio, and a focus on creating long-term value by leading the transition towards electric vehicles.\n\nThese results also support our long-term vision of integrating sustainability in the core of our business model. To this end, we have developed an ambitious ESG strategic plan until 2025, which not only establishes objectives for all the areas that we consider essential for this correct performance, but also strengthens our firm conviction that sustainability represents a cornerstone of our business strategy.\n\nThe development of environmental, social and good governance aspects is integrated transversally in our business strategy. Starting with the development of lighter parts, which help increase the autonomy of the electric vehicle, reduce CO2 emissions and optimise the use of raw materials. Another key pillar of our ESG plan is to promote the circular economy, closely collaborating with our entire value chain to use our high-quality scrap as a secondary raw material for the production of low-emission steel. In this regard, in 2023, agreements have been reached with our suppliers Tata Steel UK, SSAB and Arcelor Mittal to promote low-emission steel.\n\nThe commitment to local communities in which Gestamp is present has always been a key part of our social strategy. We are aware of our role of contributing to the development of communities through the generation of quality employment and the implementation of Social Action initiatives that positively impact society. As a result, in 2023 we have developed around 229 initiatives with 464,827 beneficiaries.\n\nAll of this structured in a strong governance model supported by the Board of Directors, the ESG Commission and the ESG Committee, which ensure that sustainability is addressed comprehensively and effectively throughout the organisation. What's more, the new regulatory requirements on transparency, such as the CSRD, serve as a tool to be able to show the market how sustainability has always been part of Gestamp.\n\nBeyond our determined commitment to sustainability and the positive economic performance during the year, the group continues to invest decisively in strengthening our long-term strategic positioning through product innovation and the digitalisation of our processes.\n\nIn this way, we are committed to innovation and technology as a driving force for developing solutions that help in the transition towards cleaner mobility that is safer for people, and to help address challenges within the industry. Gestamp is a technology company that already has the capabilities to offer a product portfolio that will be key in the new architecture of the car of the future, products that combine weight efficiency, passenger safety and the most competitive cost.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to our Industry 4.0 model, we are developing more efficient and flexible production plants that continuously improve operations management and provide operational flexibility through the digitalisation of all our processes.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue working in the Group on using all the means at our disposal to reaffirm our commitment to sustainability and contribute to the achievement of Agenda 2030 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/22 description: The image shows a signature on the left and the name and title of a person on the right.

This improvement in rigidity also contributes to improving the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle.\n\nIn addition to what has been mentioned, other highly relevant aspects to take into account in the development of products are comfort and durability.\n\nWe can group the family of products that Gestamp works on into three large groups:\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/17 description: This image shows various car parts and their names. The parts are divided into three categories: Chassis, Mechanisms, and unnamed. The Chassis category includes structural assemblies, bumper systems, closures, gigastampings, battery boxes, and Class A. The Mechanisms category includes cross car beams, underbody, and upperbody. The unnamed category includes subframes, links, control arms, rear twist systems, hinges, powered systems, and door checks.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp. The word \"Gestamp\" is written in a bold, dark blue font. To the right of the word is a square containing a stylized graphic of a curved line with a circle at the end, also in a lighter shade of blue.\n\n2023\n\n#### [BODY IN WHITE \\(BIW\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0VrPV1zszM)\n\nBody-in-White products (or BIW) form the structure that supports the vehicle and protects the driver and other passengers.\n\nIt participates in crash safety, aerodynamics, weight distribution and general structural integrity, in addition to defining the aesthetics of the vehicle.\n\nThe body must be designed so that, in the event of a crash, deformation occurs appropriately and the maximum amount of kinetic energy is transformed into deformation work. Certain parts have to absorb a large amount of energy in the event of an impact.\n\nIt is here, in the bodywork, where the use of hot stamping is key to lightening the vehicle and, in turn, exceeding the increasingly demanding safety regulations.\n\nGestamp has been revolutionizing the design and manufacturing of parts in this technology, being able to integrate functionality through solutions in which the latest generation materials are used.\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/8 description: The image shows a close-up, low-angle shot of stacked metal beams or structures, possibly in an industrial setting. The beams are arranged in a repeating pattern, with each layer slightly offset from the one below it, creating a stepped effect. The metal has a dull, gray-blue tone, and the lighting is somewhat dim, casting shadows that emphasize the depth and texture of the structures. The beams are perforated with numerous small holes, adding to the visual complexity and suggesting a functional design. The overall composition is abstract and emphasizes the geometric patterns and industrial aesthetic of the scene.\n\nThe chassis comprises the under body of vehicles and includes systems, frames and related parts, such as front and rear axles and couplings, control arms and integrated couplings, which connect the body and the powertrain of a vehicle and support its weight.\n\nThese structures are essential for the dynamics, performance and safety of vehicles and have a particular influence as regards noise, vibrations, driving and impacts.\n\n#### [CHASSIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnfKSSPhQo) [MECHANISMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFht8noscp8)\n\nThese are mechanical components, such as hinges for doors, bonnets and boot doors, door checks and door hinges, which enable users to open and close a vehicle's bonnet, side doors, rear doors and boot, as well as pedal systems and hand brakes. Mechanisms also include powered systems that allow vehicle doors to open and close electrically and by means of remote activation. These components afford important functionalities and play a significant role in safety and comfort.\n\n[6. Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[5. Social Dimension](#page-107-0)\n\n[2.

The third number is +750, and its description is \"PEOPLE actively working\".\n\n## TRANSFORMATION PLAN\n\nIn order to prepare for the future and the changes forced upon us by the world, as well as market uncertainty, Gestamp launched ATENEA two years ago, a comprehensive, ambitious transformation plan for continued growth and improvement which addresses key issues arising from the company's rapid growth.\n\nThis project remains a key milestone for the future of the Group and aims to build on everything that has made Gestamp successful in the past, in order to stay competitive in the future.\n\nThe transformation programme seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate functions and operational layers in processes, systems, organisation and culture.\n\nThe programme was launched in September 2021 with 45 initiatives, signifying the first steps of this model of excellence. This live project saw the launch of a second wave of 25 initiatives at the start of 2022, this time put forward by the organisation and led by talent from all regions. Since then, the launch of initiatives has continued as required by the organisation and its different functions, with a total of 92 initiatives launched over the two years of the programme. The transformation plan has, therefore, become a programme driven and led by the organisation itself.\n\nThere are currently 48 initiatives underway, with multidivisional teams working together to design the best solution, with an expected impact of nearly 80% in plants and divisions. A total of 79 of the Group's plants are currently involved and more than 750 people are actively working on the ATENEA programme.\n\nThis ambitious plan is part of Gestamp's strategy and will be crucial for overcoming the challenges of the future, aiming to ensure operational excellence in its factories and the transition towards corporate functions with greater added value.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/21 description: The image shows a Newton's cradle, a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy using a series of swinging spheres.

For those reasons, the industry is a pioneer in the application of quality systems throughout the value chain. Gestamp's customers demand flawless products in the required quantity and by the agreed deadline to ensure both the quality of the final product and its proper functioning.\n\n#### **Quality Systems**\n\nAll of Gestamp's production plants have developed and maintained a quality management system with the international certifications required by Gestamp's customers. These certifications are mainly in accordance with IATF 16949 (99% of Gestamp's production plants with at least one year of records), with the remaining 1% representing a single plant that only supplies customers who do not require this certification.\n\nThe management systems of each and every one of the plants are based on Gestamp's minimum quality management system, known as GQS (Gestamp Quality System), which ensures a minimum degree of uniformity across all of them.\n\nThis management system aids Gestamp's continuous improvement by focusing on the customer and promoting prevention over detection, resulting in fewer defects and less waste in the supply chain, in a safe and sustainable manner.\n\nHowever, sometimes incidents may arise among clients, in which case predefined response mechanisms are activated and measures are taken so that the causes that produced these incidents are not repeated. These mechanisms are common in the automotive sector, such as troubleshooting methods, such as 8D, including root cause investigation methods such as 5W, 5M or Ishikawa or warranty management methods, including NTF Non-Trouble Found, to name a few. These methodologies are a standard in the sector, accepted and required by all clients.\n\nThese management systems are ever-evolving, capable of adapting to industry changes and seeking continuous improvement. In 2023, work continued to define and roll out the new system for managing costs of quality, launched in 2021, with extensive use of available IT tools. Two new sprints were added to those already developed in 2022 related to the costs of selection and rework processes with Gestamp resources and supplier charges.\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/19 description: The image shows a close-up of a machine with a robotic arm and a laser beam. The robotic arm has a black circular head with the word \"QUISS\" printed on it in yellow letters. A red laser beam is emitted from the center of the head, directed towards a metallic surface. The machine is made of metal and has various components such as wires, cables, and sensors. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a factory or industrial setting.\n\nImage /page/17/Picture/20 description: The image shows a close-up view of the engine compartment of a vehicle.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Customer-Oriented Quality**\n\nGestamp is committed to building solid, long-lasting relationships based on trust with customers. To achieve this, continuous dialogue is encouraged, which serves to better identify and meet their needs.\n\n#### ANNUAL MEETINGS\n\nAnnual meetings are held at the highest level with customers in order to review short-term results and forecasts; longer-term prospects, trends and opportunities are also discussed at these meetings. Moreover, the development of common strategies, new technologies and any needs raised by the customer are considered.\n\n#### DAY-TO-DAY RELATIONS\n\nDirect contact is maintained with the customer regarding day-to-day activities, in both the industrialisation phase and the mass production phase. During the industrialisation phase of new products, constant contact is maintained with customers, with particularly close monitoring of those projects that are considered strategic in order to ensure an appropriate response.\n\nOur production plants maintain daily contact with the facilities of our customers. This contact is more operational in nature, seeking to provide a flexible response to the requirements and needs of the customer, and resolve any issues that may arise on a day-to-day basis.\n\n#### CUSTOMER AUDITS\n\nThe customer, in turn, visits the plants from time to time to carry out audits and contribute towards continuous improvement, together with periodic assessments which allow Gestamp to determine its level of quality in comparison with the customer's other suppliers, and to take measures in areas where there may be room for improvement.\n\nEach customer decides on the frequency of these audits, which is usually yearly, but can be adapted according to the circumstances. Gestamp always works with the customer by arranging these visits, providing the information required to ensure the audit is conducted properly.\n\nImage /page/18/Picture/21 description: In a well-lit industrial setting, three men are working with metal components. The man on the left wears a two-tone shirt, safety glasses, and orange gloves, standing near a metal surface. The man in the middle, wearing a gray shirt and gloves, is positioned near several metal components. The man on the right, wearing ear protection, is also working with the metal components. Above them, a screen is mounted on the wall. The scene suggests a manufacturing or assembly process.\n\n#### **Monitoring and Internal Control**\n\nMonitoring the quality performance of parts delivered to customers is undertaken through internal audits on products, processes and systems, as well as through the use of indicators at all levels of the organisation (plants, regions, divisions and corporations).\n\nThe incidents that occurred during the year were resolved between the automotive manufacturers and the Group, which successfully managed the incidents within the optimal time frames. This ensured that end users did not face any inconvenience and no vehicle in the possession of an end user was recalled for a revision for any reason relating to the products supplied by the Group in 2023.\n\nThe manner in which said incidents were handled was the key element in resolving them. As such, there was no need to resort to the insurance guarantees that the Group has taken out.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Handling of Safety-Critical Components**\n\nGestamp has a specific directive for handling safety-critical components, understood as those that, according to the VDA (Verband Der Automobilindustrie), contain a safety or regulatory feature, i.e. that could pose an immediate risk to the life and limb of the occupants or a breach of current legislation. Some examples include the vehicle's steering, suspension or impact resistance in the event of a collision. This directive also outlines the specific requirements for maintaining records associated with this type of component, which are key to taking potential action should any adverse events occur. Furthermore, there are other company-wide directives that form part of Gestamp's quality management system, specifying minimum requirements so that design and manufacturing processes can manage factors that may affect safety-critical features in the most effective way possible.\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/13 description: A woman wearing a dark blue t-shirt with the word \"Gestamp\" and a logo on the back is standing in what appears to be a factory or industrial setting. She has curly brown hair and is wearing gray protective sleeves on her arms. The background is predominantly yellow, with various pieces of machinery and equipment visible. There are also safety signs on the wall. The overall lighting is bright, and the focus is on the woman and the text on her shirt.\n\n#### **Project Quality**\n\nIn order to adequately manage risk right from the project phase, the company's project quality department is leading a company-wide initiative related to risk prioritisation based on an FMEA cycle (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), one of the most powerful standards in the industry.\n\nTo this end, an ambitious programme is underway to fine-tune its use, in terms of both method and through the development of an IT tool, which will improve the detection and analysis of potential faults in product design or the production process, as well as their causes. It will also allow for the relevant measures to be taken later in the phases of mass production control.\n\nThe tool's development was completed in 2022 and it was launched in 2023 for start-up projects, reaching a total of 1,753 active users in the new system with 270 open projects, including 21 design FMEAs, 1,045 process FMEAs and 811 control plans by the end of 2023. Furthermore, standardisation has also continued for primary technologies (hot and cold stamping, welding, painting, machining and bonding) to be reused across all plants, thus capitalising on all the expertise that already exists within Gestamp.\n\n> 1,753 270 in the new system\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/19 description: The image shows two numbers and their corresponding labels. The number 1,753 is labeled as \"ACTIVE USERS\", and the number 270 is labeled as \"OPEN PROJECTS\".\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/20/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp. The word \"Gestamp\" is written in a bold, dark blue font. To the right of the word is a square containing a stylized graphic of a curved line with a circle at the end, also in a lighter shade of blue.\n\n#### **Process Quality**\n\nThe Process Quality department provides an organisationwide set of standards and methods linked to the most critical technologies and production processes within the Group, focusing in particular on special processes (those in which the part has to be destroyed to ensure that the product is up to standard, such as parts involving arc welding).\n\nIts aim is to align all of Gestamp's production activity with the customer's quality requirements and international standards in order to maximise the quality and efficiency of said activity. Thus, Gestamp ensures compliance with the customer's requirements throughout every process, from the early phases of production to delivery of the final product. In 2023, a\n\nspecific department for Quality 4.0 was set up, with the aim of increasing the added value of 4.0 tools. A number of projects are set to be deployed over the next few years, one of which relates to merging product and process characteristics for chassis and battery box products.\n\nSo far, in addition to the production process standards defined in previous years such as arc welding, hot stamping, leather pieces, resistance welding and painting, specific processes have been added for the manufacture of battery boxes, such as machining and bonding. Work has also been carried out on subprojects stemming from the main projects. During 2023, the major chassis plants were also audited according to the reference framework\n\ncreated the previous year, including system aspects and all the relevant technology.\n\nIn 2023, part of the certification process of the main previously indicated technologies of the plants has been resumed, prioritizing the evaluation of the chassis plants. In 2024, it is planned to continue evaluating the implementation of the already defined standards in production plants.\n\n#### INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEMS\n\nImage /page/20/Figure/10 description: The image shows a diagram of control systems.

The project had established several lines of action, such as: assessing the inventory of equipment available in production plants around the world, reviewing and identifying the suppliers of this technology and their limits and, finally, drafting complete guides for each equipment family. Finally, a database is also available to manage all the equipment and thus optimise analysis, from the technical point of view of the plants' needs, where the feedback from the plants is being implemented.\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/15 description: The picture shows a factory with a production line.

Furthermore, more than 50 projects have been virtualised, ranging from sophisticated production lines to entire factories. Also, 9 applications have been developed for maintenance, logistics, quality and energy efficiency tasks, which facilitate day-to-day plant management.\n\nGestamp has been able to develop these projects thanks to the work of multidisciplinary teams made up of experts in industrial and technological operations, digital developers and new professional profiles specialising in data management. This has ensured greater knowledge in the areas of digital technology, IoT, big data and virtualisation, as well as in other fields such as artificial intelligence, collaborative robots, resource orchestration, computing, etc. The majority of these technologies are being used in projects currently under way.\n\nThanks to the experience we have gained over the years, the Digital Factory is now a reality at Gestamp. A Digital Factory where everything is connected—products, machines, systems and people—, sharing information in real time in a transparent way and ensuring that the factories can operate efficiently at all times.\n\nImage /page/22/Picture/16 description: The image shows a robotic arm in an industrial setting. The arm is orange and black, and it is positioned next to a large white machine. There is also a blue and silver machine on wheels in the background. The floor is light gray, and the walls are white. The image is well-lit and in focus.\n\nGestamp is currently in the process of evolving and structuring all the technologies that are moving towards the concept of smart manufacturing.\n\nAbove all, this means ensuring integration and standardisation among them, so that they come together in an environment governed to perfection. This will allow us to design and deploy a longer-term strategy.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"Gestamp\" in a bold, sans-serif font.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nMeanwhile, in 2022 and 2023 greater impetus was given to all aspects related to change management, the creation of digital culture and the strengthening of teams and structures designed specifically to implement the strategic digitalisation plan. This involves a major effort in terms of training and transforming professional profiles that specialise in digital systems, defining positions and duties allocated across the various regions and plants, and fostering a robust community within Gestamp that upholds its strategy and governance on a global level.\n\nIn terms of new developments, tremendous effort is going into systematising and standardising relationships with both strategic and service partners in order to streamline all these efforts and boost progress on the roadmap towards a smart factory.\n\nIn addition, by combining experience in digitalisation and advanced engineering, Gestamp has developed a new concept of flexible assembly, allowing for the production of different products on the same line. Thus, we are moving one step closer to digital industrialisation, evolving from product-specific and linked systems to generic and individual systems where movements are carried out by AGVs (guided vehicles) instead of static robots.\n\nWith all this, in 2023, significant effort has gone into advancing the creation of a federated digital ecosystem, where the i4.0 community has increasingly clear standards for the contribution, development and implementation of digital tools. As such, the degree of customisation and closeness to the needs of each plant has significantly increased, meaning the acceptance and adoption of such tools has also increased.\n\nOn the other hand, Gestamp has also clearly driven forward the tools and structures needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and apply it to the most ambitious industrial challenges,\n\nin terms of efficiencies, energy consumption and quality. In 2024, supported by all the developments in 2023, the aim is for Gestamp to be able to successfully apply these technologies in multiple contexts, setting off on the path towards industryspecific AI in a fully regulated environment, keeping knowledge and property within the organisation.\n\nAll this allows Gestamp to deal with the uncertainties that the automotive industry is facing and to be more adaptable to change. Gestamp is actively working on a model of a connected, smart, virtualised, safe and scalable factory that can be flexibly, swiftly and efficiently adapted to the constantly changing needs of the industry.\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/18 description: The image shows a diagram that illustrates the transition from a digital factory to a smart factory.

Gestamp is a pioneer in the manufacture of products using hot stamping, one of the most advanced technologies for improving performance and passenger safety in the event of a collision.\n\nIn addition, high-strength steel products significantly improve the ability of vehicles to withstand impacts. Improvements in the energy absorption of Gestamp's products, both chassis and body in white, increase the passive safety of vehicles.\n\nIn turn, technologies such as hot stamping, where Gestamp is the market leader, make it possible to meet the most stringent safety requirements and withstand vehicle-to-vehicle crash tests. Gestamp is developing new hot stamping products, such as extreme size parts that will increase safety performance, integrate more functions and reduce assembly time for our customers.\n\nLikewise, our mechanisms unit is developing and producing passive safety solutions and achieving good results in improving pedestrian safety thanks to hood hinges.\n\nBATTERY BOX\n\nREAR SIDE MEMBER\n\nROCKER REINFORCEMENT\n\nCHASSIS\n\nBUMPER BEAM\n\nONE PIECE FLOOR\n\nOVERLAP PATCH DOOR RING\n\n## High-strength steel products significantly improve the ability of vehicles to withstand impacts.\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/18 description: The image shows a car's components.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### LIGHT WEIGHTING AND REDUCED EMISSIONS\n\nGestamp is continuously working to develop lighter vehicles. Weight reduction is one of the company's main areas of research. It is one of the most demanded requirements in the automotive sector due to the need to improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nChassis and body components are essential for meeting emissions targets, as they make up around 70% of the vehicle's total weight.\n\nAlso, as part of the electrification trend in the industry, the increase in vehicle mass due to batteries has reinforced the importance of lightweighting. Weight affects the range of the electric vehicle, and until the full decarbonisation of the electricity grid takes place, its consumption will continue to play an important role in the CO2 emissions of vehicles during the use phase.\n\nTherefore, Gestamp provides innovative solutions to offer the best weight reduction results and meet the most stringent requirements of the sector. Extensive experience in hot stamping technology and the development of multi-material solutions have led to various alternatives for lighter vehicles.\n\nIn order to take into account the environmental impact of, for example, weight reduction, life cycle analysis (LCA) of products is carried out as a strategic element in the design phase. As explained in the Circular Economy chapter, the carbon footprint of the different processes carried out at Gestamp and the materials used in the production phase are some of the main variables analysed in the study. For example, it has been found that the lightening of parts and the use of a smaller amount of raw materials are two of the factors that most influence the reduction of the carbon footprint. This is due to the high impact\n\nof the extraction phase of the materials used, in addition to the use phase of the vehicles explained above.\n\n#### COMFORT\n\nDriving experience, comfort and dynamism are some of the key aspects that users take into account. Gestamp develops solutions that improve comfort and convenience when using the vehicle, such as components that reduce the noise and vibration of the vehicle, electrical systems that allow doors and trunks to be automatically raised and held or doors opened with the greatest safety thanks to a complete system of sensors that avoid impacts against obstacles.\n\nThe main criteria for a user's vehicle purchase include driving experience, comfort and dynamics. This is leading to a rise in demand for components such as electric liftgate systems, noise and vibration reducing components, electric door systems, power assist steps and noise reducing tyres.\n\nAt Gestamp we have been working on these components for many years and we are at the forefront within the sector. Originally and to date, they are components that are mounted on high-end vehicles and SUVs, but it is expected that in the coming years they will become a standard in all types of cars.\n\nImage /page/26/Picture/22 description: A light blue car is driving on a road.

Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n#### GESTAMP'S EV CONCEPT\n\nElectrification is an unstoppable trend for the automotive sector, with diverse factors driving it forward, the most important of which is the growth in urban populations and the improvement in the air quality there.\n\nGestamp's strategy remains to constantly accompany its customers in order to offer them the best innovations for their vehicles and, in the case of electric vehicles (EV), to help them in the transition to electric vehicles.\n\nThe Technology and Innovation Office teams develop different solutions for the electrification of different mobilities.\n\nThe Electric Vehicle area and Gestamp's R&D teams are offering various solutions, such as the new electric battery box, chassis components integrating the new electric motors. These components meet traditional specifications like durability, rigidity, and strength, but they need to be optimised in terms of noise transmission and energy absorption during collisions due to the specific architecture of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, innovations in the use of different materials are being pursued to reduce weight and provide more suitable solutions for new electric platforms. The motto is: the right materials in the right place.\n\nThe impact behaviour is different in a battery electric vehicle (BEV), mainly due to the higher weight and low centre of gravity of the battery system. In addition, the higher mass of the batteries also contributes to the potential energy of the vehicle in case of a collision. Gestamp has developed a wide range of body in white products to increase safety and protect battery passengers in the event of a collision.\n\nIt should be noted that the company has collaborated in different types of mobility beyond electrification itself. Thus, projects have been developed for cars that cover long distances, small cars for cities, and concepts referred to as \"urban people mover\" and \"last mile delivery\".\n\nImage /page/27/Picture/9 description: The image shows a mechanical assembly, possibly part of a vehicle's chassis or drivetrain.

To the right of the word is a blue square containing a white graphic that resembles a stylized \"G\" or a curved line with a circle at the end.\n\n2023\n\n#### **Gestamp's main innovations**\n\n#### GESTAMP LABORATORY FOR THE VALIDATION OF AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS\n\nG-Lab, Gestamp's virtual laboratory for the validation of automotive products, is an R&D programme that develops digital prototypes of its own vehicles in order to validate the behaviour of new body in white components and technologies.\n\nThis is the most relevant safety-focused project at Gestamp, as G-Lab is based on prevention as the main pillar throughout the design, development and manufacturing process of vehicle components.\n\nG-Lab was created with the aim of obtaining the best results in virtual validation of all types of collisions and impact scenarios for the different vehicle segments. For this reason, the program allows for full vehicle collision simulations during the co-development process with customers.\n\n[2. Gestamp Group](#page-4-0)\n\n[1.

Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nInternal capacities for undertaking vehicle crash simulations\n\nThanks to G-Lab, Gestamp offers the best body in white solutions in new mobility scenarios, focusing on safety, lightness and sustainability. These models offer the possibility to perform much of the development and testing in the virtual environment and thus accelerate the design, testing and approval phases.\n\nGestamp has numerous virtual models of combustion engine vehicles (ICE), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV). These models allow the impact of new technologies, new designs or materials on the body and chassis to be predicted and assessed in terms of weight, performance and cost.\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/15 description: The image contains three views of a silver car that has been damaged in a collision.

The hood is mounted on a blue platform, and there are various wires and cables connected to it. The lighting in the scene is bright, highlighting the metallic surface of the hood and the surrounding equipment.\n\n#### NEW MATERIALS\n\nIn a bid to develop new, lighter and safer products, Gestamp is researching new materials. The company believes that the kind of structural materials used will gradually change in the years to come, with an increase in the use of aluminium, carbon fibre, new high-strength steels and multimaterial hybrid structures.\n\n- **•** High and ultra-high-strength steels: The application of Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) and Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) helps to reinforce vehicles to protect the passenger compartment in the event of an accident.\n- **•** Aluminium: The use of aluminium allows weight reduction in high-end models by applying aluminium solutions in the cladding parts and doors of the vehicle. Gestamp already manufactures battery cases with the most advanced crash alloys.\n- **•** Composite materials: Some manufacturers have used composite materials to reduce the weight of high-end vehicles and improve their efficiency. Due to the great need to reduce the weight of electric vehicles, more and more applications of these materials are being found.\n- **•** Multi-material structures: Companies such as Gestamp are investing in new technologies and machinery to create multi-material structures as part of the existing manufacturing process and value chain. This formula supports the philosophy of the right material in the right place and opens up a wide range of innovations to respond to the lightweighting of parts to meet the need to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Letter from the Chairman](#page-2-0)\n\n[INDEX](#page-1-0)\n\n[4. Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n#### TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nGestamp's R&D teams are constantly developing new technologies in line with customer needs in order to increase performance or reduce weight. One example is the launch of new advanced cold-formed steels with improved strength properties, which enable weight reduction by applying the knowledge and experience gained in the forming and development of chassis products. Development teams focus on innovative design approaches to deliver optimised highperformance products; from increasing service life by design and minimising weight through in-house optimisation tools coupled with manufacturing expertise to achieve 10-15% mass reduction, to the introduction of new paint processes to improve corrosion protection.\n\nIn the hot-stamping field, development of the new Ges-Multistep technology continued, optimising the process for different types of steel, including zinc materials with a new improved anti-corrosion coating.\n\n## New processes have also been developed that allow hot stamping of material with 25% higher strength.\n\nThis material is manufactured using a laser post-treatment that gives it sufficient ductility to obtain the best results in impact tests.\n\nThree partial cooling methods have been employed to obtain different mechanical properties across a part and achieve better shock performance. And new degrees of hardness/absorption have been achieved that allow for even better deformation control.\n\nGestamp has managed to produce parts with \"soft zones\" that have different degrees of hardness and absorb the force of impact, with different production processes:\n\n- **•** During forming: in the die/forming tool.\n- **•** After forming: post-treatment by alternative heat source, laser, induction, Ges-Softbend.\n- **•** Before forming: in the heating furnace.\n\nWith these developments, Gestamp has become the most advanced hot stamping supplier in the market, offering a wide range of materials with different resistance and coating features.\n\nBeyond steel, Gestamp has managed to bring hot stamping technology to aluminum. The need to reduce the weight of vehicles has led some manufacturers to increasingly use aluminum in some components, such as doors, and in chassis components for large and high-end vehicles.\n\nThe low level of formability and the high elastic recovery of this material in the conventional cold stamping process has motivated the R&D department to process hot stamping, where design pieces very similar to those made of steel are achieved, but much lighter and with almost zero elastic recovery.\n\n- **• Multistep**\n- **• 2000 Mpa & Soft Zone Bkt**\n- **• Hotstamping Aluminium**\n- **• Furnace Soft Zone**\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/19 description: The image shows a car frame with different parts highlighted in different colors. The text on the left side of the image lists \"Alu Multimaterial\" and \"Alu Extrusion\".\n\nGestamp's current hot stamping lines can be used for both materials by only modifying the process parameters. Gestamp has ended 2023 with a total of 106 hot stamping lines.\n\nFor the manufacture of battery boxes, new aluminum extrusion processes have been developed in which large section profiles with high ductility are produced. This makes it possible to manufacture boxes with very light frames to protect the battery.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n#### **Product development**\n\nProduct innovation at Gestamp comes from the application of new technologies to create lighter, more efficient components.\n\n#### BODY IN WHITE\n\n#### **Extreme Size Parts**\n\nGestamp has created two product families, GES-GIGASTAMPING tm and GES-ENERCONT tm. There is a clear growing trend among all original part manufacturers to develop extreme size parts, fully in tune with the challenges of electric vehicles.\n\nGestamp's leadership in hot stamping technology has enabled it to create new products of much larger sizes than those that currently make up the body in white. Thanks to the reduction in the number of components, the complexity of assembly processes on manufacturers' production lines is also reduced, minimising their internal production costs.\n\nThese extreme size parts are designed to improve vehicle weight and carbon footprint while maintaining safety.\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/9 description: The image shows a red car chassis on a white background. The chassis is the frame of the car, and it is made of metal. The chassis has a sunroof. The chassis is missing the engine, wheels, and other parts of the car.\n\nWith different mobility possibilities in mind, Gestamp has created GES-ENERCONT tm, a family of energy containers. In the case of long-haul vehicles, Gestamp has developed a compact solution with a design that is valid for both steel and aluminium in which energy capacity has been maximised.\n\nThis product from the *Extreme size parts* family and manufactured with hot stamping technology offers a single cell solution. Thinking about urban mobility, Gestamp has created a light and compact solution that not only uses aluminum, but also composite materials.\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/12 description: The image shows the body of a car in a factory.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### CHASSIS\n\n#### **Use of carbon fibre reinforced composites in chassis products**\n\nIn the Chassis project, Gestamp has partnered with Ford (lead), the NCC and the University of Nottingham to reduce the weight of three components in a Ford Transit, the best-selling van of all time. These include the front subframe, the front lower wishbone, and the rear solid axle. The result is a 40 % component weight reduction at an affordable cost. This represents a saving of more than 30 kg on the current steel components. In this project, Gestamp used its own in-house topology and material optimisation tools to generate the new chassis concepts, placing the right material, with the optimal component geometry, in the most advantageous position.\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/14 description: A close-up shot captures a welding robot in action, emitting bright sparks and smoke. The robot's arm, metallic and cylindrical, extends downwards towards a dark, angular metal structure. The welding point is a burst of intense light, surrounded by a cloud of blue smoke and scattered sparks. The background is blurred, suggesting a workshop or factory setting.\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/15 description: The image shows a car chassis. The chassis is made of metal and has a complex structure. It is designed to support the weight of the car and to provide a stable platform for the suspension and other components. The chassis is also designed to protect the occupants of the car in the event of a collision.\n\nThe opportunity to explore new innovative ideas to reduce mass in chassis products consolidates Gestamp's current market leadership position in steel and aluminum chassis structures and is a further example of Gestamp's continued drive to utilize innovation as a means of progress and remain at the forefront of innovation in the sector while working closely with clients.\n\nIn 2023 Gestamp closed a very ambitious project launched together with a client to develop a lighter, stiffer and safer front lower control arm.\n\nThe study used the product of the front lower control arm, an important component of an automobile suspension system that stabilizes the vehicle when in motion, placing extreme demands on formability, strength, stiffness and fatigue properties. It had to work perfectly in the event of a head-on collision. The challenge was to develop and produce a low control arm with high strength steel grades that did not previously exist on the market. After six years of design and development with our client, we achieved the cost targets, the weight target (a 16% weight reduction in the part) and the CO2 target. The result, a new Docol® 1000 CP steel grade.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Gestamp shares this commitment and supports the drive towards electrification with greener and lighter products for electric vehicles (EV).\n\nApart from steel, the application of other materials and combinations of materials are playing a more important role in the development of lightweight automotive parts. Aluminium is by far the most widely used non-ferrous metal in the world and possibly one of the most sustainable materials used in the global automotive industry today.\n\nHistorically, aluminium has been used for over a hundred years to produce lightweight bodies for performance and agility. However, lightweight chassis design has been driven by the rise of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), especially in China, and aluminium is a lightweight metal that can be applied to offset the weight gain caused by lithium-ion batteries. With typical weight reductions of up to 30% compared to the equivalent steel chassis structure, aluminium is seen as a key factor for sustainable lightweighting.\n\nGestamp recognises that the electrification of the automotive industry represents the fastest path to zero emissions; in anticipation of this shift in the global market, Gestamp launched a strategy to independently develop and validate in-house aluminium chassis design and manufacturing competencies.\n\nImage /page/33/Picture/16 description: A close-up shot reveals a silver metal frame structure, possibly part of a vehicle chassis or industrial equipment, mounted against a backdrop of blue and white panels.

From international fairs to technological events, also having different events directly at the headquarters of different clients.\n\nThis year 2023 has left behind digital events, which were protagonists during previous years due to COVID-19 and which had already lost strength in 2022. Although these types of digital events such as Webinars have resolved different scenarios thanks to their versatility, the year 2023 reflects that the best option to promote innovations, technologies and products are physical events.\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp has also followed a strategic calendar that includes key events, conferences and other activities to reach target groups around the world and in different regions. In addition, Gestamp also participates in activities organized by clients and other interested parties, such as universities, associations and business partners.\n\n#### **Technology events and public trade fairs**\n\nA central pillar of Gestamp's event catalog is technology events and public trade fairs.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n# 2.3 Economic Strategy\n\n## BUSINESS CONTEXT AND RESULTS\n\n#### **Macroeconomic Context and Sector Evolution**\n\nAs reported in the January 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) update, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates global economic growth to have reached +3.1% YoY in 2023. GDP growth has been better than expected at the beginning of 2023 - the IMF forecasted a +2.9% YoY growth in its January 2023 WEO - as a result of the resilience shown by major economies such as China and United States. Over 2023, tight monetary policies in main geographies have helped to bring inflation closer to central banks' target, which has been the key macroeconomic topic of the year. Looking ahead, risks to the outlook now seem to be more balanced but there is still some uncertainty arising from geopolitical risks and persistently high core inflation. As a result, the IMF now expects a GDP growth in 2024 at same levels as in 2023 at +3.1%, 0.2% higher than the October 2023 WEO projections, with a modest rise to +3.2% YoY in 2025.\n\nWithin the auto sector, 2023 has closed with a record growth of market production volumes following strong estimates' revisions by S&P Global Mobility (former IHS), mainly in Asia, throughout the year. According to the S&P Global Mobility update as of February 2024 volumes grew by +10.2% in Gestamp's footprint during 2023 reaching 82.1 million vehicles, already above the 80.7 million units produced in 2019, but still below 2017 peak levels. Once again, Gestamp has outperformed the market on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact from raw materials by 6.4 percentage points (in Gestamp's footprint – IHS data as of February 2024).\n\nDuring 2023, Western Europe and Eastern Europe were the two regions showing the strongest production growth (+14.1% and +11.3%, respectively), followed by Asia with a +10.3% growth, North America (NAFTA) growing at +8.3% and South America (Mercosur) at +3.6%.\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility (as of February 2024), 2024 is expected to be a transition year in terms of global light vehicle production within a context of a progressive recovery of 2017 peak levels (85.8 million vehicles in Gestamp's footprint). Following an extraordinary growth in 2023, market\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility data as of February 2024, global light vehicle production volumes in 2024 are expected to slightly increase versus 2023 at 82.2 million units in countries within Gestamp's production footprint.\n\nproduction volumes in Gestamp's footprint are expected to slightly increase in 2024 to 82,2 million units and are expected to surpass peak levels only by 2027 with 86.1 million vehicles.\n\nMoreover, since after the summer of 2023 S&P Global Mobility has been slightly revising downwards its Electric Vehicle (EV) penetration estimates (S&P Global Mobility as of January 2024 expects 26.3 million EVs produced by 2025 with a market penetration of 29% versus the 26.8 million units expected for 2025 in May 2023) and growth in the EV market now looks more saw-tooth shaped. However, automotive industry fundamentals for the medium term remain focused on the electrification trend as the world continues moving towards a sustainable mobility. China, Europe, and North America continue to be the main promoters of this EV trend, with EV penetration rates expected to reach 65%, 54% and 35%, respectively, by 2027. Gestamp continues to work closely to its clients with a leading positioning in this powertrain transition through its focus in Technology and Innovation and its unique value proposition.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/38/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Uncertainty at macro level is expected to persist mainly arising from the geopolitical risks (Israel-Palestine and Ukraine-Russia wars, together with tensions between China, Taiwan and Unites States and an intense electoral year with presidential elections taking place in significant countries such as United States, Russia, India and Mexico) and a higher for longer inflationary pressure. More specifically for the auto market, 2024 is expected to be marked by: i) limited auto production growth, with ii) EV penetration still on the rise but with a saw-tooth shape and iii) declining steel prices but still above normalized levels.\n\nAccording to S&P Global Mobility data as of February 2024, global light vehicle production volumes in 2024 are expected to slightly increase versus 2023 at 82.2 million units in countries within Gestamp's production footprint. By region, S&P Global Mobility expects production volumes to grow in 2024 in NAFTA (+2.4%) and Asia (+0.1%), while Mercosur (-1.2%), Eastern Europe (-1.2%) and Western Europe (-2.4%) are expected to see volumes slightly declining.\n\nLooking at Gestamp's operations, the Group's main focus for 2024 will be to preserve its growth profile by: i) mitigating the potential EV volatility, ii) keep using our technology and innovation capabilities to be at the vanguard, and iii) implementing a disciplined capex strategy to capture future growth; as well as to ensure the company's profitability by: i) further implementing efficiency improvements, ii) reinforcing its flexibility to mitigate potential volatility and iii) focusing on the NAFTA region restructuring plan.\n\n## For 2024, Gestamp expects revenues for the auto business to outperform market production volumes.\n\nIn this context, the Group is determined to continue reinforcing its financial and strategic positioning. For 2024, Gestamp expects revenues for the auto business to outperform market production volumes growth in the low-single digit range with a flat reported EBITDA margin when compared to 2023. As for Gescrap, the Group expects similar revenues and EBITDA in 2024 versus 2023. Regarding Free Cash Flow and leverage targets, Gestamp expects to generate positive Free Cash Flow (FCF defined as Net Debt reduction excluding acquisitions and dividends) in the range of the €200 million and reach a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0-1.5x. Gestamp is strongly committed on delivering on this guidance.\n\nOn June 20th, 2023 Gestamp celebrated its second Capital Markets Day in which presented its long term strategy for the 2022-27 Plan explaining the Group's positioning as Partner Supplier for its clients towards a more sustainable mobility. Gestamp's Strategic Plan is based on seven key pillars, which are: i) growth ambition, as market production volumes recover with increasing EV penetration and outsourcing levels; ii) being a trusted partner for both traditional clients and new comers; iii) using its technology and innovation capabilities to be differential; iv) keep improving the operational excellence, in order to v) grow in a profitable way; vi) maintain a disciplined balance sheet\n\nprofile; and vii) lead the circular economy in the automotive sector supported by its latest acquisition, Gescrap.\n\nDuring the Capital Markets Day the Group provided its financial targets for 2027, which include: i) revenues outperforming the market by mid-single digit during the period, with EV related sales reaching more than 50% of total sales of parts by 2027; ii) a 150-190 basis points increase in EBITDA margin; iii) net debt to EBITDA ratio standing in the range of 1.0-1.5x throughout the period; iv) a ROCE improvement of 350 basis points; and v) maintaining current dividend policy based on a 30% pay-out of annual net profit.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

This strategy is considered an area of particular importance as it has to be perfectly aligned with the basic principles of its business strategy, but at the same time it is an essential part of the Group's concerns within the framework of its sustainability policy.\n\nFiscal Policy revolves around four basic pillars:\n\n- **•** Responsibility in decisions and actions in fiscal matters.\n- **•** Tax contributions where the activities take place. Gestamp's aim has never been to relocate activities or profits to particular jurisdictions for purely fiscal reasons.\n- **•** Transparency in all the information that Gestamp provides to shareholders, the market and the different stakeholders with which it is associated; this information is also accessible, transparent and reliable.\n- **•** Cooperation with the different public administrations of the countries where Gestamp has an industrial presence and always subject to solid values of professionalism, collaboration, good faith, mutual trust and mutual respect.\n\nAt Gestamp, tax matters are managed in an orderly and professionalised manner in order to guarantee both due and timely compliance with all tax obligations and the effective management of tax risks.\n\nTo this end, Gestamp, on the one hand, has an appropriate, expert and integrated organisation with sufficient technical competence at corporate, divisional and local level, which enables it to manage and ensure due compliance with its tax policies and, on the other hand, it applies the most effective procedures, systems and internal controls to ensure that the tax function is carried out appropriately.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/20 description: In this high-angle shot, a group of business professionals are gathered in what appears to be an office setting.

It also provides information on fiscal risks and their management to the Internal Audit and Risk Management Department which, in turn, follows up and monitors said risks, including them in the Group's Comprehensive Risk Management System and informing the Audit Committee of them.\n\nINFORMATION ON CORPORATE TAX EXPENSES, PROFIT BEFORE TAXES AND SUBSIDIES BY COUNTRY\n\n|                | Corporate tax expenses |       | Profit before taxes |        | Subsid.

Gestamp decided to distribute on an annual basis a total dividend equivalent to approximately 30% of the consolidated net profit for each year, but in two payments, anticipating part of the payment via an interim dividend:\n\n- I. A first payment, through the distribution of an interim dividend, that will be approved pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors to be adopted in December of each year and paid between January and February of the following year.\n- II. A second payment, through the distribution of an ordinary dividend, that will be approved by virtue of a resolution of the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting at the time of approval of the annual accounts and will be paid between the months of June and July of each year.\n\nIn line with our policy, in December 2023, the Board of Directors approved the distribution of an interim cash dividend in January 2024 against 2023 financial results. The payment took place on January 10th, 2024 for a gross amount of €0.07 per share.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

In this regard, the conditions for contracting to commercial suppliers relating to industrial activity for the manufacture of parts located in Spanish territory included payment periods equal to or less than 60 days in both 2023 and 2022, as stipulated in Transitional Provision Two of the aforementioned law.\n\nIn accordance with such Law, the following information corresponds to the Group companies that operate in Spain:\n\n| 2023                                |                |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Average payment period to suppliers | 42 days        |\n| Total payments made                 | €4,597 million |\n| Total payments pending              | €698 million   |\n\n#### 2022\n\n| Average payment period to suppliers | 43 days        |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Total payments made                 | €3,393 million |\n| Total payments pending              | €618 million   |\n\nThe monetary volume paid in 2023 in a period less than the maximum established in the late payment regulations, for companies based in Spain, is 1,083,610 thousand euros (673,169 thousand euros in 2022) corresponding to 62,251 invoices (42,027 invoices in 2022).\n\nFor reasons of efficiency and in line with common business uses, the Group's Spanish companies basically have a supplier payment schedule, whereby payments are made on fixed days which, at the main companies, are twice a month.\n\nIn general, in 2023 and 2022, payments made by Spanish companies to suppliers under agreements entered into after the entry into force of Law 15/2010, did not exceed the legal deferral limits. The payments made to Spanish suppliers in 2023 and 2022 that exceeded the established legal deadline have been, in quantitative terms, of scant relevance and are derived from circumstances or incidents outside the established payment policy, including mainly the closing of agreements with suppliers in the delivery of goods or provision of the service or specific handling processes.\n\nAlso, at December 31st, 2022 and 2021, no amounts were pending payment to suppliers located in Spain that exceed the legal payment term.\n\n#### **Subsequent Events**\n\nThere are no significant subsequent events after December 31st, 2023.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-49-0\"></span>03 ESG Perspective\n\n- 3.1 [ESG at Gestamp](#page-50-0)\n- 3.2 [ESG Strategy](#page-53-0)\n- 3.3 [ESG Criteria Ratings](#page-58-0)\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-50-0\"></span>Image /page/50/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"Gestamp\" in a bold, dark blue font, followed by a stylized blue square containing a white curved line with a circle at the end, resembling a stylized \"G\" or a connection symbol.\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/3 description: The image shows a symbol consisting of three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, with the word \"INDEX\" written in capital letters below the lines.

In the design, development and manufacture of parts for vehicles, Gestamp remains faithful to its commitment to producing vehicles that are safer - with a view to keeping passengers and pedestrians safe - and lighter, while reducing CO2 emissions during the vehicle's service life.\n\nGestamp views sustainability as a way of creating long-term value in a bid to boost the growth strategy and enable all stakeholder groups to gain a competitive edge.\n\nAs the interests of its stakeholder groups figure ever more prominently in its long-term vision, Gestamp subjects all its operations to certain environmental, social and governance-related criteria. This approach gives Gestamp an essential competitive edge and enables the company to take its place among the major players of the sector.\n\n## DOUBLE MATERIALITY ANALYSIS\n\nIn 2023, with the guidance of an external consultant, Gestamp conducted a double materiality analysis based on GRI standards, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the reporting standards (ESRS) developed by EFRAG.\n\nThe primary aim of this analysis is to identify and assess the main positive and negative environmental and social impacts of the company's activities (impact materiality) and the related risks and opportunities that may arise for the company (financial materiality). It can then set out to define its management model, strategy and action plan accordingly.\n\nTo this end, according to a particular methodology (see Annex: Double Materiality Methodology) involving a qualitative assessment of Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IROs), it was possible to identify and assess, by way of a bottom-up approach, sub-topics, on the one hand, and the most relevant ESG topics for the company, on the other hand. The company's materiality matrix has been produced on the basis of the results:\n\nImage /page/53/Figure/19 description: This image is a materiality matrix, plotting different environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors based on their impact and financial materiality. The x-axis represents financial materiality, and the y-axis represents impact materiality. The matrix is divided into four quadrants: High Impact Materiality, High Materiality, Low Materiality, and High Financial Materiality. Several ESG factors are plotted on the matrix. 'Water' is in the top left quadrant. 'Responsible supply chain' is in the top center. 'Occupational health and safety', 'Business conduct', 'Own workforce', 'Product innovation and quality', 'Climate Change', and 'Circular economy' are in the top right quadrant. 'Affected communities', 'Pollution', and 'Biodiversity and ecosystems' are in the bottom left quadrant.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nIt should be noted that the methodology diverged considerably from the approach adopted in the materiality analysis published in 2022, as the concept of relevance for stakeholder groups (internal and external) gave way to an impact (inside-out perspective) and risk and opportunity (outside-in perspective) analysis. As such, while analysis granularity is greater in 2023, the number of material topics fell from 20 to 8 (12 fewer), meaning that it is possible to identify those that are particularly relevant for the company.\n\nThese matters are addressed in the **8 strategic pillars** which form the cornerstone of the company's ESG strategy, and in the ambitious targets it has set for the next few years.\n\nInformation about the company's ability to manage the most relevant impacts, risks and opportunities for Gestamp in 2023 is detailed in the various chapters of this report.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/14 description: The image shows a view looking up into a canopy of green trees.

The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing a different aspect of ESG. The sections include Business Conduct, Climate Change, Circular Economy/Product Innovation and Quality, Biodiversity and Ecosystems/Pollution/Water/Circular Economy, Occupational Health and Safety, Affected Communities, and Own Workforce. Each section contains specific goals and metrics related to that aspect of ESG. For example, the Business Conduct section includes goals such as \"Deployment of the third party due diligence policy in more than 60% of countries (80% off total turnover)\" and \"Implementation of Human Rights due diligence program.\" The Climate Change section includes goals such as \"62% of the energy used by Gestamp in 2025 will be renewable\" and \"45% reduction of tCO2e in scopes 1&2 in 2025.\" The diagram also includes images of people and symbols related to each section, such as a handshake for Business Conduct and a recycling symbol for Circularity.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### [3.

In this sense, it is a source of great opportunities that require innovative solutions, investment and new commitments in the short, medium and long term.\n\nGestamp tackles the challenge of sustainable mobility and decarbonization of the sector while understanding that all agents in the value chain must be involved and work together by building alliances that allow them to achieve common and more ambitious goals.\n\nAs a result of the double materiality analysis, the following impacts, risks and opportunities linked to the material issue of **Climate Change** have been achieved:\n\n#### IMPACT\n\n(GHGs).\n\nDeterioration of air quality as a consequence of emissions from fossil fuel consumption\n\n#### RISKS4\n\nIncreased exposure to extreme weather events: cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, etc.\n\nAn increase in temperature could result in increased air conditioning costs for Gestamp, especially related to providing a suitable environment for the health and safety of its employees.\n\nIncreased costs resulting from the transition to low-emission technologies.\n\nVariation in the availability of resources due to climate change leading to a decrease in supply and an increase in prices.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/23 description: This is an aerial shot of a lush green landscape, possibly a forest or mountainous region, partially obscured by a layer of white clouds or fog.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nIn 2020, Gestamp validated by SBTi its emission reduction targets: 30% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 22% reduction of Scope 3 (base year 2018). Due to regulatory changes and customer requirements in 2022 Gestamp decided to increase the level of ambition regarding Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions. The SBTi targets for scope 1 and 2 will be actualized during 2024.\n\n**2045**\n\nClimate Neutral\n\n**SCOPE 1 and 2**\n\n**2050**\n\nClimate Neutral\n\n**SCOPES 1, 2 and 3**\n\n**Road to Neutrality**\n\n**2030**\n\nClimate Neutral\n\n**SCOPE 2**\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp has kept on working on a new strategy to combat Climate Change as required by regulations such as the EU climate-neutral by 2050 objective and the emission reduction targets of its customers.\n\nTo define this strategy, the company:\n\n- **•** Has a multidisciplinary working group led by ESG Management, with the participation of the Environment, Purchasing, Energy Efficiency, Commercial and Operations departments.\n- **•** Analyses the neutrality targets and time horizons of automotive manufacturers and their requirements for greenhouse gas reductions in production processes.\n- **•** Monitors, for all production plants, the most intensive sources of emissions, both by type of installation and by type of fuel.\n- **•** Studies, both technically and economically, the feasibility of establishing emission reduction measures for the 3 scopes over time.\n\n#### CLIMATE-NEUTRAL TARGETS\n\nGestamp will be neutral in Gestamp will be neutral in Gestamp will be neutral in\n\nScope 2\nby 2030\n\nScopes 1 and\n\nGestamp will be neutral in\n\nScope 2 Scopes 1 and 2 Scopes 1, 2 and 3 **by 2030 by 2045 by 2050 at a global level**\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The lines are a teal color, and the word \"INDEX\" is in a darker teal color.\n\nRegarding Scope 3, Gestamp is aware of the challenge of establishing initiatives to reduce its emissions outside its direct control. Despite this, in 2023 the company has continued to work with its main suppliers and will continue to reinforce measures aimed at reducing these emissions in 2024.\n\n| 1.

These indicators are included in this report and verified together with the rest of the non-financial information.\n\n#### **Contribution to the decarbonization of vehicles through their useful life**\n\nFor many years Gestamp has contributed to emission reductions of vehicles by making their parts lighter, leading to an increase in fuel efficiency and therefore reducing CO2 emissions. To this end, the ESG department, in collaboration with departments such as innovation, purchasing and sales, analyses the carbon footprint of the components and the impact within the vehicle's life cycle.\n\nIn addition, Gestamp helps its customers in the challenge of the electrification of the sector and its transition to electric vehicles, providing technological solutions adapted to this environment, which increase both the autonomy and safety of these vehicles. (Please see the innovation section).\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations provided by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) working group, and after becoming a *[supporter](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/)* of the initiative in 2022, Gestamp has worked on climate change-related disclosure in four topic areas: governance model, strategy, risk management and metrics and objectives.\n\nImage /page/62/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logo for CDP, which consists of a red geometric shape on the left and the letters \"CDP\" in red on the right.

In this way, Gestamp has identified the **main opportunities** presented by climate change for the company and a total of **47 physical and transition risks** in different time horizons: short (0-5 years), medium (6-15 years) and long term (16-30 years).\n\nImage /page/64/Picture/19 description: This is an aerial shot of a winding road cutting through a dense forest.

Once climate risks and opportunities have been identified, they are assessed according to a series of specific criteria, the results of which are used to establish controls.\n\nThe climate risks identified in the various areas of the company influence the overall strategy of Gestamp and are included in the overall risk management, with measures being established to manage these risks as follows:\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/22 description: A close-up shot captures the side of a car parked on an asphalt road, with the road stretching into the distance. The car's tire and part of its body are visible on the left side of the frame. The asphalt road is textured and appears to be well-maintained. In the background, there are hills and mountains under a partly cloudy sky, adding depth to the scene.\n\n- **• Products and services:** Gestamp has boasted a strategy for products and services related to climate change since electric vehicles entered the market. For the rolling out of electric vehicles, in 2018 Gestamp set up a new business unit devoted to electric vehicles whose task is to develop the best solutions to adapt its products to the new technical demands of electric cars.\n- **• Value chain:** the company's processes regarding supply chain consider 2 key lines: 1) Participation in working groups together with customers to seek projects that guarantee CO2 emission reductions throughout the useful life of vehicles. 2) Collaborate with suppliers to align with the scope 3 reduction targets and achieve a supply chain with a lower climate footprint.\n\nSome examples in 2023 are:\n\n- **-** ArcelorMittal Europe Flat Products and Gestamp, have signed a \"circularity agreement\". The agreement includes jointly designing and implementing a circularity scheme that encourages steel recycling between Gestamp and ArcelorMittal, and ultimately passing on the benefits of the agreement to automobile manufacturers.\n- **-** Tata Steel and Gestamp have signed an agreement aimed at almost doubling the percentage of recycled steel in components supplied to the automotive sector. The initiative will allow Gestamp to pass on to vehicle manufacturers the benefits of increasing recycled material, as well as reducing the associated carbon footprint.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in blue text below three horizontal blue lines.\n\n[1.

Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n**• Investment in R&D:** Customers seek lighter parts which allow them to lower the weight of end vehicles so as to be able to reduce emissions per km. In this sense, the mission of the R&D Department is to develop innovative solutions that enable the weight of the parts to be reduced, thus contributing to a reduction in the overall weight of the vehicle. This approach results in lower fuel consumption, thus reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Gestamp also supports the approval of new materials (low-emission, recycled, etc.) and favours co-development throughout the value chain for the design of the product required for the mobility of the future.\n\n**• Operations:** In 2023, Gestamp has defined a roadmap, in accordance with the ESG 2025 Plan, to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement and the requirements of its customers. These measures include energy efficiency actions (see \"Metrics and targets\" in the \"Road to neutrality\" section of this chapter) to reduce consumption and electrify their facilities. In this vein, Gestamp boasts a renewable energy supply strategy by means of three channels:\n\n**-** Signing of long-term renewable energy supply agreements, PPAs (power purchase agreement). In 2023, in the Indian perimeter, the extension of the solar PPA has been signed at the Chennai plant, and work has been done so that the Pune plant has an operational solar PPA in 2024. At the same time, the negotiation of a 15-year contract for the supply of 49 GWh of wind energy to plants in Mexico by the company Elawan.\n\n**-** Purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (EACs). In 2023, production plants in the United Kingdom, the Nitra plant in Slovakia and Hardtech in Sweden have used green energy with guarantees of origin, while in Poland the electricity company made green certificates available. Likewise, renewable energy certificates were purchased for part of consumption in Germany, the Czech Republic, China, Mexico and the USA.\n\n**-** Energy self-consumption. In 2023, 25.5 GWh of photovoltaic solar energy will be self-consumed from plants in China, Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain and Portugal. During this year, a total of 13 solar self-consumption plants have been launched, 11 in Spain, 1 in Portugal, 1 in Bulgaria and 2 in Turkey. The deployment in these countries will end next year. Additionally, a contract has been signed with EDF for the installation of solar covers in 7 plants in Germany and work has been underway on solar self-consumption agreements in France, the United Kingdom and Japan that are expected to be launched next year.\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/16 description: A close-up shot of the rear of a gray car parked on the side of a road.

Each plant reports its energy consumption levels in a database and, based on this information, the carbon footprint of each centre and the overall footprint are calculated according to GHG Protocol and IPCC procedures.\n\nAll Gestamp production processes need a source of energy in order to function. Therefore, the different sources of energy consumed at the facilities are comprehensively tracked: Electricity,\n\nThe distribution of energy consumption globally is divided into 60% electricity, 35% natural gas and\n\nEnergy consumption by fuel type (GJ) 2021 2022 2023 Electricity 3,762,902 3,977,471 4,167,390 Natural gas 2,604,914 2,358,550 2,388,841 LPG 282,400 335,083 338,281 Diesel 26,342 25,985 23,153 **Total energy consumption 6,676,588 6,697,089 6,917,665 Renewable energy consumption\\* 347,915 1,329,133 1,735,762 % of total consumption 5% 20% 25%** Electricity is the main type of energy consumed by the Group, given that its plants use electricity as an energy source for most of the production processes, and also to power the facilities. Natural gas is used mainly for air conditioning in buildings, so consumption is usually seasonal. In addition, some production plants use it in processes like hot stamping and in painting lines. The other fuel types are linked primarily to the fleet of forklifts at the plants.\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/14 description: A man wearing a black t-shirt with the word \"Gestamp\" on the back is working with a machine.

In the case of electricity, they are requested directly from the supplier of each plant (if not available, the country's electricity emission factor provided by the International Energy Agency is taken). For Scope 3, DEFRA, CEDA and Sphera sources are combined for aluminium and steel consumption. The % are always referred to total emissions, so they do not have to add up to 100 as a whole. In the breakdown of Scope 1 into the different fuel types, only the main fuels are taken into account. There are other sources of Scope 1 emissions that are taken into account in the total but have not been disaggregated.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in blue, with three horizontal blue lines above it.

In terms of Energy Efficiency, in the last years a global initiative has been launched to optimize and reduce the energy consumption and to be environmentally responsible. Each production plant is working individually and together with other plants to implement measures to rationalize the consumption and to make sure all the technologies and equipment are working in the most efficient way from an energy point of view.\n\nThe commitment to emissions reduction, environmental protection, equipment performance optimization and operational excellence, drive this initiative in Gestamp Group. The Energy Efficiency project aimed at making improvements through several areas:\n\n- **•** Analysis of consumption and knowledge of the energy performance of the individual productive assets and facilities\n- **•** Study of good practices implemented in the Group\n- **•** Research into new improvement channels\n- **•** Sharing of all acquired knowledge.\n- **•** Setting of aims and the involvement of all organizational levels of the company.\n\nTo achieve those aims, the instantaneous consumption of electricity and gas of the equipment are monitored to create a model of its performance. Based on those consumption patterns, algorithms to identify quantify and notify deviations, are created.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The graphic consists of two curved lines that start thin and become thicker as they curve around to form a hook shape. At the end of the hook is a small circle. The lines are white, and the square is dark blue.\n\n2023\n\nIn 2023, over 47 plants formed part of the Energy Efficiency initiative. A total of 9% of the plants included in this scope were certified under the energy management system standard ISO 50001. For the remaining plants included in the initiative, it is worth saying that the strategy used regarding\n\nSpecific Energy Efficiency measures were identified and implemented at each of these plants to optimize the functioning of equipment and to reduce its electricity and natural gas consumption. Furthermore, standard documents related to shut-down protocols and other good practices were launched globally. Shut down protocols were followed in the production assets during non-working periods which resulted in significant improvement in energy KPIs and a reduction of non-essential energy consumption. These initiatives together enabled the Group to achieve a reduction of almost\n\nAdditionally, a 16 GWh energy savings has been achieved in plants which are out of scope of energy efficiency initiative through continuous application of shut-down protocols and energy efficiency\n\nJust to reinforce the Energy Efficiency initiative and the shut-down protocols application, an Energy Efficiency audit program was also globally announced to all divisions and launched in a pilot plant at the end of 2023. This audit program will continue being implemented during 2024 with the aim of identifying non-standard practices which correction will result in additional energy efficiency\n\nFrom a global perspective within the group, a 51 GWh energy savings were achieved in 2023.\n\nenergy efficiency is based on the requirements from ISO 50001 guidelines.\n\n#### **Results achieved in 2023**\n\n35 GWh.\n\nbest practices.\n\nsavings for the plants.\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in blue, with three horizontal blue lines above it.

Furthermore, new objectives for 2024 were defined based on the potential energy efficiency actions that could be implemented in each plant, as seen in the table below:\n\n|             | Total MWh  | Emissions avoided |\n|-------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Target 2024 | 48,950 MWh | 12,025 tCO2       |\n\n#### LONG-TERM EXPECTED OUTCOMES\n\nFrom 2024 forward, Gestamp will keep working to optimize consumption at the plants involved in the project, endeavoring to find ideal consumption levels for production and auxiliary equipment. The dynamics of responsible consumption at the plants will be consolidated by implementing an energy performance standard at the plants. In this way, and by monitoring energy consumption, the plants will be capable of standardizing the expected performance, assessing, and predicting deviations by using energy production indicators for equipment and energy management.\n\nEnergy-related best practices are being integrated and consolidated in a cross-disciplinary manner across all the Group's teams strategies: ESG, R&D, new construction, expansions, Operations, etc.\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/17 description: The image shows a tunnel-like structure made of metal sheets.

The diagram is circular, with arrows indicating the flow of materials. The process starts with raw material extraction, which leads to steel production. Steel production also receives materials from other sources of pre-consumer scrap and pre-consumer scrap. The steel is then used in manufacturing, which leads to the use phase of the car. After the use phase, the car is sent to scrap collection and processing, which also receives materials from other sources of scrap. The scrap is then sent back to steel production as cropst-consumer AP, completing the cycle.\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/14 description: The image shows a field of wind turbines against an orange sky with clouds.

Seeking the generation of new materials with a high percentage of recycled content to mitigate this impact becomes especially relevant.\n\nThis is why Gestamp identifies the high value of its commitment to the circular economy and for a model based on:\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/14 description: The image shows a simple illustration. A small, filled blue circle is positioned above a black, blocky shape that resembles a pedestal or a simplified building. The circle appears to be floating or suspended above the blocky shape.\n\n**INCREASE IN RECYCLED MATERIAL**\n\nDevelopment of partnerships that promote \"closing the loop\" projects.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/17 description: The image shows a blue pushpin.\n\n#### **EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES**\n\nDeveloping production processes that promote the efficient use of resources (raw materials, water and energy).\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/20 description: The image shows a blue and white icon of a trash can with a warning sign on it and a gear next to it. The trash can is outlined in blue, and the warning sign is a blue triangle with an exclamation point inside. The gear is also blue and is located to the right of the trash can.\n\n#### **WASTE MANAGEMENT**\n\nDevelopment of waste management processes that enhance the availability of secondary raw materials.\n\nHowever, Gestamp faces significant challenges related to the so-called \"green\" steel. Its availability is directly related to decarbonisation strategies and the investments of the main suppliers, which entails additional costs. Approval is also required to ensure that they meet the strict technical and quality requirements of customers. Similarly, there are obstacles to the acquisition of aluminium and other composite materials, which although used to a lesser extent by the company, present the same difficulties in terms of availability, costs and approval requirements.\n\n## AENOR CERTIFICATION: CIRCULAR ECONOMY STRATEGY\n\nGiven the challenges of defining priorities in the circular economy, AENOR has developed a certification of the Circular Economy Strategy Management Model. This model provides organisations with a reference framework that helps determine the relevance of the aspects to be addressed and identify their contribution to international circular economy principles. In this regard, Gestamp has worked during 2023 on obtaining the AENOR Circular Economy certification, demonstrating its firm commitment to innovative practices in this area.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/26 description: The image shows the logo for AENOR ESTRATEGIA.

An example of this are the agreements signed in 2023 with [Tata Steel](https://www.gestamp.com/Medios/Prensa/Comunicados-de-prensa/2023/Gestamp-y-Tata-Steel-firman-alianza-para-aumentar-casi-al-doble-el-acero-reciclado-en-su-produccion), [SSAB](https://www.gestamp.com/Medios/Prensa/Comunicados-de-prensa/2023/Gestamp-y-SSAB-inician-una-alianza-para-utilizar-acero-libre-de-fosiles) and [Arcelor Mittal](https://www.gestamp.com/Medios/Prensa/Comunicados-de-prensa/2023/ArcelorMittal-y-Gestamp-firman-un-acuerdo-de-circularidad).\n- **•** Collaboration with customers to align with their expectations and requirements.\n- **•** Approval and validation of new materials with a high recycled material content, in a collaborative environment between steel mills, the customer and Gestamp.\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/18 description: The image shows a dense forest from an aerial perspective. The canopy is lush and green, with varying shades indicating different types or ages of trees. The trees are closely packed together, creating a continuous blanket of foliage. Some tree trunks are visible, appearing as thin, light-colored lines amidst the greenery. The overall impression is one of a healthy and thriving forest ecosystem.\n\n#### EXAMPLE OF GREEN STEEL APPROVAL\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp has begun carrying out the first tests with new, more sustainable materials thanks to the alliances forged with steel suppliers. In this sense, a steel with a high content of recycled material (>75%) and produced with renewable energy through an electric furnace (EAF) has been tested for the manufacture of a component of the chassis division. The first tests have proved successful, determining that this new material does not affect the proper performance of the part.\n\nThanks to the analysis of the product's carbon footprint (*cradle-to-gate*), it has been determined that with this material we could reduce the equivalent CO2 emissions of the component by up to 63%.\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/22 description: This image shows a bar chart comparing the carbon dioxide emissions of green steel and conventional steel. The y-axis is measured in kg CO2 eq. The bar for green steel has a value of 11.93, while the bar for conventional steel has a value of 32.38. A note below the chart states that the result assumes all the stamped parts in green steel. For the analyzed part the result is 16.39 kg CO2 eq. achieving approx. 50% of reduction.\n\nAlthough steel is the Group's main raw material, and most of the actions have been focused on this material, work is also in progress on signing agreements with aluminium suppliers to comply with the emission reduction and circularity requirements of customers, particularly projects related to battery boxes for electric vehicles.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

This integration allows greater control over the management of metals, obtaining better traceability, and promoting and enabling their use in the production of low-emission steel and with a high content of recycled material.\n\nIn this regard, and thanks to the integration of Gescrap, Gestamp seeks to promote the availability of high-quality scrap in the automotive sector. An example of this is the agreement established with Tata on the mass balance where the amount of scrap supplied by Gestamp will be counted as part of the recycled steel material of the final product. In this way, the percentage of recycled material associated with the steel supplied to Gestamp has risen to 30% (from 17%), without it affecting quality, strength or conformability.\n\nImage /page/80/Picture/14 description: The image shows the logo for Gescrap. The logo consists of a circular graphic on the left and the word \"GESCRAP\" on the right. The circular graphic is made up of two curved shapes, one orange and one blue, that intertwine to form a circle.

The metal object is in the foreground and is the main focus of the image. There are some papers and a notebook on the table as well.\n\n#### **Gestamp in the vehicle life cycle**\n\n1\n\nVEHICLE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STAGE\n\nThrough our R&D departments, technological developments and customer and supplier collaboration, Gestamp offers solutions to reduce the weight of the parts it manufactures (one of the key factors in the commitment to the decarbonisation of the automotive sector). At this stage, the selection of production processes associated with manufacturing also plays a fundamental role.\n\nLikewise, it becomes necessary to integrate, from the initial design conception phase, the possibilities of the materials used at the end of the useful life of the vehicle, in order to facilitate its recovery (ecodesign).\n\n2\n\nMANUFACTURING STAGE Gestamp uses environmental and social criteria to select its suppliers.\n\nAs a Tier 1 supplier of automotive components, Gestamp focuses its manufacturing activity on:\n\n- **•** Optimising the consumption of raw materials and natural resources.\n- **•** Optimising production processes and logistics.\n- **•** Energy efficiency.\n- **•** Correctly managing waste generated.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Analysis of product life-cycle as a strategic element**\n\nIn an environment where a common language becomes necessary when measuring the impact of a product on the environment and society, Gestamp is committed to life-cycle analysis as a differentiating factor in the development of its parts. These analyses:\n\n- **•** Provide a global perspective of the complete life-cycle of products in the development phase.\n- **•** Make it possible to show the impact on use and end of useful life, which is decisive when codesigning a part.\n- **•** Help highlight and reliably quantify the Group's circular strategy.\n\nDespite the fact that the analyses carried out to date have focused on the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and on intermediate analyses of the product's life cycle (Cradle-to-Gate & Gate-to-Gate), Gestamp is considering the possibility of including other categories of future environmental impact such as resource depletion and toxicity. Gestamp also aims to promote the complete analysis of the product life cycle (Cradle-to-Grave) in the coming years. For this, Gestamp has an internal PCF tool (Product Carbon Footprint) which carries out these analyses.\n\n#### PCF GESTAMP TOOL\n\nGestamp has developed an automated carbon footprint calculation tool for the parts that it manufactures, mainly focused on the Chassis and Body in White divisions, although it plans to expand its scope to Tooling and Edscha. This tool has as its main input a complete database called Life Cycle Inventory adapted to Gestamp's main production processes and the most used raw materials. During its building, a detailed analysis of all production processes was carried out together with the energy efficiency team and its real-time consumption monitoring tool. Likewise, with highly relevant departments in the company, such as the purchasing department, which has worked on obtaining information on suppliers and raw materials; and the engineering and commercial departments, which knew the technical detail of the parts to be analysed.\n\nDuring 2024, the aim is to certify the calculation methodology behind the PCF tool, as well as the inventory on which it is based.\n\nImage /page/82/Figure/20 description: The image shows a diagram of the life cycle of a product, from cradle to grave. The diagram is divided into three sections: Cradle, Gestamo Gate, and Grave. The Cradle section includes the raw material extraction and material manufacture stages. The Gestamo Gate section includes the auto-parts manufacture stage. The Grave section includes the final product assembly, use stage, and end of life stages. The diagram also includes information about the emission factor material, logistics and material information, Gestamp production information, and scope 3 and scope 1 & 2.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION](#page-59-0)\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group had 94% of its plants certified according to the ISO 14001:2015 and/or EMAS standard. During the year, 2 new certifications have been achieved: Gestamp Pune II and Gestamp Wroclaw; and the certifications of Gestamp Kaluga and Gestamp Saint Petersburg have been lost due to the situation of these plants due to the war in Ukraine.\n\n[4.1 Road to Neutrality](#page-60-0)\n\nEach plant is audited both externally and internally every year. In order to carry out internal audits, the Group encourages cross audits in which two specialists from two plants audit a third plant in order to share experiences, replicate solutions, propose improvements, etc. This project is currently implemented in plants in Spain, Portugal, Germany and Brazil.\n\nFurthermore, internal audits have been carried out in all plants that are included in the scope of the Zero Waste certification.\n\nAs a new measure implemented in 2023, internal audits have been carried out on the environmental information reported by the plants on the ENVRA platform. Through the verification of invoices and internal documents, it has been verified that the data on water, energy and waste consumption is correct and accurate. These audits have been carried out both electronically (plants in Spain) and in person (USA, France) and will be progressively extended over the next few years until they cover 100% of the Group.\n\n#### **Resources earmarked for environmental prevention: people, provisions and guarantees**\n\n[4.2 Cicularity](#page-75-0) **[4.3 Environmental Management](#page-84-0)**\n\nGestamp has a professional team dedicated to complying with environmental requirements both at the corporate level and at each of the production plants. Environmental technicians report quarterly to the corporate team, who monitor and evaluate the indicators.\n\nAll investments in systems, equipment and facilities in relation to the protection and improvement of the environment, as well as any expenses incurred with regard to the protection and improvement of the environment are set out below:\n\n|                                               | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Environmental investments<br>(thousands of €) | 4,520 | 5,046 | 6,918 |\n| Environmental expenses<br>(thousands of €)    | 1,685 | 1,965 | 2,295 |\n\nRegarding environmental risks, Gestamp makes financial provisions to cover their implementation. Additionally, the company has guarantees in the form of insurance that can cover the occurrence of environmental risks:\n\n- **•** Environmental Liability Insurance.\n- **•** Third-Party Liability Cover for Sudden and Accidental Pollution in the General Third-Party Liability policy.\n\nDuring 2023, three environmental incidents have taken place in the USA that have affected the exterior surface of the factory; But in none of the three cases has it been necessary to activate the guarantees of the Environmental Liability Insurance that the Group has contracted. In 2022, there were no environmental incidents that caused the Environmental Liability Insurance to be activated.\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/24 description: Two men are standing in front of a large industrial machine.

At plants where surface treatment processes take place, such as painting or galvanising parts, or hydroforming processes, there is an industrial use of water. Only 29% of the Group's centres have such a process.\n\nTo monitor the development of water consumption, we use the Water Consumption Index, WCI, which measures the m3 of consumed water/€100,000 of added value. The significant variation experienced in this index depends on the part being painted, which directly relates to the projects being worked on with the customer at any given time.\n\nThe painting of skin parts, which will eventually be placed on the outside of vehicles, involves certain quality requirements that make it essential to frequently change the baths on the cataphoresis lines. As such, there is a considerable increase in water consumption. Conversely, the baths can be reused in the treatment of structural parts, which entails a low water consumption and a reduction in the WCI.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group's level of activity has increased and yet a reduction in water consumption can be seen as a result of the saving measures implemented in the production centers. In this way, the Water Consumption Index has been reduced compared to the previous year.\n\n| Water consumption according to the source (m3) | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Public Network                                 | 1,383,704 | 1,584,713 | 1,570,338 |\n| Surface Water                                  | 0.241     | 0.240     | 0         |\n| Underground Water                              | 255,162   | 206,835   | 183,212   |\n| Total                                          | 1,639,107 | 1,791,788 | 1,753,550 |\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/19 description: A close-up shot captures a hand emerging from the water, with the fingers extended upwards.

Gestamp works to reduce all this consumption by identifying and implementing good practices.\n\nTo a lesser extent, representing 2% of total consumables, products such as oil, paint and chemicals necessary as auxiliary materials for the development of productive activity are used in plants.\n\nEfficiency in processes, quality, product and tool design are fundamental in order to optimise and reduce raw material consumption. Therefore, Gestamp monitors all of this every quarter by means of different management systems of the Group controlled by the plants, divisions and corporate from different perspectives, in addition to the environmental perspective, such as the areas of finance, purchasing, quality and the technical office, with the ultimate goal of achieving operational excellence.\n\n| Consumo de Materias Primas y Materiales Aprovisionados (% Tn) | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Steel                                                         | 97%       | 96%       | 96%       |\n| Aluminium                                                     | 2%        | 3%        | 3%        |\n| Other procured materials:                                     | 1%        | 1%        | 1%        |\n| Paint                                                         | 0.05%     | 0.05%     | 0.1%      |\n| Oil                                                           | 0.05%     | 0.06%     | 0.09%     |\n| Binder agent                                                  | 0.09%     | 0.03%     | 0.06%     |\n| Welding wire                                                  | 0.26%     | 0.19%     | 0.34%     |\n| Electrodes                                                    | 0.01%     | 0.01%     | 0.01%     |\n| Chemical products                                             | 0.09%     | 0.06%     | 0.14%     |\n| Welding gases                                                 | 0.44%     | 0.60%     | 0.001%    |\n| Steel consumption per region (Tn)                             | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n| Europe                                                        | 1,485,081 | 1,540,072 | 1,667,939 |\n| North America                                                 | 1,112,524 | 541,567   | 541,748   |\n| South America                                                 | 250,737   | 282,541   | 321,024   |\n\nAsia 188,349 274,452 293,752 **Total 3,036,691 2,638,632 2,824,468**\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/18 description: The image shows a row of large, silver metal coils.

Of this total, 28,095 tons would correspond to non-hazardous waste and 28,395 tons to hazardous waste.\n\nOf the total of non-hazardous waste, 95% corresponded to scrap metal. Scrap metal is a waste product that is 100% recyclable. Its reintroduction into the steel production process contributes to closing its life-cycle in accordance with the circular economy model.\n\n#### **Hazardous waste**\n\nIn the hazardous waste category, the most frequently generated type is contaminated water, sludge, used oils and contaminated materials (cloths and gloves stained mainly with oil).\n\n| Types of waste generated (Tn) | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hazardous Waste               | 23,289    | 24,034    | 28,395    |\n| Non-Hazardous Waste           | 23,222    | 26,982    | 28,095    |\n| Scrap                         | 998,309   | 959,696   | 1,051,236 |\n| Total                         | 1,044,820 | 1,010,712 | 1,107,726 |\n\n#### **Non-Hazardous Waste**\n\nThe most frequently generated non-hazardous waste categories are wood, solid urban waste and paper/cardboard:\n\n|                                      | 2021  | 2022  |       | 2023    |                                       |                                   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|---------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Type of waste (%)                    | %     | %     | %     | Tonnes  | Waste not<br>intended for<br>disposal | Waste<br>intended for<br>disposal |\n| Wood                                 | 33%   | 31%   | 33%   | 9,161   | 8,724                                 | 437                               |\n| Solid urban waste                    | 25%   | 25%   | 27%   | 7,460   | 2,230                                 | 5,230                             |\n| Paper/cardboard                      | 13%   | 11%   | 13%   | 3,657   | 3,450                                 | 207                               |\n| Non-hazardous sludge                 | 4%    | 4%    | 8%    | 2,346   | 1,833                                 | 513                               |\n| Other non-hazardous metals           | 12%   | 12%   | 6%    | 1,767   | 1,759                                 | 8                                 |\n| Other non-hazardous waste            | 8%    | 2%    | 4%    | 1,204   | 192                                   | 1,012                             |\n| Plastic containers                   | 3%    | 3%    | 4%    | 1,157   | 1,104                                 | 53                                |\n| Non-hazardous oil                    | 2%    | 2%    | 2%    | 638     | 630                                   | 8                                 |\n| Process furnace waste                |       | 1%    | 0.3%  | 72      | 27                                    | 45                                |\n| Inert waste                          |       | 9%    | 2%    | 634     | 469                                   | 165                               |\n|                                      | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  |         |                                       |                                   |\n| Type of hazardous waste              | %     | %     | %     | Tonnes* | Waste not<br>intended for<br>disposal | Waste<br>intended for<br>disposal |\n| Polluted water                       | 69%   | 74%   | 74%   | 20,881  | 17,482                                | 3,399                             |\n| Used oil                             | 8%    | 4%    | 4%    | 1,134   | 1,077                                 | 57                                |\n| Sludge                               | 8%    | 8%    | 8%    | 2,367   | 444                                   | 1,923                             |\n| Other waste                          | 6%    | 1%    | 1%    | 299     | 10                                    | 289                               |\n| Contaminated material                | 3%    | 3%    | 4%    | 1,177   | 584                                   | 593                               |\n| Used oil filters                     | 0%    | 0%    | 0%    | 77      | 2                                     | 75                                |\n| Blasting dust                        | 2%    | 2%    | 1%    | 368     | 224                                   | 144                               |\n| Cutting oil                          | 1%    | 3%    | 2%    | 698     | 587                                   | 111                               |\n| Welding powder                       | 1%    | 1%    | 1%    | 152     | 36                                    | 116                               |\n| Contaminated packaging               | 1%    | 1%    | 1%    | 375     | 141                                   | 234                               |\n| Chemical products                    | 1%    | 1%    | 1%    | 331     | 25                                    | 306                               |\n| Others                               | 1%    | 1%    | 3%    | 834     | -

During 2023, the business volume prior to the COVID and chip crisis has recovered. New projects have been started in several plants and this means a greater generation of waste during the first stages of the projects as a consequence of the modifications in the plant lines, which then stabilizes when entering production. Even so, thanks to the Circular Economy model implemented in the Group, it has been possible to maintain the Waste Production Index at a level similar to that achieved the previous year.\n\nRegarding the Waste Management Index, the increase observed is due to the general increase in costs. Due to generalized inflation, during 2023 spending on waste management has increased more than added value.\n\n| Waste Production Index Evolution                                               | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Waste Production Index (tonne of waste/€1,000 million euros of<br>added value) | 17   | 15   | 16   |\n\n \\* Having increased the added value (11%) compared to last year, and maintaining the trend in the generation of total waste, the reduction in the index becomes more notable.\n\n| Waste Management Index Evolution                                                                         | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Waste Management Index (cost of waste management in thousands of euros/€10 million euros of added value) | 19   | 19   | 21   |\n\n#### **Zero waste certification**\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp continued to maintain the AENOR Zero Waste certification which it obtained in 2021, highlighting its Circular Economy model, capable of reintroducing the waste it generates back into the value chain.\n\nThe Zero Waste Regulation takes into account two types of certifications:\n\n**•** Zero Waste. Recovery of more than 90% of waste (excluding scrap metal)\n\n**•** Towards Zero Waste. Recovery of more than 60% of waste (not taking scrap metal into account)\n\nThe verification, which has been carried out online and in person at all the plants within the certification perimeter in India and Brazil, has proven that the waste management systems of 63% of the Group's plants meet the requirements for the existence of complete traceability of waste. This monitoring includes, from its generation to its delivery to a manager for its recovery, ensuring the non-existence of waste with final destination to landfills and verification of the legal requirements associated with the waste management process.\n\nOut of the percentage of verified plants, 15% obtained the Zero Waste certification (more than 90% of waste) and the remaining 48% meet the requirements for Towards Zero Waste (more than 60%).\n\nThe follow-up audits also highlighted the high level of collaboration and involvement of all participating staff in the process of implementing the scheme, the tidiness and cleanliness of the waste storage areas in all the plants audited, and the integration of some specific requirements of the Zero Waste Management System into the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems.\n\nImage /page/93/Figure/25 description: The image shows a comparison of zero waste initiatives. The first section, labeled \"ZERO WASTE,\" indicates that 16 plants are involved. Of the waste produced, 98% is scrap, with 100% recycling and material recovery. The remaining 2% is other waste, with >90% recycling and material recovery. The second section, labeled \"MOVING TOWARDS ZERO WASTE,\" indicates that 51 plants are involved. Of the waste produced, 98% is scrap, with 100% recycling and material recovery. The remaining 2% is other waste, with >60% recycling and material recovery.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The study has concluded that, although 67% of the plants are located in an area close (<5km) or adjacent to a protected natural environment, given the characteristics of Gestamp's production processes, the direct impact on ecosystems is very low.\n\nImage /page/94/Figure/14 description: This image shows a world map with several countries colored in dark blue. The text on the image indicates that these countries have plants located in an area close to or adjacent to a protected natural environment. There are also three labels on the map: \"Gestamp Llanelli\" in Europe, \"Gestamp Betim\" in South America, and \"Gestamp Palau\" in Africa. These labels are connected to gray dots, which the legend indicates are plants with a risk of affecting the natural environment.\n\nAccording to the internal risk assessment, the highest potential risk is considered to occur in plants with industrial surface treatment processes that discharge their water into public channels. Only 8 plants of the Group meet these conditions and, through internal audits, the necessary controls are carried out to guarantee that they have implemented an environmental accident/incident prevention plan that minimizes the occurrence of a possible event.\n\nIn parallel, as part of Gestamp's commitment to biodiversity protection, the company is voluntarily participating in two external initiatives:\n\n#### [EUROPEAN COMMISSION EU BUSINESS @ BIODIVERSITY PLATFORM](https://green-business.ec.europa.eu/business-and-biodiversity_en)\n\nFor many years, Gestamp has worked with pioneering companies to develop tools that help integrate biodiversity into different business models which are currently in place. The work focuses on three main areas:\n\n- **•** Natural capital: helping integrate biodiversity into decisions of the company.\n- **•** Innovation for Biodiversity and Business: developing tools for assessment and sharing and identifying opportunities and best practices.\n- **•** Financial Institutions: forum for dialogue between financial institutions to integrate biodiversity and natural capital into trends in financial activities.\n\n#### PARTICIPATION IN NATURE BUSINESS AMBITION\n\nIn 2023, Forética launched the business leadership initiative Nature Business Ambition in which Gestamp participates, in order to boost ambition, promote action and build alliances to help towards the recovery of nature and biodiversity as key factors in achieving a \"Nature positive\" planet by 2030:\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/24 description: The image contains two logos side by side. The first logo is the word \"forética\" in blue, with a stylized \"é\". The second logo is a green speech bubble containing a white leaf. To the right of the speech bubble are the words \"Nature Business Ambition\" in gray.\n\n## Ambition Action Alliances\n\nBoost ambition and enhancement of the commitment of participating companies\n\nPromote action by identifying business cases, trends and major tools to move towards a \"Nature positive\" world\n\nBuild alliances with the main national and international stakeholders to become a player of reference\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION](#page-59-0)\n\nIn order to comply with the climate and energy objectives proposed by the European Union for 2030, and in turn, achieve the Neutrality objective of the European Green Deal by 2050, it is essential that investments are directed towards sustainable projects and activities. In this way, the economy, companies and society in general will become more resilient to current and future climate and environmental consequences. This is why a common language and a clear definition of what is sustainable is needed.\n\n[4.1 Road to Neutrality](#page-60-0)\n\nIn this sense, and to face this challenge, the European commission published a classification system called the EU Taxonomy (Regulation (EU) 2020/852), which aims to decarbonize the economy by defining what it considers as environmentally sustainable economic activities. As of today, said Regulation establishes the classification criteria for the activities defined for two of the six proposed environmental objectives, Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change:\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION\n\n6 CLEAN WATER\nAND SANITATION\n\n14 LIFE\nBELOW WATER\n\nPROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF WATER AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/17 description: The image shows three icons representing sustainable development goals. The first icon, in green, represents \"Good Health and Well-Being\" (SDG 3) and features a heartbeat symbol. The second icon, in orange, represents \"Sustainable Cities and Communities\" (SDG 11) and depicts a cityscape with buildings and houses. The third icon, in brown, represents \"Responsible Consumption and Production\" (SDG 12) and shows an infinity symbol with an arrow. Below the icons, the text \"PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF POLLUTION\" is written.\n\nPREVENTION AND CONTROL OF POLLUTION\n\nADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n[4.2 Cicularity](#page-75-0) **[4.3 Environmental Management](#page-84-0)**\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/20 description: The image shows the Sustainable Development Goal 12 icon, which represents \"Responsible Consumption and Production.\" The number \"12\" is displayed in a large, bold, gold font on the left side of the image. To the right of the number, the words \"RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION\" are stacked in smaller, uppercase letters. Below the text, there is a symbol resembling an infinity sign or a Mobius strip, also in gold.\n\nTRANSITION TO A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/22 description: The image shows two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

This delegated act on climate taxonomy establishes the technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation and for determining whether this causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives.\n- **•** On July 6th, 2021, Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 was published, which in article 8 in particular specifies the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by companies subject to the NFRD (Non-Financial Reporting Directive).\n- **•** Lastly, on March 9th, 2022, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 was published which amends the previous Delegated Regulations and includes, subject to strict conditions, relevant nuclear and gas related activities in the list of economic activities covered by EU taxonomy8.\n- **•** On June 27th, 2023, it was published:\n- **-** Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, which supplements Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical selection criteria to determine under what conditions an economic activity will be considered contributes substantially to the rest of the objectives of the taxonomy and to determine whether said economic activity does not cause significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, and which modifies Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.\n\t- **-** Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485, which modifies Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 establishing additional technical selection criteria to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to contribute substantially to mitigation or adaptation to climate change, and to determine whether that economic activity does not cause significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives.\n\nAccording to article 8 of the Regulation, in 2023 companies must report:\n\n- **•** Eligibility and alignment in accordance with Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 the objectives of Mitigation and Adaptation of Climate Change.\n- **•** Eligibility of new activities included in the Environmental Delegated Regulation and the amendment to the Climate Delegated Regulation.\n\nThe regulations establish a series of economic activities (eligible activities). For an activity to be considered aligned, it must contribute substantially to one of the environmental objectives (mitigation or adaptation to climate change), not cause significant harm to any of the remaining environmental objectives and comply with minimum social safeguards.\n\nLikewise, the most relevant information must be included in relation to compliance with the regulations, the accounting policy and qualitative information that allows contextualizing the results obtained and facilitating the understanding of the KPIs.\n\nIn 2023 it has not been identified activities associated with other objectives beyond Climate Change Mitigation. However, in 2024 a review of the activities will be carried out as a result of the integration of Gescrap in the development of Non-Financial Information.\n\n#### SCOPE OF THE REPORT\n\nThe scope of the analysis has included all the Gestamp Group's operating plants included in the scope of this non-financial information report (see chapter *[About this Report](#page-208-0)*).\n\n8Gestamp does not carry out activities related to nuclear energy and fossil gas contemplated in the Complementary Climate Delegated Regulation. For this reason, no related information is presented considering the templates of Annex XII of the Delegated Disclosure Regulation.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Gestamp Compliance Assessment**\n\nGestamp, in an exercise of transparency and in compliance with the new regulatory requirements under the scope of application of the NFRD, carried out during 2021 the evaluation of the eligibility of its activity based on the criteria defined in the \"European green taxonomy\". In this initial exercise, Gestamp was positioned as eligible as defined in activity 3.3. of Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport, since it is an essential part of the manufacturing of the vehicles indicated in the technical selection criteria for said activity. However, automotive components were not explicitly mentioned in that description.\n\nDue to the uncertainty regarding the application of the regulations and after having carried out the exercise internally, the European Commission published a Q&A on February 2, 2022 specifying that the activity of companies supplying automotive components was not eligible according to activity 3.3. Manufacturing of low-carbon technology vehicles for transportation described in the Taxonomy. For this reason, Gestamp finally concluded that it did not have activities associated with those considered eligible from the point of view of the Regulation.\n\nDuring 2022 Gestamp again carried out the eligibility exercise for its activities taking into account the following factors:\n\n- **•** The latest EU FAQ from December 2022 which, in a generic way, indicates that for the activities of 3.1-3.6, the components can be counted if they fit the selection criteria.\n- **•** Component manufacturers are one of the main actors in the transition towards sustainable mobility, accounting for 70% of the value of the vehicle, 90% of the production cost and 58% of investments in sustainable mobility come from automotive component suppliers, according to CLEPA data.\n- **•** The public position regarding the Taxonomy of other companies in the sector and sector associations such as CLEPA (European Automotive Suppliers Association) with its # FairTaxonomy movement).\n- **•** The recognition that the eligibility of Gestamp's activities would mean for investors.\n\nFinally, during 2023, the European Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Union Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 of June 27, 2023, which modifies Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 establishing additional technical selection criteria to determine the conditions under which an economic activity is considered to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation, and to determine whether that economic activity does not cause harm significant to any of the other environmental objectives. Gestamp has carried out an analysis of the activities that this modification includes.\n\nIn this sense, within the study carried out, two additional activities have been considered to those finally reported as eligible according to the technical selection criteria:\n\n| Activities studied and their adaptation to the technical selection criteria<br>of the Taxonomy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Eligibility Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 3.3.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### KPI CALCULATION METHODOLOGY\n\nGestamp has avoided double counting of activities during the analysis process by considering only one eligible activity, since the production of the same part could have fit into several activities.\n\nRegarding the calculation process, the accounting data was taken from corporate financial systems, and the report thereof was additionally confirmed with plant teams. These calculations do not include intercompany transactions, so double accounting has not occurred in this sense either.\n\n**Capex**\n\n#### **Sales**\n\nRepresents the proportion of net business volume derived from products or services contemplated by the Taxonomy. The turnover KPI offers a static view of the company's contribution to environmental objectives. Calculation of %:\n\n- **•** Numerator: net amount of turnover that is associated with the economic activities carried out by the company that are taxonomically eligible.\n- **•** Denominator: Considers the total volume of the net amount of the company's turnover as stated in note 3.23 of the Consolidated Annual Accounts.\n\nRepresents investments in fixed assets of an activity that is contemplated in the Taxonomy. Capex offers a dynamic and prospective view of companies' plans to transform their business activities. Calculation of %:\n\n- **•** Numerator: association of the CaPex intended for the selected taxonomic activity\n- **•** Denominator: includes the additions of tangible and intangible assets during the year before depreciation, amortization and possible new valuations, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, corresponding to the year of the company, excluding changes in fair value. Additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations will also be included.\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/21 description: The image shows a person holding a pen and pointing at a document with a graph on it. The graph shows a line chart with multiple lines, and the person is pointing at one of the lines with the pen. The document is white, and the graph is in color.

In this sense, although the figures are not representative today, the percentage of eligible sales has doubled compared to last year. Likewise, due to the development of regulations and the integration of Gescrap in the 2024 Annual Report, as well as Gestamp's commitment to the development of more sustainable mobility and the circular economy, exponential growth is expected in the coming years of these indicators.\n\nGestamp will continue working on this analysis to be able to provide eligibility and alignment figures that are more in line with the reality of your business.\n\nImage /page/103/Figure/14 description: The image shows two donut charts.

The corporate training team has worked with educational institutions such as Comillas Pontifical University, the University of Deusto and several professional training centres and business schools to develop programmes that help meet the Group's needs in relation to highly specialised profiles.\n\nIn response to business demand on both a corporate and global level, Gestamp continues collaborating with the University of Deusto – giving classes on the Master's in Automotive Design and Manufacturing course – and Comillas Pontifical University, with its Chair for Connected Industry.\n\nIn 2023, the corporate selection team has mainly worked on the 3 following talent attraction initiatives:\n\nFirstly, in collaboration with the corporate communication team, the selection team has sponsored **Formula Student** teams from the University of the Basque Country, Comillas Pontifical University in Madrid, the Technical University of Catalonia, Carlos III University in Madrid and Poznan University of Technology in Poland. 1 3\n\nAs part of this sponsorship, as well as providing financial support for each team to help them meet the financial and/or functional costs of their project activities, Gestamp has appointed a technical adviser from the Group as a mentor to guide and support each team through the vehicle design and manufacturing process. This has meant that the different teams can get to know Gestamp, learn about our technologies, products and processes and be supported by our R&D, I4.0 and Advanced Engineering areas.\n\nSecondly, the corporate selection team, in collaboration with the internal communication and culture team, has worked on the launch of **monthly newsletters**. These newsletters feature the job vacancies published on the internal portal Gestamp Jobs with the aim of boosting talent attraction and internal mobility. The newsletters have different themes and mainly focus on vacancies within a specific department or geographical area with a high volume of recruitment, such as the USA. 2\n\n3\n\nThirdly, in collaboration with the **ICEX Vives grants**, a global talent attraction and recruitment programme has been launched under which Gestamp has hired 50 recent graduates to work in production engineering, industrial engineering, processes, quality, logistics, control, etc. in various plants across Europe, the UK and the USA. Under this programme, 50 young people have started their professional career at Gestamp with a 12-month ICEX grant and subsequent commitment to remain at a foreign plant for a total of 2 years. As a brief summary, the number of positions offered per country were as follows:\n\n| 6<br>GERMANY        | 2<br>HUNGARY        |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 8<br>FRANCE         | 4<br>BULGARY        |\n| 7<br>UNITED KINGDOM | 23<br>UNITED STATES |\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The aim of the audit is to measure the extent to which this process is being fulfilled in accordance with the Corporate Selection Policy.\n\nWe also began to **incorporate the CID perimeter** in the Recruiting and Onboarding modules of the global selection tool (**SAP SSFF**) that was introduced in 2022. This perimeter could not be created and incorporated in 2022 because the corresponding taxonomy module was not finished.\n\nLastly, to measure the level of implementation of the global selection tool (SAP SSFF), a monthly audit was launched to audit the total number of hires performed each month in the tool following the procedure set out in the Corporate Selection Policy. Currently, the level of hires performed in accordance with the corporate procedure stands at 70%.\n\nAs an additional initiative linked to this point, in 2023, corporate selection KPIs were defined and automated, a structured control panel was developed and a global governance model was launched.\n\nThe aim of this control panel is to help our HR teams to quickly understand the status of the selection processes within their scope, providing them with a top-level overview of the key performance indicators (KPIs). Below follows a brief summary of the defined indicators:\n\nInternal\n\nexternal hires\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/17 description: The image shows a blue icon of a person with a circular arrow around them.

As such, personal and professional development is nurtured through a training model with the following key aims:\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/13 description: The image contains text describing Gestamp's view on the importance of people's talent and ability to work in a team. It states that these qualities are essential for Gestamp's success and that personal and professional development is nurtured through a training model with key aims.\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/14 description: A group of people are sitting around a table in a meeting room.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Talent development**\n\nThe process of developing and retaining talent is essential for the Group to have the best professionals and ensure the success of its strategy.\n\nThe company's growth in new markets and geographical areas has meant developing and providing career opportunities for employees in the organisation both in and away from their place of origin.\n\nIn addition, Gestamp has created a talent pool of highly trained professionals, leading to an increase in the internal promotion rate in 2023, rising to 93% in the case of division directors and country managers. In the case of plant managers, the internal promotion rate is 76%. This figure is somewhat lower due to the emergence of new markets where local hiring is more advisable. If we look at mature areas, such as Spain, France and Portugal, the internal vs external promotion rate jumps to 84.2%.\n\nIn 2023, as part of the Atenea Transformation Plan, Gestamp continued to work on strengthening the talent management programme on a uniform basis across all regions. Thus, the Group's talent is identified by a combination of two variables: employee performance and potential. In order to do this, an assessment process is carried out for a large section of the organisation, the results of which are reviewed on a yearly basis by the heads of each organisation and their Human Resources teams.\n\nIn 2023, this was launched for all employees classed as office staff, with a success rate of 97%. In this regard, all managers and HR teams have been trained to guarantee full understanding and proper implementation of the initiative.\n\n#### **Performance appraisal**\n\nAt Gestamp, work has been done to shift the performance system towards a waterfall goal-setting meritocratic method that uses strategic priorities to link employee performance to the achievement of the Group's strategic objectives.\n\nThis system increases transparency, gives employees a clearer idea of what is expected of them and allows them to focus their work on achieving said objectives. As part of this system, the performance appraisal consists of a series of individual goals set at the start of the year by the manager of each employee based on the priorities set by the Group, a personal improvement goal and a series of leadership skills that will vary depending on the individual's role within the organisation. At the end of the year, each manager evaluates each goal and each skill, producing a final performance rating. Meetings are then held with the area managers to review and confirm the results of the appraisals and to draw up action plans where necessary.\n\nTo reward our employee's hard work, motivate them and align our interests, the evaluation of the individual goals set at the start of\n\nthe year by the manager of each employee will be reflected in a percentage of the employee's annual variable remuneration, which consists of the following elements and relative weightings:\n\n- **•** Financial goals, with a relative weighting of 50%\n- **•** Strategic goals, with a relative weighting of 25%, including ESG goals\n- **•** Individual goals, with a relative weighting of 25%\n\nTo make sure that these goals are achieved, feedback is used by managers as a key management tool. As such, in 2023, we launched a communication and training campaign to develop a culture of feedback and achieved 92% participation across all managers in the organisation.\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/26 description: A woman wearing safety glasses and a dark blue t-shirt with a logo on it is standing in a factory.

The number of employees who participated in training activities was 323,060 and the average number of training hours per employee was 28.\n\n| Average training hours                    | 2021      | 2022        | 2023      |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| Total number of training hours            | 1,094,712 | 1,146,150.5 | 1,226,762 |\n| Average direct workforce                  | 40,494    | 41,616      | 43,893    |\n| Average hours of training per<br>employee | 27        | 27.5        | 28        |\n\n#### FOSTERING A CULTURE OF LEARNING\n\nAfter designing and launching the Corporate Training and Development Policy in 2022, several initiatives were carried out in 2023 to strengthen a culture of learning, knowledge sharing and collaboration among employees and the implementation of practices and tools that promote learning and continuous improvement.\n\n#### **Online learning campus update**\n\nTo continue promoting learning at Gestamp, in March 2023, we rolled out the new Gestamp Global Learning platform across the entire organisation. The aims of this update to our learning platform were to improve user experience, offer new programmes that are aligned with our global objectives and quality standards and to ensure that all Gestamp staff have access to a broad range of training programmes at any time and from any location.\n\nIn line with this idea of \"Anytime & Anywhere\", a mobile app was created so that all users, regardless of their role at the organisation, can access the training programmes. Through this mobile app, we can break down the barriers to training faced by some users who do not have access to a computer or the internet as the app allows for offline training.\n\n#### **Integration of LinkedIn Learning training content**\n\nTo further boost learning and development opportunities for Gestamp staff, in April 2023, the LinkedIn Learning training catalogue was added to our online learning platform. This catalogue includes over 16,000 courses in 13 different languages and is accessible from any device.\n\nThe content is applicable across a range of areas, in addition to specific Gestamp content, and it is delivered by leading experts in current areas of interest. In addition, the content consists of videos that are under 5 minutes long, offering the flexibility to continue learning \"in the flow of work\".\n\nIn 2023, a total of 1,500 licences were purchased.\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/23 description: The image shows four LinkedIn Learning courses. The first course is titled \"Fundamentos de Inteligencia artificial: Redes neuronales\" and has a duration of 1h 30min. The second course is titled \"Fundamentos de Inteligencia artificial: Machine Learning\" and has a duration of 1h 30min. The third course is titled \"TensorFlow esencial\" and has a duration of 3h 30min. The fourth course is titled \"Trabajo colaborativo con Microsoft: SharePoint, Teams, Grupos y Viva\" and has a duration of 1h 30min.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Cross-cutting knowledge aside, our priority is the **processes and technologies that help us stand out on the market and that will help meet future business** \n\nThanks to this model, our staff can find what they need at any time and can reach out to experts in any area of knowledge\n\nTo implement this transfer of knowledge, the Technological Knowledge Transfer Committee was created with business representatives and facilitated by the training and development\n\nteam. The key actions of this committee are:\n\n## ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/3 description: The image shows the word \"INDEX\" in a dark blue sans-serif font, with three horizontal lines above it.

The second chart, titled \"PARTICIPANTS BY TYPE OF LABOR AND GENDER\", shows participant numbers for MOD Female (24,621), MOD Male (127,627), MOI Female (7,935), MOI Male (80,998), MOE Female (8,804), and MOE Male (37,401). The third chart, titled \"TOTAL EXTERNAL TRAINING HOURS VS INTERNAL\", shows percentages of 26% and 28%.\n\nEmployees are mainly trained in the workplace, which is a highly practical approach as it guarantees they develop knowledge of the Group's industrial processes and allows them to constantly adapt to technological innovation and customer requirements in areas such\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, Gestamp's plants continued to focus on staff training and development, delivering a total of 1,200,795 hours of training. A total of 304,651 employees took part in this training, with each employee completing an average of 27.4 hours of in-\n\n#### **Global programmes**\n\nIn addition to the training reflected in these figures, we also ran **global training programmes led by the Corporate Training and Development team**, amounting to a total of 25,967 hours of training with 22,842 participants.\n\nSome of the highlights of the global training programmes are:\n\n#### GES-GIGASTAMPING® TRAINING\n\nAs on other occasions, thanks to the continued collaboration between the training team and the Office of Technology and Innovation (TIO, Spanish acronym), we identified the need for an internal training workshop on hot stamping for extreme size parts: GES-Gigastamping®.\n\nThe workshop focused on product design, simulation and dies. It covered the entire stamping process and closed with Gestamp Mason's experience of manufacturing these parts.\n\nAnother key element was the opportunity for participants to expand their network of contacts within the Group and to identify experts in different fields. Given the size of the Group and the range of locations, this aspect is essential for sharing experiences and improving practices.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the Gestamp Technology Institute, Gestamp Group's training centre of excellence, saw over 120 people complete this exciting training workshop.\n\n#### 2022 MOE: Office staff MOI: Indirect labour 2023\n\nMOD: Direct labour\n\nplant training.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The programme has spanned a total of 265 hours.\n\nIt has been delivered by an external provider and monitored at all times by internal staff. It has also included regular progress meetings with the students.\n\nTen people started the programme, of which eight have already joined Gestamp and are working on projects in Madrid and Boroa.\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/20 description: A group of about a dozen people are standing in a factory.

As such, our Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out a series of rules and regulations in line with the relevant legislation in force, ethical standards and social responsibility.\n\nTo ensure that all staff are aware of the Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, we have designed online training available in the 16 languages used in the Group. This training is compulsory for all existing staff or newly hired staff since November 2023. It provides an understanding of the pillars of the Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy and the protocols to be followed in the event of any form of harassment in the workplace.\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/14 description: The image shows a course introduction page with the title \"Hello!\" and the text \"Welcome to this new course about Gestamp's equality, diversity and inclusion policy.

On the right side of the image, there are six photos of diverse people.\n\nThis new training represents yet another step towards guaranteeing that Gestamp's equality principles are respected and followed in each and every initiative, action and workplace behaviour.\n\n#### LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT\n\nWith a view to guaranteeing the future of the company, 2023 saw the second edition of the **Plant Director Development Programme**. This programme aims to ensure that our plant directors have the right level of skills, a global culture and a shared leadership approach.\n\nIt has been adapted specifically to our needs and developed by Gestamp in collaboration with the Hult Ashridge business school. Feedback from participants in the first edition of the programme informed the design of this second edition to create a highly refined programme.\n\nThe learning plan started in May 2023 with 27 participants and will finish in March 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, in October 2023, we launched the first edition of the \"**Leadership Development Programme**\". The aim of this programme is to develop and promote a solid foundation in leadership and to strengthen the skills of Gestamp professionals, equipping them to take on more senior roles in the future.\n\nThis programme, developed by Gestamp in collaboration with the Hult Ashridge business school, focuses on the development of key leadership skills, promotion of strategic thinking and enhancement of interpersonal skills, training leaders who can excel in complex business environments.\n\nA total of 96 participants with different profiles and from 14 different countries were selected take part in this first edition of the programme, which will run until June 2024.\n\nIn terms of our commitment to developing female talent, as in previous years, we took part in the Promociona executive development programme run by the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE).\n\nLastly, the 2023 training programme for members of the Board of Directors was aligned with the company's strategic objectives and structured around ESG, electric vehicles, cybersecurity and the Criminal Risk Prevention Plan. It consisted of 5 online sessions with e-learning content that could be accessed through the Gestamp Global Learning online campus.\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/25 description: A group of about 30 people are standing on a staircase.

While these benefits are managed locally and will vary depending on the country where the employee works, the company is working on a proposal to ensure access to a minimum level of benefits in all countries, thereby improving the Group's employee value proposition.\n\nGestamp is constantly looking for ways to continue offering programmes that are adapted to the local conditions in each country, raising up its employees to empower them and support them according to their different needs.\n\nIn 2023, we organised initiatives that focused on our employees' physical and emotional wellbeing, supporting the different cultures and customs in each country. These initiatives took place in a range of different locations, always in line with local customs, and included sports activities, family days, volunteering, mental health awareness activities and cultural activities. All these activities shared the common goal of promoting healthy lifestyles, teamwork and commitment. In addition, various employee benefit programmes were implemented in a range of countries, considering the specific needs of each group and market. These benefits included a flexible remuneration plan, physiotherapy, annual health checks, employee assistance programmes, discount packages for savings on day-to-day expenses, etc.\n\nThe percentages of Gestamp Group employees with access to some of the main benefits are presented below:\n\n| Benefit                   | % of employees with access to the<br>benefit |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Health insurance          | 72%                                          |\n| Life insurance            | 74%                                          |\n| Pension plan/Savings plan | 56%                                          |\n| Wellbeing benefits        | 68%                                          |\n\nThe employee value proposition will continue to be a central theme in Gestamp's 2024 benefits strategy.\n\nSeeking to improve the employee experience and our commitment to sustainability, seeking to generate a positive impact on employees throughout the Group.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/123/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nGestamp employs highly qualified individuals who have the option to move country for a period of time in order to meet the specific needs of certain locations. In many cases, such mobility gives them the chance to lead new projects, like setting up a new plant or implementing new technologies or processes. This capacity to move talent provides flexibility and agility when executing projects.\n\nThere are two types of groups:\n\n- **•** Personnel with short-term assignments: professionals who move for periods of 3 to 12 months.\n- **•** Personnel with long-term assignments: professionals who, due to the particular circumstances of the project and the country, move for periods of 1 to 5 years (maximum) and, in most cases, with their families.\n\nOnce the ultimate goal has been achieved, these employees return to their original work centres, leaving the project in the hands of local employees, who take with full or near-full responsibility for its management.\n\nWe have a Corporate Policy that aims to establish, order, define and oversee the regulations and guidelines that govern employee expatriation within the Group, regardless of the country of origin and/or destination country.\n\nIn 2023, we had a total of 67 expatriate employees working abroad for over a year, providing international support.\n\n#### PERSONNEL WITH LONG-TERM TRANSFERS PER COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND DESTINATION\n\n| Country        | Origin | Destination |\n|----------------|--------|-------------|\n| Brazil         | 1      | 1           |\n| Bulgaria       | -      | 4           |\n| China          | -      | 14          |\n| France         | 2      | 2           |\n| Germany        | 4      | 4           |\n| Hungary        | -      | 1           |\n| India          | -      | 2           |\n| Morocco        | -      | 2           |\n| Mexico         | 2      | 6           |\n| Poland         | -      | 5           |\n| Russia         | 1      | 2           |\n| Slovakia       | -      | 3           |\n| Spain          | 50     | -           |\n| Sweden         | 1      | -           |\n| United Kingdom | 4      | 1           |\n| Turkey         | -      | 2           |\n| USA            | 2      | 18          |\n| Total          | 67     | 67          |\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

However, Gestamp promotes shift rotation with the aim of facilitating the adjustment of working hours to workers' specific needs.\n\nFor office-based workers in many regions, remote work measures have continued to be employed, in addition to other measures that promote flexibility and a good work-life balance, such as flexible working hours.\n\nIn 2023, 109 of Gestamp's work centres (103 in 2022) implemented measures related to improving the work-life balance.\n\n#### **Collective bargaining agreements and freedom of association**\n\nAt Gestamp, labour relations are managed in accordance with union and labour legislation that applies to each geographical area. With union representation in each production plant, all aspects relating to union, labour and employee contractual relations are negotiated.\n\n## 66% of employees are protected by a collective agreement.\n\nIn 2023, 66% of employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement (67% in 2022). There are specific Occupational Health and Safety Committees in most production plants. In 2022, 93% of plants had employee consultation and participation mechanisms in place relating to occupational risk prevention (3% less than in 2022 since Turkey is not excluded).\n\nIn certain geographical areas, where required due to historical, cultural or legal obligations, we have inter-centre committees that complement the in-plant negotiating framework.\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/20 description: A man wearing safety glasses and gloves stands in a factory.

The most common channels are the local and corporate intranet, the internal newsletter, the satisfaction and organisational climate survey, the suggestion box and the information channels.\n\nEmployees also have access to established communication channels at the Compliance Office through which they can report or submit queries regarding the Code of Conduct. The Group has a corporate intranet that provides information on the most significant matters relating to the organisation on a corporate, divisional, plant and individual level.\n\n100% Scope of the consolidation perimeter.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"Gestamp\" in a bold, dark blue font.

These surveys were aimed at a total of 43,674 employees, which corresponds to 98.67% of the total Group workforce at the end of the year. The average number of employees satisfied with the Organization has been 79.14%.\n\n*To reach this figure, the results were standardised to come up with a global satisfaction score given that each work centre conducted a specific survey for its workforce.* \n\n#### **Absenteeism**\n\nThe absenteeism rate at Gestamp is stable and has improved compared with the previous year, standing at 4.4%. The total number of absenteeism hours in 2023 was 3,477,290, representing an average of 6.6 absenteeism hours per month per employee.

In addition, the amounts have been converted to euros using the average exchange rate for 2023. By including the exchange rate variable, the differences between remuneration may be due to macroeconomic variables that are not linked to the Gestamp remuneration policy.\n\nThis calculation method is the same as the method used for the past two years and therefore the data is comparable.\n\n#### **Average remuneration by professional category broken down by gender in 2023 for the whole Group**\n\nJust as in 2022, to calculate the average remuneration for 2023, we have chosen to calculate it by category. This allows us to obtain uniform collectives from a responsibility point of view, an aspect which is directly linked to our employees' remuneration.\n\n|                     | 2023    |         |         | 2022    |         |         |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Global Gestamp      | Men     | Women   | Total   | Men     | Women   | Total   |\n| Directors (1)       | 177,972 | 144,648 | 173,565 | 166,985 | 119,232 | 160,185 |\n| Middle managers (2) | 79,529  | 74,807  | 78,529  | 73,027  | 67,910  | 72,043  |\n| All other employees | 26,796  | 22,540  | 25,943  | 25,206  | 21,461  | 24,486  |\n| Total               | 29,795  | 24,955  | 28,826  | 27,982  | 23,523  | 27,126  |\n\nAverage remuneration data includes theoretical total annual wages.

It is calculated by taking the average remuneration of each country (including fixed salary and variable remuneration, extrapolated to full-time hours and for the whole year). The calculation per country takes into consideration the relative size of each country by dividing it among all eligible employees. This allows us to achieve a reliable global indicator of the difference in salary between men and women.\n\n| 7.90% | 6.60% | 7.83% |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n\nThe result of the salary gap calculation is 7.9% for total remuneration (fixed remuneration + variable remuneration).\n\nThe same calculation method was used in financial year 2022.\n\nThe 2022 salary gap calculation is based on the great effort made by the company in implementing its own unique global professional classification system, named Gestamp Group Grading System (G3S). The system was fully introduced by the end of 2022, reaching a maximum level of classification detail. In 2023, classification audits were performed to ensure the quality of the data and reflection of the organisational changes in the classification system. The work performed in 2022 and the revisions in 2023 have given us an up-to-date, robust and reliable database for comparing positions with the same level of remuneration.\n\nThe analyses were based on the active workforces at 31 December 2023 in 21 countries (Argentina, Germany, Brazil, China, South Korea, Slovakia, Spain, USA, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Czechia, Russia, Sweden, Taiwan and the UK). In 2023, Russia was added to the analysis, while it was excluded in 2022 given the geopolitical situation. As a result, the scope covers 97.1% of the Gestamp workforce (excluding joint ventures) and a total of 38,001 employees. In 2022, the scope covered 36,468 employees. Joint ventures were excluded from the calculation because Gestamp is not responsible for managing their remuneration.\n\nFollowing the methodology used in 2022, the analysis does not include interns, expatriate workers, cases of long-term leave, partial retirement and companies that do not use the SAP HCM system. These exclusions make up the difference between 97.1% of the Gestamp workforce and 100% of the Gestamp workforce.\n\nThe gender pay gap calculation is made using the theoretical annual remuneration, extrapolated to full-time hours. This information is automatically extracted from the SAP HCM system. To reaffirm the quality of the data and review of eligible employees, all information has been validated with the local HR teams. The automated extraction of the entire database was possible thanks to efforts to improve data quality in recent years. These improvements include the interconnection between payroll systems and the definition of salary additions across the Group.\n\nThe method, aligned with the method used in 2022, compares employees in positions with the same level of remuneration according to the Gestamp classification system (G3S). The levels of remuneration are used to define the salary bands. This allows the policy to be linked to objective criteria and guarantees there is no discrimination of any kind.\n\nThe following table shows the workforce broken down by gender for the past three years. If we compare this year with the previous year, there is a clear improvement in the number of women, rising from 19.20% of total employees in 2022 to 20.18% in 2023.\n\nIn terms of women holding positions of responsibility, according to the Gestamp Global Grading System (G3S) methodology, 13.66% of management and 21.46% of medium-level positions are held by women. In the case of middle management, there has been a significant increase in the presence of women, rising from 18.80% in 2022 to 21.46% in 2023, surpassing the total percentages of women in the organisation.\n\n|                             |        | Women  |        |        | Men    |        |  |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--|\n| Professional Classification | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2023   | 2022   | 2023   |  |\n| Directors                   | 13,66% | 14,30% | 15,30% | 86,34% | 85,70% | 84,70% |  |\n| Middle managers             | 21,46% | 18,80% | 20,40% | 78,54% | 81,20% | 79,60% |  |\n| All other employees         | 20,20% | 19,30% | 18,60% | 79,80% | 80,70% | 81,40% |  |\n| Total                       | 20,18% | 19,20% | 18,60% | 79,82% | 80,80% | 81,40% |  |\n\nScope: Gestamp workforce, excluding joint ventures.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/130/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n## DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\nGestamp promotes diversity, recognising it as a key competitive advantage for its business, while it gives priority to equity and inclusion in its people management model. Gestamp respects the rights of equality and non-discrimination on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, social origin, ethnic origin, age, disability and religion, among others. This is provided for in the company's Code of Conduct and the sixth goal of the UN Global Compact, which the Group has complied with since 2008.\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp approved an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy that promotes equal opportunities, non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion of all Gestamp Group employees, in accordance with the legislation in force in each country and following international good practices. This includes the provisions of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) approved by the UN, specifically SDG 5: Gender Equality and SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities.\n\nIn 2024, as part of the Strategic ESG Plan, we are planning to create a Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion plan for the whole Group. With this plan, we aim to perform a deeper analysis of diversity across the different geographical regions and to strengthen the areas of action for specific groups.\n\n#### **Gender diversity**\n\nIn 2023, Gestamp has worked on the geographical expansion of its gender equality policies through the following actions:\n\n- **•** Approval of the Global Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, the aim of which is to create a positive environment that facilitates and promotes equal opportunities, non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion of all Group employees.\n- **•** Implementation of the Equality Plan at the Gestamp management companies. Each plan is aligned with Group and legislative criteria and is managed and implemented on a local level. Similarly, the Corporate team has worked on communication campaigns, training on the Equality Policy and the sexual harassment prevention protocol, among other actions, to support implementation on a local level.\n\nAt Gestamp, women represent 20% of the Group's total workforce.\n\nThe automotive industry clearly has plenty of work to do to reach gender parity, due in part to the traditional masculinisation of the sector and the continued underrepresentation of women in STEM careers (science, technology, engineering and maths).\n\nGestamp strives to increase the proportion of women in its workforce. This effort is reflected in the percentage of female recruits, which grew from 22% in 2018 to almost 27.5% in 2023. This shows a positive trend, thanks in large part to the measures included in the Equality Plans at Group level and the awareness of the Group's HR teams.\n\nIn terms of women holding positions of responsibility, 13.3% of management and 21.0% of mediumlevel positions are held by women. In the average remuneration analysis, we have chosen to group by category rather than by type of labour as this allows for a better reflection of the pay reality by creating homogeneous groups in terms of responsibility, which is reflected in remuneration.\n\nIt's not always easy to find women in selection processes for certain common positions in the automotive sector, such as die-makers, welders and maintenance specialists. Even so, at some work centres, there is almost an equal ratio of women to men.\n\n| Region         | Female | Male  | Total 2022 | Female | Male  | Total 2023 |\n|----------------|--------|-------|------------|--------|-------|------------|\n| Asia           | 467    | 2,555 | 3,022      | 420    | 1,762 | 2,182      |\n| Eastern Europe | 267    | 535   | 802        | 337    | 526   | 863        |\n| North America  | 1,591  | 3,117 | 4,708      | 1,336  | 2,737 | 4,073      |\n| South America  | 262    | 1,298 | 1,560      | 225    | 1,138 | 1,363      |\n| Western Europe | 569    | 1,699 | 2,268      | 618    | 1,575 | 2,193      |\n| Total Gestamp  | 3,156  | 9,204 | 12,360     | 2,936  | 7,738 | 10,674     |\n| %              | 25.5%  | 74.5% | 100.0%     | 27.5%  | 72.5% | 100.0%     |\n\nIn 2023, 27.5% of new hires were women, which is 7.5 percentage points higher than the percentage of women on staff (20%)\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

On the right side of the logo is a circle made up of different colored segments, each representing one of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n#### **BEST PRACTICES**\n\n#### **GESTAMP PARTICIPATES IN THE 4TH TARGET GENDER EQUALITY ACCELERATOR PROGRAMME.**\n\nThe Target Gender Equality accelerator programme, organised by the UN Global Compact, provides companies with support in defining and reaching ambitious business objectives in order to promote gender equality. This initiative is run in collaboration with the Global Compact Local Networks and helps companies set targets and develop capacity-building actions to increase women's representation and leadership.\n\n#### **BEST PRACTICE IN FOSTERING FEMALE TALENT IN INDIA.**\n\nIn its plants in India, Gestamp has started the 'Gender Equality Vision 2020-2025' programme with the aim of reaching a 20% female workforce by 2025. In the context of an inclusive workplace, this plan has been created to guarantee the recruitment, training and development of female professionals, implementing policies to ensure a workplace that is safer and has the utmost respect for female talent.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/132/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Cultural and geographical diversity**\n\nGestamp sees its heterogeneous workforce as an opportunity for the Group to find better solutions to the current global challenges.\n\nGeographical and cultural diversity is one of the distinctive features of the Gestamp workforce: Over 40,000 professionals with 95 different nationalities work across 24 countries. In each country where the company operates, there is an average of 13 nationalities at each geographical location, while the countries with the greatest cultural and geographical diversity are: Germany, Spain, the UK and France, with 46, 42, 32 and 27 different nationalities in each workforce, respectively.\n\nThis geographical diversity is incredibly enriching for Gestamp, a company that is committed to hiring local talent as a key source of creativity and innovation. In addition, this helps develop an increasingly more inclusive Group in terms of country of birth, culture, race and sex. Gestamp works to find points of cooperation between people from different cultures and to make the joint project and shared identity their own.\n\n#### NATIONALITIES OF GESTAMP EMPLOYEES\n\nImage /page/132/Figure/16 description: This bar chart shows the number of speakers of different languages.

This interaction between different generations is very enriching for Gestamp because it encourages innovation in problem solving, as each generation brings a different perspective.\n\n**[See Annexes: Average number of employees by contract type, age and gender](#page-201-0)** \n\nImage /page/133/Picture/14 description: Three men are gathered around a piece of machinery.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n[6. Governance](#page-155-0)\n\nGestamp's approach to prevention has evolved over time: while the company once focused on the standard practice of controlling accident rates, it now has an ambitious management system all of its own. Its system sets out safety criteria in relation to working conditions and management requirements at 100% of Gestamp's production centres. It is even more stringent than the requirements of local legislation in some countries.\n\nIt is also used to assess health and safety performance and provides a road map for continuous improvement.\n\nThe following principles are included in **[Gestamp's Occupational Health and Safety Policy](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Sustainability/Commitments/Health%20and%20safety/Politica-de-Salud-y-seguridad-en-Gestamp-(pdf).pdf?ext=.pdf)**:\n\n- **•** Health and safety issues must be integrated into daily tasks and decision-making both in the design phase of the workplaces themselves, of each system to be used or of each piece of work equipment, as well as during their operation for the performance of the activity.\n- **•** Preventing occupational accidents and diseases is the essential aim of this Policy. It is achieved by preventing and minimising the risks to the health and safety of people. The company therefore undertakes continuous improvement and actions based on risk analysis.\n- **•** Complying with the legislation of all countries in which the Gestamp Group operates. However, the internal Health and Safety Policy is the Gestamp Group's standard, as it goes beyond what is required by law in most cases.\n- **•** Risks that are important due to their severity, that is, those that may lead to serious accidents, must be prevented or minimised using technical means.\n- **•** By establishing suitable regulations and procedures, as well as training, we can control risks that we have not been able to prevent.\n- **•** Under no circumstances should activity be placed before safety.\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/16 description: In an indoor shot, a man wearing safety glasses, earplugs, and gloves is working in a factory.

The badge has a scalloped edge and is attached to two ribbons.\n\n#### **Experience**\n\nCreation os manuals and supporting documents. Safety standards, management guides, detailed specifications, good practices.\n\n#### **GHSS features**\n\nThe GHSS Management System is integrated at all organisational levels and implemented at 100% of production plants operated by Gestamp, meaning that it regulates the activities of 47,099 employees (41,608 internal and 5,491 external employees) or 95% of all employees.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/16 description: The image shows an icon of two people. The person in the front is wearing a hard hat.\n\n#### **Professionalism**\n\nAn extensive team of professionals dedicated to prevention, from corporate level to the plants to provide their opinions when undertaking improvement and starting new projects. Experts in working and prevention management conditions that seek best practices and solutions and define the direction of the system.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/19 description: The image shows a right triangle with a solid blue outline. A dashed blue line forms the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n\n#### **Measurement**\n\nGestamp Health & Safety Indicator (GHSI) is an internal tool designed by us and adapted to the particularities of the company's activity, reaching higher levels of demand than those required by international standards. It enables us to analyse 78 factors equally in all the Group's plants\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/22 description: The image is completely white and contains no discernible content or features.\n\n#### **Integration**\n\n**Communication**\n\nCollaboration with other corporate departments so that Helath and Safety is another aspect to consider in new projects. Full integration is sought: layout design, machinery and facility purchasing, training, and corporate policies. The Health and Safety team regularly participates in audits and collaborative projects with strategic areas of the Group such as Industry 4.0, Standardisation, Purchasing and Sustainability.\n\nComputer applications and web communities that support the system. The applications allow control of everything related to the GHSI: quartely reviews, audits and reports; while the web communities generate discussion forums and document repositories and share information with all of the Group's plants.\n\n#### RESPONSIBILITY AND FUNCTIONS AT ALL LEVELS\n\nPlants must manage health and safety with the same level of knowledge and standards that they use in their core business.\n\nThe model is supported by senior management. Each year a Leadership Meeting is held, where the overall targets for improvement are established based on the Indicator. In addition, the results are submitted to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, along with a progress report on the corporate plans and other important matters.\n\n| Group Managers<br>they manage the global numbers<br>for each plant of division.                                     | Image: Person with globe               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Division Managers<br>Overview of the situation.

It is a robust system that is implemented across the entire Group, and recognised at all organisational levels. The Gestamp Group has gone another year without recording a fatal accident, which is a milestone for an industrial group.\n\nTaking into account the robustness of GHSS and the organisation's commitment to Health and Safety, in 2022 a decision was made to certify the system under the international standard ISO 45001.\n\nIn record time, almost 100% of the Group's plants have achieved ISO 45001 certification through the multisite model (except for the 4 plants located in Russia, due to the war in Ukraine).\n\nThis achievement has been possible thanks to having a prior system such as GHSS, fully implemented across the organisation, demonstrating Gestamp's firm commitment to Health and Safety, as well as the continuous work and effort of every team.\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/16 description: The image is a logo for ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Internal auditing systems**\n\n#### FULL ON-SITE PLANT AUDITS EVERY TWO YEARS (2-5 DAYS) QUARTERLY REMOTE AUDITS\n\nWhen a plant enters the system, a full audit is conducted on site at the plant. In addition to assessing the safety conditions and prevention management in place at the plant, this is used to provide safetyrelated training to the parties that are directly responsible in this regard.\n\nOnce it is part of the system, these audits are repeated every two years in order to ensure that the indicator continues to reflect the actual safety situation at the plant. They also allow the Group to verify on-site whether the improvements made and approved remotely each quarter have been consolidated, to refresh safety standards and to get first-hand feedback from the plants.\n\nFace-to-face audits were cancelled during 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, and resumed in 2022. Audit rates returned to normal in 2023, with 50% of plants being audited every two years, and despite the prolonged suspension of audits, the system has continued to operate to a satisfactory standard in the Group.\n\nThese are audits of factors that the plant aims to improve; they are conducted remotely through the use of an internally developed IT application.\n\nThe plants must report their improvements in the first 15 days of each quarter. The improvements are first validated by the Division-level prevention managers, who act as advisors, then move on to the audit phase.\n\nThe criteria followed are exactly the same as for full audits and the same auditors review them. The difference is that only the improvements proposed by the plants, which have been validated by their advisors, are audited. To guarantee the use of uniform criteria, there is a guide linked to the indicator that outlines the criteria.\n\nIn addition, other documents are also being produced that provide further details on the criteria of certain factors of the indicator, such as hygiene risk management, subcontractor management, working at a height, maintenance of metal shelving and management of lifting devices, to name a few.\n\n828 **FACTORS** reviewed in the year\n\nImage /page/140/Picture/22 description: A high-angle shot captures a group of four individuals gathered around a light-colored table, seemingly engaged in a collaborative work session.

Participation in sector associations and forums.\n- **•** Comparative analysis activities with other companies.\n\n#### SAFETY ALERTS\n\nSerious accidents and incidents with implications on prevention within the Group are used as an awareness-raising measure.\n\nThe investigation carried out by the plant, together with a video or photographs of the event are shared via the prevention web community. This information is completely anonymous. The important thing is not where it happened, but that it happened at a Group work site, and we must prevent the situation from repeating itself in another.\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/14 description: A man wearing a face mask, ear protection, and gloves is working on a machine in a factory.

Corporate provides support and monitoring to production plants, focusing on certain factors of the GHSI indicator: specific training, definition and modification of equipment and work sites, machine malfunctions and maintenance.\n\nCorporate and divisional teams work together with production plants to create supporting documents to meet the proposed objectives, and to follow up closely with quarterly meetings to check on the implementation of the factors.\n\n#### Steps taken in 2023:\n\n- **• Plan Launched Globally:** To mark the World Day for Safety and Health, a communication campaign was launched through One Gestamp and material was also provided locally by Corporate.\n- **• Corporate publications of assistance:** Guides and procedures were prepared and published for all the factors included in the Plan, except for \"Definition of machinery and installations\", which is expected to be addressed in early 2024.\n- **• Regular meetings between Corporate and Divisions/ Regions to keep track of improvements:** In 2023, a total of 34 meetings were held. Plans are in place to arrange further meetings, the frequency of which depends on the extent to which the improvement is taking effect.\n\n#### **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**\n\nGestamp has set up a task force to coordinate the task undertaken by different corporate departments - of replacing forklift trucks with AGVs in the production areas of plants.\n\nOn the basis of the work undertaken by the task force, it will be possible to:\n\n- **•** Factor safety criteria into the design of logistics flows, in the case of new projects, or into the adaptation process being undertaken by Operations\n- **•** Factor safety criteria into the Industry 4.0-based plant simulation\n- **•** Identify and assess current safety criteria and adapt them to new conditions arising from the introduction of the AGVs. They relate to storage, movement of loads and workstation design, all of which respectively have a bearing on the plant layout design.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/25 description: A woman wearing a navy blue t-shirt with the word \"Gestamp\" on it, blue gloves, and blue arm sleeves is working with a metal frame.

It uses artificial intelligence to assess ergonomic risks.\n\nThe system analyses recorded videos and issues ergonomic risk reports automatically, which reduces the time spent on the assessment of repetitive tasks and unnatural postures by up to 80%.\n\n**• Cameras incorporating AI technology** to help and assist the operation of forklift trucks. Particularly in areas of poor visibility or during reverse manoeuvres.\n\n#### **Safety Radars**\n\nSafety radars can be integrated into most of Gestamp's processes to improve safety levels in:\n\n- **• Access protection:** Prevent access to danger zones.\n- **• Machinery reset prevention:** Stop machinery from starting unexpectedly while the operator is in a danger zone.\n- **• Anti-collision:** Prevent collisions when machinery is in motion, involving the operator, other machinery or suspended loads.\n\nThe radars have been tested in 3 plants across Spain, focusing on different uses, and plans are in place to deploy them at other European plants. The tests at these pilot plants enable us to identify and determine other uses.\n\nPublications are issued and duly updated to inform all other plants of the test results.\n\n#### **Psychosocial Risk Assessment**\n\nFollowing the addition of the new factor to the group indicator in 2022, psychosocial assessments have been carried out at several plants.\n\nThe importance of psychosocial factors for workers' health has been increasingly recognised. Changes in organisations, current globalisation processes and exposure to psychosocial risks have become more frequent and intense, making it appropriate and necessary to identify, assess and control them in order to prevent the associated risks to health and safety at work.\n\nIn order to monitor plant implementation more exhaustively and encourage improvement, a new factor has been created to define Gestamp's psychosocial assessment model.\n\n#### **Training**\n\nVarious corporate training initiatives have been carried out:\n\n- **• Training for Plant Managers**: The purpose of this training initiative is to involve the Group's Management Team, regardless of level, in Health and Safety management in order to prioritise the resources needed to implement the necessary preventive strategy.\n- **• Training for plant health and safety (H&S) professionals:**  Check-lists are created and published for every factor in order to facilitate the simulation/self-audit undertaken by H&S officials in respect of the GHSS factors related to Working Conditions and Prevention Management.\n\n#### **Publications**\n\nBesides the guides relating to the factors included in the 2025 Plan, plants were able to refer to the following documents published in 2023:\n\n- **• New documents:**\n- **-** Press Line Safety Standard.\n- **-** Works with Risks of Fire.\n- **-** New Machinery Directive 2023/1230 Compliance Guide.\n- **• Document reviews:**\n- **-** Ergonomic Assessment Procedure.\n- **-** Matrix Machinery Safety Guide.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-145-0\"></span>Image /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Responding to the needs of society and contributing to the improvement of people's quality of life is essential in order to grow as a company.\n\nGestamp's social action must reflect its commitment to society and must contribute to generating a positive impact on the communities and environments where it operates.\n\nGestamp seeks to align its social contribution with its business activity, through medium and long-term social projects in the communities in which it operates, reinforcing trust between those communities and the company, and enhancing its positive contributions.\n\nGestamp's **[Social Action Policy](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Sustainability/Sustainability%20at%20Gestamp/2022_11_07-Politica-de-accion-social_Gestamp.pdf?ext=.pdf)** establishes the strategies followed by the group's social initiatives: commitment to local communities, alignment with local communities and being sustainable over time.\n\nGestamp collaborates in local initiatives promoted by both economic (business, technology, innovation clusters and associations) and social and environmental organisations (road safety, education, environmental awareness, socio-economic development, among others).\n\nAs part of the **ESG Strategic Plan**, objectives have been established in the Social Contribution area with 2025 in mind, linked to the Social Action strategy and to Gestamp's support for the local communities where it has a presence, with the intention of generating a positive impact.\n\nImage /page/145/Figure/19 description: The image shows a table with two columns: Description and Level of achievement. The first row in the Description column is \"Reach a minimum annual social action figure (€1.3M).\" The corresponding row in the Level of achievement column shows that in 2023, the figure was 1.13M€, and in 2025, the figure was 1.3M€. The second row in the Description column is \"Achieve at least 70% annual alignment of the group's global initiatives with the strategic areas of Social Action.\" The corresponding row in the Level of achievement column shows that in 2023, the alignment was 81.55%, and in 2025, the alignment was 70%. The third row in the Description column is \"Conduct socio-economic impact studies in markets where Gestamp operates.\" The corresponding row in the Level of achievement column shows that in 2023, 1 country was analyzed, and in 2025, 2 countries were analyzed.\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/20 description: In a well-lit classroom setting, a group of approximately ten students, predominantly female, are seated at a long table, attentively listening to a male instructor.

This deployment has been carried out in collaboration with divisional and regional Human Resources managers and with the involvement of each plant and work centre.\n\nIn addition to the three priority areas of Social Action (Education, Mobility and Sustainability), support in humanitarian crises affecting areas where Gestamp has a presence has been included.\n\n#### SOCIAL ACTION POLICY - AREAS OF ACTION\n\n**Gestamp's Social Action Policy establishes priority areas of action aligned with the business, thus providing coherence to the group's social action and maximizing long-term social impact.**\n\nImage /page/146/Picture/17 description: The image shows a graduation cap in blue.

Inclusive education is a human right that improves people's quality of life, facilitates access to decent work and favours their economic progress and that of their families.\n\nGestamp's Social Action Area promotes initiatives aimed at combating school dropout rates, extracurricular support, equal opportunities and access to education for vulnerable groups.\n\nIn addition, emphasis is placed on technical training projects and the promotion of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) vocations, with a greater focus on those groups that are less represented in these areas of knowledge.\n\nSDGs related to EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/16 description: The image contains three icons representing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Turkey and Morocco suffered major earthquakes that were very destructive. In both cases, the solidarity and quick reaction of Gestamp's plants was exemplary, especially in the locations closest to the disaster areas.\n\nIn addition, at a global level, the corporate Social Action team set up channels of collaboration through the NGO **[World Central](https://wck.org/es-es)  [Kitchen](https://wck.org/es-es)**, so that all Group employees had the opportunity to make donations in a safe manner, with the guarantee that the aid would reach the affected area.\n\nIn both cases, Gestamp undertook to contribute the same amount raised by employees, doubling the donation.\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/16 description: The image shows a map icon with a location pin on it, next to the text \"Earthquake: TURKEY MOROCCO\".\n\n€20,215 €5,152 **TURKEY MOROCCO**\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The handshake is surrounded by a few small blue dashes.\n\n**Collaboration:** Gestamp works with institutions, non-governmental organizations, private companies, educational and other entities for the effective development of its social action. Relationships and collaborations with public or private institutions are aimed at combining efforts to support the community.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/16 description: The image shows a calendar icon with an hourglass in front of it. The calendar has three circles on top, and the hourglass is filled with a blue gradient.\n\n**Long term:** Gestamp's social action initiatives and its relationship with communities, as well as its business activities, are intended to be permanent in the medium and long term.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/18 description: The image shows a group of three people represented by simple line drawings. The figures are arranged in a cluster, with one figure slightly in front of the other two. All three figures are wearing collared shirts and ties. The lines are blue, and the image has a clean, minimalist style.\n\n**Employee involvement:** social action initiatives provide the opportunity to channel concerns over solidarity and commitment, which is why Gestamp encourages volunteering among its employees.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/20 description: The image shows a stylized eye icon. The eye is outlined in a dark blue color, and the iris is a lighter blue circle within the eye.\n\n**Ethics and Transparency:** Gestamp takes an ethical and transparent approach to its collaborations with other bodies, so that these collaborations are not exploited for purposes contrary to the applicable legislation at any given time. The Group's established procedures for third party due diligence shall be applied.\n\n![map pin icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/material-design-icons/master/maps/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_place_24px.png)\n\n**Adapting to local needs:** For every project it undertakes, Gestamp is committed to initiatives that are flexibly adapted to the local needs and demands of the communities in which it operates.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/24 description: The image shows a blue and purple rocket ship taking off. The rocket ship is angled slightly to the left and has a small window near the top. There are clouds of smoke coming from the bottom of the rocket ship, indicating that it is in motion.\n\n**Leaving an impact:** the ultimate goal of\n\nGestamp's social action is to create a positive impact on the local communities where it operates and to contribute towards improving people's quality of life, beyond its own business activity.\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/27 description: A group of approximately 30 people are posing for a photo in front of a dark brown wall. The group consists of both men and women, mostly young adults, and they are arranged in a semi-circle, with some kneeling in the front and others standing behind them. To the left of the group, there is a large, light blue teardrop-shaped flag with white designs on it. Next to the flag, there is a white sign with blue writing on it. To the right of the group, there is a small, striped booth with a triangular flag hanging from it. The floor is light gray with blue dotted lines on it.\n\n#### **Collaboration with non-profit organisations**\n\nTransparency in Gestamp's collaboration with Associations and Non-Profit Organisations is essential for the proper functioning of the projects and their sustainability over time.\n\nTo monitor and measure the impact of the initiatives that Gestamp carries out, the Business for Social Impact (B4SI) methodology is taken as a reference. Furthermore, in 2023, with the aim of strengthening the impact measurement system, Gestamp once again has the consulting firm Mas Business, from the LBG Group. In this way, a double verification of the measurement of the impact of Social Action is guaranteed.\n\nWith the intention of improving impact measurement and better analyzing the social impact of the initiatives carried out by Gestamp, this year the number of beneficiaries of social projects has been incorporated into the reporting campaign. With the initiatives carried out in 2023, a total of 464,827 direct beneficiaries have been impacted.\n\nIn 2023, a total of 229 social and non-profit activities have been identified in which the company has worked together with 187 collaborating entities and in which a total of 1,565 employees have participated voluntarily, the total value being of the contribution of 1,126,291.67 euros.\n\nBy type of contribution, the majority of activities were made as a monetary contribution (89.6%), followed by contributions in kind (7.7%) through volunteer actions carried out by Gestamp employees. The contribution in kind has represented 2.7% of the contributions.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/152/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Putting this commitment into practice, the company is actively involved in a range of initiatives geared towards social, economic and technological issues, in the form of business clusters and associations.\n\nEstablishing alliances and fostering understanding between the different actors in society and the sector is fundamental to creating a sustainable business ecosystem. This is how Gestamp sees it, and its participation in organisations and institutions is very active.

Riberas, Executive Chairman of Gestamp, renewed his position for two more years as Chairman of the Spanish Association of Automotive Suppliers (SERNAUTO), a position he has held since 2021, with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of component manufacturers and continuing to consolidate the Spanish supplier industry both inside and outside Spain.\n\nThe commitment to innovation has always been a constant at Gestamp and is reflected in its participation in organisations such as the University Institute for Automotive Research and the COTEC Foundation. Gestamp is constantly innovating in order to strengthen its position as a technological leader and to guarantee the sustainability, efficiency and competitiveness of its production processes and products.\n\nKnowledge transfer is also a priority in the business model, where the Group collaborates in various educational and dual vocational training programmes.\n\nParticipation in technology partnerships helps in the process of transferring knowledge of a new technology, which is the usual mechanism by which the organisation adapts to the requirements of new projects. These new projects also end up fostering socio-economic development as a whole.\n\nGestamp holds the presidency of the Spain-China Council Foundation and the vice-presidency of the main automotive clusters, and actively participates on the boards of directors of the main bilateral chambers of commerce.\n\nThe institutional relations area seeks to show different institutional audiences Gestamp's contribution to society, collaborating in the development of public policies and regulations as a corporate citizen, with ethics, transparency, integrity and professionalism in our institutional dialogue.\n\nFurthermore, Gestamp is registered in the EU Transparency Register and abides by the rules and principles set out in Annex I of the Interinstitutional Agreement.\n\nImage /page/153/Picture/21 description: A close-up shot depicts a stack of hands, creating a sense of unity and teamwork.

During these, suppliers must implement an action plan approved by Gestamp with the aim of improving the quality of both the product and the service provided. In 2023, 27 different suppliers participated in\n\n### ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/3 description: The image shows three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other, with the word \"INDEX\" written below them.

This policy sets out the underlying principles that are to govern it, which include the following:\n\n- **•** Equal treatment and transparency. This principle states that the selection of directors shall be transparent and free from implicit bias, so as to guarantee the same opportunities for all qualified candidates.\n- **•** Diversity. This principle states that diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, backgrounds, nationalities, age and gender shall be encouraged, in order to enrich the decision-making process and to bring different perspectives to discussions on matters within the Board's competence.\n\nThe Board of Directors' Knowledge, Skills, Diversity and Experience Guide sets out the knowledge, skills, diversity and experience that the Board of Directors as a whole must possess such that it serves as a reference and support tool for the Board of Directors' Selection Policy.\n\nThis guide, approved on 14 December 2017 by the Board of Directors at the proposal of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, develops the aforementioned principles and establishes that, for the purposes of selecting candidates and re-electing directors, and in the event of equal knowledge and experience, diversity is to be encouraged, thus preventing discrimination on the grounds of gender, age, culture, religion\n\nand race. It also establishes that the composition of the Board of Directors is to be in accordance with the demographic reality of the markets in which the Company operates.\n\nIn pursuit of this principle of diversity, and of gender diversity in particular, the Board of Directors' Selection and Diversity Policy establishes the Board's duty to ensure that the Company's diversity measures encourage a significant number of women in senior management positions within the Company, in accordance with the provisions of Recommendation 14 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies.\n\nAs a whole, the Board must possess the knowledge, skills and experience needed to guarantee the adequate governance of the Company in line with its activities, including its main risks, ensuring that it has effective capacity for independent and autonomous decision-making in the Company's interest. For the purposes of defining the skills, knowledge and experience that, as a whole, are deemed most appropriate for the Board of Directors and to verify the suitability of a candidate for a vacancy on the Board, the Nomination and Compensation Committee approves a competency matrix for the Board of Directors. The current Board of Directors' competency matrix is as follows:\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/20 description: A conference room is shown with a long wooden table surrounded by chairs.

On the same date, the results of their evaluation were submitted to the Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee. After analysing the results, each of the Committees issued a report on the evaluation. In addition, the Nomination and Compensation Committee, aided by the\n\nexternal consultant, prepared an action plan that was presented at the first meeting of the Board of Directors in 2024 together with the reports issued by each of the Committees.\n\nAlthough the results of the 2023 evaluation were positive, the action plan arising from the process includes a series of recommendations about operational aspects of the Board of Directors, which are to be implemented in 2024.

Good governance and transparency. The Board of Directors shall adopt any measures required to ensure good governance and transparency in the remuneration received by the Directors so as to guarantee the trust of investors and shareholders.\n\n[7.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nGestamp carries out its activities in multiple countries, markets and regulatory, political and socioeconomic environments and due to this the company is exposed to strategic, operational, financial, reputational and compliance risks, which must be mitigated in the most effective way possible.\n\nDuring 2023, the risks detected by the company are in line with those of the previous period, also taking into account the consequences derived from the ongoing international conflicts, which have generated an impact for companies and countries around the world.\n\nThese factors have led to the reinforcement of internal measures and policies to mitigate the different consequences derived, among others, from price increases and discontinuities in the supply of raw materials and energy.\n\nBelow are some of the main risks identified and the management measures established by the company:\n\nImage /page/177/Picture/15 description: The image shows an industrial robotic arm in an industrial setting.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/12 description: The image contains text describing the ability to adapt to drops in volumes, flexibility of production and absorption of associated costs, and uncertainty of sales volume forecasts.\n\nGestamp has been working for years on Industry 4.0 and digitalization projects aimed at making production more flexible and absorbing costs.\n\nGestamp's Smart Factory model allows us to face market uncertainties, with a new component assembly concept that makes it possible to adjust the installed production capacity to the real volumes of the different vehicles at all times.\n\nMultiple indicators of maximum sensitivity are also available for detecting situations of non-immediate adaptation.\n\nGiven the impossibility of anticipating events that could substantially alter vehicle sales volumes, Gestamp works to try to reduce the impact of this risk on the business. Among other measures, there are: the optimization of the cost structure to balance variable and fixed costs, the aforementioned Smart Factory model for the implementation of flexible production processes or the establishment of binding contractual clauses against drops in volumes, where may be possible.\n\n#### **Profitability deviations in the industrialization and production phases of the projects.**\n\nGestamp has GPCS (Gestamp Product Creation System), a system that regulates and collects all the procedures to be carried out in the study and pricing phase of the projects, serving as a repository of all the documentation of the different parts of the process, including that associated with risks. In this system, the different milestones of each project, their review points and those responsible are defined. This system is disseminated and implemented globally in the Group. Additionally, there is a global database that includes the history of incidents and lessons learned for consultation when preparing each new Business Case.\n\nFinally, for each launch and its corresponding Business Case, a deviation analysis is carried out and they are monitored from a specific corporate control department.\n\n#### **Volatility risks and supply management**\n\nMost steel is purchased through \"re-sale\" contracts agreed upon directly by automakers. For the rest of raw material supplies, Gestamp negotiates with steel suppliers purchase prices aligned with the agreements closed by customers.\n\nNumerous controls are carried out associated with the management of the logistics chain and daily controls of the stock level in conjunction with production forecasts. Gestamp has designed a long-term energy purchase strategy with PPA contracts (Power Purchase Agreement) with the aim of reducing the impact of price volatility.\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/23 description: The image shows a blue badge with a star in the center. The badge has a jagged edge and a ribbon hanging from the bottom.\n\n#### **Incidents related to the quality of Gestamp products**\n\nGestamp has a global quality management system that is the basis of the plants' systems, certified by internationally accredited independent organizations and also audited regularly by both clients and the internal quality audit team. Additionally, it develops quality standards with the best practices of the different plants to be implemented in all of them, with a special focus on manufacturing processes, as well as various computer tools that help with the effective deployment of work methodologies in the quality environment. typical of the automotive sector.\n\n#### **Cybersecurity risk and critical information leak**\n\nImplementation of the strategic cybersecurity plan in the plants and divisions, with various measures ranging from the reinforcement of barriers to access to information, to alert systems for intrusion attempts, phishing, malware, etc. or ongoing employee awareness activities. Update and reinforcement of liquid asset protection procedures. Classification of information by level of criticality and design of adequate protection.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

The podium has a flat top with a raised edge, and a tall, thin stand. The microphone is attached to the top of the podium and has a small, round head.\n\n#### **Political and economic instability in the various countries in which Gestamp operates**\n\nGestamp monitors the geopolitical situation in all the countries in which it operates to evaluate and incorporate the effects of potential instability into the Group's forecasts and strategic and operational decisions and designs mitigating measures in this regard. Likewise, related factors and indicators are taken into account in the award of each new relevant project in countries with significant risk, through ad hoc reports and are shared in the committees responsible for making the decisions, as well as their mitigating measures.\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/16 description: The image shows an icon of two people, one wearing a hard hat and the other wearing a suit. To the right of the icon is the text \"Di er\".\n\n#### **Difficulty in identifying, selecting and retaining trained professionals in line with an environment of technological change and global growth**\n\nGestamp currently has a people management model that allows it to identify, on a homogeneous and consistent basis, the existing talent in the organization. This, together with other management tools such as training and development programs, mobility plans, and compensation programs, contributes to the development and growth of talent. Furthermore, based on the Group's strategic priorities, both in terms of growth and development and adoption of new technologies, it allows planning the talent needs in number and characteristics, for those environments where it is necessary.\n\n#### **Sufficient ESG objectives in the company's business model and their adequate achievement.**\n\nGestamp has established a long-term ESG 2025 strategic plan that has been designed to be in line with the risks identified in the Group and in line with the expectations of the different stakeholders. Governing bodies and ESG policies have been defined that determine the company's governance in this field, as well as multidisciplinary working groups at both the corporate and divisional levels. Finally, continuous monitoring activities are carried out.\n\n#### **Inadequate definition of the technological strategy**\n\nGestamp participates in co-developments with clients and multiple digitalization and Industry 4.0 initiatives. Additionally, a specific technological innovation roadmap has been defined for electric vehicles and other technologies. The activities are supervised and directed by the R&D Committee.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Regular assessment of foreign exchange exposure by geography and making hedging decisions. Monthly monitoring of its impacts. Establishment of contractual clauses with third parties for indexation of exchange rate variations.\n\n#### COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\nImage /page/180/Figure/17 description: The image shows a document with a seal on it. The document is white with blue lines, and the seal is blue with a white center.\n\n**Compliance risks associated with the various legislation and regulations to which the Group is subject.**\n\nContinuous monitoring of all regulatory changes that may affect Gestamp. There is a complaints channel with continuous activity and monitoring and regular reporting to the Group's Audit Committee.\n\nLikewise, the Group has a Criminal Risk Prevention Model, as well as a Criminal Risk Prevention Manual and the codes and policies associated with it, which are approved and reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors.\n\nImage /page/180/Picture/21 description: A close-up shot captures a wooden gavel resting on a black base, positioned in front of a brass scale of justice.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n**ESG risks**\n\nGestamp is aware that ESG risks are closely linked to the geographical location of its plants and the complexity of the automotive sector value chain. For this reason, through the ESG 2025 Strategic Plan, it also seeks to contribute to mitigating these risks with a double direction: towards the company and towards its stakeholders and environment.\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Management and the ESG Management have created a matrix that crosses Gestamp's risks with the areas of the ESG Strategic plan with a double objective: to ensure that the Risk Map is aligned with the company's new ESG strategy and know the degree of contribution of the different areas of the ESG Plan to the mitigation of the company's risks.\n\n#### LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTION OF THE ESG PLAN TO THE TOP 20 IDENTIFIED RISKS\n\nImage /page/181/Figure/15 description: The image shows a series of icons representing different areas of focus. From left to right, the icons are: a tree for Environmental Targets, a person with stars for Talent, a car for Circularity, a heart for Health & Safety, a building for Social Contribution, three people for Ethics & Good Governance, a cloud with CO2 for Road to Neutrality, and three circles connected in a loop for Supply Chain Responsible Management. The icons are arranged in a line, with some icons in a light blue circle and others in a light gray circle. To the right of the icons, there is text that describes the areas represented by the icons. The text indicates that the light gray circles represent areas that contribute to risk mitigation, while the light blue circles represent areas that, in addition to contributing to risk mitigation, are a source of competitive advantage.\n\nAfter analyzing this matrix, the following conclusions have been obtained:\n\n- Firstly, the most mature plan areas, that is, those in\n- which the company has been working for the longest time, meet their objective of mitigating risks such as the safety and health of workers, risks related to the quality of the parts supplied or risks of compliance and accountability.\n- In addition, the plan reinforces areas that mitigate risks related to the environmental, social and ethical 1 2 3\n\t- management of the supply chain or non-alignment with clients' ESG expectations or talent attraction and retention.\n- And mainly, the plan not only contributes to\n- mitigating risks, but also transforms some of them\n- into opportunities and competitive advantage, such as alignment with clients' climate change objectives or introducing the concept of circularity.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/182/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"Gestamp\" in a bold, dark blue font.

For more information see the Criminal risk prevention section.\n\nIn line with this commitment, Gestamp has a Compliance Department that operates through different bodies: the Ethics Committee, the Compliance Office and the Regulatory Compliance Unit. The Compliance Department supports the Board of Directors and, in particular, the Audit Committee, the supervisory body of the Code of Conduct, the Whistleblowing Hotline and the Group's internal control programmes.\n\nThe Compliance Policy establishes the governance structure of the Compliance Department: while the Ethics Committee, with the support of the Compliance Office, acts within the scope of the Code of Ethics and the Whistleblowing Hotline, the Regulatory Compliance Unit is limited to developing and monitoring the compliance programmes implemented in the Group.\n\nAdditionally, the Sustainability Committee monitors and oversees those aspects related to Human Rights such as the Policy, which was approved at the end of 2022 by the Board of Directors.\n\nImage /page/183/Picture/17 description: A slightly angled shot shows a white wall with the word \"Gestamp\" in silver, sans-serif letters.

This document is the common reference framework for the ethical and respectful behaviour of the members of the governing bodies and employees contractually linked with the Group companies or with any of the subsidiaries in which the parent company holds, directly or indirectly, the status of majority partner.\n\nIt contains the Rules of Conduct based on the Corporate Principles and on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact relating to human rights, labour standards, environmental standards and the fight against corruption.\n\nOn 7 May 2018, the Board of Directors of Gestamp Automoción, S.A. approved the current version of the Code of Conduct in order to adapt and update its content to meet the requirements arising from the new listed company status of the Group's parent company.\n\nThe **[Code of Conduct](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/About%20Us/Code%20of%20Conduct/Code-of-Conduct-ES.pdf?ext=.pdf)** can be found on the Group's website and Intranet and is available to both employees and third parties (suppliers, clients, local communities, etc.) in any of the 18 languages used by the Group.\n\n#### TRAINING\n\nAll Group employees and members of the governing bodies must have completed the introduction course on the Code of Conduct at least once. It also forms part of the induction plan for new employees, where they are given the document and asked to adhere to it. The Code of Conduct training can be carried out in the following ways:\n\n- **• Online training:** through the Gestamp Corporate University.\n- **• Face-to-face training:** For cases where the employee does not have access to an electronic device that allows them to carry out said online training.\n\nImage /page/184/Picture/20 description: Two copies of a document titled \"Código de Conducta\" are stacked next to each other. The document has the \"Gestamp\" logo at the top, followed by the title in large, bold letters. Below the title are four circular icons representing different aspects of conduct.

Therefore, special controls for human rights have been incorporated into the Group's supplier management platform: ESG risk prediction tool, self-completed questionnaire for suppliers and templates for identifying conflict minerals. (Further information: Responsible supply chain\n\n#### management).\n\nGestamp also has a whistleblowing hotline for employees and people linked in any way to the Group (employees, clients, suppliers, collaborators, partners, shareholders and investors and local communities, among others) which considers matters directly or indirectly related to human rights. (See Code of Conduct section).\n\nAs a result of the diagnosis, Gestamp has identified the need to strengthen some of its human rights violation protection measures such as:\n\n- **•** Annually update the identification and assessment of real and potential human rights risks.\n- **•** Ensure that the Human Rights policy is transferred to all Human Resources procedures and processes.\n- **•** Prepare a remediation protocol.\n\nFurthermore, Gestamp's plants in the United Kingdom have a specific internal policy called Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement to comply with the regulations, of an eminently criminal nature, existing in the UK (Modern Slavery Act).\n\nAdditionally, in its activities in Germany, Gestamp as implemented the Law for due diligence of the supply chain (LkSG).\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/193/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

This model, including the Criminal Risk Map and Criminal Risk Prevention Manual, is regularly revised and updated.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, work continued on updating and improving the Criminal Risk Prevention Model by extending the scope of evaluation processes for the design and effectiveness of controls, as well as establishing corrective measures for any shortfalls detected. In terms of promoting a culture of compliance within Gestamp, training on criminal risk prevention has continued, adapted to the risk profile for the professional activity of each employee. Likewise, a notice about the Gift Policy was sent to all employees, which detailed the fundamental aspects of the standard in order to promote greater awareness of it.\n\nFinally, in order to achieve better coordination and supervision of the control framework established on an international level, work has continued on revising the risks and controls set locally, with corrective action proposed where necessary.\n\nImage /page/193/Picture/15 description: The image is a blurry, abstract shot of an electronic display.

These illegal activities stunt economic and social development, undermine the rule of law and, from a business perspective, are detrimental to the market and corporate reputation.\n\nOn 17 December 2018, the Gestamp Board of Directors approved the Anti-Corruption and Fraud Policy, which expands on the internal regulations regarding corruption, fraud and bribery already established in the Code of Conduct. The Policy is applicable to directors, managers and employees who are contractually bound to the Group's companies, as well as any third parties that liaise with the Group.\n\nThe aim of this Policy is to send a strong and clear message of opposition to all forms of corruption, fraud and bribery and to explicitly state our commitment to avoiding said conduct within the organisation.\n\nTo this end, it establishes certain guidelines for action and the rules applicable to the performance of any business-related activity conducted within the Group in relation to:\n\nImage /page/194/Figure/16 description: The image shows five icons related to unethical behavior. The first icon depicts a briefcase with two hands shaking inside, labeled \"Corruption.\" The second icon is a money bag with a dollar sign on it, labeled \"Fraud and bribery.\" The third icon is a gift box with a bow, labeled \"Gifts and tokens of appreciation.\" The fourth icon shows a hand holding two coins with dollar signs, and the fifth icon is a podium.\n\nDonations or aid Political activity\n\nThe Group is also aligned with major international standards on corporate responsibility and anti-corruption, including the Tenth Principle of the UN Global Compact, the recommendations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, among others.\n\nCorruption, fraud and bribery also form part of the catalogue of risks found in the Group's Criminal Risk Prevention Model and, therefore, controls designed to prevent them from materialising have been introduced. This includes due diligence measures established to identify and manage the integrity risk associated with certain partners, customers and suppliers that Gestamp engages with based on its normal operations.\n\nAlthough the training given on criminal risk prevention has been adapted to the risk profile for the professional activity of each employee, all participants took the module on the prevention of corruption and bribery.\n\nWith respect to political activity, the Group does not take part in any activity of this kind, nor does it show support for, make financial contributions or give donations of any kind to political parties or their members.\n\nThis includes due diligence measures established to identify and manage the integrity risk\n\n#### PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM\n\nIn accordance with the legislation applicable in the jurisdictions where Gestamp carries out its usual activities, the Group is not obliged to comply with anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing legislation.\n\nNevertheless, the Criminal Risk Prevention Model includes money laundering and terrorism financing within the catalogue of risks that the Group is exposed to as a result of its usual activity, therefore specific measures are in place to prevent them from materialising.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Compliance in terms of Competition**\n\nOur Code of Conduct establishes measures aimed at avoiding any conduct that could illegally restrict free competition in the markets in which Gestamp operates. It does so by forbidding engagement in secret agreements on prices or terms of sale with competitors, secret agreements on waiving competition, the submission of sham bids, client sharing and other market segmentation standards.\n\nFurthermore, the Crime Prevention Model stipulates the analysis, identification and regular assessment of risks linked to the perpetration of offences related to conduct that restricts free competition, and also defines effective controls for preventing the possibility of such offences being committed.\n\nGestamp has not been involved in any legal proceedings in the last 5 years nor have any fines been imposed for anti-competitive practices.\n\n#### **Conflicts of Interest**\n\nBeyond the Code of Conduct applicable to all employees and persons connected to them, in order to avoid conflicts of interest, **[Article 22 of the Board Regulations](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Shareholders%20Investors/Corporate%20Governance/Corporate%20Rules/Reglamento%20del%20Consejo/2021_03_29-Reglamento-CdA-(Modificacion-Comision-ESG).pdf?ext=.pdf)** stipulates that directors are required to inform the Board of Directors of any circumstances that may lead to a direct or indirect conflict of interest as soon as they become aware of such circumstance.\n\nIn any event, each member of the Board of Directors must abstain from attending and participating in deliberations and votes (including by means of proxy vote) concerning matters in which they or a related party, as defined in the applicable law, have a direct or indirect conflict of interest.\n\nAdditionally, directors should abstain from engaging in commercial or professional transactions that may lead to a conflict of interest, without having first informed and received approval from the Board of Directors, which shall request a report from the Audit Committee.\n\n#### **Internal Code of Conduct Concerning Securities Markets**\n\nThe **[Internal Code of Conduct Concerning Securities Markets](https://www.gestamp.com/Gestamp11/media/GestampFiles/Shareholders%20Investors/Corporate%20Governance/Corporate%20Rules/Codigo%20Conducta/Reglamento-Interno-de-Conducta-(pdf).pdf?ext=.pdf)** determines the standards of conduct and action to be followed by those to whom they are addressed, including, but not limited to, the members of the Board of Directors, senior management, employees or external advisors who have access to insider information belonging to Gestamp, as well as those involved in handling, using and disseminating insider information, all for the purpose of fostering transparency, protecting the interests of investors with regard to Gestamp securities and avoiding any situation that potentially qualifies as market abuse.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Intellectual and industrial property**\n\nThe company considers intellectual and industrial property rights, and the implementation of the related trade secrets and knowhow, to be integral to the competitive advantage of our business. Therefore, Gestamp focuses its efforts and invests resources in submitting, registering, maintaining, monitoring and defending our intellectual and industrial property rights.\n\nThese intellectual and industrial property rights cover both the technologies, processes and products encompassed in Gestamp's core business, as well as those technologies aimed at optimising and increasing the flexibility and efficiency of processes and the quality of the products in the area of Industry 4.0.\n\nMany of the technologies and processes that we use stem from the knowledge, experience and skills of our scientific and technical personnel. In some cases, these technologies and processes are patented and protected through intellectual and industrial property rights, while others are protected through trade secrets. To protect our trade secrets, know-\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Gestamp has more than 1,300 patents, utility models and corresponding applications.\n\nhow, technologies and processes, we formalise confidentiality agreements with employees, clients, suppliers, competitors, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators that prevent confidential information from being disclosed to third parties.\n\nGestamp protects its pre-existing intellectual and industrial property rights and does not transfer them to any collaboration partners, clients, suppliers, competitors or third parties. Where development agreements are formalised, we assert ownership over intellectual and industrial property rights that may arise in relation to those agreements and which are connected to or based on company know-how, trade secrets, technology and processes.\n\n#### TACKLING THE ISSUE OF COUNTERFEIT PARTS\n\nThe use of original/authentic parts is a pre-requisite for the proper functioning and maintenance of vehicles throughout their service life.\n\nBeyond the law's prohibition of using counterfeit parts, Gestamp is aware of how a counterfeit component can compromise the integrity of a vehicle in terms of safety and performance.\n\nGestamp has identified two stages in its manufacturing process in which there is a potential risk of counterfeit parts making their way into the value chain. Although there is a low likelihood of this happening, the company has established measures to reduce the risk to a minimum:\n\n- **•** Acquisition of counterfeit parts in the purchasing process: as a first class supplier, most of the goods acquired by the company are materials; nevertheless, where a final product is acquired, suppliers must guarantee that there is no risk of selling counterfeit products to Gestamp.\n- **•** Withdrawal of defective parts: the company takes care to ensure that non-compliant products that are not undergoing checks or repairs—and therefore must be discarded—are rendered unusable prior to disposal, to prevent their potential return to the supply chain as a counterfeit part.\n\nGestamp has built and maintains quality management systems that have the international certifications required by customers, above all the IATF 16949 standard. These management systems aid Gestamp's continuous improvement by focusing on the customer and promoting safe, sustainable prevention through detection, resulting in fewer defects and less waste in the supply chain.\n\nThe aim is to bring the whole of the company's manufacturing activity in line with the quality expectations of customers and with international standards, to ensure the maximum quality and efficiency of manufacturing processes, and to comply with customers' specifications throughout these processes until the delivery of the final product.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/197/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp. The word \"Gestamp\" is written in a bold, sans-serif font in a dark blue color.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n#### **Personal Data Protection**\n\nGestamp is committed to the protection of personal data. Therefore, within the Group we are constantly adapting and boosting our resources to comply with the personal data protection legislation in force in the regions where Gestamp operates and/or carries out personal data processing activities.\n\nIn this regard, Gestamp has a **[Data Protection Policy](https://www.gestamp.com/data-protection-policy)** aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (GDPR), which sets out guarantees and principles, as well as the main obligations and rights in terms of personal data protection at Gestamp Group companies. This Data Protection Policy is the core of Gestamp Group's commitment to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to personal data protection.\n\nGestamp continually strives to implement any and all mechanisms that are required in order to ensure that personal data remain secure and to prevent tampering, loss, or unauthorised processing or access, even in regions that are beyond the scope of application of this GDPR, by adapting the Data Protection Policy to local laws. As such, Gestamp Group standards are applied across all regions in which we operate, are present and/or conduct personal data processing activities. Since these standards are based on the GDPR, in several regions they are stricter than national regulations.\n\nMoreover, the Group has conducted a risk assessment of the corporate applications that process personal data, to evaluate the security measures implemented, and it has developed a procedure for the execution of privacy impact assessments (PIA) that determines the level of risk entailed whenever data\n\nare processed with a view to establishing the most appropriate control measures to limit this risk.\n\nFurthermore, the training of our employees is crucial to the success of any new project. Therefore, to ensure compliance with and implementation of the GDPR, the Group has offered faceto-face training sessions for certain corporate services employees who regularly work with personal data, thus providing them with theoretical and practical information about how to apply the GDPR. In addition, there is an online data protection training course available to employees free of charge and accessible at any time.\n\nImage /page/197/Picture/18 description: A medium shot depicts an office setting with a man working at a desk in the foreground and a meeting room visible through a glass wall in the background. The man, who has a beard and is wearing a headset, is focused on a computer screen. His desk is cluttered with papers and office supplies, including a red document holder. Behind him, a glass wall separates his workspace from a meeting room. Inside the meeting room, a woman in a patterned dress is standing near a whiteboard, seemingly in the middle of a presentation or discussion. A conference table and chairs are arranged in the center of the room. The word \"Gestamp\" is visible on the glass wall, possibly indicating the name of the company. A projector is mounted on the ceiling of the meeting room. The overall lighting is bright, and the color palette is dominated by neutral tones, with accents of blue and red.\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/198/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

On this basis, Gestamp is able to identify the aspects that it should prioritise and those that should serve to underpin its ESG strategy and governance model.\n\nThe analysis conducted during the 2023 reporting period was divided into 3 phases:\n\n- **• Phase 1 -** Context analysis and understanding of Gestamp's value chain.\n- **• Phase 2 -** Identification of topics, sub-topics and material IROs.\n- **• Phase 3 -** Assessment and weighting of material IROs.\n\nThis analysis will be reviewed annually and updated at least e zo years. These times are pending review based on the new regulations and applicable standards.\n\n# PHASE 1 - CONTEXT ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING OF GESTAMP'S VALUE CHAIN\n\nA context analysis has been conducted to identify and develop a clearer understanding of Gestamp's business activities, based on internal and external sources:\n\n#### INTERNAL SOURCES::\n\n- **•** 2022 Materiality analysis.\n- **•** Gestamp's 2022 Annual Report.\n- **•** ESG Risk Map.\n- **•** Analysis of Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.\n- **•** Other information identified as relevant by business units.\n\nImage /page/210/Picture/27 description: The image shows a blue icon of an arrow pointing to the right, enclosed in a bracket. The bracket is open on the left side, and the arrow is pointing towards the right.\n\n#### EXTERNAL SOURCES:\n\n- **•** Relevant sector-based reports\n- **•** Information about competitors in the public domain.\n- **•** Standards/recommendations: SASB, GRI, TCFD, WEF, EFRAG,\n- **•** ESG Analysts: MSCI, S&P, Sustainalytics, Ecovadis, FTSE.\n- **•** Regulations and recommendations of regulators: EU Taxonomy, CNMV, etc.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/211/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\n# PHASE 2 - IDENTIFICATION OF TOPICS, SUB-TOPICS AND MATERIAL IROS\n\nFor the purpose of classifying the Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IROs) that will be identified and assessed, first of all the topics identified on a preliminary basis as being the most relevant have been listed for ease of understanding and in the interests of facilitating analysis. As such, the new EFRAG Standards of the CSRD and all resources identified during the context analysis have been taken into consideration.\n\nThe identified material topics are divided into more specific sub-topics which increase granularity and show how the topics correspond to the company's activities.\n\n3\nFinally, a preliminary list of approximately 100 impacts, risks and opportunities related to every sub-topic and material topic have been identified. Prioritised according to relevance, only those considered to be the most relevant have subsequently been assessed. All the sources consulted during the context analysis have been used to this end.\n\n#### IMPACT\n\n1\n\n2\n\nThe effect that the entity's processes, activities, products, services and relations have on people or the environment over time. The effect may be:\n\n- **•** Current or potential, depending on whether it is happening at the present time or may happen in the future.\n- **•** Positive or negative.\n\n#### RISK\n\nAny uncertain environmental, social or governance-related events or conditions which, should they occur, may have a material negative impact on the company's business model and strategy.\n\n#### OPPORTUNITY\n\nAny uncertain environmental, social or governance-related events or conditions which, should they occur, may have a material positive impact on the company's business model and strategy.\n\n## PHASE 3 - ASSESSMENT AND WEIGHTING OF MATERIAL IROS\n\nGestamp has involved its four principal stakeholder groups in the assessment of IROs. Information has been gathered via surveys, including questions on topics and sub-topics for employees and associations, as well as special surveys on IROs for relevant departments (representing customers and suppliers and providing their business vision). A trend analysis conducted for regulatory bodies and the financial community has also identified the topics that they currently prioritise.\n\nImage /page/211/Figure/25 description: The image shows a diagram with icons and text labels representing different stakeholders and methods of analysis. From left to right, the stakeholders are: Employees, Customers, Suppliers, Civil Society and Opinion Makers, Regulatory Bodies, and Financial Community. The first four stakeholders are grouped under the heading \"SURVEYS\", while the last two are grouped under the heading \"TREND ANALYSIS\".\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/212/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for Gestamp.

Letter from the Chairman](#page-2-0)\n\nOn the basis of the results, the IROs have been assessed in their respective material topics and subtopics, according to the following criteria:\n\nImage /page/212/Figure/4 description: This image shows a diagram of impact and financial materiality. The impact materiality section is divided into positive and negative impacts. The positive impact section is divided into real and potential impacts. The real impact is calculated as Scale + Scope. The potential impact is calculated as (Scale + Scope) x Likelihood. The negative impact section is divided into real and potential impacts. The real impact is calculated as Scale + Scope + Remediability. The potential impact is calculated as (Scale + Scope) x Likelihood. The financial materiality section is divided into risk and opportunity. The risk is calculated as Scale x Probability. The opportunity is calculated as Scale x Probability. The timeframe for impact materiality is short term, medium term, and long term. The timeframe for financial materiality is potential. Scale is the magnitude of IRO if it occurs. Scope indicates the level of impact on population and geographic area. Likelihood indicates the probability of the IROs occurring. Remediability is the difficulty of repairing or offsetting a negative impact.\n\n[4. Environmental Dimension](#page-59-0)\n\n[5. Social Dimension](#page-107-0)\n\n[2. Gestamp Group](#page-4-0)\n\n[3. ESG Perspective](#page-49-0)\n\n[6. Governance](#page-155-0)\n\n[7. Annexes](#page-199-0)\n\nThe primary material aspects in terms of IRO are assessed according to a double materiality matrix produced on the basis of the above.
