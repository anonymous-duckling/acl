Kapsch TrafficCom prepares this statement in the form of this consolidated non-financial report (\"Report\"). Thereby, the company complies with the provisions of the Austrian Commercial Code and the disclosure requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom analyzes its impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Other national, union-based or international frameworks (such as the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative) are not applied.\n\nTo avoid redundancies, the Report refers to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2023/24 (\"Financial Statements\"), the Consolidated Management Report 2023/24 (\"Management Report\"), the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report 2023/24 (\"CG Report\") and the Remuneration Report 2023/24 (\"Remuneration Report\") where necessary. References within this Report are identified by the word \"section\" in conjunction with the relevant chapter title. All references are written in italics and are preceded by two arrows ( ).\n\nThe disclosed key figures were collected for the Kapsch TrafficCom Group (\"Group\"); any deviations are explained for the respective key figures. This report has not been audited externally.\n\n# 1.2 Organization of sustainability at Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\nGeorg Kapsch, CEO of Kapsch TrafficCom, has the Executive Board responsibility for Environment, Social & Governance (ESG). Detailed information on the organization and role of the executive bodies of Kapsch TrafficCom can be found in the *CG Report*, while information on non-financial criteria in the context of Executive Board remuneration can be found in the *Remuneration Report*.\n\nThe (non-financial) sustainability initiatives of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group are coordinated and processed by an ESG task force. It consists of eight people from different divisions with global responsibility and is led by the Investor Relations Officer.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom achieved significant progress in the continuous systematization and expansion of sustainability management. For example, a central data hub for non-financial information was implemented. This means that non-financial data can now be reported in a more efficient and structured manner and the database can thus be improved.\n\nIn addition, the company conducted a new materiality analysis in the reporting period, which was already based on the concept of double materiality. The results of this analysis served as the basis for the new reporting structure and – where the data was already available – new content.\n\nWith these and other measures to improve the internal reporting process, Kapsch TrafficCom is also preparing for future reporting in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Kapsch TrafficCom AG will publish its first sustainability report in accordance with the new requirements for the financial year 2024/25, which will also be audited externally. The following additional content is planned:\n\n- Corporate carbon footprint (incl. emissions from upstream and downstream value chain)\n- Further sustainability indicators and disclosures on ESG topics\n- Climate and sustainability strategy\n- ESG governance\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 1.3 Business model and strategy.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is a globally renowned provider of transportation solutions for sustainable mobility. Innovative solutions in the application fields of tolling, tolling services, traffic management and demand management contribute to a healthy world without congestion.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has brought projects to fruition in more than 50 countries around the globe and has subsidiaries and branches in more than 25 countries worldwide. Comprehensive information on the Group structure and Group companies can be found in the *Financial Statements, note 1.1 \"Group structure and consolidated group\"* and a list of consolidated companies in the *Financial Statements, note 29 \"Interests in subsidiaries\"*.\n\nWith one-stop-shop solutions, the Company covers the entire value chain of customers, from components to design and implementation to the operation of systems. Further information on the Company can be found in the *Financial Statements, note 1 \"General information\"*.\n\n### 1.3.1 Sustainable business model.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom addresses challenges in the field of transportation that go hand in hand with megatrends ( *Management Report, chapter 1.1.2 \"Definition of market\"*). The Company's products and solutions help to\n\n- maintain and further develop existing road infrastructure,\n- make efficient use of existing transport routes,\n- reduce the environmental impact (especially emissions in the form of greenhouse gases, particulate matter and noise) caused by traffic,\n- direct the behavior of road users as well as\n- increase road safety.\n\nInternal and external studies quantify the effects as follows: Globally, road traffic causes 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions; in urban areas, road traffic is responsible for 25% of air pollution. Intelligent transportation systems are one of the key technologies for solving this problem. As a key player in the transportation sector, Kapsch TrafficCom supports its customers in reducing as many traffic emissions as possible.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's products and solutions for sustainable mobility include:\n\n- Tolling technologies. Distance-based pricing improves transport efficiency and can contribute to CO<sup>2</sup> savings of more than 10%. Well-maintained road surface, financed by toll revenues, leads to significant fuel reduction.\n- Traffic management. Urban traffic management enables the reduction of stop-and-go traffic, which can reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions by 8% on average in developed cities and 15% in emerging cities.\n- Low-emission zones. With defined zones that are only used by environmentally friendly vehicles (free of charge), greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by around 20%.\n- Demand management. Integrated solutions that combine tolling, traffic management and low-emission zones are referred to as demand management. This can reduce emissions by up to 30%.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom itself is not an energy-intensive Company. Nevertheless, climate protection is a core element of its corporate Strategy 2027, the Company's mission and vision. Kapsch TrafficCom's goal is to continuously reduce the use of resources and the emission of climate-relevant emissions associated with its business activities. Since 2021, Kapsch TrafficCom has been continuously developing its sustainability strategy, which ties its contribution to an environmentally friendly and healthier world to two ecological sustainability goals. In the 2023/24 financial year, these targets were additionally linked to further key figures.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Sustainable portfolio.<br>Increase the proportion of taxonomy-compliant products<br>to 50% by 2030                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Sustainable company.<br>Reduction of the CO2 footprint of Kapsch TrafficCom<br>by 42% by 2030 (according to ISO 14064-1:2018, Greenhouse Gas<br>Protocol and in line with the 1.5 degree pathway)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| In particular, the use of materials with a high footprint and electricity<br>consumption during operation is to be further reduced. In order to<br>make this goal measurable, Kapsch TrafficCom is currently working<br>on calculating the product carbon footprints of all relevant products<br>in the portfolio. Kapsch TrafficCom also supports its customers in<br>realizing the full savings potential of traffic emissions. This can only<br>be realized together with the customer. | This is to be achieved through savings in electricity consumption,<br>increased use of energy from renewable sources for production and<br>office locations (Scope 2) and the reduction of Scope 3 emissions.<br>The measures focus primarily on emissions resulting from the<br>purchase of materials and the use of solutions. Kapsch TrafficCom<br>is currently working on the certification of the corporate carbon<br>footprint for the base year and subsequent financial years. |\n\nDetails and the corresponding initiatives are explained in *section 2 \"Environmental information\"*.\n\nEspecially for implementation and operation projects in the tolling business, Kapsch TrafficCom often engages numerous suppliers and subcontractors from the country in which the order is placed. In this way, the Company contributes to local value creation and creates jobs.\n\nThe Code of Conduct applicable to the entire Kapsch Group (and thus also to Kapsch TrafficCom) contains the principles of conduct applicable to the management as well as to all employees. The Code can be viewed on the Kapsch TrafficCom corporate website at *https://www.kapsch.net/en/download/code-of-conduct*.\n\n# 1.3.2 Contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom wants to contribute to a healthy world. In addition to the environmental aspect, social sustainability is an equally important factor for this. An internal company analysis showed that Kapsch TrafficCom's business activities contribute to the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/6 description: The image shows a green square with the number 3 in the upper left corner. To the right of the number 3 is the text \"GESUNDHEIT UND WOHLERGEHEN\". Below the text is a white heart with a white line running through it, resembling a heartbeat.\n\n Good health and well-being. Traffic management systems are used to manage and reduce traffic. This lowers emissions (especially exhaust gases, particulate matter and noise), which has a positive impact on air quality and quality of life. The use of intelligent transportation systems can also reduce the risk of accidents in road traffic. In this way, Kapsch TrafficCom supports the United Nations' goal of reducing traffic accidents by 50% by 2030. Within the Company, a dedicated and independent care counselor is focusing on fostering mental well-being amongst the colleagues and maintaining a healthy and friendly work environment.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/8 description: The image is a red square with the number 4 in white in the upper left corner. To the right of the number 4 are the words \"HOCHWERTIGE BILDUNG\" in white. Below the number 4 is a white open book and a white pencil.\n\n Quality education. Kapsch TrafficCom AG is an apprenticeship company and offers apprenticeships as well as a trainee program for university graduates. This gives young people the opportunity to start their careers in a global company and to continue their education at the same time. In addition, the responsible annotation team has been launched five years ago. It is an initiative to enable persons with disabilities to provide value-adding services as part of a job training or employment in annotation at Kapsch.\n\nImage /page/4/Figure/10 description: The image is a red square with the number 5 in the upper left corner. To the right of the number 5 is the word \"GESCHLECHTER- GLEICHHEIT\" in white text. Below the number and text is a white symbol that appears to be a combination of the male and female gender symbols with an equals sign in the middle.\n\nGender equality. Kapsch TrafficCom has set itself the goal of employing at least 30% women in key and management positions in all geographical regions by 2028. The program KTCwomen@Kapsch promotes the global networking of motivated female employees. The WomenMentoring program aims to encourage female employees to use competencies more actively and to develop potential in a sustainable and visible manner.\n\nImage /page/4/Figure/12 description: The image is a yellow square with the number 7 in the upper left corner. To the right of the number 7 is the text \"BEZAHLBARE UND SAUBERE ENERGIE\" in black. Below the text is a white sun with a power button in the center.\n\n Affordable and clean energy. The establishment of an emissions-based toll system promotes vehicle fleet renewal and the use of lower-emission vehicles. Kapsch TrafficCom also strives to use electricity from renewable sources at its larger locations wherever possible.\n\nImage /page/4/Figure/14 description: The image is a maroon square with the number 8 in white on the upper left. To the right of the number 8 are the words \"MENSCHENWÜRDIGE ARBEIT UND WIRTSCHAFTS-WACHSTUM\" in white. Below the text is a white line graph that is trending upwards.\n\nDecent work and economic growth. Kapsch TrafficCom is an attractive employer that offers highquality jobs. The production sites in Austria and Canada meet high standards with regard to working conditions and compliance with human rights.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/0 description: The image is a square icon with an orange background. The number \"9\" is in the upper left corner, followed by the words \"INDUSTRIE, INNOVATION UND INFRASTRUKTUR\" stacked on top of each other. Below the text is a white graphic of three cubes stacked in a triangular formation.\n\n Industry, innovation and infrastructure. The toll systems implemented by Kapsch TrafficCom help to finance necessary investments in road infrastructure. Traffic management systems contribute to more efficient use of the traffic infrastructure. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom experts are active in standardization work to contribute to global interoperability and backwards compatibility of upcoming technologies.\n\nImage /page/5/Figure/2 description: The image is a square icon with an orange background. In the upper left corner is the number \"11\" in white. To the right of the number are the German words \"NACHHALTIGE STÄDTE UND GEMEINDEN\" stacked on top of each other, also in white. Below the text is a simple illustration of a city skyline with four buildings of varying heights and designs, all in white.\n\nSustainable cities and communities. Access restrictions and tolling of urban areas not only support the reduction of emissions, improving air quality and quality of life but also help protect cultural heritage. In addition, these solutions encourage the use of the public transport system. Less road traffic creates space for bike lanes and meeting zones and improves road safety.\n\nImage /page/5/Figure/4 description: The image shows a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) icon. The icon is a square with an orange background. The number \"12\" is in the upper left corner. To the right of the number is the text \"NACHHALTIGE/R KONSUM UND PRODUKTION\" in black letters. Below the text is a white infinity symbol with an arrow on one end.\n\n Responsible consumption and production. For Kapsch TrafficCom, sustainability in production is a permanent endeavor. Accordingly, the production facility in Vienna has successfully participated in the ÖkoWin environmental program for more than ten years in order to continuously make production more efficient and environmentally friendly.\n\nImage /page/5/Figure/6 description: The image is a square green icon with the number 13 in the upper left corner. To the right of the number 13 is the text \"MASSNAHMEN ZUM KLIMASCHUTZ\". Below the number and text is a white image of an eye with the earth as the pupil.\n\nClimate action. Contributing positively to climate protection is an integral part of Kapsch TrafficCom's corporate strategy. In this context, numerous measures are being implemented to put the company on course for the 1.5 degree pathway by 2030. On the other hand, the Company's products can support cities and regions in reducing their traffic emissions.\n\nImage /page/5/Figure/8 description: The image is a green square with the number 15 in white in the upper left corner. To the right of the number 15 are the words \"LEBEN AN LAND\" in white. Below the number and text is a white drawing of a tree with three birds flying above it. Below the tree are two white horizontal lines.\n\nLife on land. Road traffic is a major source of noise and air pollution (for example, from nitrogen oxides). These emissions pose significant threats to biodiversity. Kapsch TrafficCom's products and solutions can help reduce traffic emissions and thus contribute to preserving biodiversity. Studies have shown that free-flow tolling solutions can reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by up to 24% compared to traditional toll booths. In addition, Kapsch also supports the environmental organization Global Nature Fund.\n\nImage /page/5/Figure/16 description: The image is a square graphic with a blue background. On the left side of the graphic is the number \"16\" in a large, white, sans-serif font. To the right of the number is the text \"FRIEDEN, GERECHTIGKEIT UND STARKE INSTITUTIONEN\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. Below the text is an image of a white dove holding an olive branch in its beak, and below the dove is a white gavel.\n\n Peace justice and strong institutions. Kapsch TrafficCom is firmly committed to the rule of law and against corruption or bribery. A clear set of internal rules for dealing with politics, authorities and public officials helps to build and maintain effective, accountable and inclusive institutions. In those countries where Kapsch TrafficCom operates, this also contributes to improving the national corruption perception index, a recognized indicator of Transparency International based on the perception of corruption in the public sector.\n\nThe website *https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/* provides further information on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n*\"Kapsch TrafficCom is committed to the ten universal principles of the UN Global Compact, to the ILO Core Labour Standards, and to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\"* \n\nGeorg Kapsch, CEO\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn implement\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *2 Environmental information.*\n\n# 2.1 EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n## 2.1.1 Ecologically sustainable activities in accordance with EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 is intended as a framework to enable a uniform EU-wide definition of environmentally sustainable economic activities. The aim is to steer capital flows towards sustainable investments in line with the EU sustainability goals.\n\nAccordingly, Kapsch TrafficCom has to include in its non-financial report \"how and to what extent the undertaking's activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under Articles 3 and 9 of this Regulation.\" The following environmental objectives are stated:\n\n- climate change mitigation,\n- climate change adaptation,\n- the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\n- the transition to a circular economy,\n- pollution prevention and control, and\n- the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nAn economic activity shall be considered sustainable if it\n\n- a) contributes significantly to at least one of the six environmental objectives listed,\n- b) does not significantly harm the other environmental objectives listed,\n- c) is carried out in compliance with minimum social and governance criteria, and\n- d) meets the technical screening criteria.\n\nThe technical screening criteria are published in delegated regulations of the European Commission:\n\n- the criteria for climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation in the delegated regulations 2021/2139 and 2023/2485;\n- the criteria for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems in the delegated regulation 2023/2486.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is obliged to disclose the share of revenues, capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenditures (OpEx) that is taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned:\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible share includes all potentially environmentally sustainable economic activities covered by the taxonomy.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned share includes only those economic activities that also meet the technical screening criteria and thus qualify as an indeed environmentally sustainable share in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n# 2.1.2 Goals of the taxonomy and Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom implements and operates traffic solutions for sustainable mobility. The innovative solutions in the application areas of tolling, toll services, traffic management and demand management contribute to sustainable mobility, a healthier world without congestion.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nTherefore, Kapsch TrafficCom believes that its tolling and traffic management business segments serve the objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation, in particular climate change mitigation through the promotion of clean or climate-neutral mobility, as well as prevention and mitigation of pollution through the reduction of pollutant emissions from road traffic into the air.\n\nTolling and traffic management are necessary tools to address a particularly large and complex source of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution: mobility. However, the delegated regulations only identify changes in the vehicle fleet, not in mobility behavior. They also do not take into account the reduction of pollution through tolling and traffic management systems.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom participates directly and through industry associations in the political dialogue with the aim that the technical screening criteria in the area of road transport are more clearly specified.\n\n# 2.1.3 Identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities.\n\nIn this Report on the financial year 2023/24, the required disclosures include all environmental objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation in the economic activities already defined, while in the previous year only the two environmental objectives that were already specified at that time were included.\n\nOn October 20, 2023, the European Commission published the Commission Notice C/2023/267 with answers on the interpretation and application of certain provisions (FAQ; Frequently Asked Questions) of the delegated regulation 2021/2139 on the contribution to climate change mitigation and adaption in the Official Journal of the European Commission. In this clarification, the European Commission states under which activities of the delegated regulation tolling and traffic management systems fall in its view: namely under 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies\" and 6.15 \"Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport\".\n\nAccordingly, Kapsch TrafficCom analyzed its business activities with respect to taxonomy eligibility. The following explanations provide an overview of the business activities, products and services as well as their classification based on this analysis:\n\n#### Kapsch TrafficCom services.\n\nIn classifying a service, Kapsch TrafficCom follows the definition in ISO 9000: \"output of an organization with at least one activity necessarily performed between the organization and the customer; the dominant elements of a service are generally intangible\". Kapsch TrafficCom's services include implementation and operation of tolling systems, traffic management, demand management and public transportation.\n\nIn accordance with the Commission Notice C/2023/267 of the European Commission, Kapsch TrafficCom's services contribute to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation and are taxonomy-eligible under the economic activity 6.15 \"Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport\". These services integrate or use products of Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\nFurthermore, the services also contribute to the environmental objective circular economy and are taxonomy-eligible under economic activity 4.1 \"Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions\".\n\n| Solutions, taxonomy-eligible<br>(environmental objectives climate change mitigation, 6.15; circular economy, 4.1) | eligible | aligned |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Tolling                                                                                                           | X        |         |\n| Traffic management                                                                                                | X        |         |\n| Demand management                                                                                                 | X        |         |\n| Public transportation                                                                                             | X        |         |\n\nTolling includes the development of tolling systems of all types, including software and hardware products listed under products, and may include urban access systems, various types of highway tolling systems, or parts thereof.\n\nTraffic management includes the development of traffic management systems for various environments, from roads and highways to urban areas or individual infrastructure facilities such as bridges and tunnels, and may include Orchestrated Connected Corridors (OCC) and traffic data analysis.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nDemand management optimizes both traffic volume and traffic flow and includes both traffic management-related demand management and tolling-related demand management.\n\nPublic transport refers to a public transportation app, including ticketing.\n\n### Kapsch TrafficCom products.\n\nIn classifying a product, Kapsch TrafficCom follows the definition in ISO 9000: \"output of an organization that can be produced without any transaction taking place between the organization and the customer\". One of the key criteria of products is that they are tangible. Kapsch TrafficCom's products are hardware, e.g. on-board units or transceivers. Software is considered an intangible product.\n\nIn accordance with the Commission Notice C/2023/267 of the European Commission, hardware of Kapsch TrafficCom contributes to the environmental objective climate change mitigation and is taxonomy-eligible under the economic activity 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies\". Furthermore, the products also contribute to the environmental objective circular economy and are taxonomy-eligible under the economic activities 1.2 \"Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment\" and 4.1 \"Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions\". For the sake of clarity, only product groups are listed in the table below; those products that are also taxonomy-aligned are highlighted within these groups.\n\n| Product groups, taxonomy-eligible<br>(environmental objectives climate change mitigation, 3.6; circular economy, 1.2 and 4.1) | eligible | aligned<br>under climate<br>change mitigation,<br>3.6 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| 5.8GHz CEN DSRC Transceivers                                                                                                  | X        |                                                       |\n| 5.8GHz CEN DSRC On-board Units                                                                                                | X        |                                                       |\n| TRP-4010 5.8GHz DSRC Transponder                                                                                              | X        | X                                                     |\n| 5.8GHz CEN DSRC Handheld and Desktop Readers                                                                                  | X        |                                                       |\n| GNSS & 5.8GHz CEN DSRC On-board Units                                                                                         | X        |                                                       |\n| OBU-5310 GNSS/5.8 CEN/UNI DSRC On-board Units                                                                                 | X        | X                                                     |\n| 915MHz Multi-Protocol Readers (North America)                                                                                 | X        |                                                       |\n| 915MHz Transponders -

As road safety is not yet covered by the delegated regulations, these devices are not taxonomy-eligible.\n\n#### Capital and operating expenditures: Corporate logistics.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's vehicle fleet consists of Company-owned and leased vehicles.\n\n| Economic activities, taxonomy-eligible (environmental objective climate change<br>mitigation; 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles) | eligible | aligned |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Vehicle fleet                                                                                                                                                      | X        | X       |\n| Economic activities, taxonomy-eligible (environmental objective climate change<br>mitigation; 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings)                          | eligible | aligned |\n| Buildings (rent)                                                                                                                                                   | X        | X       |\n\n#### 2.1.4 Identification of taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\n\nAlthough almost all of Kapsch TrafficCom's business is taxonomy-eligible, as described above, the tolling and traffic management systems (services or solutions) in their current form do not meet the criteria for a significant contribution to climate change mitigation as set out under 6.15 \"Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport\" nor do they meet the criteria for a significant contribution to circular economy as set out under 4.1 \"Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions\". They are therefore not considered taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe same applies to the components business and the products of Kapsch TrafficCom with regard to the environmental objective circular economy under 1.2 \"Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment\" and 4.1 \"Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions\". Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom analyzed its components business for alignment with the technical screening criteria listed under 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies\".\n\nTo meet the screening criteria, the product was required to demonstrate significant life cycle GHG savings compared to its best performing alternative on the market. In addition, physical climate risks, compliance with the REACH Regulation 1907/2006, RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU and screening for other hazardous substances, as well as environmental impact assessments were analyzed to verify any potential impact on other environmental objectives, details of which can be found in *section 2.3 \"Pollution\"*. Finally, compliance with the minimum requirements specified in Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 was verified.\n\nThe analysis and preparation were carried out in close cooperation between Product Management, Supply Chain Management, the HSSEQ (Health, Safety, Security, Environment & Quality) and Environmental Sustainability departments, and the Corporate Expert EU Affairs. The Human Resources department, the Compliance Officer, the Data Protection Officer, the Chief Security Advisor and the Head of Taxes and Transfer Pricing were also involved, in particular to review the minimum protection. External experts were further consulted to review the reasoning and analysis.\n\nAs in the previous year, the required information was provided for two components: the TRP-4010 and OBU-5310 on-board units, for both of which carbon footprints and detailed financial data were available and which are used in markets clearly defined by the EU.\n\nThe TRP-4010 on-board unit is used for toll collection for passenger vehicles and on some road networks for heavygoods vehicles, it uses Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) – radio communication via \"microwave\" (in accordance with CEN DSRC, 5.8GHz). The OBU-5310 on-board unit uses Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to locate vehicles via satellite.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe carbon footprint of both on-board units was determined in accordance with ISO 14067:2018 (Carbon footprint of products – requirements and guidelines for quantification). They are manufactured in Kapsch TrafficCom's production facility in Austria and from an external producer in Sweden, which are certified in accordance with ISO 14001. At the facility in Austria, the carbon footprint is also analyzed and reduced annually in accordance with the OekoWin program. Both are, according to the analysis – and confirmed by the independent TÜV Austria – the best performing on-board units for their respective markets in terms of greenhouse gas emission savings over the entire life cycle. In this way, the two on-board units make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation, and they do not compromise any of the other environmental objectives set out in the Taxonomy Regulation. Including by complying with the REACH Regulation 1907/2006 and the RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU.\n\nRegarding the minimum protection in terms of social and governance criteria, Kapsch TrafficCom, as described in detail in this Report, complies with the required OECD guidelines and basic principles through compliance with local legislation as well as through its own initiatives.\n\nThus, the business with the two on-board units TRP-4010 and OBU-5310 complies with the criteria for the environmental goal climate change mitigation specified in section 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies\" and is taxonomy-aligned\n\nAs only the environmental goal climate change mitigation is addressed for the time being, any double counting in the allocation was excluded.\n\n# 2.1.5 Key figures.\n\n### Revenues.\n\nThe revenues in the denominator correspond to total revenues in accordance with IFRS as reported in the *Financial Statements, \"Consolidated statement of comprehensive income\"* and described in the *Management Report, chapter 1.2 \"Financial and non-financial performance indicators\"*.\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible part of revenues includes all revenues with the exception of revenues from the sale of equipment used to monitor road safety and enforce commercial vehicles, as road safety is not yet covered by the delegated regulation 2021/2139.\n\nRevenues in the numerator include revenues from the components business with the two on-board units TRP-4010 and OBU-5310. This activity is included in the definition area 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies\".\n\n# CapEx (capital expenditure).\n\nCapital expenditures within the scope of the Taxonomy Regulation comprise all additions to intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and additions to property, plant and equipment including rights of use from leases as well as additions from acquisitions ( *Financial Statements, note 12 \"Property, plant and equipment\" and Note 13 \"Intangible assets\"*) and thus form the capital expenditures in the denominator.\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible portion of capital expenditures includes all additions to \"land and buildings\" in which Kapsch TrafficCom Group operates (activity 7.7) and the vehicle fleet, which includes both Company-owned and leased vehicles (activity 6.5).\n\nThe capital expenditures in the numerator (taxonomy-aligned CapEx) were determined using a revenue key based on the taxonomy-aligned revenues.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n## OpEx (operating expenditures).\n\nIn accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation, operating expenditures in the denominator include direct, non-capitalized costs incurred to maintain the functionality of fixed assets (mainly maintenance expenses, see *Financial Statements, note 7 \"Other operating expenses\"*) and research and development costs that are not capitalized and are therefore recognized as an expense ( *Financial Statements, note 13.3 \"Capitalized development costs\"*).\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible portion of OpEx includes operating expenses that ensure the functionality of fixed assets and mainly comprise maintenance expenses ( *Financial Statements, note 7 \"Other operating expenses\"*).\n\nThe operating expenditures in the numerator (taxonomy-aligned OpEx) were determined using a revenue key based on the taxonomy-aligned revenues.\n\nThe following breakdown results from the calculations (based on the values of the Kapsch TrafficCom Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS):\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/5 description: The image contains three bar charts comparing Revenues, CapEx, and OpEx in EUR million (in %). The Revenues chart shows EUR 538.8 million (100%), EUR 536.7 million (99.6%), and EUR 31.4 million (5.8%). The CapEx chart shows EUR 13.3 million (100%), EUR 10.1 million (75.9%), and EUR 0.8 million (5.7%). The OpEx chart shows EUR 83.9 million (100%), EUR 2.6 million (3.1%), and EUR 0.2 million (0.3%).\n\n Total Taxonomy-eligible

change.\n\n## 2.2.1 Organization and strategy.\n\nAs mentioned above, around 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by road traffic. Kapsch Traffic-Com offers solutions consisting of hardware, software and services that make road traffic more efficient, safer, more reliable and more comfortable as well as reduce environmental pollution. The focus of the European Green Deal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions therefore offers growth opportunities for Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\nIn addition to reducing traffic emissions, Kapsch TrafficCom strives to ensure that the production and operation of its products and solutions require as little material and electricity as possible. At the same time, the Company is working to use renewable resources wherever possible. Details on this are described in *section 1.3.1 \"Sustainable business model\"*.\n\n### 2.2.2 Management of impacts, risks and opportunities.\n\nA complete overview of the material matters and the corresponding concepts of Kapsch TrafficCom can be found in *section 1.3.5 \"Material impacts, risks and opportunities\"*. Many of these concepts and measures are cross-thematic, which is why they are described collectively in *section 1.4.2 \"Sustainability program\"*. Some initiatives are highlighted here as examples:\n\nGreen Gantry. The Green Gantry made of wood is an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional steel toll gantries. The carbon footprint of wood is up to twenty times lower than that of steel.\n\nOn-board Units. The TRP-4010 and OBU5310 on-board units currently have the lowest carbon footprint of all comparable devices available on the market. Further information on this can be found in *section 2.1.4 \"Identification of taxonomy-aligned economic activities\"*.\n\nDeep Learning Versatile Platform. The Deep Learning Versatile Platform can translate visual input into digital data. This enables complex traffic monitoring to improve traffic safety and traffic flow. By choosing a cloud solution, up to 25% CO2e emissions can be avoided.\n\nGeo Location Platform. The Geo Location Platform enables satellite-based toll collection and location-based business applications for public authorities and toll or fleet service providers. It is likewise available in the cloud as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution. According to a Microsoft study, an Azure cloud-based deployment can avoid 72% to 98% of CO2e emissions compared to an on-premise solution.\n\nManufacturing sites. The aim is to use electricity as efficiently as possible. Processes are optimized and new machines are purchased as required for this purpose. The energy efficiency of machines is taken into account when purchasing new equipment. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom uses as much energy as possible from renewable sources in production. No process water is required for production. Water is only needed for kitchens and sanitary facilities.\n\nPackaging. For packaging, Kapsch TrafficCom uses recyclable packaging wherever possible or materials that are as environmentally friendly as possible and have a low carbon footprint; an innovation project is currently supporting this approach.\n\nReduction of business travel. There is no substitute for face-to-face meetings. Nevertheless, in many cases the possibilities offered by communication technologies can help to avoid business trips. Kapsch TrafficCom has invested in video conferencing systems and uses digital collaboration systems such as Microsoft Teams and Webex worldwide. In the two financial years 2020/21 and 2021/22, travel decreased significantly due to restrictions associated with COVID-19.\n\nRaising employee awareness of climate and environmental protection issues. Employees receive training on environmental management as soon as they join the Company. As part of its internal communications, Kapsch TrafficCom has been providing environmental tips for many years, for example on potential savings in resource consumption.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nTransport. In general, transportation by ship and truck is preferred to air transport. If quality and economy are comparable, local suppliers are preferred in order to minimize transport routes. In this context, there have been increasing initiatives for back-sourcing from the Asian region in recent years.\n\n# 2.2.3 Key figures and targets.\n\nThe calculation of the corporate carbon footprint for Kapsch TrafficCom in accordance with ISO 14064:2018 is currently in preparation. Data already available is shown in the following table. Unless otherwise stated, the base year is financial year 2019/20 as the last financial year unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Key categories not yet included in this report (category 1 \"Purchased goods and services\" and category 11 \"Use of sold products\") will be reported from the next financial year.\n\n|                                                                       | Values<br>base year | 2022/23 | 2023/24 | Reduction<br>compared to<br>the base year<br>in percent | Targets                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Scope 1: Direct emissions [t CO2e]                                    | 3,509               | 2,731   | 2,765   | -21%                                                    | Do not increase                        |\n| Scope 2: Purchased energy [t CO2e]                                    | 12,040              | 11,635  | 12,749  | 6%                                                      | Actively reduce                        |\n| Energy consumption [MWh]                                              | 18,878              | 18,169  | 19,017  | 1%                                                      | Actively reduce                        |\n| Scope 3: Category 2 – Capital goods [t CO2e]                          | 19,042              | 12,923  | 5,196   | -73%                                                    | Do not increase                        |\n| Scope 3: Category 3 –<br>Fuel- and energy-related activities [t CO2e] | 2,889               | 2,765   | 2,995   | 4%                                                      | Do not increase                        |\n| Scope 3: Category 5 –<br>Waste generated in operations [t CO2e]       | 157                 | 76      | 134     | -15%                                                    | Actively reduce                        |\n| Scope 3: Category 6 – Business travel [t CO2e]                        | 2,856               | 1,064   | 1,633   | -43%                                                    | Actively reduce                        |\n| Number of airline tickets [in % of base year]                         | 100%                | 34%     | 51%     | -49%                                                    | Maintain below 50%<br>of the base year |\n| Scope 3: Category 7 – Employee commuting [t CO2e]                     | 5,293               | 2,515   | 2,469   | -53%                                                    | Actively reduce                        |\n\nScope 1. The Company's most relevant source of emissions for Scope 1 is the vehicle fleet. Since the financial year 2021/22, its CO<sup>2</sup> emissions have been recorded and reported at all sites with at least 5 employees or more than 200 m² of space. This year is therefore used as the base year.\n\nThe target for 2030 is not to increase Scope 1 emissions. Compared to the base year, 21% of Scope 1 emissions have been saved to date.\n\nScope 2. Since the financial year 2021/22, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from energy consumption, heating and cooling have been recorded and reported at all sites with at least 5 employees or more than 200 m² of space (including production), so this year is used as the base year. The sites comprise 99.4% of the total workforce. The data quality of the data collected to date has fluctuated greatly in the past; the Company is working to continuously improve data quality. The increase in emissions and consumption is also attributed to the fact that offices were used more frequently again after the end of the COVID restrictions. Due to a change in the methodology for data collection, there was an increase of 6% compared to the base year.\n\nThe target for 2030 remains to actively reduce Scope 2 emissions.\n\nScope 3. All other indirect emissions are recorded in Scope 3 and reported separately by category. In addition to categories 1 \"Purchased goods and services\" and 11 \"Use of sold products\", which are not yet reported, categories 6 \"Business travel\" and 7 \"Employee commuting\" have significant emission values. For CO<sup>2</sup> emissions in categories 3 and 5, the first data collection year 2021/22 is the base year. One target is to keep the number of flights in category 6 below 50% of the base year. The target was met in the financial year 2022/23 with a value of 34% and slightly exceeded in the financial year 2023/24 with 51%.\n\n",

He is wearing a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark blue tie with a subtle pattern. The background is a plain white, which puts the focus entirely on the man. He has a slight smile and is looking directly at the camera.\n\nIn financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom reached key milestones, giving us a solid base for the future. On the one hand, our financial and net assets position as well as the results of operations have improved significantly compared to the previous year; on the other hand, we have achieved significant project progress and were awarded new contracts, which will increasingly be reflected in revenue, earnings and liquidity. We are well on track, however our operating result is still unsatisfactory and we still have some way to go. Above all,\n\nwe need to increase project margins.\n\n*Financial year 2023/24: Key milestones achieved – solid basis for the future.* \n\n## Milestones.\n\nThe most significant event was undoubtedly the settlement agreement reached in the arbitration proceedings between our joint venture auto-Ticket and the Federal Republic of Germany in July 2023. This led to a net cash inflow totaling EUR 109 million in the reporting period, which is reflected in EBIT with EUR 79 million and enabled the repayment of financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 88 million – ultimately significantly more than the cash inflow of at least EUR 80 million announced in July.\n\nIn addition, we reached an agreement with our bank partners in May 2023 to restructure our financing. One component of this agreement was the capital increase that we conducted in November. Another component is the waiver of dividend distributions during the contract term, which was extended to the end of March 2026 a few weeks ago.\n\nOur project successes in the past financial year were also impressive. We were able to reach several milestones in existing projects, which will lead to good incoming payments. In addition, order intake increased by 53% to EUR 734 million compared to the previous year. The order backlog at the end of the year amounted to EUR 1.4 billion, which is 15% more than in the previous year and corresponds to 2.5 times revenue. Naturally, this new business is not yet reflected in revenue for the 2023/24 financial year. Furthermore, the operation of the tolling system in the Gauteng province in South Africa was extended again by one month. We expect a prolongation until mid-November 2024 on a reduced scope.\n\nOur key financial indicators have improved significantly on the basis of these developments.\n\n## Financial development.\n\nAt EUR 539 million, net revenues were slightly below the previous year, but we were able to achieve a slight increase in invoiced sales of EUR 558 million compared to the previous year. A customer credit note, deferred revenues from processed orders in the past and margin value adjustments led to the reported reduction.\n\n*Financial and net assets position as well as results of operations have improved significantly.* \n\nIn terms of costs, the progress of our restructuring is clearly visible. Only the cost of materials continued to rise due to further price increases, ongoing delivery difficulties and enormous inflation.\n\nThe EBIT of EUR 70 million is significantly higher than the previous year, not only but mainly due to one-time effects. The settlement agreement in Germany with EUR 79 million and the reversal of a value adjustment on receivables with EUR 5 million had a positive effect. Negative one-time effects resulted from the further reduction in margins by a total of EUR 25 million for projects to be completed, primarily in North America. After analyzing the projects, we have now taken targeted precautions that allow us to assume today that we will not have to report any further negative one-time effects in this regard. Furthermore, restructuring costs of around EUR 3 million were recorded. Adjusted for these one-time effects, the EBIT of EUR 15 million was significantly higher than in the previous year (EUR 5 million).\n\nThe financial result declined to EUR -30 million in the financial year 2023/24, primarily reflecting the one-time costs in connection with the restructuring of financing and higher interest rates.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 62 million and free cash flow to a considerable EUR 106 million, mainly due to the settlement agreement in Germany and the sale of an investment in the USA.\n\nThe developments described above led to a significant improvement in our key financial indicators: Equity increased by EUR 32 million to EUR 83 million, raising the equity ratio to 19% after 11% in the previous year. Net debt decreased by EUR 80 million to EUR 106 million, primarily as a result of lower financial liabilities, which include lease liabilities of EUR 36 million. The gearing was thus reduced to 127%.\n\n## Strategic progress.\n\nWe are pleased with the new orders we have been awarded, not only because of their size, but also with regard to our strategy. Four years ago, we defined Strategy 2027 based on the market development we expected. We are increasingly seeing this change in new orders, which include toll services and connected vehicles.\n\nWith a view to building on our technology and market lead and shaping the future with our portfolio, we are currently conducting a comprehensive review of Strategy 2027. As a first step, we sold one investment that was not part of our strategic core business in March and one in April 2024. This also brought and continues to bring us further cash inflows.\n\nAdvancement to us also means further refining our \"Green Vision\", which is based on sustainable products and a sustainable company. During the reporting period, we analyzed the potential impact of our business activities on people and the environment along our entire value chain, as well as the associated financial risks and opportunities. With the involvement of our stakeholders, we have thus identified the material sustainability matters for Kapsch TrafficCom and can now address these in a focused manner.\n\n## Outlook.\n\nIn the financial year 2024/25, we will complete our strategy review and further expand our sustainability manage-\n\nment with additional concepts and key figures. In financial terms, we expect revenue growth to exceed market growth in the current financial year. The operating result (EBIT) should show a slight improvement *Revenue growth over market growth and* compared to the result adjusted for one-time effects of EUR 15 million, whereby positive one-time effects are also possible again.\n\n*Outlook 2024/25: slight improvement in earnings (EBIT).*\n\nI would like to thank our employees, whose expertise, innovation, motivation and day-to-day commitment make Kapsch TrafficCom the pioneer for sustainable mobility that we are. I would also like to thank our long-term investors for their trust and hope that they will continue to support us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Capital markets.*\n\nKapsch TrafficCom AG has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange in the prime market segment since June 26, 2007. The shares are included in Austrian indices, as well as the sustainability index VÖNIX.\n\n## Investor Relations activities in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nIn addition to regular and occasion-related publications, Kapsch TrafficCom's investor relations team is available for investor inquiries and actively takes opportunities to intensify contact with capital market participants. In the reporting period, this included participation in six investor conferences and the execution of a roadshow as well as numerous direct meetings, telephone calls and e-mails.\n\n## Capital increase.\n\nAt the end of May 2023, Kapsch TrafficCom agreed on a financing restructuring with its major financial creditors, which puts the financing structure on a longer-term basis. In accordance with this agreement, Kapsch TrafficCom AG conducted a capital increase of 10% of the existing share capital in November 2023, which was successfully placed with the pro rata participation of the main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH. The 1,300,000 new shares have been traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange since November 24, 2023, increasing the number of shares to 14,300,000.\n\n## Share price development.\n\nThe price of the Kapsch TrafficCom share continuously declined in financial year 2023/24, starting from a closing price of EUR 12.50 on March 31, 2023. Two strong price movements were notable in the reporting period: The agreement to restructure the financing was followed by a brief drop to EUR 10.00 at the beginning of June, from which the share price quickly recovered. On July 5, 2023, the day of the settlement agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany, an equally brief upward movement enabled the share price to reach its high for the reporting period (intraday) of EUR 13.65. On March 28, 2024, the share closed at EUR 8.50, 32.0% lower than a year earlier. The benchmark index ATX Prime recorded an increase of 9.7% in the reporting period.\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/8 description: This line graph compares the performance of KTC and ATX Prime from April 2023 to March 2024.

The ATX Prime line starts at approximately 100 in April 2023, fluctuates around 98 in May and June 2023, rises to around 100 in July 2023, and remains relatively stable around 98 until December 2023. It then increases to around 105 in January 2024 and remains stable until March 2024.\n\n## Development of Kapsch TrafficCom shares and ATX Prime in the financial year 2023/24.\n\n## Stock data.\n\n| in EUR, unless otherwise stated            | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Earnings per share                         | -1.91   | 1.72    |\n| High (intraday)                            | 14.40   | 13.65   |\n| Low (intraday)                             | 10.50   | 8.14    |\n| Closing price on March 31                  | 12.50   | 8.50    |\n| Share performance                          | -12.6%  | -32.0%  |\n| Ø trading volume (shares, double counting) | 8,491   | 17,690  |\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Analysts.\n\nIn the reporting period, the following financial institutions published reports on the Kapsch TrafficCom share (in alphabetical order):\n\n- Erste Group Bank\n- ODDO BHF/Frankfurt Main Research (FMR)\n- Raiffeisen Bank International\n\n## Dividend.\n\nIn accordance with the financing restructuring agreement, the Executive Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting 2024 that no dividend be distributed for the financial year 2023/24 and to carry forward the retained earnings to new account. Kapsch TrafficCom aims to resume dividend payments as soon as it is economically justifiable and also permissible from the Company's perspective and ideally to return to the dividend policy suspended in 2020. The core of this policy was the payment of a minimum dividend of either EUR 1.00 per share or one third of consolidated earnings per share, whichever was higher.\n\n## Shareholder structure.\n\nAt the end of the financial year 2023/24, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, as the core shareholder, held 63.3% of the of the shares, as in the previous year. As part of financing agreements in January and May 2023, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH pledged all of its shares in favor of the financing banks. This also results in restrictions customary in the market with respect to the transfer of the shares and a corresponding requirement for the consent of the banks.\n\nThe free float amounted to 36.7%, with around 16.7% held by institutional investors, mainly from continental Europe (including Austria), and around 18.2% by retail investors, according to information from a shareholder identification as of March 31, 2024.\n\nImage /page/10/Figure/10 description: The image shows two pie charts that describe the shareholder structure and institutional investors by region.

In the eurozone in particular, however, persistently high energy prices and interest rates as well as weak household consumption burdened the economy. Key interest rates were initially raised further and then remained constant over the course of 2023. Inflation rates therefore stabilized at a high level and eventually declined again significantly.\n\n## Global supply chain situation.\n\nThe global supply chain situation normalized over the course of 2023 after the pandemic-related bottlenecks. Both availability and delivery times improved in the second half of 2023. However, there were disruptions on two important shipping routes in the first few months of 2024: Conflicts in the Red Sea led to a significant decline in trade via the Suez Canal, and traffic slowed down in the Panama Canal due to water shortages caused by the severe drought. The effects were reflected in increased transport times and costs, although the duration and extent of the disruptions could not yet be estimated at the end of the financial year.\n\n## Interest rates.\n\nBoth the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (FED) in the USA continued the gradual increase in key interest rates that began in 2022 in the first months of the financial year. In Europe, the interest rate for main refinancing operations and the interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were raised from 3.50%, 3.75% and 3.00% respectively in March 2023 to 4.50%, 4.75% and 4.00% respectively by September 2023. The FED also raised interest rates in two further steps from 4.75% to 5.00% in March 2023 to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% from July 2023. Interest rates then remained constant and were recently expected to be followed by interest rate cuts.\n\n## Inflation.\n\nThe measures taken by central banks to control the enormous inflation took effect in the 2023/24 financial year, with inflation stabilizing at the beginning of 2023 and falling significantly in the following months.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global inflation rate averaged 6.8% in 2023 after 8.7% in the previous year. In Austria, it remained higher at 7.7% in 2023 (previous year: 8.6%) and was also significantly higher than the inflation rate in the eurozone of 5.4% (previous year: 8.4%). According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), the development in the first quarter of 2024 suggests a further slowdown in inflation in Austria. Inflation plays a significant role for Kapsch TrafficCom, particularly in connection with personnel costs.\n\nImage /page/11/Figure/15 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Inflation 2022-2024. (in %)\". The x-axis represents different regions: World, USA, Emerging markets, Euro area, and Austria. The y-axis represents the inflation rate. For the \"World\" region, the inflation rates are 8.7 in 2022, 6.8 in 2023, and 5.9 in 2024. For the \"USA\" region, the inflation rates are 8.0 in 2022, 4.1 in 2023, and 2.9 in 2024. For the \"Emerging markets\" region, the inflation rates are 9.8 in 2022, 8.3 in 2023, and 8.3 in 2024. For the \"Euro area\" region, the inflation rates are 8.4 in 2022, 5.4 in 2023, and 2.4 in 2024. For the \"Austria\" region, the inflation rates are 8.6 in 2022, 7.7 in 2023, and 3.9 in 2024.

The influence of the currency on the business development results from the internationality of the Group with a large number of projects as well as locations in the USA and other countries where invoicing is done in USD. In the financial year 2023/24, the Euro (EUR) trended sideways within a narrow range against the US dollar. The average for the reporting period was EUR/USD 1.08 (previous year: 1.04) with a maximum of 1.13 on July 18, 2023 and a minimum of 1.05 on October 3, 2023.\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/2 description: The image is a line graph titled \"EUR-USD development.\" The x-axis represents months from April 2023 to March 2024, and the y-axis represents values from 0.95 to 1.15. The line on the graph shows the EUR-USD development over time. The source is listed as European Central Bank, April 2024.\n\n#### Global economic performance.\n\nThe IMF estimates a global GDP growth rate of 3.2% for 2023 (previous year: 3.5%). This growth was primarily driven by a strong second half of the year in the USA and in major\n\nemerging and developing countries, which recovered quickly from the effects of the COVID pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n*Global economic performance 2023: +3.2%*\n\nAccordingly, GDP growth in both the USA (2.5%) and the emerging and developing countries (4.3%) exceeded forecasts. In the eurozone, however, the gross domestic product nearly stagnated at 0.4%. This is due to weak household consumption, persistently high energy prices and weaker manufacturing and corporate investment as a result of high interest rates.\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/8 description: This bar chart shows the GDP growth from 2022 to 2024. The y-axis is labeled '(in %)' and ranges from -1 to 5. The x-axis shows the following categories: World, USA, Emerging markets, Euro area, and Austria. For the 'World' category, the GDP growth is 3.5 in 2022, 3.2 in 2023, and 3.2 in 2024. For the 'USA' category, the GDP growth is 1.9 in 2022, 2.5 in 2023, and 2.7 in 2024. For the 'Emerging markets' category, the GDP growth is 4.1 in 2022, 4.3 in 2023, and 4.2 in 2024. For the 'Euro area' category, the GDP growth is 3.4 in 2022, 0.4 in 2023, and 0.8 in 2024. For the 'Austria' category, the GDP growth is 4.8 in 2022, -0.7 in 2023, and 0.4 in 2024. The source is listed as IMF World Economic Outlook Database, April 2024.\n\n## GDP growth 2022–2024.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Austria.\n\nHigh interest rates and high inflation rates characterized the Austrian economy in the financial year 2023/24. The gross domestic product showed a decline of 0.7% in 2023 after an increase of 4.8% in the previous year. According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), this was primarily due to the low demand for capital goods in connection with the high interest rates. *BIP in Austria 2023: -0.7%*\n\nExports fell by 0.2%, mainly due to significantly lower exports of services. Investments declined by 2.4%; the construction industry in particular recorded a collapse in demand. The high inflation rate and the resulting lower real disposable income as well as high energy prices also reduced household consumption by 0.3%.\n\nImage /page/13/Figure/3 description: This line graph, titled \"Export, investment & consumption growth in Austria 2021-2024. (in %)\", shows the growth of exports, investments, and consumption in Austria from 2021 to 2024. The y-axis ranges from -15 to 15. The x-axis shows the years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 (forecast). The export growth starts at approximately 9% in 2021, increases to approximately 11% in 2022, drops to approximately 0% in 2023, and remains at approximately 0% in 2024. The consumption growth starts at approximately 6% in 2021, decreases to approximately 6% in 2022, drops to approximately 0% in 2023, and remains at approximately 1% in 2024. The investment growth starts at approximately 0% in 2021, decreases to approximately -1% in 2022, drops to approximately -2% in 2023, and remains at approximately -2% in 2024.

The Paris Agreement is an important global climate protection agreement and was adopted in December 2015 at the Paris Climate Change Conference. The European Commission (as part of the \"European Green Deal\") and the USA are pursuing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Road traffic plays a significant role here, as it is responsible for a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas emissions. Both traffic management and tolling solutions are recognized tools for influencing traffic and means of transportation.\n\nNeed for traffic infrastructure and its maintenance. Studies expect not only an increase in the global population, but also more private vehicles on the roads. As the volume of vehicles grows, it will be inevitably necessary to increase investments in road construction and maintenance. This is usually extremely expensive. At the same time, the increasing number of hybrid or electric vehicles is having a negative impact on mineral oil tax revenues. This means that an increase in the need for alternative financing models, including tolling solutions, can be assumed.\n\nUrbanization. The percentage of people living in cities is increasing. Whereas in the year 1800 only 2% of the world's population was urban, in 2007 for the first time more than half of the world's population lived in cities. Based on a current figure of around 56%, the United Nations forecasts that the urban population will account for more than 60 % of the population in 2030 and around 68% in 2050. At the same time, the world's population will rise from around 7.9 billion people today to 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050. It is precisely in urban areas that private and professional mobility gives rise to major challenges. After all, houses cannot be moved at will to expand roads or even rebuild them. Furthermore, as the urban population grows, there will be an increase in the volume of business within a city as well as with business partners outside of the city. Since products must be delivered, a higher urban population tends to bring about an increase in the volume of transportation.\n\nNew means of transportation and services. Analysts expect that urban passenger traffic will more than double by 2050. Autonomous vehicles could intensify this trend. The existing road infrastructure will not be able to meet these needs. This results in two consequences: the increased use of public transport and shared means of transportation, and – if no appropriate countermeasures are taken – more extensive congestion. In addition, the trend toward electric vehicles will continue. While this reduces immediate CO₂ emissions, the particulate matter problem will remain.\n\nConnected vehicles. Technological advances in the exchange of information between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle, V2V), between vehicles and traffic infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure, V2I), and in the area of autonomous driving are rapid. Already today, these developments are enabling increasingly better and more extensive applications for better driving comfort and greater driving safety. In addition, the new communication channels and the enormous volumes of data enable substantial improvements in traffic management.\n\nData and artificial intelligence. Open data and open interfaces enable more extensive and higher-performing applications. Connected vehicles are an important data source. Machine learning and artificial intelligence create new opportunities for data analysis, simulation, forecasting, and management.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nData security. Due to the use of large amounts of data, the protection of personal data and how it is handled is becoming increasingly important.\n\nFundamental changes in the business environment of Kapsch TrafficCom. The aforementioned market drivers have already sparked the following trends:\n\n- While the ITS industry relied heavily on hardware in the past, it is increasingly shifting towards software platforms. More and more, module solutions and cloud applications are playing a role.\n- Offered services (anything-as-a-service) put the focus on the user and are integrated into platforms and devices preferred by them.\n- Payment solutions are integrated into vehicle technology, and new payment technologies will enter the market.\n- Intelligent traffic infrastructure can be achieved with more affordable sensors, modules, and connection technologies. Specific domain knowledge and the need for customer-specific solutions will remain significant, however.\n- New solutions can be rolled out on a global scale.\n\n#### 1.1.3 Business performance 2023/24.\n\nIn financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom reached key milestones that placed the company back on a solid base for the future: In May 2023, a financing restructuring was agreed with the major financial creditors, which led to a longer-term financing structure and has since been extended until March 2026. In July, a settlement agreement was reached in the arbitration proceedings between the autoTicket joint venture and the Federal Republic of Germany conducted due to the termination of the operations contract for the collection of the passenger car toll. This led to a significant improvement in the financial and asset position. The earnings also improved as a result.\n\nAlthough net revenues were slightly below the previous year's figure, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to achieve an increase in invoiced revenues compared to the previous year and numerous project successes, which indicate a future increase in revenues and earnings.\n\nProject successes. The operation projects continued to perform well and several implementation projects were transitioned to the operation phase. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to win several new projects in the reporting period. Of particular strategic importance are those that point the path to the future of roads with tolling services and connected vehicles.\n\nThe company was awarded two interconnected contracts in the tolling segment in Switzerland: firstly, the implementation of the collection system for the performance-based heavy vehicle fee (after the balance sheet date) and its operation, and secondly, the corresponding vehicle equipment and registration system for the trucks as well as customer service for the toll service provider for at least eight years. Together, Kapsch TrafficCom thus supplies all essential elements for this state-of-the-art system.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the further expansion of the tolltickets network. With the purchase of a single toll box, drivers can since then seamlessly use the road network in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal – a cornerstone for the tolling services business segment in Europe.\n\nIn the segment of traffic management, Kapsch TrafficCom sees a particularly increasing demand for urban traffic management and low emission zones. In addition, the implementation and subsequent operation of a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) with hardware and software for construction site areas were awarded in a highway project in Germany. Shortly after the end of the financial year, Kapsch TrafficCom was awarded a pioneering contract in Florida, USA: In Pinellas County, intersections will be equipped with modern technology to prevent accidents involving pedestrians, and a system that combines predictive analyses with traffic distribution algorithms is designed to help proactively reduce traffic congestion.\n\nOrder intake reached a remarkable EUR 734 million in the reporting period (previous year: EUR 480 million), and the order backlog amounted to EUR 1.4 billion at the end of the year, 15% higher than in the previous year.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.2 Financial and non-financial performance indicators.\n\n## 1.2.1 Results of operations.\n\nRevenues. Revenues of Kapsch TrafficCom amounted to EUR 538.8 million in the financial year 2023/24 and were therefore 2.6% (EUR 14.6 million) below the previous year. While invoiced revenues1) of EUR 557.8 million were despite a customer credit note in the amount of EUR 5.5 million even higher than in the previous year (EUR 549.7 million), deferred revenues from orders processed in the past and margin value adjustments contributed to the fact that the reported net revenues were lower. Business dynamics declined slightly over the course of the year, particularly outside Europe. Revenues declines were recorded in all business areas – implementation (-7.0%), operation (-0.4%) and components (-2.0%).\n\nGeographically, the breakdown of Group revenues was as follows:\n\n- EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa): 51.7% (previous year: 49.3%)\n- Americas region (North, Central and South America): 43.1% (previous year: 45.0%)\n- APAC region (Asia-Pacific): 5.2% (previous year: 5.7%)\n\n## Revenues by region.\n\nThe EMEA region generated slight sales growth and continued to make the largest contribution to revenues. In the Americas and APAC regions, on the other hand, there was a decline after the growth of previous years.\n\n| in EUR million | 2022/23 | 2023/24 | +/-    |\n|----------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| EMEA           | 272.9   | 278.7   | 2.1%   |\n| Implementation | 45.8    | 56.7    | 23.9%  |\n| Operations     | 195.1   | 185.8   | -4.7%  |\n| Components     | 32.1    | 36.2    | 12.8%  |\n| Americas       | 249.0   | 232.4   | -6.6%  |\n| Implementation | 105.1   | 86.8    | -17.4% |\n| Operations     | 97.1    | 105.2   | 8.4%   |\n| Components     | 46.8    | 40.5    | -13.6% |\n| APAC           | 31.5    | 27.7    | -12.1% |\n| Implementation | 13.2    | 9.1     | -31.0% |\n| Operations     | 10.1    | 9.9     | -1.9%  |\n| Components     | 8.2     | 8.7     | 5.7%   |\n| Total          | 553.4   | 538.8   | -2.6%  |\n\nIn the 2023/24 financial year, 8.50 million on-board units were sold, 7.9% fewer than in the previous year (9.23 million units). While revenues in the Americas declined and remained at the previous year's level in EMEA, growth was recorded in the APAC region, particularly in Australia.\n\nOther operating income increased to EUR 81.3 million in the financial year 2023/24. The increase resulted primarily from the agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany (EUR 66.3 million) and operating foreign currency gains of EUR 10.2 million (previous year: EUR 10.6 million). It also includes income from research funding programs in the amount of EUR 2.1 million (previous year: EUR 1.3 million).\n\nFrom the 2023/24 financial year, gains from derivative contracts will not be presented in other operating income, but rather as \"Gains from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments\" under financial income. The previous year's figures were adjusted accordingly in the amount of EUR 2.4 million.\n\nCost of materials and other production services increased by 4.6% (EUR 10.2 million) to EUR 232.7 million (previous year: EUR 222.6 million) despite the decline in revenues. The ratio of materials and other purchased manufacturing services to revenues therefore increased to 43.2% (previous year: 40.2%).\n\n<sup>1)</sup> Invoiced revenues = invoiced revenues - revenue deductions - credit notes - contractual penalties\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel expenses decreased by EUR 5.5 million to EUR 242.4 million in financial year 2023/24 (previous year: EUR 247.9 million) due to favorable currency developments and, in some cases, lower inflation-related salary indexation in several countries. As of March 31, 2024, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group employed a total of 4,054 people, which was 15 people or 0.4% more than on the previous year's reporting date. The personnel ratio (ratio of personnel expenses to revenues) amounted to 45.0% (previous year: 44.8%).\n\nOther operating expenses decreased by EUR 3.0 million or 3.9% to EUR 73.2 million in the financial year 2023/24. The change was mainly due to the positive deviation in connection with the reversal of an allowance (EUR -10.1 million), although this was partially offset by the increase in legal and consulting costs of EUR 2.8 million due to legal disputes, higher communication and IT expenses (EUR +3.0 million) and increased travel expenses (EUR +1.1 million).\n\nThe proportional result from associates and joint ventures of EUR 15.4 million (previous year: EUR -1.7 million) is mainly attributable to the joint venture autoTicket GmbH in Germany.\n\nEBITDA. The operating result before amortization, depreciation and impairment (EBITDA) of EUR 88.5 million was significantly higher than the previous year's figure of EUR 27.1 million (adjusted). The EBITDA margin thus rose to 16.4% (previous year: 4.9%, adjusted).\n\nExpenses for amortization and depreciation amounted to EUR 18.3 million in the financial year 2023/24 and were therefore – with a slight increase in net investments – lower than in the previous year (EUR 21.8 million).\n\nEBIT. The operating result (EBIT) of EUR 70.3 million was significantly higher than the previous year's value of EUR 5.2 million (adjusted).\n\nThe results in the 2023/24 financial year were influenced by the following special effects:\n\n- In July 2023, the joint venture autoTicket GmbH reached a settlement with the Federal Republic of Germany and received an amount of EUR 243 million. The cash inflow to Kapsch TrafficCom AG from this settlement to date amounted to EUR 109.2 million. The special effect from Germany led to an increase in EBIT of EUR 79.2 million, of which EUR 15.4 million is reported as share of profit from associates and joint ventures.\n- After an agreement was reached with a customer regarding overdue receivables, the allowances for these receivables were reversed in the amount of EUR 10.1 million. In contrast, a credit note was issued in the amount of EUR 5.5 million, which led to a reduction in revenue. The EBIT effect therefore amounted to EUR 4.5 million.\n- For some projects in the Americas region, the project margins were adjusted, revenues and contract assets from customer contracts were reduced and provisions for onerous contracts were recognized. Only projects that had been a heavy burden on the Group for years were taken into account. Kapsch TrafficCom assumes that these project-related legacy burdens have now been finally eliminated. This had a negative effect of EUR -25.3 million on EBIT.\n- Costs in relation to the restructuring are reflected in EBIT in the amount of EUR 3.2 million.\n\nAdjusted for these one-off effects, EBIT in the financial year 2023/24 would have amounted to EUR 15.1 million and EBITDA would have amounted to EUR 33.3 million.\n\nFinancial result. The financial result decreased from EUR -13.9 million (adjusted) in the previous year to EUR -30.1 million in the financial year 2023/24. The most significant differences resulted from the increase in interest expenses and the one-off costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of the financing, which reduced the net interest result from EUR -5.0 million in the previous year to EUR -22.0 million. In addition, hyperinflation adjustments in the amount of EUR -7.0 million (previous year: EUR -5.1 million), the reversal of an allowance for a loan to an associated company in the amount of EUR 2.4 million and effects from exchange rate changes in the amount of EUR -0.5 million (previous year: EUR -2.2 million) were recognized in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nProportional result from associated companies and joint ventures from financial investments. The contribution to earnings from Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, amounted to EUR -3.2 million (previous year: EUR -1.3 million), including a loss of EUR 2.3 million from the sale of the shares.\n\nIncome taxes. Tax expenses in the financial year amounted to EUR 14.6 million (previous year: EUR 14.4 million). The tax expense results from the higher earnings before taxes and the use of loss carryforwards in Austria, which reduced the deferred taxes recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nResult for the period. The result for the period was clearly positive at EUR 22.3 million (previous year: EUR -24.2 million). A result of EUR 23.2 million (previous year: EUR -24.8 million) was attributable to the equity holders in the Group. This corresponds to earnings per share of EUR 1.72 (previous year: EUR -1.91).\n\nOther comprehensive income. This item mainly includes currency translation differences and revaluations of post-employment benefit obligations. The other comprehensive income amounted to EUR -1.7 million (previous year: EUR -2.1 million)\n\nTotal comprehensive income. The comprehensive income as the sum of the result for the period and other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 20.6 million (previous year: EUR -26.3 million).\n\n## 1.2.2 Results of operations by segment.\n\n## Tolling.\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/5 description: The image contains the text \"Tolling revenues by regions.\"\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/6 description: The image is a donut chart showing the distribution of something across three regions: Americas, EMEA, and APAC. The Americas account for 43.7%, EMEA accounts for 50.0%, and APAC accounts for 6.3%.\n\nRevenues. In the financial year 2023/24, revenues in the tolling segment decreased by 6.2% from EUR 403.4 million to EUR 378.3 million. Revenues contributed 70.2% (previous year: 72.8%) to total revenues.\n\nIn the EMEA region, a moderate increase in revenues of 1.2% (EUR 2.2 million) to EUR 189.3 million was achieved in the reporting year. This development was primarily due to new implementation projects in France and Spain, which were won in the previous year but only led to higher revenues in the reporting period. In other countries, however, there was a decline in revenues, mainly due to the completion of an implementation project in Poland in the previous year and lower component sales in Austria, Greece, Portugal and Denmark.\n\nIn the Americas region, revenues in the tolling segment decreased by 12.9% to EUR 165.2 million, making EMEA once again the region with the highest revenues for Kapsch TrafficCom. The decline was particularly noticeable in the USA, where Kapsch TrafficCom focused on stabilizing existing projects. Other countries in Latin America, such as Chile, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Argentina, also contributed to the decline in revenues. This is due to the completion of implementation projects in the previous year, which no longer generated revenue in the 2023/24 financial year. The largest positive deviations came from new implementation and operations projects in Mexico and Brazil.\n\nFollowing growth in the previous year, the APAC region suffered a 10.4% decline in revenues in the 2023/24 financial year, generating revenues of EUR 23.8 million. This decline was particularly noticeable in Australia, the strongest country in the region, where there were delays in some implementation projects. In contrast, the components business developed in a positive way\n\n## Segment tolling by business type.\n\n| in EUR million  | 2022/23      | 2023/24      | +/-          |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| <b>Revenues</b> | <b>403.4</b> | <b>378.3</b> | <b>-6.2%</b> |\n| Implementation  | 119.4        | 96.7         | -19.0%       |\n| Operations      | 202.5        | 207.7        | 2.6%         |\n| Components      | 81.5         | 73.9         | -9.3%        |\n| EBIT1)          | -9.3         | 54.3         | —            |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\nEBIT. The operating result in the tolling segment amounted to EUR 54.3 million after EUR -9.3 million in the previous year (adjusted). This positive development is primarily due to the settlement reached in the arbitration proceedings regarding the termination of the operator agreement for the collection of the infrastructure charge in Germany. The development of profitability in the toll segment was mixed in the financial year 2023/24: while the contribution to earnings from operating projects increased significantly, the components business declined slightly. In particular, high costs in connection with the completion of some implementation projects as well as the adjustment and the associated provisions for the projects to be completed in the Americas had a dampening effect.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe costs of materials and other purchased production services decreased by 6.3%. This decrease was partly due to the lower proportion of implementation projects, which always have higher material costs. Personnel expenses decreased due to favorable currency developments and restructuring measures. Depreciation and amortization decreased by 16.0% to EUR 13.4 million, mainly because it was possible to optimize rental office space and thus also the capitalized lease agreements. Other operating expenses decreased by EUR 8.1 million to EUR 47.4 million. The operating foreign currency result in the tolling segment amounted to EUR 2.9 million (previous year: EUR 2.8 million) and thus made a positive contribution to EBIT, as in the previous year.\n\n## Traffic management.\n\n## Traffic management revenues by regions.\n\nImage /page/19/Figure/3 description: This image is a donut chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. The regions are Americas (41.9%), EMEA (55.7%), and APAC (2.4%).\n\nRevenues. In the financial year 2023/24, revenues in the traffic management segment amounted to EUR 160.5 million, a rise of 7.0% on the previous year's figure of EUR 150.0 million, and contributed 29.8% (previous year: 27.2%) to total revenues. Implementation revenues increased by 25.2% compared to the previous year, and Kapsch TrafficCom also recorded a significant increase in revenues in the components business, particularly in France, Morocco and Greece. The EMEA region continued to make the largest contribution to revenues in the traffic management segment at 55.7% or EUR 89.5 million. Revenues in the Americas region increased by 13.4% to EUR 67.2 million in the financial year 2023/24. Revenues in the APAC region decreased sharply. At EUR 3.9 million, **55,7%** | it was 20.4% below the previous year's figure of EUR 4.9 million.\n\n#### Segment traffic management by business type.\n\n| in EUR million  | 2022/23      | 2023/24      | +/-         |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| <b>Revenues</b> | <b>150.0</b> | <b>160.5</b> | <b>7.0%</b> |\n| Implementation  | 44.6         | 55.9         | 25.2%       |\n| Operations      | 99.8         | 93.2         | -6.6%       |\n| Components      | 5.6          | 11.5         | >100%       |\n| <b>EBIT1)</b>   | <b>14.6</b>  | <b>15.9</b>  | <b>9.3%</b> |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\nEBIT. EBIT in the traffic management segment amounted to EUR 15.9 million in the financial year and was therefore also above the previous year (EUR 14.6 million, adjusted). This increase was mainly due to the 7.0% rise in revenues with slightly lower expenses for materials and purchased services. Personnel expenses fell by 2.0% to EUR 63.5 million and depreciation and amortization decreased by 17.1% to EUR 4.3 million. The operating foreign currency result had a negative impact of EUR -0.6 million in the financial year 2023/24.\n\n## 1.2.3 Net assets position.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's total assets as of March 31, 2024 amounted to EUR 443.7 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 480.1 million).\n\n## Assets.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment decreased by EUR 6.2 million compared to March 31, 2023, mainly due to scheduled depreciation. Intangible assets decreased by EUR 3.9 million essentially due to current amortisation.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures decreased by EUR 21.1 million. The main effect was derived from the positive proportional result of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR 15.5 million; EUR 30.0 million was paid out in dividends by this company. The share in Traffic Technology Services, Inc, USA, was sold thereby also reducing the interests in associates by EUR 7.3 million.\n\nOther non-current financial assets and investments decreased by a total of EUR 11.8 million. This was mainly due to the repayment of financing from the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany (EUR -12.9 million) and the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA (EUR -3.8 million). The effect was partially offset by the reversal of an allowance on loans in the amount of EUR 2.4 million.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets amounted to EUR 45.6 million as of March 31, 2024 (previous year: EUR 49.8 million). The majority of deferred tax assets relate to loss carryforwards in the USA, Austria, Brazil and Spain.\n\nInventories increased by EUR 2.7 million to EUR 47.8 million, largely due to higher stock levels in the manufacturing companies in Austria and Canada.\n\nTrade receivables and other current assets increased by EUR 13.5 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in invoiced sales. The higher invoiced sales also led to a reduction in non-current and current contract assets by a total of EUR 5.5 million.\n\nAt EUR 33.4 million, cash and cash equivalents were lower than in the previous year (EUR 45.2 million), mainly due to the repayment of financial liabilities and the reduction in trade payables.\n\nA total amount of EUR 11 million was identified as assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. In addition to property, plant, and equipment, this specifically included trade receivables and other current assets as well as cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Liabilities and equity.\n\nThe development of financial liabilities clearly reflects the restructuring of financing and the repayments following the cash inflow from Germany: Non-current financial liabilities increased by EUR 33.4 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to the reclassification between non-current and current financial liabilities according to maturity (EUR 38.2 million). Current financial liabilities were reduced in particular through repayments in the amount of EUR 105.7 million from EUR 131.2 million to EUR 12.8 million.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, non-current lease liabilities amounted to EUR 26.9 million (previous year: EUR 32.2 million), with the decrease mainly resulting from the reduction of rental space. Current lease liabilities amounted to EUR 9.2 million (previous year: EUR 11.6 million).\n\nNon-current and current contract liabilities increased by EUR 17.0 million due to further work on ongoing projects.\n\nTrade payables were reduced by EUR 12.1 million to EUR 62.9 million compared to the previous year, with part of these liabilities relating to invoices not yet received for purchased services.\n\nCurrent provisions increased by EUR 3.6 million compared to the previous year and amounted to EUR 22.4 million as at March 31, 2024 (previous year: EUR 18.9 million). The increase mainly related to the recognition of project provisions and provisions for impending losses in connection with projects.\n\nEquity increased by EUR 32.1 million to EUR 83.4 million as of March 31, 2024 due to the positive result for the period and the capital increase. The equity ratio increased from 10.7% in the previous year to 18.8% in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nA total amount of EUR 4 million was identified as liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. This specifically included short-term financial liabilities, trade payables, other liabilities and accruals.\n\n## 1.2.4 Financial position.\n\n## Cash flow.\n\nThe operating result was clearly positive in the reporting period and amounted to EUR 70.3 million (previous year: EUR 5.2 million, adjusted) due to the increase in other operating income in connection with the agreement with Germany. The improved result impacted cash flow from operating activities, which amounted to EUR 61.9 million in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year: EUR 2.7 million, adjusted). The cash flow from earnings amounted to EUR 67.0 million (previous year: EUR 11.4 million) and the change in net working capital amounted to EUR -5.1 million (previous year: EUR -8.6 million).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following effects were responsible for the change in net working capital: Trade receivables, current contract assets and other current assets increased by a total of EUR 16.8 million (previous year: decrease by EUR 11.8 million). Inventories also increased by EUR 2.7 million (previous year: increase by EUR 10.3 million). The increase in current contract liabilities and other current liabilities, net of the decrease in trade payables in the amount of EUR 10.6 million (previous year: decrease by EUR 0.5 million) and the addition to current provisions in the amount of EUR 3.8 million (previous year: decrease by and utilization of EUR 9.6 million) could not compensate for this effect.\n\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to EUR 43.8 million in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year: EUR -0.2 million). Investments in property, plant and equipment increased to EUR -5.7 million (previous year: EUR -3.6 million). Payments for the purchase of securities, investments and other non-current financial assets included financing of the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, in the amount of EUR -1.3 million (previous year: EUR -1.5 million), as well as financing of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR -0.5 million (previous year: EUR -3.0 million).\n\nIn contrast, the cash inflow from the repayment of the financing of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR 12.9 million and the cash inflow from the sale of the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, in the amount of EUR 7.9 million had a very positive effect. In addition, there was a cash inflow from the dividend of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR 30 million in the 2023/24 financial year. Altogether, this resulted in a clearly positive cash flow from investing activities.\n\nThe sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities is the free cash flow. It\n\namounted to EUR 105.7 million in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year: EUR 2.5 million, adjusted) and was significantly higher compared to the previous year due to the effect of the settlement of the arbitration\n\n*Free cash flow: EUR 105.7 million*\n\nproceedings in Germany and the sale of the shares in Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA.\n\nCash flow from financing activities was clearly negative in the 2023/24 financial year at EUR -111.6 million (previous year: EUR -13.1 million, adjusted). The change was mainly due to the repayment of current financial liabilities in the amount of EUR -105.5 million (previous year: EUR -18.4 million), also as a result of the restructuring of financing arrangements, the addition of new borrowings in the amount of EUR 28.3 million (of which EUR 0.8 million are non-current) and the ongoing repayment of lease liabilities in the amount of EUR -11.8 million. The interest paid on financing and the associated costs amounted to EUR -26.7 million (previous year: EUR -8.6 million, adjusted). These were recognized in cash flow from financing activities for the first time in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year adjusted).\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 amounted to EUR 33.4 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 45.2 million).\n\n## Key figures.\n\nNet debt as of March 31, 2024 was EUR 106.0 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 186.3 million) and thus EUR 80.3 million below the previous year. This development resulted mainly from the reduction of financial liabilities by EUR 85.0 million. The simultaneous increase in equity by EUR 32.1 million reduced the gearing ratio to 127.1% (March 31, 2023: 363.1%).\n\nNet working capital amounted to EUR 78,5 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 79.4 million).\n\n## 1.2.5 Non-financial information.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom Group prepares a separate consolidated Non-Financial Report that fulfils the legal requirements pursuant to section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.3 Research and development.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24 Kapsch TrafficCom invested 5% of its revenues in generic development, development support and product management.\n\nIn line with the corporate strategy \"Strategie 2027\" Kapsch TrafficCom launched a multi-year technology transformation program in the financial year 2021/22. The goal of this program is to safeguard and modernize the company's technology portfolio and reinforce its leadership in the marketplace. The emphasis is on advancing an agile way of working, developing the company's technology stack faster and more flexibly as well as adapting the current product and solution portfolio to the ever-evolving market requirements. This enables a faster time to market and more efficient delivery of solutions, resulting in improved revenues and margins.\n\nWith a strong focus on customers and their needs, the transformation is based on four pillars:\n\n*A technology transformation program aims at efficient delivery of state-of-the-art solutions.*\n\n- Product portfolio. In the product area, the product management team was strengthened. The team was also given responsibility to manage and steer the portfolio by means of a holistic view and a portfolio strategy aimed at consolidation and optimization. This identifies commonalities and synergies and builds on intelligent platforms.\n- Technology stack. The technology stack evolution allows Kapsch TrafficCom to accelerate the migration to the cloud as well as the adoption of new technologies and architectures. The technology stack is the frame for standardizing and developing technologies.\n- Organization and processes. Kapsch TrafficCom introduced SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework©) to continuously improve its software engineering methodology, organization and processes. This system and software engineering methodology leverages industry-standard agile principles to enable the development of the most complex software and cyber-physical systems and to promote customer centricity. The initial pilot projects showed successful outcomes in software development. The key improvements included better alignment with customer requirements, enhanced quality through early defect detection and increased predictability by adapting swiftly to changes. In the next step, these methods will be expanded to other teams in order to accelerate and improve the quality of software releases, with a focus on effectively meeting customer needs.\n- Culture. Fostering and nurturing a culture of collaboration, curiosity and innovation is the fourth pillar of transformation and a key success factor.\n\nIn the financial year 2022/23, the patent portfolio of Kapsch TrafficCom was further optimized. The focus was on topics of high strategic importance. As of March 31, 2024, the patent portfolio consisted of 118 patent families with 824 individual patents and 41 pending patent applications. In the financial year, three new patent families were filed in the field of tolling and one patent family was discontinued.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom strives to mitigate the risk of patent infringements and to foster the patenting of new ideas. Hence, the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management focuses on supporting product management and product development. Patent analysis in various areas ensures that products and solutions are actually free to operate. Based on these patent analyses and the expertise gained from them, Kapsch TrafficCom also intends to file more of its own patents in order to secure its freedom to operate and its unique selling proposition for its products and solutions.\n\nIn addition, the global patent monitoring system was further established. Its task is to analyze patent applications from competitors and in relevant technology segments in order to gain a better overview of competitors' strategies.\n\nThe development expenses of Kapsch TrafficCom amounted to EUR 80.0 million in the financial year 2023/24 (previous year: EUR 78.3 million). This corresponds to 14.8% (previous year: 14.2%) of total Group revenues. They are divided as follows:\n\n- Expenses for customer-specific developments: EUR 55.4 million (previous year: EUR 51.3 million)\n- Expenses for product management, development support and generic development: EUR 24.5 million (previous year: EUR 27.1 million)\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *2 Anticipated development and risks.*\n\n## 2.1 Outlook to financial year 2024/25.\n\nFor the financial year 2024/25, the management expects revenues to grow above the forecasted average annual market growth of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. The operating result (EBIT) should show a slight improvement compared to the result adjusted for one-time effects of EUR 15.1 million, whereby positive one-time effects are also possible again.\n\n*Expectation for financial year 2024/25:*\n\n*Revenue growth above market growth*\n\n*Slight improvement in earnings (EBIT)* \n\n## Revenues.\n\nRevenues continue to be affected by the economic and political uncertainties in connection with the global conflicts. In the past financial year, net revenues were also negatively impacted by a customer credit note and deferred revenues.\n\nThe high order intake and order backlog will increasingly be reflected in revenues and form a solid basis for further growth. In the medium term, it should at least be possible to return to the pre-crisis revenue level of almost EUR 740 million in the 2018/19 financial year.\n\n## EBIT (operating result).\n\nThe EBIT of the past year was influenced by many one-time effects, both positive and negative. Kapsch TrafficCom is therefore utilizing the figure of EUR 15.1 million adjusted for these one-time effects as a starting point for further development.\n\nDespite the improved situation, the focus remains on costs. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom is analyzing its process organization from bottom to top according to a Zero Base Approach in order to avoid project difficulties of the past in the future. The aim is to increase efficiency through global standards and tools.\n\n## Liquidity.\n\nThe increase in invoiced revenues in the reporting period and the recently awarded projects will be reflected in earnings and liquidity. In addition, the restructuring of financing has led to a longer-term financing structure. In May 2024, the term of the existing restructuring agreement, including all credit lines, was extended until March 31, 2026.\n\nAs of the reporting date, Kapsch TrafficCom had already generated around half of the further cash inflows from pending proceedings and other measures of at least EUR 30 million targeted in the half-year 2023/24: The total net cash inflow from the settlement agreement in Germany was around EUR 5 million higher than expected; the sale of two investments that are not part of the strategic core business also generated inflows of around EUR 11 million, of which the sale of the investment in TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited (TMT), South Africa, (EUR 3 million) took place after the balance sheet date. The management is still aiming for further cash inflows to reduce net debt further. The aim is to achieve a minimum level of net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0x in the longer term.\n\nIn connection with this, the aim is also to release the dividend block and lift the pledge on the shares of the core shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\n## Non-financial targets.\n\nThe company's non-financial targets can be found in the separate non-financial report in accordance with Section 267a UGB.\n\n## Corporate governance.\n\nThe mandates of Franz Semmernegg and Harald Sommerer as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board will expire in financial year 2024/25. Both will leave the Board. In the course of the new elections, the Supervisory Board is to be intentionally positioned more strongly as an advisory body to the Executive Board.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Strategy 2027.\n\nGlobal megatrends as well as growing awareness and legal requirements regarding climate and environmental protection are increasing the demand for comprehensive and intelligent transportation solutions. More and more, this confirms that Kapsch TrafficCom is addressing the right issues with its Strategy 2027, even if implementation is taking longer than originally assumed due to the market situation.\n\nA comprehensive strategy review was launched in the past financial year and is still ongoing. One of the first changes resulting from this was the sale of the non-core investments Traffic Technology Services, Inc. in the USA (TTS) and TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited in South Africa (TMT).\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is still predominantly perceived as a hardware provider. In fact, however, the company is already more of a provider of software and services; this development and change will continue – while retaining the hardware component – and will be shaped in the strategy review.\n\n## 2.2 Risk report.\n\n## 2.2.1 Risk management.\n\nThe enterprise-wide risk management process (Enterprise Risk Management, ERM) of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework, an internationally recognized standard for risk management.\n\nThe risk management process aims at an early identification, assessment, and management of those risks that can significantly affect the achievement of the strategic and operating objectives of the company. The primary goal is not risk avoidance, but the controlled and conscious handling of risks and the timely recognition and exploitation of opportunities that arise. In this way, ERM makes a valuable contribution to corporate management.\n\nAs part of ERM, major risks are identified, quantified, and globally aggregated on a quarterly basis. The risk report derived from this enables the concise assessment and monitoring of the major business risks. The report is sent to the Executive Board, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, and the first reporting level. The Audit Committee is informed immediately by the Executive Board about important events. The Supervisory Board also deals with the effectiveness of the risk management system as part of its monitoring of the Executive Board. The design and implementation aspects of the risk management system are reviewed annually by the auditor in accordance with Rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (ÖCGK) to ensure that the system is adequately designed and implemented. To further strengthen risk management, internal audits are carried out after this external audit to assess the operational effectiveness of the system. This proactive approach enables Kapsch TrafficCom to continuously improve and ensure the effectiveness of its risk management in day-to-day operations.\n\nThe project-oriented risk management encompasses both customer projects and internal development projects. Using institutionalized processes, an analysis of all relevant risks and opportunities is already carried out in the course of offer preparation. Consequently, a basis is created for decisions and for the timely planning and implementation of control measures.\n\n*Risk management entails the identification, assessment and control of risks.*\n\nThe main generic risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom and the general handling of these risks are briefly discussed in the following. The environmental, social and governance impacts, risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom are explained in the separate non-financial report.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.2 Industry-specific risks.\n\nVolatility of new orders. Kapsch TrafficCom's most relevant customer groups include primarily government agencies and municipal authorities as well as private concessionaires, public-private partnerships and consumers. Larger contracts\n\nare usually tendered. Until a contract is actually awarded to Kapsch TrafficCom, there are a number of uncertainty factors both within and outside of the company's area of influence. For example, political changes, appeals or lawsuits by unsuccessful bidders can lead to a delay in the awarding of a contract, to its cancellation or to a modification of the tender.\n\nThere is also the risk that offers made by Kapsch TrafficCom will not succeed for technological, financial, formal or other reasons.\n\nThe expansion into new business areas is aimed at increasing revenue growth and smoothing out revenue spikes in order to achieve a more stable revenue development. This is to be achieved in particular by further broadening the customer and product portfolio and by increasing the share of revenue from the operating business (technical and commercial operations of systems usually previously set up by the company) and from the tolling service business. The latter is typically commissioned on a long-term basis and is therefore characterized by better predictable revenues.\n\nThe economic situation of relevant national economies, possible government investment programs, changes in political priorities, an increasing focus on sustainability, trade conflicts, military conflicts or epidemics can have a significant impact on incoming orders.\n\nRisks of project execution. Intelligent transportation solutions are often technically complex and challenging systems, that must be implemented within a strict timeframe. However, the actual project environment cannot be\n\nfully analyzed and taken into account during the preparation of an offer. Therefore, uncertainties remain with regard to integration efforts for third-party systems, efforts for interfaces and other factors accelerating or delaying the handling of projects. Unavoidable dependencies on suppliers and service providers can also have a negative effect on the\n\n*Technical challenges and tight schedules cause typical project risks.*\n\nquality and timely completion of a project. All of these factors thus affect the risk of missed deadlines and/or system and product defects.\n\nIn connection with the installation of systems, Kapsch TrafficCom is generally contractually obligated to issue performance and delivery date guarantees. If the contractual services are not fulfilled or if deadlines are exceeded, penalties and damages usually have to be paid, in some cases even damages for lost toll revenue. Significant missed deadlines can also result in premature termination of a contract by the customer. A significant delay in a project, a clear failure to meet the contractually agreed performance criteria or failed implementation of a project could reduce the chances of success in future tenders. There is also the risk that projects of Kapsch TrafficCom cannot be realized at the previously calculated costs. Due to the strong social opposition to toll systems that is sometimes encountered, the risk of a late or limited start to toll collection exists, which can have further consequences on revenues, profitability and payment flows in the operation project.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom employs project management methods and project risk management procedures based on the IPMA (International Project Management Association) standards in order to minimize such risks in projects.\n\nLong-term contracts with public agencies. For many projects, contracts are awarded by public agencies. Framework agreements and service contracts in connection with tolling or traffic management projects may include terms and conditions that are not negotiable in a tender process and that may be disadvantageous for Kapsch TrafficCom. Some multi-year contracts contain demanding requirements regarding the targeted performance of the implemented systems, components and processes. Failure to meet these requirements can result in considerable contractual penalties, obligations to pay damages or termination of the contract. On the other hand, in some contracts substantial bonus payments may be earned in the case of over-performance. Moreover, for long-term contracts, the achievable margins may deviate from the original calculations due to cost changes.\n\n*Geographic diversification and expansion of the product portfolio contribute to stabilizing revenues.* \n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nContracts may entail liabilities relating to a loss of profit by customers, product liabilities and other liabilities. Kapsch TrafficCom strives to include appropriate limitations of liability in contracts. However, there can be no assurance that all contracts will contain sufficient limitations of liability or that they will be enforceable under applicable law.\n\nRisks in the supply chain. As a manufacturer of high-tech, multi-component devices and as a supplier of these devices and/or third-party products in the context of tolling and traffic management projects, Kapsch TrafficCom is dependent on the functional capability of the supply chain. It is essential to receive ordered components on time in order to ensure that they are available for ongoing projects when needed. At the same time, the components must be of good quality and offered at a reasonable price to achieve satisfactory financial results.\n\nThe situation on the global market for semi-conductors can be significantly affected by shifts in production capacity, geopolitical changes in the main production regions and disruptions in logistics. This can lead to the unavailability of the necessary components as well as fluctuations in delivery times and prices and cause difficulties in ongoing projects. Financial or operational difficulties at individual suppliers can also lead to delays in delivery, additional costs or a deterioration in the price-performance ratio of the components if supplier substitution is necessary.\n\nThis risk is limited by the fact that Kapsch TrafficCom ensures that at least two suppliers from different countries of origin are utilized for critical materials, insofar as this is economically feasible.\n\n## 2.2.3 Strategic risks.\n\nAbility to innovate. The strong market position of Kapsch TrafficCom is based to a large extent on its ability to develop high quality, efficient and reliable systems, components, solutions and services. Kapsch TrafficCom is\n\ncommitted to ongoing and consistent innovation. In order to maintain its high technological standards, Kapsch TrafficCom invests in research and development activities. However, if Kapsch TrafficCom does not succeed in developing innovative systems, components, solutions and services in line with market requirements, this may be detrimental to its competitive position.\n\n*An ongoing and consistent innovation process supports the strong market position.*\n\n*The international growth is opening up new opportunities*\n\n*but also poses risks.*\n\nSince the striving for innovation leadership is based to a large extent on technology, internal know-how and intellectual property, the global increase in product piracy and reverse engineering may have negative impacts on the market position of Kapsch TrafficCom. The company therefore places great importance on protecting technologies and the company's internal know-how, such as through patents and non-disclosure agreements with relevant contractual partners. On the other hand, newly developed systems, components, solutions or services may also infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\nAcquisition and integration of companies as part of the Group's growth. The Group's growth can be organic as well as through selected acquisitions or the establishment of joint ventures. In the course of these activities, it is\n\nnecessary to overcome a number of challenges in order to achieve the desired goals and synergies, as well as to realize the expected opportunities arising from the acquisition of new technologies and market knowhow.\n\nCountry risk. Due to the further expansion of business activities in countries outside of Europe, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to increased political risk in some countries. Significant and currently unforeseeable political changes may have a major impact on the ability to implement or operate projects in these countries as well as to make funds available or withdraw them again. Interference with the property rights of Kapsch TrafficCom or problems with business practices and activities may also arise. Kapsch TrafficCom includes these risks in the evaluation of such projects.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.4 Financial risks.\n\nForeign exchange risk. As a global company, Kapsch TrafficCom maintains branches and subsidiaries in many countries outside the Euro zone. Consequently, transaction risks arise from possible exchange rate fluctuations,\n\nwhich may be reflected in the consolidated financial statements as exchange rate losses or gains. Kapsch TrafficCom strives as far as possible to avoid these transaction risks in the amount of the net currency positions from the respective projects or to hedge them, if necessary. However, because the net currency position at the respective payment flow deadlines is often difficult to predict, hedging is only possible to a limited extent. The remaining exchange rate risk is accepted and included\n\n*Financial risks arise from exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations as well as loans. Sufficient liquidity increases the flexibility and the ability to take quick action.*\n\nin the business planning. Due to the conversion of individual financial statements of the subsidiaries outside the Euro zone into the Group currency of the Euro, Kapsch TrafficCom is also subject to a translation risk. In addition, long-term disadvantageous exchange rate changes can also cause a change in the position of Kapsch TrafficCom relative to competitors, such as when products or services based on a euro-cost structure can no longer be offered at competitive prices outside the Euro zone.\n\nInterest rate risk. Within the framework of project financing, the Group regularly agrees to variable interest rates that are tied to market interest rates (e.g. Euribor). In this context, there is an interest rate risk, which — where material — is hedged by suitable financial instruments.\n\nLiquidity risk. Sufficient financial resources have to be available for Kapsch TrafficCom to meet its payment obligations at all times. The availability of medium- and long-term financing is necessary for the implementation of large-scale projects, such as the implementation of a nationwide tolling system with an agreed delayed payment by a major client, and for the acquisition of companies. In addition, the execution of large projects regularly requires the provision of bank guarantees, some of which are extensive, as collateral for bid obligations (bid bonds) or to secure possible warranty claims (performance bonds).\n\nIn financing agreements, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to the usual limitations of its business policy, such as with regard to taking on additional borrowings, the use of assets as collateral or the provision of guarantees and sureties in favor of third parties. The availability of financing and bank guarantees depends not only on market conditions but in particular on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. A lack of liquid assets (even if the Group is otherwise essentially solvent), of financing or of bank guarantees could in turn have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. The Group continuously monitors compliance with all covenants in connection with loan agreements.\n\nLiquidity risk is counteracted by ongoing Group-wide cash flow planning. This enables potential liquidity bottlenecks to be identified at an early stage and appropriate countermeasures to be taken in time.\n\nCredit risk. Kapsch TrafficCom is exposed to the risk of non-payment by customers. The main customers of Kapsch TrafficCom are to a large extent state agencies, especially in connection with the implementation or operation of nation-wide or regional tolling and traffic management systems. Kapsch TrafficCom also acts as a subcontractor to third parties (for example concessionaires, general contractors, etc.) in public sector projects. The scope of a potential non-payment varies depending on the size of the order and can have a noticeable impact on the earnings situation in the case of individual large projects. The creditworthiness of new and existing customers is evaluated, and hedging is performed according to the assessment of the existing non-payment risk. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom takes advantage of offers from public institutions, such as OeKB (Oesterreichische Kontrollbank), EKN (Exportkreditnämnden; Swedish National Export Credits Guarantee Board) and MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency), to hedge against the non-payment risk on the basis of guarantees. Moverover, there is a risk that counterparties of both original and derivative financial instruments (including financial institutions assumed to have good credit ratings) cannot meet their payment liabilities when due. A payment default or the need to impair receivables could have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.5 Personnel risk.\n\nThe success of Kapsch TrafficCom depends to a significant extent on key personnel, in particular technical experts with many years of specific experience. In addition, the ability to recruit qualified employees with state-of-the-art\n\ntechnology knowledge, to integrate them into the Company and to retain them in the long term is of high importance for the success of the Group. The loss of important employees in key positions and difficulties in recruiting personnel can have a negative impact on the success of the Group.\n\n*Kapsch TrafficCom is taking attractive measures to counteract personnel risk.*\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has been proactively implementing measures to counteract this risk for several years. These include, for example, an internal career and training platform that allows employees to advance their careers autonomously and away from approval processes. Attractive offers such as bonus systems or further training opportunities additionally support these efforts. A periodic employee survey as well as an \"OpenLine2CEO\" to Georg Kapsch enable the management to identify current concerns, worries and wishes as well as the general mood and to respond appropriately.\n\n## 2.2.6 Legal risk.\n\nA large number of regulations and legal requirements must be observed in connection with participation in public sector tenders, the establishment and operation of tolling and mobility solutions, acquisitions and cooperations as well as capital market issues. It may take a considerable administrative, technical and commercial effort to capture, enforce and monitor all compliance requirements. If applicable regulations or official requirements cannot be met, this can lead to severe penalties and also reduce the ability of (successfully) taking part in future tenders as well as restrict the continuation of the relevant business activity.\n\nThe expansion of business activities into new regions and into select new business fields tends to increase the risk of patent violations or the violation of intellectual property rights (IPR). This can result in financial damages from court actions. Kapsch TrafficCom attempts to counteract this risk as far as possible by performing an evaluation of possible IPR violations prior to entry into new markets or regions, for example. However, it is not possible to completely avoid this risk.\n\nChanges in the geopolitical situation, such as military conflicts, can lead to the legal framework becoming more complex as a result of sanctions and embargoes being imposed. In order to remain compliant with the respective requirements, Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the relevant regulations.\n\n## 2.2.7 Cyber-risk.\n\nAs a core process of ISO/IEC 27001, Kapsch TrafficCom has a uniform risk management process for information security that is integrated into corporate risk management. The structured approach to considering risks related to information security is derived from Kapsch TrafficCom's business processes and represents a holistic approach. The risk management process is implemented in all companies whose IT is fully integrated into the Group IT, regardless of whether they are formally certified in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 or not.\n\n## 2.2.8 Operational risks.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's involvement in the realization of complex tolling and traffic management projects as well as in the production of components entails certain operational risks, including risks in the areas of health, safety, environment and quality (HSSEQ). In order to adequately mitigate these risks, Kapsch TrafficCom has developed internal processes that meet the requirements of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. In addition, aspects of ISO 9001 were integrated in order to meet quality management standards, and at individual locations also aspects of ISO 50001 in order to efficiently organize energy management and optimize energy consumption.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nLocal legal requirements sometimes exceed ISO standards, therefore Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the legal requirements in the countries in which it operates. This ensures that the operational standards always comply with the strictest local regulations.\n\nThrough regular training and further education, Kapsch TrafficCom strengthens the awareness and skills of its employees with regard to HSSEQ topics. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom utilizes ongoing audits and performance analyses to monitor and continuously improve compliance with these standards. This systematic approach not only helps to minimize risks, but also promotes sustainable corporate management and increases customer satisfaction.\n\n## 2.2.9 Opportunities.\n\nThe enterprise risk management approach of Kapsch TrafficCom not only addresses risks but also encompasses the regular identification, evaluation and management of opportunities. The goal of these efforts is to manage the strategic orientation of the product portfolio and market activities through\n\nthe early identification of opportunities and to develop corresponding potential.\n\n*The early identification of opportunities opens up new potential.*\n\nMarket opportunities exist in geographic diversification as well as increasing expansion of the customer and product portfolios, driven in part by the following factors\n\n- Opportunities arise from so-called change requests requests for changes from customers that only arise in the course of project execution. These change requests result in extensions to the contractual delivery components and are priced and paid for separately.\n- In addition, the increasing financing requirements of infrastructure projects and the growing need to relieve government budgets are creating opportunities both to open up new tolling markets in so-called emerging and developing countries and to expand activities in already developed markets.\n- The global rise in traffic volumes and the associated impact on the environment and society open up further opportunities in the area of mobility solutions, as, for example, toll collection, traffic management and demand management are increasingly being used as controlling instruments in environmental and traffic policy. In both segments, this creates opportunities to further develop and market the portfolio in line with the new requirements.\n- Furthermore, demands with regard to increasing the productivity of vehicles and vehicle operations, as well as the rising comfort expectations of travelers, are opening up opportunities by expanding the functionalities of existing systems. This offers opportunities to acquire new customers or to serve both public-sector customers and end customers with new concepts. This particularly applies in the area of tolling services.\n\nOther opportunities. Continuous innovation, technical advancements and the acquisition of new technologies by means of corporate acquisitions create opportunities for Kapsch TrafficCom to improve efficiency and performance of customer systems and to gain a technological edge over competitors with regard to the performance and functionality of the offered systems.\n\n## 2.2.10 Overall assessment of the risk situation.\n\nFrom the current perspective, no risks have been identified that could endanger the continued operations of Kapsch TrafficCom. Due to the geographic diversification, the continuous expansion of the product and solution portfolio as well as the development of new business models through selected new ITS solutions, the business activities of Kapsch TrafficCom could be positioned more broadly without the need to step outside the core business area. The concentration of risk in individual regions and in individual large projects was thereby reduced.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.3 Internal control system with respect to the accounting process.\n\nAs in the previous year, the Group-wide uniform documentation of all controls for achieving the key controlling goals was advanced again in the financial year 2023/24. This aims to increase efficiency and at the same time reduce risk in the Group as well as to show alternative courses of action to management. *The uniform documentation of all*\n\n## *controls is being advanced.*\n\nThe basis of the processes for Group accounting and reporting is an\n\naccounting manual (IFRS Accounting Manual), that is issued and regularly updated by the Kapsch Group. In this manual, the essential accounting and reporting requirements based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are specified throughout the Group. Another important basis of the internal control system (ICS) are the Group guidelines, work instructions and process descriptions.\n\nCentral elements of the ICS are execution of the principle of dual control and the segregation of duties as well as defined actions for monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of operating activities, the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with relevant legal regulations. In this regard, Kapsch TrafficCom acts based on international standards and best practices, such as COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework.\n\nThe accounting of business transactions in Kapsch TrafficCom is managed by a variety of software solutions. In a number of countries, the accounting has been outsourced to local tax accountants due to the small size of the subsidiaries. The individual companies submit reporting packages to the head office on a monthly basis containing all relevant accounting data pertaining to the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow accounting. This data is then entered into the central consolidation system OneStream on a monthly basis. The financial information is reviewed at Group level by Kapsch TrafficCom AG and forms the basis for interim reporting.\n\nThe Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board in regular meetings about the economic development in the form of consolidated presentations consisting of segment reporting, earnings development with budget and year-on-year comparison, forecasts, consolidated financial statements, personnel and order development as well as selected key financial figures.\n\n*The ICS is implemented locally and monitored centrally.*\n\nIn accordance with local requirements, responsibility for the implementation\n\nand monitoring of the internal control system lies with the relevant local management. The management of the individual subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and designing an internal control system in line with the requirements of the respective company with regard to the accounting process and for ensuring compliance with the Group-wide guidelines and regulations.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *3 Other disclosures.*\n\n## 3.1 Disclosures on capital, share, voting and control rights and related agreements.\n\nThe fully paid-in share capital of Kapsch TrafficCom AG amounts to EUR 14.3 million. It is divided into 14.3 million shares. There are no legal or statutory caps or restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or the transfer of shares. KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH held roughly 63.3% of the shares as of March 31, 2024. In connection with the refinancing, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH pledged all of its shares in Kapsch TrafficCom AG in favor of the financing banks in financial year 2023/24. This also results in restrictions customary in the market with respect to the transfer of the shares and a corresponding requirement for the consent of these banks.\n\nKAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of DATAX HandelsgmbH, whose shares are held (partly indirectly, partly directly) in equal parts by Traditio-Privatstiftung and Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung, two private foundations under the Austrian Private Foundation Act. Each of these private foundations is managed by its own Executive Board, with no individual serving on both boards. The beneficiaries of these private foundations are Georg Kapsch and members of his family (Traditio-Privatstiftung) as well as Elisabeth Kapsch and members of her family (Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung).\n\nThere was no other shareholder holding more than 10% of the voting rights in Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of March 31, 2024. In the financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom did not acquire or dispose of any treasury shares and did not hold any as of the balance sheet date.\n\nNo shares with special control rights exist. No restrictions exist with respect to the exercising of the voting right by employees with capital participation. There are no special provisions regarding the appointment and recall of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the modification of the articles of association.\n\nThe Company currently has no conditional capital authorizing the Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares without (further) referral to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nConventional \"change of control\" clauses, which may lead to termination of the contract, relate to financing agreements, such as the promissory note bond (\"Schuldscheindarlehen\") and further financing, totaling about EUR 94 million, or are related to individual customer contracts.\n\nNo compensation agreements exist between Kapsch TrafficCom AG and its Executive Board and Supervisory Board Members or employees for the event of a public takeover offer.\n\n## 3.2 Corporate Governance Report.\n\nIn accordance with C-rule 61 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, it is pointed out that the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report can be accessed on the internet at https://www.kapsch.net/en/ir/Corporate-Governance.\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief

global supplier of superior technologies, solutions and services of the ITS market (Intelligent Transportation Systems). Intelligent Transportation Systems support and optimize the traffic. They use therefore information and communication solutions.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom operates in two segments: Tolling and Traffic Management.\n\n## Tolling.\n\nThis segment comprises activities relating to the implementation and the technical and commercial operation of toll collection systems. Projects are generally awarded by public agencies or private concessionaires in the context of tender procedures. Toll collection systems may comprise both individual road sections and nation-wide road networks. The manufacture and procurement of components both for the expansion and adaptation of the systems installed by Kapsch TrafficCom and on behalf of third parties complete the portfolio of Kapsch TrafficCom; toll services for business customers and private customers further complete it.\n\n## Traffic Management.\n\nThis segment primarily comprises activities relating to the implementation and operation of systems and solutions for controlling traffic and mobility behavior, as well as the relating components business. The strategic focus is on the areas of traffic optimization, decision intelligence (analysis, simulation and prediction of traffic) and the operation of mobility platforms and services. One basis for this is the use of increasing amounts of data for analysis, simulation and intelligent control of traffic flows and mobility behavior. Customers in the traffic management segment are mainly public authorities but also private companies.\n\n## 1.1 Group structure and consolidated group.\n\nThe parent company (reporting entity) of this group is Kapsch TrafficCom AG. The company is a joint stock corporation incorporated and domiciled in, Am Europlatz 2, 1120 Vienna, Austria.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, held a share of 63.3% in Kapsch TrafficCom AG. KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH is a 100%-subsidiary of DATAX HandelsgmbH, Vienna, which is the controlling entity of Kapsch TrafficCom AG and the ultimate parent of Kapsch Group. The shares of Kapsch TrafficCom AG are listed in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange since June 26, 2007.\n\nThe consolidated group as well as changes in the scope of consolidation are included in note 29.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of Preparation.\n\nPursuant to Section 245a Austrian Commercial Code (UGB), the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\nFor ease of presentation, amounts have been rounded and, unless indicated otherwise, are presented in thousands of Euros (EUR k). However, calculations are done using exact amounts, including the digits not shown, which may lead to rounding differences.\n\n## 1.3 Accounting and valuation principles.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 are prepared under the historical cost concept, with the exception of financial instruments measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. The measurement was made accordingly at the balance sheet date. Pertinent explanations can be found within the scope of the corresponding accounting policies. The accounting and valuation principles, which form the basis for these consolidated financial statements, were applied unchanged to the previous period and supplemented by new mandatory guidelines applicable from the financial year. Note 34 provides a detailed description of all accounting and valuation principles, including new accounting and valuation principles to be applied.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.4 Material accounting estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future developments. These influence the amount and presentation of assets and liabilities reported at the balance sheet date as well as income and expenses recorded during the reporting period. Estimates are made by the Executive Board to the best of their knowledge. Nevertheless, the actual values may differ from these estimates. All estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will generally differ from actual results.\n\nIn particular, estimates and assumptions regarding the following areas have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\n\n## 1.4.1 Revenue recognition for contract work.\n\nThe Group applies the rules of IFRS 15. Revenue for implementation projects, that fulfill the criteria of IFRS 15.35 for revenue recognition over time, is recognized in accordance with the corresponding stage of completion, with an expected profit margin already being assumed. The stage of completion is determined by an input orientated method using the ratio between the costs already incurred and the expected total costs of the corresponding contract. This requires to continuously estimate and update the planned costs arising from the contract as well as the risks arising from project management. This may result from technical difficulties, delays in the schedule or difficulties with sub-suppliers or other external general conditions, and which influence the profit margin of the project. Furthermore, these projects may also lead to damages or penalties that are to be considered during the project evaluation and which require an assessment of risks. For most contracts, contract revenue is defined and includes fixed elements and partly variable elements that are assessed by probability as to their amounts and timing. Large-scale orders of the Group are usually technically complex individual orders based on specific terms and conditions which therefore are to be critically assessed with regard to revenue recognition and project risks on an individual basis. Details to the revenue recognition are included in note 34.3 and sensitivity analysis is included in note 20.\n\n## 1.4.2 Estimated impairment of goodwill.\n\nIn accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 13 and 34, the Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is determined on the basis of the calculation of the value in use. Therefore assumptions must be made and used as a basis for this. Sensitivities for the acquired goodwill are detailed in note 13.\n\n## 1.4.3 Recognition of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group reviews the recognition of deferred tax assets at least on an annual basis. These deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to offset the temporary differences. Deferred taxes on loss carryforwards are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and, in particular in the case of a history of losses, there is convincing substantial evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future to utilize these loss carryforwards. Assumptions must be made and used as a basis for this. The sensitivities are listed in note 17.\n\n## 1.4.4 Other estimates and assumptions.\n\nFurther areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements include impairment of inventories, assumption of useful lives for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, assumptions and interest rates related to liabilities from post-employment benefits to employees, assumptions and interest rates related to leasing contracts, as well as provisions for warranties and losses for onerous contracts.

The operating results of the segments are regularly reported to the Executive Board (chief operating decision maker). Resource allocation decisions are reviewed based on these segments. The Executive Board has identified two reportable segments (as described in note 1 and 34.4):\n\n## ■ Tolling\n\n■ Traffic Management\n\nThe segment results, as well as capital expenditure, depreciation and impairment and other non-cash-effective positions for the reporting period and the previous financial year are as follows:\n\n|                                                                 | 2022/23        |                            |                | 2023/24        |                            |                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------|\n|                                                                 | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Manage-<br>ment | Total          | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Manage-<br>ment | Total          |\n| Invoiced sales                                                  | 394,811        | 154,934                    | 549,745        | 396,491        | 161,339                    | 557,831        |\n| Accrued sales                                                   | 8,570          | -4,900                     | 3,670          | -18,190        | -798                       | -18,989        |\n| <b>Revenues</b>                                                 | <b>403,380</b> | <b>150,035</b>             | <b>553,415</b> | <b>378,301</b> | <b>160,541</b>             | <b>538,842</b> |\n| Implementation                                                  | 119,389        | 44,620                     | 164,009        | 96,681         | 55,870                     | 152,551        |\n| Operations                                                      | 202,486        | 99,789                     | 302,274        | 207,730        | 93,210                     | 300,940        |\n| Components                                                      | 81,506         | 5,626                      | 87,132         | 73,890         | 11,461                     | 85,351         |\n| Operating result1)                                              | -9,331         | 14,576                     | 5,245          | 54,328         | 15,930                     | 70,258         |\n| EBIT margin1)                                                   | -2.3%          | 9.7%                       | 0.9%           | 14.4%          | 9.9%                       | 13.0%          |\n| Capital expenditure2)                                           | 20,015         | 6,458                      | 26,473         | 8,013          | 5,222                      | 13,235         |\n| Depreciation and impairment                                     | 16,584         | 5,237                      | 21,821         | 13,934         | 4,342                      | 18,276         |\n| Other non-cash-effective positions                              | 4,420          | -1,280                     | 3,140          | -10,457        | 781                        | -9,676         |\n| Share of operating result from associates<br>and joint ventures | -1,479         | -201                       | -1,681         | 15,418         | 0                          | 15,418         |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\n2) Capital expenditure includes also capital expenditure for right-of-use assets from leases (see note 12 and 13).\n\nThe business types implementation, operations and components also correspond to performance obligations pursuant to IFRS 15.\n\nThe segment assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date are as follows:\n\n|                                            | March 31, 2023 |                       |         | March 31, 2024 |                       |         |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------|----------------|-----------------------|---------|\n|                                            | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Management | Total   | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Management | Total   |\n| Segment assets                             | 228,859        | 90,664                | 319,523 | 218,517        | 110,242               | 328,758 |\n| Interests in associates and joint ventures | 24,736         | 0                     | 24,736  | 3,592          | 0                     | 3,592   |\n| Segment liabilities                        | 153,460        | 84,067                | 237,527 | 158,117        | 94,308                | 252,424 |\n\nThe segment assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, other non-current assets, non-current and current contract assets, non-current and current lease receivables, inventories, trade receivables and other current assets as well as current tax receivables.

These losses are primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations of the Argentine peso, the Chilean peso, and the South African rand against the euro and the US dollar.\n\nCommunication and IT expenses rose by EUR 2,968 k compared to the previous financial year, with significant increases in the USA and Austria. Legal and consulting costs increased by EUR 2,762 k, primarily due to attorney fees associated with the restructuring agreement.\n\nThe losses from deconsolidation of companies primarily resulted from the liquidation of Streetline Inc., based in Foster City, USA.\n\nFollowing an agreement with a customer regarding overdue receivables, the impairment allowance for these receivables, amounting to EUR 10.1 million, was reversed. The agreement included an instalment payment plan of EUR 4.5 million and a credit note for the receivables totalling EUR 5.6 million, which was also recognized in revenue.\n\n## 8 Expenses for amortization, depreciation and impairment.\n\n|                                               | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment | -17,330 | -14,064 |\n| Amortization of intangible assets             | -4,491  | -4,191  |\n| Impairment on intangible assets               | 0       | -21     |\n| Total                                         | -21,821 | -18,276 |\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment also includes depreciation of right-of-use assets from leases (EUR 10,057 k). Details can be found in note 12. The decrease in depreciation of property, plant, and equipment mainly involves depreciation on right-of-use assets from building leases. This is primarily due to an office building lease in the USA that was terminated early in the 2022/23 financial year.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 9 Financial result.\n\n|                                                                                               | 2022/23<br>(adjusted) | 2023/24        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Interest income                                                                               | 2,087                 | 1,838          |\n| Interest income from leases                                                                   | 11                    | 14             |\n| Income from securities, recognized at fair value through profit or loss                       | 36                    | 118            |\n| Income from investments, recognized at fair value through profit or loss                      | 436                   | 153            |\n| Income from accrued interest of non-current receivables                                       | 0                     | 156            |\n| Gains from derivative financial instruments1)                                                 | 2,352                 | 1,206          |\n| Income from hyperinflation adjustment2)                                                       | 0                     | -0             |\n| Exchange rate gains from financing activities                                                 | 2,514                 | 2,907          |\n| <b>Finance income1)2)</b>                                                                     | <b>7,437</b>          | <b>6,393</b>   |\n| Interest expense                                                                              | -7,131                | -23,951        |\n| Interest expenses from leases                                                                 | -1,493                | -1,477         |\n| Expense from investments, recognized at fair value through profit or loss                     | -21                   | -11            |\n| Expense from interest accretion of non-current liabilities                                    | -11                   | -452           |\n| Losses from financial instruments                                                             | -31                   | -1,804         |\n| Expense from hyperinflation adjustment2)                                                      | -5,109                | -7,007         |\n| Exchange rate losses from financing activities                                                | -4,717                | -3,402         |\n| Interest expense from liabilities from post-employment benefits<br>to employees (see note 25) | -260                  | -710           |\n| Interest expense from liabilities from anniversary bonuses<br>to employees (see note 25)      | -15                   | -51            |\n| Expense from the disposal of financial assets                                                 | -167                  | -24            |\n| Impairment of financial assets                                                                | -2,350                | 0              |\n| Reverse of impairment of financial assets                                                     | 0                     | 2,350          |\n| <b>Finance cost2)</b>                                                                         | <b>-21,305</b>        | <b>-36,539</b> |\n| <b>Financial result1)</b>                                                                     | <b>-13,869</b>        | <b>-30,146</b> |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year.\n\n2) Adjustment previous year: netting of income from hyperinflation adjustment and expense from hyperinflation adjustment.\n\nIn the previous financial year, the interest expense totalled EUR -23,951 k, mainly attributed to the financing restructuring agreement reached in May 2023, which markedly exceeded the previous year's figures. A return to a market-standard interest rate is anticipated for the upcoming financial years.\n\nArgentina is classified as a hyperinflationary economy. The gains and losses from hyperinflation adjustments are reflected in the financial results. Since the gains and losses were not offset in the previous year but were offset in the 2023/24 financial year under hyperinflation expenses, a netting of the previous year's gain from hyperinflation amounting to EUR 825 k with hyperinflation expenses (hyperinflation expenses 2022/23 pre-adjustment: EUR -5,935 k) was conducted.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses primarily arose from fluctuations in foreign currencies related to intercompany financing. These notably affected subsidiaries in Zambia (Zambian Kwacha against South African Rand) and Argentina (Argentinian Peso against US Dollar).\n\nThe Group employs derivative financial instruments to hedge or minimize both interest rate and currency risks. While the Profit and Loss effects from interest rate hedging were already disclosed in the financial results, hedging related to currency risk was previously shown in operational activities due to the global business operations involving various currencies with countries and business partners.\n\nFollowing an analysis with a clear distinction between operational and financial effects in the 2023/24 financial year resulting from modifications in financing restructuring, the (positive) hedge effects concerning foreign exchange risk (primarily from hedging an intercompany loan from an EUR to a USD company) are now retrospectively reported in the financial results. The \"Operational gains from derivative contracts\" previously shown in other operating income for the previous year from derivative contracts amounting to EUR 2,352 k were accordingly reclassified into financial income for the previous year.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a result of adjustments to prior year figures regarding gains from derivative financial instruments, the following previous year positions changed as follows (first value corresponds to value before adjustment): EBIT from EUR 7,597 k to EUR 5,245 k, EBIT margin from 1.4% to 0.9%, EBIT for toll segment from EUR -7,617 k to EUR -9,331 k, toll segment EBIT margin from -1.9% to -2.3%, EBIT for traffic management segment from EUR 15,213 k to EUR 14,576 k, traffic management segment EBIT margin from 10.1% to 9.7%, EBITDA from EUR 29,418 k to EUR 27,066 k, EBITDA margin from 5.3 % to 4.9 %, financial income from EUR 5,910 k to EUR 7,437 k (including reclassification for the offsetting of hyperinflation results amounting to EUR -825 k), financial result from EUR -16,221 k to EUR -13,869 k, cash flow from result - other adjustments position from EUR -11,199 k to EUR -8,847 k, net debt to EBITDA from 6.33 to 6.88.\n\n## 10 Income taxes.\n\n|                                            | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Current income taxes                       | -6,311  | -11,888 |\n| Changes in deferred taxes                  | -8,039  | -2,724  |\n| Total                                      | -14,350 | -14,611 |\n| thereof income/expense from group taxation | -26     | 0       |\n\nThe reasons for the difference between the arithmetic tax expense/income based on the Austrian corporate income tax rate1) of 23% (previous year: 23%) and the recognized tax expense/income are as follows:\n\n|                                                                              | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Result before income taxes                                                   | -9,890  | 36,876  |\n| Arithmetic tax expense/income                                                | 2,275   | -8,481  |\n| Effects of different tax rates in the Group                                  | -566    | -1,029  |\n| Unrecognized deferred tax assets on current tax losses and                   |         |         |\n| impairment of previously recognized tax losses                               | -10,524 | -4,853  |\n| Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrecognized previous-year tax losses | 0       | 4,518   |\n| Change of tax rate                                                           | -2,073  | 0       |\n| Tax allowances claimed and other permanent tax differences                   | 4,341   | -12,130 |\n| Income and expenses not subject to tax and other differences                 | -6,156  | 7,216   |\n| Tax effects from previous periods                                            | -1,648  | 147     |\n| Recognized tax expense/income                                                | -14,350 | -14,611 |\n\nUnrecognized deferred tax assets for current losses and write-downs of previously recognized losses mainly relate to unrecognized losses in the USA and Brazil. Based on planning for the coming years, these losses are unlikely to be fully utilized. In the financial year 2023/24, deferred tax assets for previously unrecognized losses were primarily related to loss carryforwards in Austria.\n\nThe tax effects concerning prior periods include adjustments to previous years' values due to tax audits and modifications made during the preparation of tax returns.\n\nFor further information on deferred tax assets and liabilities, see note 17.\n\n<sup>1)</sup> On January 20, 2022, the National Council passed the eco-social tax reform. Among other things, this provides for a gradual reduction in the corporation tax rate from 25% to 23% (2023: 24%, 2024: 23%). For annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements with a reporting date after January 20, 2022, the theoretical tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the new tax rates. The tax rate to be used is the rate that is likely to be applied when the temporary difference underlying the deferred tax is realized (reversed). As there were no significant realizations of deferred taxes in the 2023/24 financial year, the corporate income tax rate of 23% applicable from 2024 was used for the calculation - in line with the consolidated financial statements as at March 31, 2023.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 11 Other comprehensive income.\n\n|                                                                              | 2022/23       |                     |               | 2023/24       |                     |               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                                                              | Before taxes  | Tax expense/ income | After taxes   | Before taxes  | Tax expense/ income | After taxes   |\n| Remeasurements of liabilities from post-employment benefits                  | 2,076         | -410                | 1,666         | -1,346        | 305                 | -1,041        |\n| Currency translation differences                                             | -4,400        | 0                   | -4,400        | -715          | 0                   | -715          |\n| Currency translation differences from net investments in a foreign operation | 818           | -188                | 630           | 141           | -33                 | 109           |\n| <b>Fair value changes recognized in equity</b>                               | <b>-1,506</b> | <b>-598</b>         | <b>-2,104</b> | <b>-1,919</b> | <b>272</b>          | <b>-1,647</b> |\n\nThe USD loans granted by Kapsch TrafficCom AG to a subsidiary in the USA were classified as net investments in a foreign operation in accordance with IAS 21, as the Executive Board of Kapsch TrafficCom AG does not plan to repay these loans in the foreseeable future and repayment is not probable.

Recoverability of intangible assets with finite useful lives.\n\nIntangible assets (excluding intangible assets with indefinite useful lives) are allocated to the individual companies and are tested for impairment at this level if any indications of impairment appear.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, there were neither impairments nor write-ups, as in the previous year.\n\n## 13.2 Recoverability of goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to the following six groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) and is tested for impairment at this level.\n\n|                                                  | March

group of CGUs was carried out based on the budget for the financial year 2024/25 as well as a new mid-term plan, which also considers the effects from rightsizing measures to increase efficiency and revenues in the short and mid-term, most of which have already been implemented. Impairment test was carried out for each group of CGUs. The restructuring measures include improvements of processes, optimizations of procurement, optimizations on the sales side, improvements of project processing, focusing on and improving net working capital as well as selective personnel measures.\n\nThe results of this impairment test are described below.\n\n## 13.2.1 Key assumptions for impairment testing.\n\nThe following key assumptions for determining of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units were made:\n\n|                                     | 2022/23      | 2023/24      |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Determination of recoverable amount | Value in use | Value in use |\n| Detailed planning period            | 4 years      | 6 years      |\n| Terminal value growth rate          | 2.00%        | 2.00%        |\n| Market risk premium                 | 5.71%        | 6.08%        |\n| Risk-free rate                      | 2.29%        | 2.42%        |\n\nIn the case of all cash-generating units of the Group, the market side is generally based on a project business in which the Group is commissioned to set up a tolling or traffic management system. In connection with this, longterm operation business can often be generated. In addition, system extensions (e.g. through additional routes or additional applications) and/or further ongoing component deliveries for these customers can also be provided within the framework of such long-term contracts. This characteristic of the project business is also reflected in the market planning process of the individual cash-generating units.\n\nThe Group plans each customer project for each performance obligation as carefully as possible in its project planning tool. Projects, in which systems have already been set up and where there are still medium- and long-term operations business and several years of experience with customers, can be planned very reliable. In these cases, the further development and the potential for additional business can usually be planned very reliably over the entire remaining term. For new implementation projects, the uncertainties regarding technical implementation, timing and quantities are higher. In general, the closer the award dates of such implementation projects are, the more reliable planning is in this respect. Implementation projects for which the Group has already been selected as a supplier or which are even already in the implementation phase can also be planned with particular accuracy. Projects, which are unlikely to be won or executed at the time of budgeting, are not included in the budget or medium-term planning. Uncertainties, delays and deviations can never be completely ruled out in the project business, however such risks are minimized in the best possible way by professional project management and controlling. Furthermore, planning \n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nincludes the sale of components that are not related to construction projects. This, too, can generally be estimated very well on the basis of many years of experience.\n\nIn the CGU Tolling-Americas, there are a large number of projects and demand for tolling systems, primarily in the USA but also in Latin American countries, which are assessed according to their probability and are included in the planning accordingly. Strong demand for traffic management projects (especially road safety and traffic monitoring systems) is also expected in the CGU TM-Americas and has been included in the planning accordingly.\n\nThe focus in the region EMEA is on Europe, although selected projects in Africa and the Middle East continue to be included in these CGUs. In the CGU Tolling-EMEA, demand for tolling systems remains strong, not least because of the budget constraints in many public budgets. Already won, prepared or potential implementation and operation projects, as well as their expansion, are included in the planning according to their probability. In the CGU TM-EMEA, management expects an increasing demand for traffic management systems, especially for road telematics solutions in urban areas. This is also included accordingly in the planning of this CGU.\n\nThe planning for the CGU Tolling-APAC is based on finalized implementation projects, current operation projects, their extensions, tenders either in preparation or already in progress within this region. Road telematics solutions are an essential part of the planning in the CGU TM-APAC as they are in other regions. Different projects in the field of road safety and traffic monitoring systems are expected.\n\nDelivery of components is an integral part of the plan in all Tolling CGUs.\n\nIn connection with the hostilities in Ukraine and their potential impact on the Group's business in the surrounding countries of Russia and Belarus (where projects are predominantly handled in the Tolling-EMEA CGU area), it should be noted that uncertainties and risks in these countries have also been taken into account in the planning as part of flat-rate discounts based on an overall Group view.\n\n## 13.2.2 Peer Group.\n\nIn addition to Kapsch TrafficCom AG, the peer group assumed for the impairment test comprises another eleven peer companies, of which only seven companies were relevant for determining the parameters in the financial year 2023/24 (2022/23: eleven companies – thereof six relevant).

These refer to a further capital contribution in Copiloto Colombia S.A.S., Colombia, of EUR 279 k. In addition, the company NATRAS AG was founded together with a partner, in which Kapsch TrafficCom AG holds 50% of the shares. The addition for this company amounted to EUR 270 k.\n\nThe disposal of EUR 6,272 k related to the derecognized carrying amount of the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, which was sold in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nThe agreement in the arbitration proceedings between the joint venture autoTicket GmbH and the Federal Republic of Germany had a significant impact on the development of the carrying amount of shares in associated companies and joint ventures.\n\n## Associated companies.\n\n## Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA.\n\nIn March 2024, the shares in the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, which was previously accounted for using the equity method, were sold. The sale led to the deconsolidation of the company. As of March 31, 2024, the carrying amount of the investment was EUR 0 (March 31, 2023: EUR 7,278 k) and Kapsch TrafficCom's share was 0.00% (March 31, 2023: 42.44%). The proportional result from this associate amounted to EUR -1,006 k in 2023/24 (2022/23: EUR -1,266 k) and is reported in the result before taxes after the financial result. In addition, a loss from the disposal of the associated company of EUR 2,230 k was recognized in earnings before taxes after the financial result. The loss on disposal results from the selling price of EUR 7,893 k less an offsetting loan of EUR 3,851 k and the carrying amount of EUR 6,272 k.\n\n## Joint ventures.\n\nThe joint ventures include autoTicket GmbH, Germany, Copiloto Colombia S.A.S., Colombia, and NATRAS AG. These companies are also accounted for using the equity method.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n## autoTicket GmbH, Deutschland.\n\nAs of August 13, 2018, the company autoTicket GmbH, Germany, (autoTicket) was acquired together with CTS EVENTIM AG & Co. KGaA as a shell company. Kapsch TrafficCom holds 50% of the shares and accounts for the company as a joint venture using the equity method. As the activities and strategy of autoTicket are part of Kapsch TrafficCom's core business, the proportional results (2023/24: EUR 29,498 k and 2022/23: EUR -1,765 k) are disclosed separately in the operating result (Item: \"Proportional result from associates and joint ventures\"). The increase in earnings in this financial year is due to the settlement of the arbitration proceedings with the Federal Republic of Germany. As a result, autoTicket GmbH received an amount of EUR 243 million in July 2023.\n\nIn February 2024, the distribution of a dividend was resolved, which was split equally amongst the shareholders. The proportional dividend from Kapsch TrafficCom amounted to EUR 30,000 k and reduced the carrying amount of the investment accordingly.

as well as shares in investment funds.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Fair value-hierarchies and determination of fair value.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities must be classified to one of the three following fair value-hierarchies:\n\n- Level 1: There are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. In the Group, listed equity instruments are attributed to level 1.\n- Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques based on direct or indirect observable market data. This category comprises securities that are not regularly traded on a stock market, derivative financial instruments and financial liabilities. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:\n\t- Quoted market prices are used for securities.\n\t- The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n\t- The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted to present value.\n\t- The fair value of financial liabilities classified as level 2 was derived through discounting the gross cash flows over the contracted term at a risk-adjusted observable interest rate.\n- Level 3: Financial instruments whose valuation information is not based on observable market data are classified to this category. Variable purchase price components (earn-out) fall into this category, for example. They are based on agreed conditions and the expectation of the future sales/earnings development of the respective subsidiaries.

In these consolidated financial statements, tax loss carry-forwards amounting to EUR 370,281 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 351,596 k) are not recognized due to the unsecure potential for future taxable income. The not recognized tax loss carry-forwards relate to a small extent to Austria and primarily to foreign subsidiaries in Spain, in the USA, Brazil and in Zambia and are, for the predominant part, not expiring or not before 2031. All other deferred tax assets have been recognized in the respective Group companies as future deductible items.\n\nSensitivity analyzes indicate that the deferred tax assets would deviate from the previously assumed estimates by around EUR +3,686 k or EUR -3,686 k in the event of a change in earnings before taxes of +/-10%.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, taking maturities into account, when there is a legally enforceable right to offset tax assets against tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets/liabilities are attributable to the following positions:\n\n|

In case the assumptions made for the impairment of inventories would change by +/-10%, the effect would be approximately EUR -4,781 k and EUR +4,781 k (March 31, 2023: EUR -4,510 k or EUR +4,510 k).\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 19 Trade receivables and other current assets.\n\n|                                                          | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Trade receivables                                        | 98,117         | 98,489         |\n| Allowance for bad debt                                   | -13,418        | -2,670         |\n| Trade receivables – net                                  | 84,699         | 95,819         |\n| Receivables from tax authorities (other than income tax) | 14,629         | 15,228         |\n| Current lease receivables                                | 567            | 474            |\n| Other receivables and prepaid expenses                   | 18,110         | 19,953         |\n| Total                                                    | 118,005        | 131,474        |\n\nFor details on current lease receivables see note 24.\n\nOther receivables and prepaid expenses mainly include prepaid expenses in the amount of EUR 12,331 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 10,862 k), other prepayments received in the amount of EUR 5,506 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 3,262 k) and deposits in the amount of EUR 2,031 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 2,346 k).\n\nAllowance for bad debt developed as follows:\n\n|                                          | Allowances | ECL<br>according<br>to IFRS 9 | March 31,<br>2023 | Allowances | ECL<br>according<br>to IFRS 9 | March 31,<br>2024 |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Balance as of March 31 of previous year  | -4,401     | -1,567                        | -5,968            | -11,637    | -1,781                        | -13,418           |\n| Additions                                | -7,719     | -335                          | -8,054            | -456       | -78                           | -535              |\n| Utilization                              | 54         | 121                           | 175               | 12         | 764                           | 776               |\n| Disposals                                | 275        | 0                             | 275               | 10,201     | 0                             | 10,201            |\n| Currency translation differences         | 154        | 0                             | 154               | 69         | 0                             | 69                |\n| Assets held for sale                     | 0          | 0                             | 0                 | 238        | 0                             | 238               |\n| Balance as of March 31 of financial year | -11,637    | -1,781                        | -13,418           | -1,574     | -1,096                        | -2,670            |\n\nThe decrease in allowances for trade receivables mainly relates to a long-standing customer in the EMEA region, with whom an agreement regarding overdue receivables was reached in April 2023, resulting in the reversal of allowances in the amount of EUR 10.1 million.\n\nMaturity structure of trade receivables:\n\n|                    | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|--------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Not yet due        | 52,228         | 61,323         |\n| Overdue            |                |                |\n| 1-30 days          | 9,433          | 9,387          |\n| 31-60 days         | 3,154          | 5,459          |\n| 61-90 days         | 1,870          | 2,438          |\n| 91-180 days        | 7,776          | 7,240          |\n| 181-270 days       | 2,146          | 3,930          |\n| More than 271 days | 21,511         | 8,712          |\n| Total              | 98,117         | 98,489         |\n\nTotal trade receivables are with 73.0% not due or overdue for 1-30 days (March 31, 2023: 62.8%).

These relate exclusively to the last open projects, which have contributed negatively to earnings for many years. A solution for these projects is being worked on intensively.\n\nImpairment on contract assets amounted to EUR 382 k as of March 31, 2024 (March 31, 2023: EUR 408 k) and relates to the expected impairments according to IFRS 9. In the statement of comprehensive income for 2023/24, income in the amount of EUR 26 k (2022/23: EUR 1,141 k) was recognised.\n\nAn amount of EUR 28,777 k of the contract liabilities in total amounting to EUR 31,512 k as of March 31, 2023 was recognized in revenues in the financial year 2023/24 (2022/23: EUR 18,859 k).\n\nThe future revenues from performance obligations that are unsatisfied are as follows:\n\n|                       | 2022/23   | 2023/24   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Future revenues       | 1,186,933 | 1,360,948 |\n| Total up to 1 year    | 401,716   | 368,044   |\n| Between 1 and 2 years | 196,415   | 201,584   |\n| Between 2 and 3 years | 128,719   | 152,610   |\n| Between 3 and 4 years | 86,851    | 122,543   |\n| Between 4 and 5 years | 74,639    | 90,012    |\n| More than 5 years     | 298,593   | 426,155   |\n\nIn case the margins would change by +/-10% compared to the assumptions made, the sensitivity analysis indicates that operating result would change by approximately EUR +5,520 k and EUR -4,939 k (2022/23: EUR +6,005 k and EUR -5,272 k).\n\n## 21 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n|                          | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Cash on hand             | 41             | 32             |\n| Deposits held with banks | 45,187         | 33,344         |\n| Total                    | 45,228         | 33,376         |\n\nThe carrying amounts of this item represent cash and cash equivalents at the end of the reporting period as presented in the cash flow statement.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 22 Equity.\n\n## Share capital.\n\nThe registered share capital of the company amounts to EUR 14,300,000 (March 31, 2023: EUR 13,000,000) as a result of a capital increase carried out in November 2023. The share capital was fully paid and is divided into 14,300,000 ordinary shares (March 31, 2023: 13,000,000 ordinary shares). Each share entitles the holder to one vote. There are no caps or restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or the transfer of shares. The pro rata amount of share capital per ordinary share is EUR 1.00.\n\n## Authorized capital.\n\nThe 2021 Annual General Meeting resolved to create new authorized capital of up to 10% of the share capital, excluding shareholders' subscription rights. The Executive Board is authorized until September 28, 2026, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company's share capital in one or more tranches by up to 10% and to set the issue price and the issue conditions. The shareholders' subscription rights to the new shares issued from the authorized capital was excluded. The company currently has no conditional capital that authorizes the Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares without (repeated) consideration by the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Capital increase.\n\nThe offer period for the capital increase resolved on this date ended on November 21, 2023, in which a total of 1,300,000 new no-par value bearer shares with voting rights (ordinary shares) were issued, of which 477,217 shares were issued against cash contributions and 822,783 shares against contributions in kind. The issue and subscription price was EUR 9.00 per new share and the gross proceeds amounted to EUR 11.7 million. EUR 0.2 million in transaction costs were deducted from the capital reserve of EUR 10.4 million.\n\n## Authorization of repurchase of shares.\n\nAn authorisation to repurchase shares granted by the Annual General Meeting of September 10, 2019 expired on March 10, 2022. As of March 31, 2024, Kapsch TrafficCom held, as in the previous year, no treasury shares, no shares retained for options and no conversion rights.\n\n## Capital reserve.\n\nCapital reserve includes those reserves that have not been established from results of prior periods.\n\n## Other reserves.\n\nOther reserves contain effects of changes in the interest held in subsidiaries as well as reserves from other comprehensive income, for example currency translation differences, remeasurements of liabilities from post-employment benefits after deduction of deferred taxes as well as changes of the cash flow hedge reserve after deduction of deferred taxes.\n\n## Consolidated retained earnings.\n\nRetained earnings include accumulated results of the period attributable to the equity holders of the company less dividends paid.\n\n## Dividends paid.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, as in the previous year, no dividends were paid by Kapsch TrafficCom AG. No dividends were distributed to non-controlling interests in the financial year 2023/24 either (financial year 2022/23: EUR 251 k).\n\n## Non-controlling interests.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the third party shares in the equity of fully consolidated subsidiaries. Changes in non-controlling interests due to acquisitions, formations, liquidations or disposals of subsidiaries are presented in one line \"Effects from changes in the scope of consolidation\" in the statement of changes in equity in the financial year 2023/24, as none of these transactions in the financial year 2023/24 represent a material effect on their own.

acquisitions as well as for an operating loan.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Kapsch TrafficCom AG reached an agreement on a comprehensive refinancing of short-term financial liabilities (including promissory note bonds) with its major financial creditors. Existing financing in the amount of EUR 106.3 million was extended until May 25, 2025. The restructuring measures include improvements in processes, optimizations in procurement, optimizations on the sales side, improvements in project processing, focusing on and improving net working capital as well as selective personnel measures. The aim was to materially reduce net debt by at least EUR 60 million and to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0x in the longer term.\n\nIn addition, new financing was concluded, with which half of the seven-year promissory note bond (EUR 11.5 million) were repaid. On the other hand, one of these promissory note creditors provided an additional loan in the amount of EUR 4.25 million, which also had a term until May 25, 2025. New financing, was subject to increased terms in line with market conditions; in addition, the financial creditors were entitled to a repayment premium in certain cases (also for existing financing). In order to achieve the targeted reduction in current net debt, the company has agreed to make early repayments from surplus cash and cash equivalents (cash sweep), from extraordinary inflows and from pending proceedings (particularly those in Germany) and to not distribute any dividends. The company's dividend policy therefore remains suspended. As part of the refinancing of financial liabilities, new, customary covenants (net debt/EBITDA and equity ratio) and conditions were agreed with the financial creditors for the next two years. Compliance with these covenants and the implementation status of the operational measures were closely monitored and reported on with the support of an external consultant.\n\nThe main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH supported the restructuring – in addition to loans totaling EUR 5 million already granted at the end of 2022 – by pledging all of its shares held in the company, which currently corresponds to around 63.3% of the company's share capital.\n\nThe company also undertook to use the entire existing authorized capital to the extent of 10% of the company's share capital (corresponding to 1.3 million new shares in the company) to create sufficient liquidity, whereby the main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH was entitled to contribute financial support already provided. The capital increase was carried out on November 21, 2023 (see note 22).\n\nFurthermore, a new financing line for KTC USA Inc., USA, was agreed in June 2023, which can be utilized up to USD 20 million. As at the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024, the relevant utilization was EUR 3.6 million.\n\nThe Group was able to significantly reduce its financial liabilities in the past financial year, primarily due to the inflow of funds from the German arbitration proceedings. In accordance with a defined waterfall principle, all new financing was initially repaid and older loans were subsequently serviced, whereby it was ensured that all banks involved were serviced in proportion to the outstanding loan amount. In total, repayments of EUR 87.5 million were made in two tranches (September 2023 and March 2024). As a result, Kapsch TrafficCom AG already significantly exceeded its net debt reduction target in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nIn May 2024, the term of the existing restructuring agreement, including all outstanding credit lines, was extended until March 31, 2026. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom AG commits to make repayments totaling EUR 20 million between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 24 Lease liabilities.\n\n|                               | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Non-current lease liabilities | 32,199         | 26,932         |\n| Current lease liabilities     | 11,595         | 9,158          |\n|                               | 43,794         | 36,090         |\n\nMovements of right-of-use assets from leases and classifications are included in note 12 Property, plant and equipment.

Retirement benefit obligations were valued based on an interest rate of 3.50% (2022/23: 3.95%) for the Euro zone and based on an interest rate of 4.90% (2022/23: 4.90%) for Canada as well as compensation increases based on a rate of 2.5%–3.50% (2022/23: 3.00%–5.50%). An interest rate of 3.50%–3.55% (2022/23: 3.95%–4.00% ) was used for the obligations from anniversary bonuses and 9.48% in Mexico (2022/23: 8.90%) and a value of 3.00%–5.50% (2022/23: 3.00%–5.50%) for salary increases. In addition, the calculation was based on the earliest possible statutory retirement age including transition provisions and using the mortality tables AVO 2018-P ANG (2022/23: AVO 2018-P ANG) by Pagler & Pagler for Austria and the 2014 Canadian Pension Mortality Private Tables for Canada.\n\n#### Termination benefits.\n\nThis item essentially comprises legal and contractual claims of employees in Austria or their dependents on one-time severance payments. These may arise, in particular, on the basis of an employer's notice, amicable solution to the employment relationship, retirement or death of the employee. In the case of severance payments, the Group bears the risk of inflation resulting from salary adjustments, which simultaneously lead to higher severance payments. For employees who have joined Kapsch TrafficCom in Austria after December 31, 2002, payments into an external employee benefit fund are made on a monthly basis so that the Group does not normally incur any severance payments. Similar severance obligations also exist in other countries, such as in Mexico.\n\nThe following amounts are recognized in the balance sheet and the statement of comprehensive income for termination benefits:\n\n|                                                  | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Carrying amount as of March 31 of previous year  | 9,419   | 8,143   |\n| Remeasurements (actuarial gains / losses)        | -890    | 497     |\n| Current service cost                             | 192     | 629     |\n| Interest expense                                 | 78      | 265     |\n| Payments                                         | -780    | -1,624  |\n| IC-Transfer                                      | 67      | 165     |\n| Currency translation differences                 | 58      | 43      |\n| Carrying amount as of March 31 of financial year | 8,143   | 8,119   |\n| Total, included in the staff costs (note 6)      | 192     | 629     |\n| Total, included in the financial result (note 9) | 78      | 265     |\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nRemeasurements of liabilities from post-employment benefits to employees are attributable to the following positions:\n\n|                                                            | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Remeasurements from changes in demographic assumptions     | -3      | 26      |\n| Remeasurements from changes in financial assumptions       | -1,301  | 205     |\n| Remeasurements from other changes (experience adjustments) | 414     | 267     |\n| Total                                                      | -890    | 497     |\n\nThe expected allocation for termination benefits for the next financial year 2024/25 amounts to EUR 373 k.

and service provider, the Group issues product warranties at the time of sale to its customers. Usually, under the terms of the warranty contract, the Group has the obligation to repair or replace manufacturing or software defects that become apparent within the period under guarantee. When the Group expects warranty claims on products sold or services rendered during the period under guarantee, a corresponding provision is set up in the financial statements. Based on the expectation that the majority of the expenditure will be incurred in the short or medium term, the best estimate for the cost of warranty is used for the recognition of the provision. Likewise, historical data is taken into account in the calculation of the provision amount. According to past experience, it is probable that there will be claims under the warranties. It is expected that an amount of EUR 17 k will be used in the first half of the financial year 2024/25, EUR 1,286 k in the second half of the year and the remaining amount of EUR 323 k in the following financial years.\n\nCurrent provisions of EUR 17,326 k have been recognized for losses from onerous contracts in the financial year 2023/24. A significant amount relates to various implementation projects of an American subsidiary that cannot be completed with a profit. The additions to current provisions for onerous contracts in the financial year 2023/24 also result primarily from the USA. A utilization in the amount of EUR 1,412 k is expected in the first half of the financial year 2024/25 and EUR 15,914 k in the second half of the year.\n\nThe provisions for projects (excluding impending losses) mainly relate to current costs and repair services for current toll projects. It is expected that an amount of EUR 632 k will be used in the first half of the financial year 2024/25, EUR 909 k in the second half of the financial year and the remaining amount of EUR 25 k in the following financial years.\n\nProvisions for legal fees, costs of litigation and contract risks mainly relate to current legal cases and consulting costs. It is expected that the amount of EUR 550 k will be used in the first half and the amount of EUR 595 k will be used in the second half of the financial year 2024/25.\n\nOf the remaining provision for restructuring costs, utilization in the amount of EUR 2 k is expected in the first half of the subsequent financial year 2024/25.\n\nOther provisions mainly include provisions for taxes and duties, provisions for commissions, bonuses and claims for damages. The utilization in financial year 2023/24 relates to a provision of EUR 1,700 k for claims for damages in Austria. In the financial year 2023/24, the reclassification of other current provisions includes the reclassification to \"liabilities held for sale\". It is expected that an amount of EUR 606 k will be used in the first half of the financial year 2024/25, EUR 524 k in the second half of the year and the remaining amount of EUR 1,462 k in the following financial years.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 27 Other liabilities and deferred income.\n\n|                                                        | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Other employee liabilities                             | 22,323         | 25,499         |\n| Liabilities to tax authorities (other than income tax) | 9,358          | 9,007          |\n| Other prepayments received                             | 3,322          | 10,019         |\n| Refund Liabilities                                     | 724            | 114            |\n| Sundry liabilities and deferred income                 | 7,937          | 7,354          |\n| Total                                                  | 43,664         | 51,992         |\n\nOther employee liabilities comprise liabilities to employees and board members, including liabilities for outstanding vacation and accruals for special payments as well as liabilities in connection with personnel costs (social security, etc.).\n\nThe increase in other prepayments received is mainly due to advanced prepayments from projects in Brazil and Germany.\n\nThe sundry liabilities and deferred income essentially include provisions for invoices not yet received or passive accruals of invoices.\n\n## 28 Contingent liabilities and other commitments as well as disclosure to German infrastructure charge.\n\nThe Group's contingent liabilities primarily result from large-scale projects. Operating activities require the disclosure of bid bonds or performance bonds for major projects, which are issued by financial institutes and insurance companies. In case the contractual obligations cannot be fulfilled, there is a risk of utilization, that can result in a recourse claim of the financial institute or insurance company against the Group.\n\nThe contingent liabilities and other commitments solely comprise obligations owed to third parties and are in line with standard industry practice. They detail as follows:\n\n|                                         | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| North America (toll collection systems) | 26,595         | 26,752         |\n| Australia (toll collection systems)     | 14,568         | 14,271         |\n| Total                                   | 41,164         | 41,023         |\n\nFurther performance and bid bonds from financial institutes or insurance companies, where an outflow of resources is deemed unlikely, amount to EUR 197,322 k (2022/23: EUR 248,347 k) and are not included in the balance sheet or in the contingent liabilities.\n\nAssets of Kapsch TrafficCom AB, Sweden, in the amount of EUR 10,412 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 10,638 k) were pledged as collateral for contingent liabilities in favor of a Swedish bank.\n\n## German infrastructure charge.\n\nIn 2018 the joint venture autoTicket GmbH (autoTicket), Germany, was commissioned to levy the German infrastructure charge (\"passenger vehicle toll\"). Moreover in a separate contract the Group company MTS Maut & Telematik Services GmbH (MTS), Germany, had been awarded the contract for the \"automatic control of the passenger vehicle toll\".\n\nOn June 18, 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled contrary to expectations that the passenger vehicle toll in its planned form, where in Germany accredited vehicles receive a tax relief simultaneously, violates the principles of the European Union. The customer terminated on the following day the contracts for the implementation and operation of the passenger vehicle toll effective September 30, 2019.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe operating parties of the terminated contract for the project \"Toll collection\" are Kapsch TrafficCom, CTS EVEN-TIM and autoTicket. In December 2019, they jointly asserted claims in the amount of around EUR 560,000 k against the Federal Republic of Germany. The responsible minister is disputing this claim. This matter was therefore need to be resolved before an arbitration tribunal.\n\nIn March 2022 Kapsch TrafficCom received an interim arbitration award which affirms a claim for compensation of autoTicket against the Federal Republic of Germany on the merits. Consequently, in July 2023, an arbitration decision was reached with mutually agreed terms, compelling the Federal Republic of Germany to make a payment of EUR 243,000 k. This arbitration decision yielded a one-time EBIT impact of EUR 79.5 million and a cash inflow of EUR 109.2 million during the financial year.\n\nMTS Maut & Telematik Services GmbH (MTS) is fully consolidated and a 100% subsidiary of Kapsch TrafficCom AG. As a result of the termination of the contract for the automatic control of the toll, the parties of the contract (Kapsch TrafficCom AG and MTS) asserted claims against the Federal Republic of Germany as well.\n\n## 29 Interests in subsidiaries\n\n## Consolidated group.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 the consolidated group (including parent company Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna) consists of 59 entities (March 31, 2023: 59 entities).

This group includes Kapsch TrafficCom AG and its Austrian subsidiaries. Consequently, all income tax effects from the group taxation on these member companies are treated as transactions with a related party. In the 2020/21 financial year, the positive tax allocation from Kapsch TrafficCom to the Austrian tax group leader, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, was adjusted. Since then, deferred tax assets from losses have been recognized instead of short-term tax receivables. The utilization of these loss carryforwards is shown under deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nThe change in trade payables and other liabilities includes a reduction in long-term financial liabilities by EUR 5,083 k due to the capital increase and an increase in trade payables by EUR 4,418 k to KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\nKAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, the majority shareholder of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, participated in the capital increase in proportion to its existing 63.291% shareholding. This participation was made through contributions in kind (receivables from Kapsch TrafficCom AG). KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH acquired 822,783 new shares, equivalent to 63.291% of the new shares issued, through these contributions. The value of the 822,783 new shares raised via contributions in kind amounts to EUR 7.4 million, representing a 5.75% share of the increased share capital. These new shares were also pledged to banks by KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\n## Affiliated companies.\n\nTrade payables decreased by EUR 3,498 k to Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft and by EUR 2,489 k to Kapsch Partner Solutions.\n\nIn connection with the use of the Kapsch trademark and logo, the Group is charged license fees by Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft, Vienna. These fees amount to 0.5% of the Group's total net sales to third parties. The expenses incurred for this in the 2023/24 financial year amounted to EUR 2,696 k (2022/23: EUR 2,501 k).\n\nServices in the field of Human Resources (payroll accounting, administration, recruiting, labor law consulting, personnel development, and personnel secondments) and the provision of apprentices and trainees are centrally provided for the Group by Kapsch Partner Solutions GmbH, Vienna. As of March 1, 2024, the Human Resources department was transferred from Kapsch Partner Solutions GmbH, Vienna, to Kapsch TrafficCom AG. In the 2023/24 financial year, expenses for this services amounted to EUR 1,484 k (2022/23: EUR 1,269 k) for the Group.\n\nFurthermore, in the 2023/24 financial year, transactions with the affiliated company Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft for license fees amounted to EUR 2,691 k. In addition, Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft charged Kapsch TrafficCom AG for the use of the consolidation software and the reallocation of a membership fee. Other expenses of the Group from transactions with affiliated companies related to insurance contracts amounting to EUR 52 k (2022/23: EUR 368 k),\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nwhich cover several Group companies. The remaining expenses to affiliated companies concerned other goods and services provided to the Group.\n\nThe expenses from transactions with affiliated companies in the 2023/24 financial year included the costs for the provision of the central consolidation system by Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft amounting to EUR 137 k (2022/23: EUR 128 k).\n\nAdditionally, affiliated companies supplied hardware (IT equipment) and provided maintenance and services for various customer projects on behalf of the Group amounting to EUR 57 k (2022/23: EUR 200 k).\n\nThe rental income of the Group from subleasing to affiliated companies amounted to EUR 0 k in the 2023/24 financial year (2022/23: EUR 6 k). The remaining revenues with affiliated companies related to other goods and services provided.\n\n## Associated companies and joint ventures.\n\nThe change in trade receivables and other long- and short-term assets from joint ventures relates to the repayment of loans by autoTicket GmbH, which were included in the consolidated financial statements in the previous year with a balance of EUR 12,274 k.\n\nThe liabilities from trade payables and other liabilities to joint ventures, as well as the expenses to joint ventures included in the previous year, are attributable to the consortium MyConsorzio, which is reported as an other investment starting from the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nIn March 2024, the shares in the associate company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, were sold. The expenses from associated companies include the reversal of an impairment for a loan, which was impaired in the previous year and repaid in the 2023/24 financial year, amounting to EUR 2,350 k, as well as the disposal of the investment amounting to EUR -2,230 k (2022/23: EUR -2,350 k).\n\nIncome from joint ventures amounted to EUR 53 k in the 2023/24 financial year (2022/23: EUR 170 k) and mainly includes interest charges to autoTicket GmbH, Germany.\n\n## Other related parties.\n\nThe pension obligations to other related parties are included in trade payables and other liabilities including pension benefits and contain a pension obligation (pensions in payment) to the widow of Karl Kapsch, a former board member of Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft.\n\nDetails of compensation and other payments to executive bodies are presented in note 37.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 32 Risk management.\n\nIn regard to the risks of the Group as well as risk management, we refer to item 2.2 in the management report for the Group. The impact of financial risks as described in the management report for the Group, in particular foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, is disclosed in the following:\n\n## 32.1 Foreign exchange risk.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk. This risk originates from business transactions that are executed in a currency which is not in conformity with the functional currency of the respective subsidiary (hereinafter referred to as \"foreign currency\"). The foreign exchange risk exists in relation to assets and liabilities as well as net investments of foreign business locations not in the Euro zone. During the consolidation process these positions have to be translated to the Group currency Euro.\n\nFrom Group perspective, the most relevant foreign currency was the US Dollar in the financial year 2023/24. Because the terms of agreement are stipulated in Euro, no foreign exchange risk arises in the Group with regard to the Belorussian ruble.\n\nCustomer orders are mainly invoiced in the local currencies of the respective Group companies. Only in cases in which the Group expects to be exposed to significant foreign exchange risk, major orders denominated in foreign currencies are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\nArgentina has been classified as a hyperinflationary country since July 1, 2018. The remeasurement in accordance with IAS 29 has been made. The financial statements including comparative figures have been adjusted due to the change in public purchasing power of the Argentine Peso. In the financial year 2023/24 the expenses from hyperinflation adjustment amounted to EUR 7,007 k (2022/23, adjusted: EUR 5,109 k).\n\nThe following table simulates the effect of changes in the exchange rate on the result before taxes. To do so a change in exchange rate of ceteris paribus +/-10% relating to current and non-current receivables and payables as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively has been assumed. The line \"EUR\" in the table below shows the total impact ceteris paribus of the change to the Euro on the result before taxes for all subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the Euro. The impact on equity would be insignificantly different.\n\n|          | Effect on result before taxes |                 |                 |                 |\n|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|          | 2022/23                       |                 | 2023/24         |                 |\n| Currency | Volatility +10%               | Volatility -10% | Volatility +10% | Volatility -10% |\n| USD      | -8,406                        | 10,322          | -7,322          | 8,950           |\n| ZAR      | 166                           | -203            | 1,129           | -1,380          |\n| SEK      | 560                           | -684            | 331             | -404            |\n| GBP      | 54                            | -66             | -17             | 21              |\n| BGN      | -1,128                        | 1,379           | 1,113           | -1,361          |\n| EUR      | 3,338                         | -5,210          | 4,339           | -5,303          |\n\n## 32.2 Interest rate risk.\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk arising from fluctuations in the value of financial instruments, other balance sheet items (e.g. receivables and payables) and/or cash flows due to fluctuations in the market interest rates. For fixed interest balance sheet items, the risk comprises the present value risk. In case the market interest rate for the financial instrument fluctuates, either a profit or a loss may result if the financial instrument is sold prior to maturity.\n\nIn the case of variable interest balance sheet items, the risk relates to the cash flow. With variable interest financial instruments, adjustments in the interest rates may result from changes in the market interest rates. Such changes would entail changes in interest payments. The portion of variable interest-bearing financial liabilities (financial liabilities and lease liabilities) amounts to 64%. If the market interest rate had been 50 basis points higher (lower) (+/- 0.5%) as of March 31, 2024, this, as in the previous year, would not have had any material impact on the result of the Group. In the Group, derivative instruments exist to minimize interest rate risk of financial liabilities.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 32.3 Liquidity risk.\n\nThe ongoing monitoring, control and measurement of financial and liquidity positions is carried out at the level of the operational entities, is monitored and optimized in the overall group.\n\nThe Group provides sufficient liquidity by maintaining suitable financial reserves, by issuing bonds, through customer prepayments and the continuous reconciliation of the terms of receivables, liabilities and financial assets. To this end, cash flow forecasts are prepared at regular intervals for short-term periods (the next twelve weeks), on a quarterly basis for the medium term (current financial year) as well as for long-term periods (in accordance with long-term payment obligations, particularly those arising from loans). Suitable measures for ensuring sufficient liquidity are then deducted from these forecasts.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom avoids becoming dependent on individual banks by making sure that the financial structure is always distributed over several partner financial institutions. Major repayment obligations of typically long-term contracts (such as corporate bonds or maturing repayments of long-term loans) are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate measures are initiated at an early stage (either cash flow monitoring or timely refinancing) to ensure agreed payment obligations.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom employs a risk-averse investment strategy. Liquid funds are held such that they are generally available in the short term and can therefore be used quickly whenever needed. When it comes to securities, conservative security funds, which are actively managed on an ongoing basis and include an appropriate share of bonds, are used as a rule for the coverage and hedging of pension obligations. In the event of international financial market turbulence, however, the financial investments made might still develop unfavorably or individual securities might even become untradeable. This might result in reductions in value and impairments, which in turn have a negative impact on the financial result and equity of Kapsch TrafficCom. Such a crisis also increases the default risk of individual issuers of securities or their customers. In addition, the Group might for strategic reasons acquire a direct interest in individual entities by purchasing shares. A sufficiently bad performance of these entities might also necessitate an impairment, which in turn leads to the mentioned negative impact on the financial result and equity.\n\nCash flows (gross cash flows including interest) show the liquidity risk of future periods and are split into:\n\n- First half year of the next financial year\n- Second half year of the next financial year\n- Between 1 and 2 years\n- Between 2 and 3 years\n- Between 3 and 4 years\n- Between 4 and 5 years\n- More than 5 years\n\nThis information is included in note 23 and 24.\n\n## 32.4 Credit risk.\n\nAs part of the Group's risk management policy, the Group only engages in business relationships with third parties deemed to be creditworthy and has implemented policies to ensure that the Group sells only to customers with appropriate credit histories. In addition, the Group monitors its receivables balances on an ongoing basis in order to limit its exposure to bad debts. Kapsch TrafficCom endeavors to reduce the risk of customer default as best as possible by obligatory credit checks before contract signing or, in the case of large projects, by additionally collateralizing payments. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely ruled out that there will be individual payment defaults that would have a material negative impact on the earnings and liquidity development of Kapsch TrafficCom in the case of an event of default.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the case of large toll collection projects, there is a credit risk essentially in the phase of the construction of the toll system. There is no concentration of credit risk relating to trade receivables since the Group generally has a large number of customers worldwide. Based on the Group's experiences, the default risk for trade receivables can be considered low. The maximum credit risk corresponds to the following book values:\n\n|                                                    | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Other non-current financial assets and investments | 16,217         | 4,135          |\n| Non-current contract assets                        | 3,867          | 2,603          |\n| Non-current lease receivables                      | 741            | 225            |\n| Other non-current assets                           | 3,571          | 5,755          |\n| Other current financial assets                     | 1,909          | 1,375          |\n| Current contract assets                            | 82,213         | 77,954         |\n| Trade receivables and other current assets         | 117,438        | 131,000        |\n| Current lease receivables                          | 567            | 474            |\n| Current income tax receivables                     | 4,873          | 5,005          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 45,228         | 33,376         |\n| Total                                              | 276,623        | 261,902        |\n\n## 33 Capital management.\n\nCapital management pursues value-oriented and sustainable corporate management on the basis of the income statement in individual operating segments. Key performance indicators for the balance sheet and other economic criteria as well as the long-term development of the Group are also monitored and included in the management. Capital management is considered to be a central element for ensuring the medium- and long-term going concern. An important indicator for the capital structure is the equity ratio calculated from the equity (including non-controlling interests) as a percentage of the balance sheet total. The capital management strategy at Kapsch TrafficCom also aims, among other things, at ensuring that Group companies have sufficient equity to meet local requirements. On the Group level, the aim is that the equity ratio in the financial year should remain within a range of roughly 25% to 35% on average. A major key performance indicator that is also often used in the covenants of the Group's loan agreements is the \"Gearing in relation to EBITDA\". Here, the Group is aiming for a range between 2.0 and 3.5. It indicates whether there is a balanced relationship between the company's net debt and operating earnings power. The Group is constantly checking the observance of all the covenants in connection with loan agreements.\n\nIn the past financial year 2023/24, the Group significantly improved both key figures. The equity ratio increased from 10.7% to 18.8% and net debt in relation to EBITDA was reduced from 6.88 (adjusted) to 1.20. This was due to several factors. This was due to several factors: on the one hand, the Group achieved an outstandingly successful consolidated result in the past financial year; on the other hand, the Group was able to increase its equity through the successful placement of new shares and used the cash inflow from Germany mostly to reduce its financial debt. As a result, the Group significantly exceeded the key figures agreed with the banks at all points.\n\nThe Group's own target and value for the equity ratio has therefore not yet been achieved. Nevertheless, this target remains upright and the Group is aiming to get closer to it over the next few years through active capital management and to achieve it again as quickly as possible. The measures introduced to reduce costs and increase efficiency should also contribute to this.\n\nAnother important goal is the securing of sufficient liquidity necessary in the short and long term to ensure a successful going concern. As in previous years, also in the financial year 2023/24 the Group attached the greatest importance to active liquidity management (both by monitoring the Group-wide amount of liquidity daily and substantially increasing the reliability of the weekly 12-week cash flow forecasts). Also the payment management was professionalized in the financial year and, for example, the essential and long-standing suppliers and business partners have made corresponding payment agreements.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of May 31, 2023, a strategically important restructuring of the Group's financing was successfully finalised with the main banks of Kapsch TrafficCom AG (see note 23). Part of this agreement is the implementation of measures to improve net working capital and liquidity. In May 2024 an extension of this agreement until March 31, 2026 was agreed (see note 36).\n\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 33.4 million as of the balance sheet date. The related decrease compared to the previous year (March 31, 2023: EUR 45.2 million) is due to the scheduled repayment in financial liabilities of EUR 85 million and also lease liabilities of EUR 7.7 million. In total, additional loans amounting EUR 5.3 million were taken out. Furthermore, the change in net working capital in the amount EUR -5.1 million – in particular, trade accounts payable were reduced by EUR 12.1 million – contributed to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNet debt was reduced by EUR 80.3 million in the past financial year.\n\nBesides the mentioned short and medium term targets for liquidity, repayment, and refinancing, the financing of the future course of growth and maintaining and optimal capital structure are also major goals in the Group's capital management over the medium and long term.\n\nNet debt and gearing in relation to EBITDA as well as gearing and the equity ratio as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                                   | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Non-current financial liabilities | 58,472         | 91,906         |\n| Current financial liabilities     | 131,170        | 12,751         |\n| Non-current lease liabilities     | 32,199         | 26,932         |\n| Current lease liabilities         | 11,595         | 9,158          |\n| Total financial liabilities       | 233,435        | 140,747        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents         | -45,228        | -33,376        |\n| Other current financial assets    | -1,909         | -1,375         |\n| Net debt                          | 186,299        | 105,996        |\n| Equity                            | 51,306         | 83,423         |\n| Gearing                           | 363.1%         | 127.1%         |\n| EBITDA1)                          | 27,066         | 88,534         |\n| Gearing in relation to EBITDA1)   | 6.88           | 1.20           |\n| Equity ratio                      | 10.7%          | 18.8%          |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/2024, the Group withdrew from its financial investment in Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, and is also taking further steps to withdraw from non-strategic business areas or investments in order to minimise the related risk.\n\n## 34 Accounting and valuation principles.\n\nThe accounting and valuation principles, which form the basis for these consolidated financial statements, were applied unchanged to the previous period and supplemented by new mandatory IFRS and IFRIC applicable from the financial year.\n\n## 34.1 Consolidation.\n\n## 34.1.1 Subsidiaries.\n\nSubsidiaries are all companies (including structured companies) where the Group exerts its control. The control in this sense means that the Group is exposed to fluctuating returns arising from its interest in the subsidiary, is in possession of entitlements to these returns and has the ability to influence such returns by virtue of its position of \n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\npower with respect to the associated company. Subsidiaries are included within the consolidated financial statements (full consolidation) as from the time when the parent company has acquired control over the subsidiary. They are deconsolidated at the time when such control is relinquished.\n\nAll Group internal assets and liabilities, equity, expenses and income as well as unrealized gains and losses from transactions between Group companies are completely eliminated in the course of Group consolidation. In case of consolidation processes affecting profit or loss, income tax effects are taken into consideration and deferred taxes are recognized.\n\n## 34.1.2 Transactions with non-controlling interests.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with equity owners of the Group. Depending on the ownership structure, the Group splits the gains or losses as well as all components of the comprehensive income to the interests of the parent company and the non-controlling interests. Even in the event of a negative balance of the non-controlling interests, the total comprehensive income is attributed to the parent company and the non-controlling interests. For purchases of non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant interest acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity, unless a change in the percentage of shares held leads to a loss of control of the interest.\n\nIf the Group loses its control over any of the companies, the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary are to be removed from the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining interest is to be remeasured at fair value and regarded as the initially recognized value of a financial asset pursuant to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement or as acquisition costs in case of the addition of an interest in an associated company or joint venture. Any resulting gains or losses which are attributable to the controlling interest are recognized in the income statement. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income with respect to the former subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This means that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to the result for the period.\n\n## 34.1.3 Joint arrangements.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.\n\nThe Group differentiates according to the contractual arrangements at which decisions are made unanimously, concerning rights and obligations of the controlling parties between joint ventures and joint operations. Parties belonging to a joint venture enjoy rights to net assets. In the consolidated financial statements, the result, assets and liabilities are included subject to the equity method.\n\nIn the case of the equity method, the interests in joint ventures are initially recognized at acquisition costs. After this, the carrying value of the interests goes up or down according to the share of the Group in profit or loss as well as in any changes in the other comprehensive income of the joint venture. If the share in the (cumulative) losses of a joint venture exceeds the carrying value of the joint venture (including all long-term interests which are to be allocated to the commercial substance after the net investment of the Group in the joint venture), then the Group is not to recognize the excessive loss share unless it has entered into legal or constructive obligations for the joint venture or has made liabilities or provisions for the joint venture. In the case of accumulated losses, a positive carrying amount is only recognised after the accumulated losses have been offset.\n\nUnrealized gains or losses from transactions between Group companies and joint ventures are to be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements in the amount of the share of the Group in the joint venture. Unrealized losses are not eliminated if the transaction gives any indication that there may be an impairment of the asset transferred.\n\nThe accounting and valuation principles of joint ventures correspond to those of the parent company.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nProportional results from joint ventures are split in the presentation in the income statement. Results from joint ventures whose activities and strategic alignments are part of Kapsch TrafficCom's core business are reported in the operating result. Results from other joint ventures are reported in the result before income taxes after the financial result.\n\nIf there are rights to assets and obligations for liabilities as a result of a contractual agreement it is a joint operation. Recognition in the consolidated financial statements is proportional.\n\n## 34.1.4 Associated companies.\n\nAssociated companies are entities in which the Group has a significant but not a controlling influence, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Associated companies are reported using the equity method and initially recognized at acquisition costs. Following the acquisition date, the share of the Group in the result of the associate is recorded in the statement of comprehensive income and the share of changes in other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment being made to the carrying amount of the interest. Dividends received from the associated company reduce the carrying amount of the interest. Goodwill arising on acquisition of associated companies is not separately shown but recorded as part of the carrying amount of associated companies.\n\nIf the percentage of shares held in an associated company is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the profit or loss for the period where appropriate.\n\nThe cumulative shares of the Group in the profits and losses as well as in the other comprehensive income of the associated company after the acquisition are offset against the carrying amount of the investment. If the Group's share in the losses of an associate, including any unsecured receivables, equals or exceeds its interest in that associated company, the Group will not disclose any additional losses. A liability or provision is only recognized if the Group has entered into legal or constructive obligations for the associated company or has made payments for the associated company.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group checks whether there are any indications showing that the investment in an associate is impaired. If this is the case, the impairment requirement is determined as the difference arising from the carrying amount of the interest of the associate and the corresponding recoverable amount and recognized separately in the income statement. Significant unrealized gains from transactions between the Group and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\n\nProportionate results from associated companies are split in the presentation in the income statement. Results from associated companies whose activities and strategic directions are part of the core business of Kapsch TrafficCom are reported in the operating result. Results from other associated companies are reported in the result before income taxes after the financial result.\n\nThe accounting and valuation principles of associated companies correspond substantially to those of the parent company.\n\n## 34.1.5 Business combinations.\n\nBusiness combinations are recognised by the Group using the acquisition method as of the acquisition date. The acquisition date relates to the date of transfer of control to the Group.\n\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition is the fair value of the assets transferred, the equity interests issued by the Group and the liabilities incurred or assumed as at the transaction date. In addition, they include the fair value of any recognized assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in full as incurred.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, any assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed in a business combination are measured at their full fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the entity or result from statutory, contractual or other legal rights. No new restructuring provisions may be recognized\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nwithin the scope of the purchase price allocation. Any remaining positive differences, which compensate the seller with market opportunities that cannot be identified more closely and with development potential, are capitalized as goodwill in the respective cash generating units (CGUs).\n\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is measured in accordance with IFRS 9 and a resulting profit or loss recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\n\nAny hidden reserves and liabilities uncovered are carried forward in line with the corresponding assets and liabilities. The determination of the fair values requires certain estimates and assumptions, in particular of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, of the liabilities assumed as well as of the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's net assets.\n\nThe Group determines the goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n\n- the fair value of the consideration transferred plus\n- the value recognized of all recognized non-controlling interests in the acquiree plus\n- the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree if the combination is achieved in stages – less\n- the net amount (in general of the fair values) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities.\n\nIf the excess is negative, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognized only upon re-examination of the allocation directly in the result for the period.\n\n## 34.1.6 Non-current assets held for sale.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, Kapsch TrafficCom indirectly holds 82.9% of the shares in TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited (TMT), South Africa, through its subsidiary KTC-ZA Holding Proprietary Limited, South Africa. TMT is a provider of road safety law enforcement solutions and automatic fare collection for public transportation. By the year-end, a negotiated purchase price agreement for the sale of TMT was already in place, so the criteria of IFRS 5 are considered met. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of TMT have been classified as 'held for sale.' The closing occurred in April 2024.\n\nAn overview of the assets and liabilities held for sale can be found in the following table:\n\n|                                                    | March 31, 2024 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                      | 1,594          |\n| Intangible assets                                  | 3              |\n| Other non-current financial assets and investments | 292            |\n| Deferred tax assets                                | 939            |\n| Trade receivables and other current assets         | 4,814          |\n| Current contract assets                            | 348            |\n| Current tax receivables                            | 74             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 2,929          |\n|                                                    |                |\n| Non-current lease liabilities                      | 140            |\n| Current financial liabilities                      | 1,931          |\n| Current lease liabilities                          | 149            |\n| Trade payables                                     | 979            |\n| Current contract liabilities                       | 2              |\n| Current provisions                                 | 276            |\n| Other liabilities and deferred income              | 529            |\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe criteria were met shortly before the balance sheet date, meaning that ongoing depreciation and amortisation has not been terminated, as no material effect is expected. Only property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets fall under the measurement assessment of IFRS 5, and therefore, no impairment is expected due to immateriality.\n\n## 34.1.7 Foreign currency translation.\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is Kapsch TrafficCom's presentation currency.\n\n## Translation of foreign financial statements.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, financial statements of foreign subsidiaries (except for foreign entities from hyperinflationary countries) that have a functional currency different from the Euro which are included in the consolidated financial statements are translated as follows:\n\nThe statement of comprehensive income of foreign entities is translated into the Group's presentation currency at average exchange rates of the financial year, balance sheets at the prevailing closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The reference rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Deutsche Bundesbank, which are accessible via the Austrian Central Bank's (Österreichische Nationalbank) website, serve as the basis for the translation. If no current exchange rates are available, this will result in the use of the exchange rates as disclosed by the national banks that are derived from market information providers (Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters). Differences arising from the currency translation of foreign operations into Euro are recognized in other comprehensive income and collected in equity. If control of the foreign entity is lost, exchange rate differences accumulated in equity are reclassified and presented as part of the gain/loss from the disposal.\n\nPursuant to IAS 29, a separate measurement is required for hyperinflationary countries. As in accordance with IAS 21, monetary items are translated into the reporting currency of the Group using the prevailing closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured either at adjusted cost, or at net realizable value or at fair value. Argentina has been classified as a hyperinflationary country since July 1, 2018. All items in the statement of comprehensive income are to be restated as of the date of initial recognition of the income and expenses in the financial statements, using the general price index. A restatement in accordance with IAS 29 applies. Effects from hyperinflation are included in the financial result and in equity.\n\nAs the business activities of Kapsch TrafficCom in Russia are not material, there is no significant risk from the fluctuations of the Russian ruble.\n\nGoodwill and adjustments to the fair value in connection with the acquisition of a foreign company are treated as the assets and liabilities of the foreign company in question and converted in the course of initial consolidation at the transaction rate and subsequently converted with the key date exchange rate as at the financial statements key date of the business operation.\n\n|     | 2022/23               |                                        | 2023/24               |                                        |\n|-----|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     | Average exchange rate | Exchange rate as at balance sheet date | Average exchange rate | Exchange rate as at balance sheet date |\n| AUD | 1.52                  | 1.63                                   | 1.65                  | 1.66                                   |\n| CAD | 1.38                  | 1.47                                   | 1.46                  | 1.47                                   |\n| GBP | 0.86                  | 0.88                                   | 0.86                  | 0.86                                   |\n| SEK | 10.81                 | 11.28                                  | 11.49                 | 11.53                                  |\n| USD | 1.05                  | 1.09                                   | 1.08                  | 1.08                                   |\n| ZAR | 17.67                 | 19.33                                  | 20.29                 | 20.52                                  |\n\nThe main exchange rates used during the financial year are shown below:\n\n## Foreign currency transactions.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate as of the transaction date or, in case of new measurements, as at the time of the measurement. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary items \n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nin the balance sheet, which are capitalized at costs in a foreign currency are translated with the exchange rate applicable at the day of the transaction; non-monetary items which were recognized at the fair value in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of measurement.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses which are attributable to the translation of cash and cash equivalents as well as financial receivables and financial liabilities are presented in the statement of comprehensive income within the financial result. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income in other operating income or other operating expenses.\n\nThis excludes foreign exchange gains and losses from monetary items to be received from/to be paid to foreign operations which are designated as part of a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Such foreign exchange gains and losses are initially recognized in other comprehensive income and are then reclassified from equity to profit or loss if the net investment is sold (see note 11).\n\n## 34.2 Fair value measurement.\n\nThe fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n\nTo the greatest extent possible, the Group uses observable market data for the fair value measurement of assets or liabilities. Depending on the availability of observable input factors and their impact on the fair value measurement as a whole, the fair value is assigned to one of 3 levels in the following fair value-hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date.\n- Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n- Level 3: Inputs at this level are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\n\n## 34.3 Revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". Assessment of each contract is based on the five-step model:\n\n- Identify the contract with a customer\n- Identify the performance obligations\n- Determine the transaction price\n- Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations\n- Recognize revenue either over time or at a point in time\n\nA customer is defined as a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities in exchange for a consideration. It is assessed if the contracts meet the criteria in accordance with IFRS 15.9, in particular the enforceable right to consideration. It is furthermore assessed if the consideration the identity is entitled to is enforceable and revenue is probable (see note 32.4. Credit risk).\n\nThe Group identified the following performance obligations:\n\nImplementation projects include the construction of toll collection systems for both individual road sections and nationwide road networks as well as the construction of systems for traffic monitoring, traffic control and traffic safety. Components such as on-board units which are necessary for putting the system into a condition ready for operation, are considered part of the implementation projects. Major software upgrades that are agreed in operation projects as well as implementation within the context of service concession arrangement also fall under this performance obligation.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nImplementation projects meet the criteria for \"satisfaction of the performance obligation over time\", as the Group creates assets that do not have an alternative use and the Group thus has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The stage of completion is derived from the ratio of the costs already incurred and the estimated total costs of the corresponding order.\n\nOperation projects mainly include the operation and maintenance of toll collection systems for both individual road sections and nation-wide road networks as well as the operation and maintenance of systems for traffic monitoring, traffic control and traffic safety. Operation within the context of service concession contracts also falls under this performance obligation.\n\nRevenue from operation projects is recognized over time since the customer receives the benefits as the entity performs.\n\nThe sale of components that are not made under an implementation or operation project also constitutes a separate performance obligation. As for the sale of components, revenue is recognized as the control of the component is transferred.\n\nThere are no warranty obligations beyond those required by law.\n\nThe transaction price is mostly fixed but some contracts may also contain elements of variable consideration which are usually bonuses or penalties. They are taken into account if and to the extent that the payment is probable or if penalties are improbable. The transaction price typically refers to the price of the individual performance obligation as the price is set on basis of the costs including a reasonable margin. Cross-subsidizations are not part of the business model of Kapsch TrafficCom. It is therefore for most contracts not necessary to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations. For service concession arrangements, the transaction price is estimated for each performance obligation. In such cases, allocation is made based on the expected-cost-plus-margin approach. For contracts with a significant financing component, the consideration is adjusted by the interest component.\n\nContract assets are capitalized if the services are rendered before the consideration is received. Contract liabilities are recognized if the amount of consideration exceeds the amount of performance rendered. Service concession arrangements including the concession right to receive fees result in an intangible asset. That intangible asset increases with construction progress, thus revenue is recognized according to the stage of completion.\n\nCertain costs arising in the course of initiating or performing a contract have to be recognized under IFRS 15 if the criteria are met. Those costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term of the project.\n\nOther income is recognized by the Group as follows:\n\n- Revenue from recharged expenses is recognized on the basis of the accumulated amounts in accordance with the respective agreements,\n- Interest income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method,\n- Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## 34.4 Segment information.\n\nThe reporting on operating segments is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision- maker (management approach). The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources to the operating segments and assessing their performance. The Executive Board of Kapsch TrafficCom has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.5 Property, plant and equipment.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recognized at acquisition and production cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets in accordance with the group policies.\n\nProperties are not subject to scheduled depreciation. The useful lives generally range between 5 to 26 years for plants and buildings on leasehold land, 4 to 20 years for technical equipment and machinery, and 3 to 10 years for other equipment, factory, and office equipment. The assets' useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, in case of evidence leading to an adjustment. An asset's carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The impairment test is carried out in accordance with IAS 36 and is described in chapter 34.7.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of those assets which were replaced is derecognized. Expenses for repairs and maintenance which do not necessitate a significant replacement investment (i.e. day-today servicing) are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nThe difference between the proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and the carrying amount is recognized as profit or loss in the result from operating activities.\n\n## 34.6 Intangible assets.\n\n## 34.6.1 Goodwill.\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries. It represents the excess of the consideration transferred for the acquisition beyond the Group's interest in net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities.\n\nGoodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Group carries out the annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter. In addition, the Group carries out impairment tests during the year if a triggering event occurs that may cause the asset to be impaired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs) or groups of cash generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and have reported the goodwill. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe impairment loss of goodwill is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. No write-ups on goodwill are made.\n\n## 34.6.2 Concessions and rights.\n\nComputer software, trademarks, and similar rights are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred for acquisition and amortized linearly over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 15 years. Acquired customer agreements (toll contracts, maintenance agreements) are recognized at acquisition costs and amortized over estimated useful lives that generally range between 2 and 10 years.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.6.3 Research and development costs.\n\nResearch expenditures are recognized as an expense. Costs incurred for development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognized as intangible assets if the following criteria are fulfilled:\n\n- It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;\n- management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\n- there is an opportunity to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- adequate technical, financial, and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and\n- the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.\n\nOther development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognized as an expense. The costs for producing the intangible asset are capitalized as from the point in time when the above criteria are initially met. Development costs previously recognized as an expense cannot be subsequently capitalized. Capitalized development costs are amortized, as soon as they are available for use, using the straight-line method on the basis of the normal useful life, which generally ranges between 3 and 15 years.\n\nCapitalized development assets are tested for impairment annually in accordance with IAS 36 as long as they are not yet available for use.\n\n## 34.7 Impairment of non-financial assets.\n\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use – are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in use. At entity level an impairment is posted if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognised. Hereon at the level for cash generating units the goodwill is tested. First, the goodwill is amortized by the amount of the impairment. If the impairment is higher than the carrying amount of the goodwill, the carrying amounts of the other assets of these cash-generating units (CGUs) are proportionately reduced.\n\nThe value in use of a cash generating unit corresponds to the present value, calculated using the discounted cash flow method, of the future cash flows which the entity will receive from the cash generating unit. In order to determine the value in use, the expected future cash flows plus taxes based on the post-tax discount rate that reflects the current market expectations with regard to the interest effect and the specific risks of the cash generating units, are discounted to their present values. In the process, the current planning, covering a period of four years (detailed forecast period) and approved by Management, is used as the basis with subsequent transition to perpetuity. The growth rates according to the detailed forecast period are based on historical growth rates and on external studies on the future medium-term market development.\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell is determined using an appropriate valuation model which is based on the medium-term planning.\n\nThe difference between the recoverable amount of assets and their carrying value is reported as profit (in the case of a reversal of an impairment loss) or loss in the operating result. Profits are not reported as revenues. For assets (other than goodwill) for which an impairment loss has been recognized in the past, a check is carried out on each subsequent balance sheet date to determine if any reversal of impairment is required.\n\nThe residual carrying values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted as necessary.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.8 Borrowing costs.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are capitalized to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. A qualifying asset is an asset that requires a substantial period of time (with regard to the Group at least twelve months) to be made ready for its intended use or sale.\n\nInvestment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization within a specific period.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, the criteria for a qualified asset were not fulfilled for any assets.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## 34.9 Government grants.\n\nGovernment grants with regard to purchased non-current assets are deferred and taken through profit or loss over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. Government grants are recognized at their fair value, provided it is virtually certain that the Group will comply with all attached conditions and the grant will be received.\n\nDue to materiality considerations, government grants are not disclosed separately in the financial statements but are included in other current liabilities and deferred income.\n\nOther grants received as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred are immediately taken through profit or loss and included in other operating income.\n\nAlso grants referring to the COVID-19-pandemic and for reliefs of the effects of the pandemic fall under this point and thus are included in other operating income in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## 34.10 Leasing.\n\nIFRS 16 \"Leases\" specifies the recognition, measurement, presentation as well as disclosure requirements with regard to leases in financial statements. As for Kapsch TrafficCom, this mainly relates to buildings, motor vehicles and IT equipment. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset on the underlying asset and a liability that represents its liability to lease payments. Extension and termination options are recognized if virtually certain.\n\nThe lessor continues to distinguish between finance or operating leases for accounting purposes. Kapsch Traffic-Com has sub-leasing contracts with affiliated companies as well as the parent company and therefore discloses lease receivables instead of right-of-use assets from leases. which are classified as finance leases. The Group only acts as lessor to an insignificant extent, and thus does not expect any material impact on the Group's financial statements from such leases.\n\nThe Group applies exemptions regarding short-term leases with a term of not more than twelve months and leases of low-value assets (around EUR 5 k). Those leases will not be recognized in the balance sheet, instead, payments made for such leases will continue to be recognized as expenses.\n\nFor the calculation of the present value of liabilities from leasing contracts the incremental borrowing rate according to the corresponding maturity is calculated and applied. The incremental borrowing rate is derived from a risk free rate of the corresponding maturity, adjusted for country, currency and enterprise risks.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.11 Financial instruments.\n\nFinancial instruments include financial assets (such as securities, investments, loans, trade receivables, and cash and cash equivalents) as well as financial liabilities (such as bonds and loans, trade payables, and derivative financial instruments).\n\nFinancial instruments are first recognized at fair value.\n\n## 34.11.1 Financial assets.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets are subdivided as follows:\n\n- amortized cost,\n- fair value through profit or loss or\n- fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe classification is based on whether the instrument is classified as equity or debt.\n\nGenerally, equity investments are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss. In the case of equity instruments that are not held for trading, in accordance with IFRS 9, an entity can make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to classify equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (without recycling). The assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income without recycling. The gains and losses resulting from these assets are recognised in other comprehensive income without recycling.\n\nFair values are determined by transactions in an active market or, where there is no active market, by applying valuation techniques.\n\nAll purchases or sales are recognised on the settlement date and the cost of acquisition includes transaction costs. In the case of investments in debt instruments, the classification is based on the company's business model or managing financial assets and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost if they meet the following two conditions and are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss:\n\n- they are held in a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows and\n- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. If not material, they are not discounted. Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and parts of other financial receivables and assets fall into this category.\n\nFinancial assets that are neither held in the business model to collect the contractual cash flows nor held in the business model to collect and sell the contractual cash flows are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Assets may be designated or also fall into this category if the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding. The assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. The fair values are determined through transactions on an active market or, if there is no active market, by using valuation techniques. Debt instruments that do not include solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding, and derivative financial instruments fall into this category. Such derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency risks continue to be accounted for as hedging instruments in accordance with IAS 39.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are such debt instruments that are held in the business model hold to collect the contractual cash flows and sell, and that are solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding. Those financial assets that fulfill the requirement of the FVOCI-business model and that are not optional designated at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income. The fair values are determined through transactions on an active market or, if there is no active market, by using valuation techniques. When financial assets are disposed, the difference between the proceeds from the disposal and the carrying amount is recognized as expense or income in the statement of comprehensive income. The amount stated in equity is additionally recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial instruments whose maturity does not exceed twelve months after the balance sheet date are stated as current assets, all others are stated as non-current assets.\n\n## 34.11.2 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits held at call and other bank balances, which are convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Changes in cash and cash equivalents are presented in the cash flow statement. Overdrafts are reported in the balance sheet under current financial liabilities.\n\n## 34.11.3 Financial liabilities.\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost or at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nFinancial liabilities are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. They are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs incurred and subsequently at amortized cost, taking into account the effective interest method. Financial liabilities with a remaining term of up to one year are reported as current liabilities; if the remaining term is longer, they are reported under non-current liabilities. Liabilities from current accounts are disclosed under current financial liabilities on the balance sheet. Borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income on an accrual basis. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured at the current rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nFinancial liabilities include non-current and current financial liabilities, lease liabilities, trade payables, as well as portions of other liabilities.\n\nThere are no liabilities that were designated at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 34.11.4 Derivative financial instruments.\n\nDerivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into. They are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognizing gains or losses depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has a group-wide treasury policy in place to generally regulate hedging transactions. If necessary the Group documents and recognizes the hedging transactions in accordance with IAS 39. As of March 31, 2024 no cash flow hedges nor fair value hedges are recognized in the financial statements.\n\nIn addition to that, the Group has derivatives that hedge an asset or a liability. They are therefore measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value corresponds to the value which the relevant entity would receive or have to pay upon liquidation of the deal on the balance sheet date. Positive fair values at the balance sheet date are recognized under financial assets and negative fair values under financial liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within the financial result. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are presented in note 15.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the case of net investments in a foreign operation, exchange rate differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reclassified from equity to profit or loss on the sale or partial disposal of the foreign operation or the repayment of the amounts owed.\n\n## 34.11.5 Impairment of financial assets.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, recognition of expected credit losses applies to the following financial assets:\n\n- Trade receivables\n- Contract assets\n- Lease receivables\n- Cash and cash equivalent\n\nThe Group uses for trade receivables as well as for contract assets without a significant financing component and for lease receivables the simplified impairment model and accordingly calculates impairment at the amount of the lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit loss model) based on a provision matrix in which financial assets are structured according to ageing and the respective default rates are determined for different maturity bands. The age structure breaks down as follows: not past due, 1–30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, 91–180 days, 181–270 days, more than 270 days past due. For financial assets Kapsch TrafficCom expects a loss if contractual payments are past due 270 days or more.\n\nIn preparing the provision matrix, historical data on actually incurred defaults as well as forward-looking information and expectations are taken into account by overall estimating a potential loss by Kapsch TrafficCom. For forward-looking information and expectations changes in country specific CDS spreads are taken into account as the CDS-market represents all publicly available information and expectations in regard of market-related changes. The financial assets are allocated to different regions and credit risk and/or the changes to credit risk for the corresponding region are taken into account. Contract assets represent receivables not yet invoiced and do not significantly differ from trade receivables from comparable contracts as regards the risk criteria. Therefore, the same default rates as for receivables not past due are applied. The impairment of lease receivables is not material as of March 31, 2024. Financial assets are written off if no reasonable expectation of recovery exists. For example the debtor is insolvent or no agreement is possible and therefore the cash inflow cannot be anticipated anymore.\n\nAny impairment on cash and cash equivalents would be insignificant and was thus not taken into consideration.\n\nThe Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence of impairment of each significant individual financial asset or group of financial assets. If such evidence exists, the Group accounts for that impairment, and the proportionate loss previously recognized in equity for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income is removed from equity and recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative loss reclassified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in profit or loss. If in subsequent periods the fair value of the impaired financial instrument increases and that increase is directly related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income, the Group reverses the impairment loss.\n\n## 34.12 Inventories.\n\nInventories are stated at cost or, if lower, at net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average price method. Production cost includes all directly attributable expenses and fixed and variable overheads (based on normal operating capacity) incurred in connection with production. It excludes, however, borrowing costs as they cannot be allocated to a qualifying asset. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling expenses.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.13 Employee benefits.\n\nThe Group provides various post-employment benefits to employees and other long-term benefits either based on individual agreements or in accordance with local labor law provisions.\n\nA defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate nongroup entity (fund). The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.\n\nNext to the defined contribution plans, there are defined benefit plans. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service, and compensation.\n\nThe projected unit credit method is used for the calculation of liabilities arising from pension obligations and termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19. According to this method, post-employment costs for employee benefits are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in such a way that scheduled costs are spread over the employees' years of service on the basis of an expert opinion by a qualified actuary, who completely remeasures the schemes annually. The obligations for pension payments are calculated at the present value of future benefits using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds whose term roughly equals the term of the liability. The liability recognized on the balance sheet with respect to defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCosts arising from defined benefit plans from pension obligations and termination benefits include the following components:\n\n- Service costs include current as well as past service costs as well as gains or losses from benefit changes or curtailments. Service costs are recognized in profit or loss within personnel expenses.\n- The net interest cost on the defined benefit obligation or plan asset. This component is included in interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income.\n- Remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation or net asset. These are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\n\nContributions paid by the Group under a defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the statement of comprehensive income under personnel expenses in the period in which they occur.\n\nFor the calculation of liabilities arising from obligations for anniversary bonuses in accordance with IAS 19, the projected unit credit method is used. Anniversary bonuses are special lump-sum payments stipulated in the collective agreement and dependent on compensation and years of service. Eligibility is determined by a certain number of service years. The calculation of liabilities arising from obligations for anniversary bonuses is performed in a similar way as the calculation for liabilities arising from termination benefits. Current service costs are recognized within personnel expenses, net interest costs are recognized in interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income. Remeasurements are recognized within personnel expenses.\n\n## 34.14 Provisions.\n\nProvisions are recognized in the balance sheet in the event of a current legal or constructive obligation to third parties due to past events when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If such a reliable estimate is not possible, no provisions are set up. Provisions are measured based on the present value of the estimated settlement amount. The settlement amount is the best possible estimate of an expense on the basis of which a current obligation might be settled at the balance sheet date or transferred to a third party. This estimate takes into account future cost increases that are foreseeable and likely to occur on the balance sheet date. If material, the provisions are discounted using a pre-tax interest rate that takes into account current market expectations regarding the interest effect and the risks specific to the obligation. Increases in the provision resulting from pure compounding are recognized as interest expense in the income statement.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nProvisions for warranties and liabilities for construction flaws, serial and system problems mainly serve as coverage for obligations for free repairs and replacement deliveries, in accordance with the general sales and delivery conditions or due to individual agreements, and are measured on the basis of the group of obligations, using rates based on past experience regarding direct labor and material costs incurred, overheads, replacement deliveries, or rebates. A provision is recognized for the best estimate of the costs incurred for defects to be rectified under the warranty for products sold before the balance sheet date.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognized if the expected benefit to be derived from the contract is less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the amount from the fulfillment of the contract or any compensation payments in case of non-performance, whichever is lower. The recognition of impairment losses on assets dedicated to such onerous contracts is, however, established prior to the recognition of the provisions for onerous contracts.\n\nProvisions for restructuring are recognized if the criteria of IAS 37 are fulfilled and includes the directly linked costs of restructuring, that are compulsory in the course of the restructuring and not referring to any current activities. Restructuring measure were communicated and started in the financial year 2020/21 in Kapsch TrafficCom. The majority of the measures were carried out in the financial year 2021/22 and 2022/23 and the provision was utilized accordingly.\n\n## 34.15 Current and deferred income tax.\n\nThe tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Only taxes that relate to items recognized in other comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws applicable at the balance sheet date in the countries where the subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. The local Management is responsible together with the local fiscal representative for the preparation of tax returns, particularly relating to matters subject to interpretations and for setting up debt provisions, if reasonable, for amounts payable to tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax assets/liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred tax assets/liabilities arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither IFRS profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss, except for those transactions arising from initial recognition of the leasing in accordance with IFRS 16, they are not recognised. Likewise, deferred taxes are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax assets/liabilities are determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. In addition, it is to be assumed that such temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets for unused tax loss carried forward are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and, in particular in the case of a losses history, there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future against which these unused tax losses can be utilized. A planning horizon of six years is used, with the Group applying appropriate deductions in later planning periods due to greater uncertainties in the utilisation of the loss carry forward.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed annually at the balance sheet date and revalued if it is no longer likely that sufficient taxable income will be available to realize such assets partially or in full.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\n## 34.16 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom classifies non-current assets as \"held for sale\" if the benefit arising from the remaining carrying amount is to be realized predominately through the sale and not through the further use of the asset. The assets are remeasured in accordance with IFRS 5 immediately prior to their classification as \"held for sale\". The assets are subsequently measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is initially allocated to goodwill and subsequently to the other assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, and recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## 34.17 Contingent liabilities.\n\nWith regard to contingent liabilities, the Group classifies the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits as remote, and a liability does not have to be recognized yet pursuant to IFRS.\n\nContingent liabilities occur for two reasons. For one, they comprise possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events that are at least partly beyond the Group's con trol. For another, they comprise present obligations that fail to meet general or special recognition standards (i.e. the amount of an obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability or an outflow of resources to settle the obligations is not deemed probable).\n\n## 34.18 New and amended standards and interpretations that have been adopted by the EU and applied for the first time in financial year 2023/24.\n\n|                                           | New/amended IFRS                                                                                             | Published by the IASB<br>and adopted by the EU | Applicable to<br>financial years<br>beginning on or after | Material impact on<br>group's consolidated<br>financial statements |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IFRS 17                                   | Insurance Contracts                                                                                          | June 2020                                      | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 8                                     | Amendments to IAS 8:<br>Definition of Accounting Estimates                                                   | February 2021                                  | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 1,<br>IFRS<br>Practice<br>Statement 2 | Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS<br>Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of<br>Accounting policies                   | February 2021                                  | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 12                                    | Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax<br>related to Assets and Liabilities arising<br>from a Single Transaction | May 2021                                       | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 12                                    | Amendments to IAS 12: International<br>Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules                                   | May 2021                                       | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n\nThe application did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. IFRS 17 was published in May 2017 as a replacement for IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. The valuation model of IFRS 17 is based on the determination of the current settlement values of insurance contracts, so that their valuations have to be adjusted in each reporting period due to changes in estimates. The new rules will affect the financial statements and key figures of all entities that have insurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary or investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nFrom today's perspective, no significant effects on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group are expected.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nAmendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates. It clarifies how to distinguish between changes in accounting policies and accounting estimates.\n\nThe distinction is important because changes in estimates affect future business prospectively and events, such as changes in accounting methods, however, retrospectively to the past transactions and events and the current period are to be applied.\n\nFrom today's perspective, there are no significant effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations expected.\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies. IAS 1 clarifies that entities shall disclose all material accounting policies. Previously, the standard referred to significant accounting policies. The amendments define what is meant by \"significant accounting policies\" and how to identify them. They also clarify that immaterial information on accounting policies need not be disclosed. However, if it is disclosed, this must not obscure significant information about accounting policies.\n\nFrom today's perspective, there are no significant effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations expected.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single\n\nTransaction. IAS 12 clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommis sioning obligations. The main change in Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) is an exemption from the initial recognition exemption provided in IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24. Accordingly, the initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions in which equal amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition. This is also explained in the newly inserted paragraph IAS 12.22A. According to the amendments, deferred taxes are to be recognised for transactions in which arise taxable and deductible temporary differences of the same amount on initial recognition.\n\nFrom today's perspective, there are no significant effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations expected.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12: International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules are:\n\n- an exception to the requirements in IAS 12 under which an entity does not recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities,\n- deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the OECD's second pillar of income taxes and does not disclose them,\n- an entity shall disclose that it has applied the exception,\n- the requirement for an entity to disclose separately its current tax expense (income) relating to second pillar income taxes,\n- the requirement for an entity to recognise its actual second pillar tax expense (income) in periods when second pillar legislation has been enacted or\n- substantially enacted but not yet substantively enacted, provides known or reasonably estimable,\n- information that helps users of the financial statements to understand the second pillar income taxes resulting from these laws,\n- the requirement for an entity to apply the exemption and the requirement to disclose that it has applied the exemption immediately after the amendments are published and retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8.\n\nFrom today's perspective, no material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations are expected as Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, as Group revenues do not exceed the minimum threshold of EUR 750 million.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.19 Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and that have not been prematurely adopted by the Group.\n\n|        | New/amended IFRS                                                                                                                                  | Published by the IASB<br>and adopted by the EU | Applicable to<br>financial years<br>beginning on or after | Material impact on<br>group's consolidated<br>financial statements |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IAS 1  | Presentation of Financial Statements:<br>Classification of Liabilities as Current or<br>Non-current and Non-current Liabilities<br>with Covenants | January, 2020                                  | January 1, 2024                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 16 | Amendments to IFRS 16: Lease Liability<br>in a Sale and Leaseback                                                                                 | September, 2022                                | January 1, 2024                                           | None                                                               |\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current: Amendments to the requirements introduced by classifying liabilities as current or non-current in relation to how an entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or non-current in particular circumstances: affect only the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position, not the amount or timing of recognition of any asset, liability income or expenses, or the information that entities disclose about those items.\n\nAmendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period and align the wording in all affected paragraphs to refer to the \"right\" to defer settlement by at least twelve months and make explicit that only rights in place \"at the end of the reporting period\" should affect the classification of a liability; clarify that classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability; and make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.\n\nOnly covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current.

These shares were held by a subsidiary of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, KTC-ZA Holding Proprietary Limited, South Africa. The sale resulted in the disposal of assets with a value of EUR 11.0 million and liabilities with a value of EUR 4.0 million. The selling price including variable components is expected to amount to EUR 2.7 million. The overall effects of the deconsolidation will be published in the quarterly highlights for the first quarter of the financial year 2024/25.\n\n## Winning a major infrastructure project in Switzerland.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom AG announced on April 30, 2024 that it had been contracted by the Swiss Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (BAZG) to supply the heavy goods vehicle (HGV) road fee collection system and to manage the technical operation until at least the end of 2032.

The increase in remuneration is primarily due to the profit-based remuneration. Expenses from termination and pension benefits for the Executive Board amounted to EUR 32 k (2022/23: EUR 36 k). In total, this results in total compensation for the Executive Board (before offsetting against provisions) of EUR 3,171 k in the 2023/24 financial year (2022/23: EUR 1,974 k).\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, the following persons served on the Supervisory Board:\n\n- Franz Semmernegg (Chairman)\n- Harald Sommerer (Deputy-Chairman)\n- Sabine Kauper (until September 6, 2023)\n- Monika Brodey (from September 6, 2023)\n- Sonja Hammerschmid\n\nDelegated by the works council:\n\n- Christian Windisch\n- Claudia Rudolf-Misch (until November 22, 2023)\n- Robert Kutschera (from November 22, 2023)\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe compensation paid to the members of the Supervisory Board in the financial year 2023/24 amounted to EUR 120 k (2022/23: EUR 120 k).\n\nAs in previous years, no advances or loans were granted to members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board, nor were any guarantees issued in their favor.\n\n## Proposed appropriation of retained earnings.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement on the financial restructuring, the Executive Board will propose to the 2024 Annual General Meeting not to distribute a dividend for the financial year 2023/24 and to carry forward the retained earnings to new account.\n\nAuthorized for issue:\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\nAlfredo Escribá Gallego Executive Board member\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Statement of all Members of the Executive Board.*\n\n## *Pursuant to Sec. 124 (1) Stock Exchange Act 2018.*\n\nWe declare to the best of our knowledge that the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group as required by the applicable accounting standards, that the Consolidated Management Report gives a true and fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, so that a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group is obtained and that the Consolidated Management Report describes the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group.\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\nSignature\n\nAlfredo Escribá Gallego Executive Board member\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *Auditor's Report Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements.*\n\n## Audit Opinion.\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2024, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply with legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2024, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs) and the additional requirements under section 245a Austrian Company Code.\n\n## Basis for Opinion.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing. Those standards require the application of the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of the auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n## Key Audit Matters.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe have structured key audit matters as follows:\n\n- Description\n- Audit approach and key observations\n- Reference to related disclosures\n\n## 1 Recoverability of the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units including goodwill.\n\n## Description.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements contain goodwill in the amount of EUR 22,735 k under the item intangible assets, of which EUR 11,771 k is allocated to the cash-generating unit Tolling-Americas and EUR 7,371 k to the cash-generating unit Tolling-APAC. The Group carries out an impairment test at least once a year and if evidence occurs indicating impairment (impairment test in accordance with IAS 36). In the financial year 2023/24, the impairment test did not indicate a need for impairment. Moreover, the consolidated financial statements as at March 31, 2024 include other intangible assets in the amount of EUR 5,140 k and property, plant and equipment in the amount of EUR 45,960 k.\n\nThe CGU Tolling-Americas includes goodwill whose recoverability is significantly determined by business development in North America. In this region, significant losses were incurred in the prior financial years which mainly result from considerable cost overruns and adjustments to planned costs and margins for material projects. As a result, the management identified, resolved on and implemented measures which are expected to lead to a positive development of results in the future. In North America, the financial year 2023/24 was still significantly affected by these restructuring measures and by a period of consolidation and reorganization. Margins for some implementation projects in the US also had to be further adjusted. There is still a negative contribution to earnings in the CGU Tolling-Americas in the amount of EUR -13,192 k (prior year: EUR -20,652 k). Based on the impairment test, no need for impairment exists for the CGUs Tolling-Americas and TM-Americas, with recoverability depending on achieving the return to profitable business planning in the future.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in March 2022, sanctions resulted in an impact on Kapsch TrafficCom's business in Belarus and are presented in the CGU Tolling-EMEA. Despite the existing sanctions and the associated supply restrictions, there are currently no material negative effects, especially in the important operation of the Austrian-wide toll system for cars and trucks, which runs until 2032. The planning calculation on which the impairment test is based assumes stable ongoing operations. No need for impairment exists for this CGU as at March 31, 2024.\n\nTesting carrying amounts of cash-generating units including goodwill for impairment requires significant estimates to be made by management regarding the future market development and the probability of winning individual major contracts during the planning period. This is particularly true for implementation projects with regard to tolling systems in the Tolling segment, where the order inflow is very volatile and contracts are usually awarded based on invitations to tender, which usually is associated with certain uncertainties. Moreover, there is significant area of judgement involved in the valuation, in particular with regard to the discount rate and the assumptions for the terminal value. With regard to the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of goodwill due to these estimation uncertainties and it was therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of significant forward-looking estimates and significant assumptions to derive the future cash flows as well as whether the calculation model used complies with the requirements of IAS 36. Internal evaluation experts were partly involved.\n\nWithin our audit and by partly involving our evaluation experts, we first gained an understanding of the planning logic, the planning process and the planning model as well as the impairment test (identification and definition of cash-generating units, determination of the recoverable amount, analysis of impairment, determination of discount rate and growth rate as well as calculation model).\n\nWe examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the plan prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. We analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (revenue growth, earnings margin, working capital, investment planning) as well as the essential risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them in meetings with the management. The parameters used to determine a discount rate in line with the risk level and the assumptions relating to the long-term growth rate were checked by means of external market and industry data, and the calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy. Further, we evaluated whether the disclosures on impairment testing provided in the notes are appropriate. This included, in particular, the assessment and recalculation of sensitivity analyses performed to assess the risk of possible deviations from revenues and earnings assumptions as well as from the discount and growth rates used.\n\nThe valuation model used by the Company is appropriate to carry out an impairment test as required by IFRS (impairment test in accordance with IAS 36). The assumptions and valuation parameters used in the valuation are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by IAS 36 are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nFurther information on this key audit matter is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note 12 \"Property, plant and equipment\", 13 \"Intangible assets\" and note 34.6.1 \"Goodwill\" in section 34 \"Accounting and valuation principles\".\n\n## 2 Estimates and assumptions regarding the recognition of revenue from implementation projects.\n\n## Description.\n\nA significant part of the Group's revenues and earnings contributions reported during the financial year comes from the construction of toll systems (tolling) and from the construction of systems for controlling traffic and mobility patterns (traffic management).\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, from the total revenue in the amount of EUR 538,842k, revenue in the amount of EUR 152,551 k related to the implementation of tolling and traffic management systems. The non-current and current contract assets as at March 31, 2024 amount to EUR 80,557 k (thereof EUR 21,312 k from Kapsch TrafficCom USA), and the non-current and current contract liabilities amount to EUR 48,517 k (thereof EUR 28,517 k from Kapsch TrafficCom USA). In addition, provisions for losses from onerous contracts were set up in the amount of \n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nEUR 17,326 k (thereof EUR 15,033 k from Kapsch TrafficCom USA) in order to provide for potential future losses from the further processing of projects.\n\nThe Group realizes revenues for its implementation projects in accordance with IFRS 15 based on the percentage of completion, which is determined from the ratio of the costs already incurred to the estimated total costs for the respective contract. This requires an ongoing assessment and update of the contract costs and the risks from fulfilling the contracts, which may result from technical problems, delays or problems with subcontractors or other external framework conditions and influence the contract margin. Furthermore, damages or contractual penalties can arise from these contracts which have to be considered in the project valuation and require a risk assessment. For single contracts, a variable consideration is included in the transaction price, which also leads to estimates. Numerous projects of the Group usually are technologically complex individual contracts with specific terms of contract and therefore have to be assessed individually with regard to revenue recognition and project risks.\n\nDue to, among others, a lack of resources with regard to qualified employees and delays in the acceptance of various projects due to the insufficient maturity of the software solution, considerable cost overruns in North America and adjustments to planned costs and margins for various projects occurred in the recent past, resulting in an impact on revenue recognition pursuant to IFRS 15. In the financial year 2023/24, progress was made on the percentage of completion of the projects concerned, but due to the provisions of the customer contracts further adjustments to the expected total costs in the amount of EUR 25,272 k of these projects had to be taken into account in the current financial year which led to further negative margin adjustments.\n\nDue to the material impact of the projects, in particular during the construction phase, on the Group's assets and liabilities, financial situation and results of operations and the significant estimates involved in the accounting for these contracts, there is the risk that the revenues from implementation projects and therefore the Group's result and the project-related balance sheet items contain a material misstatement, and this was therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWithin the framework of our risk-based audit approach, we gained an understanding of the revenue process and internal controls and tested the effectiveness of selected internal controls. This mainly referred to internal automatic and manual controls in connection with the approval of order calculation upon the conclusion of new contracts as well as approval of the ongoing recalculation. We tested the controls regarding the IT system used throughout the Group for revenue recognition in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue Engine\". Using samples, we recalculated the accurate determination of revenues based on percentage of completion. Based on selected samples we looked at project requests, customer contracts, Supervisory Board minutes, the project budgeting tool as well as detailed cost estimates and held discussions with the project managers and the management team regarding the status of the project, project risks and planning assumptions. In assessing the appropriateness of the estimates, a particular focus was on the review of the regular update of plan assumptions, in particular on the planned cost to complete and the planned project margin. We requested and checked the purchase orders and contracts for both actual and planned revenue. We examined the appropriateness of the disclosures on uncertainties with regard to estimation and examined the calculation of the sensitivity figures by 10% in the case of a change in the planned project margin (profit margin) in absolute terms.\n\nAs in the prior year, we performed extended audit procedures with regard to the projects in North America (the subsidiary Kapsch TrafficCom US). In particular, we checked the effectiveness of project controlling controls and discussed with local management and the project managers in charge the risk provisions and cost adjustments as well as the most recent approved planning for the sample projects examined, and critically assessed it.\n\nThe valuation methods and underlying assumptions applied for revenue recognition from implementation projects are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by IFRS 15 are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Group's disclosures on revenue recognition are included in note 1.4.1 \"Revenue recognition for contract work\", in note 2 \"Segment information\", in note 20 \"Contract assets and contract liabilities\", note 26 \"Provisions\" as well as in note 34.3 \"Revenue recognition\" in section 34 \"Accounting and valuation principles\".\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3 Recognition of deferred tax assets.\n\n## Description.\n\nDeferred tax assets in the amount of EUR 45,568 k are reported in the consolidated financial statements, mainly resulting from tax loss carry-forwards in the amount of EUR 36,863 k predominantly in Austria in the amount of EUR 20,192 k (intragroup loss carry-forward via group taxation) and the US in the amount of EUR 9,615k. The Group recognizes deferred tax assets up to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences as well as unused tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In the case of a history of losses, deferred tax assets are capitalized on loss carry-forwards to the extent that there is convincing substantial evidence that sufficient taxable income, taking into account the potential time limitation for using such loss carry-forwards, will be available in the future. The planning horizon in this context is six years.\n\nReviewing the recognition of deferred taxes requires management to make significant estimates as regards future market and business development as well as the chance of making profits with individual major contracts within the planning horizon, which is usually subject to a degree of uncertainty. With regard to the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of deferred tax assets due to these estimation uncertainties, and they were therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the multiyear plan prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board, and we analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (revenue growth, earnings margin, investment planning). Furthermore, we analyzed and critically assessed the adjustments to the tax planning result, which also takes into account future positive one-off effects with substantial indications. The calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy and the tax rates used were reconciled with external sources. To the extent that a loss history was available, we evaluated in particular whether there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. Further, we evaluated whether the disclosures on deferred tax assets provided in the notes are appropriate. In particular, this included the sensitivity analyses determined to assess the risk of potential deviations from earnings assumptions.\n\nThe model used by the Company is suitable to recognize deferred tax assets in accordance with IAS 12. The assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by IAS 12 are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Group's disclosures on deferred taxes are included in note 1.4.3. The Group's disclosures on deferred taxes are included in note 1.4.3. \"Recognition of deferred tax assets\", note 10 \"Income taxes\", note 17 \"Deferred tax assets/ liabilities\" and note 34.15 \"Current and deferred income tax\" in section 34 \"Accounting and valuation principles\".\n\n## 4 Restructuring of financing.\n\n## Description.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, non-current liabilities in the amount of EUR 91,906 k (prior year: EUR 58,472 k) and current financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 12,751 k (prior year: EUR 131,170 k) exist.\n\nIn the previous financial year 2022/23, the adverse business development, particularly with regard to profitability and the associated liquidity and debt, has led management to prepare a comprehensive restructuring concept with the help of an external advisor, which includes measures to improve profitability and reduce working capital, but is also intended to create a basis for sustainable future growth. This restructuring concept also forms the basis for the refinancing agreement concluded by Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, with its main financial creditors on May 31, 2023, which was concluded until May 25, 2025, in which a comprehensive refinancing of current financial liabilities (including the promissory note bonds) was agreed. Existing financing in the amount of EUR 106.3 million was extended until May 25, 2025, and new financing was concluded by this date. This includes a refinancing agreement of 50% of the promissory note bond in the amount of EUR 11.5 million that has matured in mid-June 2023 and the provision of EUR 4.25 million as an additional operating loan by a promissory note creditor. In this context, the Company has agreed to make early repayments from surplus cash and cash equivalents (cash sweep), from extraordinary inflows and from pending proceedings, and to not distribute any dividends. In the course of the refinancing, additional customary covenants and conditions were agreed with the financial creditors, compliance with which will be closely monitored and reported on by the external advisors in the future. The main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, pledged all its shares held in the Company (around 63.6% of the share \n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\ncapital) as collateral. The Company also undertook to utilize the entire existing authorized capital to the extent of 10% of the share capital.\n\nIn a supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024 to the restructuring agreement, the maturity of the non-current loans was extended to March 31, 2026 with the condition that EUR 4 million must be repaid early on a quarterly basis from December 31, 2024.\n\nThe measures for ensuring sufficient liquidity implemented by management in the prior years were continued in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nDue to the material impact of the refinancing on the assets and liabilities and financial situation as well as the going concern assumption of the Group, this was identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nThe refinancing from the previous year, which was concluded on May 31, 2023, was revalued by the management in accordance with IFRS 9. We first gained an understanding of the calculation and whether a modification in accordance with IFRS 9 exists. The model for the calculation was evaluated and the cash flows analyzed. These were compared using detailed documentation on the loan agreements and interest payments in order to verify the underlying values of the model. The present values of the original cash flows were compared with the present values of the adjusted cash flows and it was checked whether a change was less than 10%, which means that the recognition of a modification is appropriate and the difference is recognized in the income statement.\n\nIn general, the calculation in the model appears plausible and essentially fulfils the requirements of IFRS 9.\n\nWe checked the agreements dated May 31, 2023 as well as the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, on refinancing and assessed the resulting impact on the assets and liabilities, financial situation and results of operations as well as the going concern assumption of the Company and assessed the related disclosures made by the Executive Board in the consolidated financial statements. In this process, we first gained an understanding of the planning process and model. We examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the plan included in the restructuring concept prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. We analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (such as revenue and cost planning, changes in working capital as well as liquidity planning) as well as the essential risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them in meetings with the management. We interviewed the management on the status of the implementation of the measures.\n\nFurthermore, on the basis of the planning calculations, we assessed whether the Company will be able to fulfil the future repayment obligation included in the supplementary agreement.\n\nMoreover, we assessed the management's measures implemented to ensure sufficient liquidity and checked whether the monitoring implemented by management in this regard (daily monitoring of the group-wide liquidity portfolio and weekly 12-weeks cash flow forecasts) continue to be performed.\n\nBased on the information we have collected and as agreed in the refinancing agreement dated May 31, 2023 and in the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, regular monitoring and external reporting will be carried out by the external advisor to ensure ongoing and appropriate monitoring of liquidity and compliance with the intended implementation of the measures from the restructuring concept.\n\nThe application of the accounting method based on the going concern assumption is appropriate.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Group's disclosure on refinancing is included in note 36 \"Events after the reporting period\", the disclosures on monitoring liquidity in note 33 \"Capital management\".\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Other Information.\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the management report for the Group and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs), and the additional regulations of section 245a Austrian Company Code, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAAs part of an audit in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risks of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, on measures taken to eliminate identified threats or on applied safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements.\n\n## Comments on the Management Report for the Group.\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report for the Group is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report for the Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian standards on auditing for the audit of the management report for the Group\n\n## Opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations, comprising the details in accordance with section 243a UGB and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Statement.\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report for the Group came to our attention.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Additional Information in Accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation.\n\nWe were elected as statutory auditor at the ordinary general meeting dated September 6, 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on November 7, 2023.

In the eurozone in particular, however, persistently high energy prices and interest rates as well as weak household consumption burdened the economy. Key interest rates were initially raised further and then remained constant over the course of 2023. Inflation rates therefore stabilized at a high level and eventually declined again significantly\n\n## Global supply chain situation.\n\nThe global supply chain situation normalized over the course of 2023 after the pandemic-related bottlenecks. Both availability and delivery times improved in the second half of 2023. However, there were disruptions on two important shipping routes in the first few months of 2024: Conflicts in the Red Sea led to a significant decline in trade via the Suez Canal, and traffic slowed down in the Panama Canal due to water shortages caused by the severe drought. The effects were reflected in increased transport times and costs, although the duration and extent of the disruptions could not yet be estimated at the end of the financial year.\n\n## Interst rates.\n\nBoth the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (FED) in the USA continued the gradual increase in key interest rates that began in 2022 in the first months of the financial year. In Europe, the interest rate for main refinancing operations and the interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were raised from 3.50%, 3.75% and 3.00% respectively in March 2023 to 4.50%, 4.75% and 4.00% respectively by September 2023. The FED also raised interest rates in two further steps from 4.75% to 5.00% in March 2023 to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% from July 2023. Interest rates then remained constant and were recently expected to be followed by interest rate cuts.\n\n## Inflation.\n\nThe measures taken by central banks to control the enormous inflation took effect in the 2023/24 financial year, with inflation stabilizing at the beginning of 2023 and falling significantly in the following months.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global inflation rate averaged 6.8% in 2023 after 8.7% in the previous year. In Austria, it remained higher at 7.7% in 2023 (previous year: 8.6%) and was also significantly higher than the inflation rate in the eurozone of 5.4% (previous year: 8.4%). According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), the development in the first quarter of 2024 suggests a further slowdown in inflation in Austria. Inflation plays a significant role for Kapsch TrafficCom, particularly in connection with personnel costs.\n\n## Currencies\n\nFor Kapsch TrafficCom, the development of the US Dollar (USD) is of particular importance in the foreign exchange markets. The influence of the currency on the business development results from the internationality of the Group with a large number of projects as well as locations in the USA and other countries where invoicing is done in USD. In the financial year 2023/24, the Euro (EUR) trended sideways within a narrow range against the US dollar. The average for the reporting period was EUR/USD 1.08 (previous year: 1.04) with a maximum of 1.13 on July 18, 2023 and a minimum of 1.05 on October 3, 2023.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Global economic performance.\n\nThe IMF estimates a global GDP growth rate of 3.2% for 2023 (previous year: 3.5%). This growth was primarily driven by a strong second half of the year in the USA and in major emerging and developing countries, which recovered quickly from the effects of the COVID pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nAccordingly, GDP growth in both the USA (2.5%) and the emerging and eveloping countries (4.3%) exceeded forecasts. In the eurozone, however, the gross domestic product nearly stagnated at 0.4%. This is due to weak household consumption, persistently high energy prices and weaker manufacturing and corporate investment as a result of high interest rates.\n\n## Austria.\n\nHigh interest rates and high inflation rates characterized the Austrian economy in the financial year 2023/24. The gross domestic product showed a decline of 0.7% in 2023 after an increase of 4.8% in the previous year. According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), this was primarily due to the low demand for capital goods in connection with the high interest rates.\n\nExports fell by 0.2%, mainly due to significantly lower exports of services. Investments declined by 2.4%; the construction industry in particular recorded a collapse in demand. The high inflation rate and the resulting lower real disposable income as well as high energy prices also reduced household consumption by 0.3%.\n\n## 1.1.2 Definition of market.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is a globally renowned provider of transportation solutions for sustainable mobility. Innovative solutions in the application fields of tolling and tolling services, traffic management and demand management contribute to a healthier world without congestion.\n\n## Vision and mission.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's mission is to develop innovative transportation solutions for sustainable mobility. Road users should be able to arrive at their destination conveniently, safely, efficiently, and on time with a minimal environmental impact.\n\n## Target markets.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom addresses the market for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These support and optimize traffic (including infrastructure, vehicles, users and industry) and use information and communication technologies for this purpose.\n\nGrand View Research places the global market size at EUR 27.1 billion in the year 2023 (USD 29.91 billion, converted at an exchange rate of 0.9045 as of December 31, 2023), and expects it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.\n\nWithin the ITS market, Kapsch TrafficCom focuses on tolling and tolling services as well as traffic management and demand management. Core regions of business activity are EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa), Americas (North, Central and South America) and APAC (Asia-Pacific).\n\n## Addressable market.\n\nThe addressable market for the company had a volume of EUR 6.4 billion in the financial year 2023/24 according to internal calculations. The market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.9% to EUR 8.7 billion until financial year 2027/28\n\n## Market drivers.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has identified the following market drivers:\n\nEnvironmental protection. The Paris Agreement is an important global climate protection agreement and was adopted in December 2015 at the Paris Climate Change Conference. The European Commission (as part of the \"European Green Deal\") and the USA are pursuing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nRoad traffic plays a significant role here, as it is responsible for a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas emissions. Both traffic management and tolling solutions are recognized tools for influencing traffic and means of transportation.\n\nNeed for traffic infrastructure and its maintenance. Studies expect not only an increase in the global population, but also more private vehicles on the roads. As the volume of vehicles grows, it will be inevitably necessary to increase investments in road construction and maintenance. This is usually extremely expensive. At the same time, the increasing number of hybrid or electric vehicles is having a negative impact on mineral oil tax revenues. This means that an increase in the need for alternative financing models, including tolling solutions, can be assumed.\n\nUrbanization. The percentage of people living in cities is increasing. Whereas in the year 1800 only 2% of the world's population was urban, in 2007 for the first time more than half of the world's population lived in cities. Based on a current figure of around 56%, the United Nations forecasts that the urban population will account for more than 60% of the population in 2030 and around 68% in 2050. At the same time, the world's population will rise from around 7.9 billion people today to 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050. It is precisely in urban areas that private and professional mobility gives rise to major challenges. After all, houses cannot be moved at will to expand roads or even rebuild them. Furthermore, as the urban population grows, there will be an increase in the volume of business within a city as well as with business partners outside of the city. Since products must be delivered, a higher urban population tends to bring about an increase in the volume of transportation.\n\nNew means of transportation and services. Analysts expect that urban passenger traffic will more than double by 2050. Autonomous vehicles could intensify this trend. The existing road infrastructure will not be able to meet these needs. This results in two consequences: the increased use of public transport and shared means of trans- portation, and – if no appropriate countermeasures are taken – more extensive congestion. In addition, the trend toward electric vehicles will continue. While this reduces immediate CO₂ emissions, the particulate matter problem will remain.\n\nConnected vehicles. Technological advances in the exchange of information between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle, V2V), between vehicles and traffic infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure, V2I), and in the area of autonomous driving are rapid. Already today, these developments are enabling increasingly better and more extensive applications for better driving comfort and greater driving safety. In addition, the new communication channels and the enormous volumes of data enable substantial improvements in traffic management.\n\nData and artificial intelligence. Open data and open interfaces enable more extensive and higher-performing applications. Connected vehicles are an important data source. Machine learning and artificial intelligence create new opportunities for data analysis, simulation, forecasting, and management.\n\nData security. Due to the use of large amounts of data, the protection of personal data and how it is handled is becoming increasingly important.\n\nFundamental changes in the business environment of Kapsch TrafficCom. The aforementioned market drivers have already sparked the following trends:\n\n- While the ITS industry relied heavily on hardware in the past, it is increasingly shifting towards software platforms. More and more, module solutions and cloud applications are playing a role.\n- Offered services (anything-as-a-service) put the focus on the user and are integrated into platforms and devices preferred by them.\n- Payment solutions are integrated into vehicle technology, and new payment technologies will enter the market.\n- Intelligent traffic infrastructure can be achieved with more affordable sensors, modules, and connection technologies. Specific domain knowledge and the need for customer-specific solutions will remain significant, however.\n- New solutions can be rolled out on a global scale.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.1.3 Business performance 2023/24.\n\nIn financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom reached key milestones that placed the company back on a solid base for the future: In May 2023, a financing restructuring was agreed with the major financial creditors, which led to a longer-term financing structure and has since been extended until March 2026. In July, a settlement agreement was reached in the arbitration proceedings between the autoTicket joint venture and the Federal Republic of Germany conducted due to the termination of the operations contract for the collection of the passenger car toll. This led to a significant improvement in the financial and asset position. The earnings also improved as a result.\n\nAlthough net revenues were slightly below the previous year's figure, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to achieve an increase in invoiced revenues compared to the previous year and numerous project successes, which indicate a future increase in revenues and earnings.\n\nProject successes. The operation projects continued to perform well and several implementation projects were transitioned to the operation phase. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to win several new projects in the reporting period. Of particular strategic importance are those that point the path to the future of roads with tolling services and connected vehicles.\n\nThe company was awarded two interconnected contracts in the tolling segment in Switzerland: firstly, the implementation of the collection system for the performance-based heavy vehicle fee (after the balance sheet date) and its operation, and secondly, the corresponding vehicle equipment and registration system for the trucks as well as customer service for the toll service provider for at least eight years. Together, Kapsch TrafficCom thus supplies all essential elements for this state-of-the-art system.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the further expansion of the tolltickets network. With the purchase of a single toll box, drivers can since then seamlessly use the road network in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal – a cornerstone for the tolling services business segment in Europe.\n\nIn the segment of traffic management, Kapsch TrafficCom sees a particularly increasing demand for urban traffic management and low emission zones. In addition, the implementation and subsequent operation of a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) with hardware and software for construction site areas were awarded in a highway project in Germany. Shortly after the end of the financial year, Kapsch TrafficCom was awarded a pioneering contract in Florida, USA: In Pinellas County, intersections will be equipped with modern technology to prevent accidents involving pedestrians, and a system that combines predictive analyses with traffic distribution algorithms is designed to help proactively reduce traffic congestion.\n\nIncoming orders reached a remarkable EUR 734 million in the reporting period (previous year: EUR 480 million), and the order backlog amounted to EUR 1.4 billion at the end of the year, 15% higher than in the previous year\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.2 Financial and non-financial performance indicators.\n\n## 1.2.1 Results of operations\n\nKapsch TrafficCom AG's revenue reached EUR 221.9 million in the 2023/24 financial year, significantly higher than the previous year's figure of EUR 155.1 million. The increase is mainly due to the offsetting of EUR 66.3 million relating to the agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany. In the toll segment, revenue amounted to EUR 193.0 million (previous year: EUR 129.8 million). In the traffic management segment, revenue also increased from EUR 25.3 million in the previous year to EUR 28.9 million in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR 50.0 million compared to the previous year (EUR 42.9 million). The average number of employees increased by 17 to 449 people.\n\nOther operating expenses decreased by EUR 16.8 million to EUR 48.5 million (previous year: EUR 65.3 million). The change was mainly due to lower expenses for write-downs on loans and receivables from affiliated companies\n\nThe operating result of Kapsch TrafficCom AG amounted to EUR 33.3 million in the reporting year and was thus significantly higher than the previous year's figure of EUR -40.6 million. It was influenced by the following one-off effects:\n\n- The joint venture autoTicket GmbH reached a settlement with the Federal Republic of Germany in July 2023 and received an amount of EUR 243 million. The cash inflow to Kapsch TrafficCom AG from this settlement to date amounted to EUR 109.2 million. This one-off effect had a positive impact on Kapsch TrafficCom AG's EBIT by EUR 79.2 million.\n- After an agreement was reached with a customer regarding overdue receivables, these receivables were written off in the amount of EUR 10.1 million, while a credit note of EUR 5.5 million was issued, which led to a reduction in revenues.\n\nThe financial result improved by EUR 74.3 million to EUR 7.5 million (previous year: EUR -66.8 million). The main deviation is due to the fact that massive write-downs were made on affiliated companies in the previous year.\n\n## 1.2.2 Net assets positions.\n\nTotal assets of EUR 398.8 million as of the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024 decreased by EUR 18.9 million compared to the end of the 2022/23 financial year (March 31, 2023: EUR 418.1 million).\n\nFixed assets decreased by EUR 39.2 million to EUR 210.0 million as of March 31, 2024 (previous year: EUR 249.2 million). The change is mainly due to the decrease in financial assets totaling EUR 33.4 million in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nInventories increased from EUR 6.0 million to EUR 7.1 million. This is due to an increase in inventory items of almost EUR 1.0 million.\n\nGroup receivables, also include receivables from companies in which participiations are held (including loans), increased from EUR 174.2 million in the previous year to EUR 193.5 million in the reporting year 2023/24.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of EUR 2.0 million were at the previous year's level of EUR 2.0 million.\n\nAt EUR 198.9 million, equity was significantly higher than the comparative figure as of March 31, 2023 (EUR 151.7 million). The equity ratio increased significantly to 49,9% as of March 31, 2024 (previous year: 36.3%)\n\nLong-term liabilities increased from EUR 89.9 million in the previous year to EUR 100.2 million as of the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024. The main reason for this is the reclassification of short-term liabilities to long-term liabilities. Group liabilities increased by EUR 3.6 million to EUR 81.4 million (previous year: EUR 77.8 million). Other liabilities increased from EUR 6.6 million in the previous year to EUR 7.6 million as of the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.2.3 Financial position.\n\nThe net cash flow from operating activities was significantly positive in the reporting period due to the increase in sales revenues and other operating income related to the agreement with Germany and amounted to EUR 96.7 million (previous year: -30.6 million).\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities of EUR -3.2 million (previous year: EUR 18.4 million) results mainly from payments for financial investments.\n\nThe net cash flow from financing activities was negative in the 2023/24 financial year at EUR -93.6 million (previous year: EUR 2.1 million). The change results, also as a result of the restructuring of financing, primarily from the repayment of short-term financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 76.1 million.\n\nThe cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 amounted to EUR 2.0 million (March 31, 2023 EUR 2.0 million)\n\n## 1.2.4 Non-Financial information.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom Group prepares a separate consolidated non-financial report that fulfils the legal requirements pursuant to section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB)\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.3 Research and develpoment.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24 Kapsch TrafficCom invested 5% of its revenues in generic development, development support and product management.\n\nIn line with the corporate strategy \"Strategie 2027\" Kapsch TrafficCom launched a multi-year technology transformation program in the financial year 2021/22. The goal of this program is to safeguard and modernize the company's technology portfolio and reinforce its leadership in the marketplace. The emphasis is on advancing an agile way of working, developing the company's technology stack faster and more flexibly as well as adapting the current product and solution portfolio to the ever-evolving market requirements. This enables a faster time to market and more efficient delivery of solutions, resulting in improved revenues and margins.\n\nWith a strong focus on customers and their needs, the transformation is based on four pillars:\n\n- Product portfolio. In the product area, the product management team was strengthened. The team was also given responsibility to manage and steer the portfolio by means of a holistic view and a portfolio strategy aimed at consoli- dation and optimization. This identifies commonalities and synergies and builds on intelligent platforms.\n- Technology stack. The technology stack evolution allows Kapsch TrafficCom to accelerate the migration to the cloud as well as the adoption of new technologies and architectures. The technology stack is the frame for standardizing and developing technologies\n- Organization and processes. Kapsch TrafficCom introduced SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework©) to continuously improve its software engineering methodology, organization and processes. This system and software engineering methodology leverages industry-standard agile principles to enable the development of the most complex software and cyber-physical systems and to promote customer centricity. The initial pilot projects showed successful outcomes in software development. The key improvements included better alignment with customer requirements, enhanced quality through early defect detection and increased predictability by adapting swiftly to changes. In the next step, these methods will be expanded to other teams in order to accelerate and improve the quality of software releases, with a focus on effectively meeting customer needs.\n- Culture. Fostering and nurturing a culture of collaboration, curiosity and innovation is the fourth pillar of transformation and a key success factor.\n\nIn the financial year 2022/23, the patent portfolio of Kapsch TrafficCom was further optimized. The focus was on topics of high strategic importance. As of March 31, 2024, the patent portfolio consisted of 118 patent families with 824 individual patents and 41 pending patent applications. In the financial year, three new patent families were filed in the field of tolling and one patent family was discontinued.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom strives to mitigate the risk of patent infringements and to foster the patenting of new ideas. Hence, the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management focusses on supporting product management and product development. Patent analysis in various areas ensures that products and solutions are actually free to operate. Based on these patent analyses and the expertise gained from them, Kapsch TrafficCom also intends to file more of its own patents in order to secure its freedom to operate and its unique selling proposition for its products and solutions.\n\nIn addition, the global patent monitoring system was further established. Its task is to analyze patent applications from competitors and in relevant technology segments in order to gain a better overview of competitors' strategies.\n\nThe development expenses of Kapsch TrafficCom amounted to EUR 51.7 million in the financial year 2023/24 (previous year: EUR 43.6 million).\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *2 Anticipated develpoment and risks.*\n\n## 2.1 Outlook to financial year 2024/25.\n\nFor the financial year 2024/25, the management expects revenues to grow above the forecasted average annual market growth of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. The operating result (EBIT) should show a slight improve- ment compared to the result adjusted for one-time effects of EUR 15.1 million, whereby positive onetime effects are also possible again.\n\n*Expectation for financial year 2024/25: Revenue growth above market growth Slight improvement in EBIT*\n\n## Revenues.\n\nRevenues continue to be affected by the economic and political uncertainties in connection with the global conflicts. In the past financial year, net revenues were also negatively impacted by a customer credit note and deferred revenues.\n\nThe high order intake and order backlog will increasingly be reflected in revenues and form a solid basis for further growth. In the medium term, revenuess of at least EUR 200 million should be possible again.\n\n## EBIT (operating result).\n\nThe EBIT of the past year was influenced by many one-time effects, both positive and negative. Kapsch TrafficCom is therefore utilizing the figure of EUR 5 million adjusted for these one-time effects as a starting point for further development.\n\nDespite the improved situation, the focus remains on costs. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom is analyzing its process organization from bottom to top according to a Zero Base Approach in order to avoid project difficulties of the past in the future. The aim is to increase efficiency through global standards and tools.\n\n## Liquidity.\n\nThe increase in invoiced revenues in the reporting period and the recently awarded projects will be reflected in earnings and liquidity. In addition, the restructuring of financing has led to a longer-term financing structure. In May 2024, the term of the existing restructuring agreement, including all credit lines, was extended until March 31, 2026.\n\nAs of the reporting date, Kapsch TrafficCom had already generated around half of the further cash inflows from pending proceedings and other measures of at least EUR 30 million targeted in the half-year 2023/24: The total net cash inflow from the settlement agreement in Germany was around EUR 5 million higher than expected; the sale of the investment Traffic Technology Services Inc., USA, which is not part of the strategic core business, also brought in an inflow of around EUR 7.9 million. The management is still aiming for further cash inflows to reduce net debt further. The aim is to achieve a minimum level of net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0x in the longer term.\n\nIn connection with this, the aim is also to release the dividend block and lift the pledge on the shares of the core shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\n## Non-financial targets.\n\nThe company's non-financial targets can be found in the separate non-financial report in accordance with Section 267a UGB.\n\n## Corporate governance.\n\nThe mandates of Franz Semmernegg and Harald Sommerer as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board will expire in financial year 2024/25. Both will leave the Board. In the course of the new elections, the Supervisory Board is to be intentionally positioned more strongly as an advisory body to the Executive Board.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Strategy 2027.\n\nGlobal megatrends as well as growing awareness and legal requirements regarding climate and environmental protection are increasing the demand for comprehensive and intelligent transportation solutions. More and more, this confirms that Kapsch TrafficCom is addressing the right issues with its Strategy 2027, even if implementation is taking longer than originally assumed due to the market situation.\n\nA comprehensive strategy review was launched in the past financial year and is still ongoing. One of the first changes resulting from this was the sale of the non-core investments Traffic Technology Services, Inc. in the USA (TTS) and TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited in South Africa (TMT).\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is still predominantly perceived as a hardware provider. In fact, however, the company is already more of a provider of software and services; this development and change will continue – while retaining the hardware component – and will be shaped in the strategy review.\n\n## 2.2 Risk report.\n\n## 2.2.1 Risk management.\n\nThe enterprise-wide risk management process (Enterprise Risk Management, ERM) of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework, an internationally recognized standard for risk management.\n\nThe risk management process aims at an early identification, assessment, and management of those risks that can significantly affect the achievement of the strategic and operating objectives of the company. The primary goal is not risk avoidance, but the controlled and conscious handling of risks and the timely recognition and exploitation of opportunities that arise. In this way, ERM makes a valuable contribution to corporate management.\n\nAs part of ERM, major risks are identified, quantified, and globally aggregated on a quarterly basis. The risk report derived from this enables the concise assessment and monitoring of the major business risks. The report is sent to the Executive Board, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, and the first reporting level. The Audit Committee is informed immediately by the Executive Board about important events. The Supervisory Board also deals with the effectiveness of the risk management system as part of its monitoring of the Executive Board. The design and implementation aspects of the risk management system are reviewed annually by the auditor in accord- ance with Rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (ÖCGK) to ensure that the system is adequately designed and implemented. To further strengthen risk management, internal audits are carried out after this exter- nal audit to assess the operational effectiveness of the system. This proactive approach enables Kapsch TrafficCom to continuously improve and ensure the effectiveness of its risk management in day-to-day operations. The project-oriented risk management encompasses both customerprojects and internal development projects. Using institutionalized processes, an analysis of all relevant risks and opportunities is already carried out in the course of offer preparation. Consequently, a basis is created for decisions and for the timely planning and implementation of control measures.\n\nThe main generic risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom and the general handling of these risks are briefly discussed in the following. The environmental, social and governance impacts, risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom are explained in the separate non-financial report.\n\n## 2.2.2 Industry-specific risks.\n\nVolatility of new orders. Kapsch TrafficCom's most relevant customer groups include primarily government agencies and municipal authorities as well as private concessionaires, public-private partnerships and consumers. Larger\n\ncontracts are usually tendered. Until a contract is actually awarded to Kapsch TrafficCom, there are a number of uncertainty factors both within and out- side of the company's area of influence. For example, political changes, appeals or lawsuits by unsuccessful bidders can lead to a delay in the awarding of a contract, to its cancellation or to a modification of the\n\n*Geographic diversification and expansion of the product portfolio contribute to stabilizing revenues*\n\ntender. There is also the risk that offers made by Kapsch TrafficCom will not succeed for technological, financial, formal or other reasons.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe expansion into new business areas is aimed at increasing revenue growth and smoothing out revenue spikes in order to achieve a more stable revenue development. This is to be achieved in particular by further broadening the customer and product portfolio and by increasing the share of revenue from the operating business (technical and commercial operations of systems usually previously set up by the company) and from the tolling service business. The latter is typically commissioned on a long-term basis and is therefore characterized by better predictable revenues.\n\nThe economic situation of relevant national economies, possible government investment programs, changes in political priorities, an increasing focus on sustainability, trade conflicts, military conflicts or epidemics can have a significant impact on incoming orders.\n\nRisks of project execution. Intelligent transportation solutions are often technically complex and challenging systems, that must be implemented within a strict timeframe. However, the actual project environment cannot be\n\nfully analyzed and taken into account during the preparation of an offer. Therefore, uncertainties remain with regard to integration efforts for thirdparty systems, efforts for interfaces and other factors accelerating or delaying the handling of projects. Unavoidable dependencies on suppliers and service providers can also have a negative effect on the quality\n\n*Technical challenges and tight schedules cause typical project risks*\n\nand timely completion of a project. All of these factors thus affect the risk of missed deadlines and/or system and product defects.\n\nIn connection with the installation of systems, Kapsch TrafficCom is generally contractually obligated to issue performance and delivery date guarantees. If the contractual services are not fulfilled or if deadlines are exceeded, penalties and damages usually have to be paid, in some cases even damages for lost toll revenue. Significant missed deadlines can also result in premature termination of a contract by the customer. A significant delay in a project, a clear failure to meet the contractually agreed performance criteria or failed implementation of a project could reduce the chances of success in future tenders. There is also the risk that projects of Kapsch TrafficCom cannot be realized at the previously calculated costs. Due to the strong social opposition to toll systems that is sometimes encountered, the risk of a late or limited start to toll collection exists, which can have further consequences on revenues, profitability and payment flows in the operation project.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom employs project management methods and project risk management procedures based on the IPMA (International Project Management Association) standards in order to minimize such risks in projects.\n\nLong-term contracts with public agencies. For many projects, contracts are awarded by public agencies. Frame- work agreements and service contracts in connection with tolling or traffic management projects may include terms and conditions that are not negotiable in a tender process and that may be disadvantageous for Kapsch TrafficCom. Some multi-year contracts contain demanding requirements regarding the targeted performance of the implemented systems, components and processes. Failure to meet these requirements can result in considerable contractual penalties, obligations to pay damages or termination of the contract. On the other hand, in some contracts substantial bonus payments may be earned in the case of over-performance. Moreover, for long-term contracts, the achievable margins may deviate from the original calculations due to cost changes.\n\nContracts may entail liabilities relating to a loss of profit by customers, product liabilities and other liabilities. Kapsch TrafficCom strives to include appropriate limitations of liability in contracts. However, there can be no assurance that all contracts will contain sufficient limitations of liability or that they will be enforceable under applicable law.\n\nRisks in the supply chain. As a manufacturer of high-tech, multi-component devices and as a supplier of these devices and/or third-party products in the context of tolling and traffic management projects, Kapsch TrafficCom is dependent on the functional capability of the supply chain. It is essential to receive ordered components on time in order to ensure that they are available for ongoing projects when needed. At the same time, the components must be of good quality and offered at a reasonable price to achieve satisfactory financial results.\n\nThe situation on the global market for semi-conductors can be significantly affected by shifts in production capacity, geopolitical changes in the main production regions and disruptions in logistics. This can lead to the unavailability of the necessary components as well as fluctuations in delivery times and prices and cause difficulties in ongoing projects. Financial or operational difficulties at individual suppliers can also lead to delays in delivery, additional costs or a deterioration in the price-performance ratio of the components if supplier substitution is necessary.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis risk is limited by the fact that Kapsch TrafficCom ensures that at least two suppliers from different countries of origin are utilized for critical materials, insofar as this is economically feasible.\n\n## 2.2.3 Strategic risks.\n\nAbility to innovate. The strong market position of Kapsch TrafficCom is based to a large extent on its ability to develop high quality, efficient and reliable systems, components, solutions and services. Kapsch TrafficCom is\n\ncommitted to ongoing and consistent innovation. In order to maintain its high technological standards, Kapsch TrafficCom invests in research and development activities. However, if Kapsch TrafficCom does not succeed in developing innovative systems, components, solutions and services in line with market requirements, this may be detrimental to its competitive position.\n\nSince the striving for innovation leadership is based to a large extent on technology, internal know-how and intellectual property, the global increase in product piracy and reverse engineering may have negative impacts on the market position of Kapsch TrafficCom. The company therefore places great importance on protecting technologies and the company's internal know-how, such as through patents and non-disclosure agreements with relevant contractual partners. On the other hand, newly developed systems, components, solutions or services may also infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\nAcquisition and integration of companies as part of the Group's growth. The Group's growth can be organic as well as through selected acquisitions or the establishment of joint ventures. In the course of these activities, it is\n\nnecessary to overcome a number of challenges in order to achieve the desired goals and synergies, as well as to realize the expected opportunities arising from the acquisition of new technologies and market knowhow.\n\nCountry risk. Due to the further expansion of business activities in countries outside of Europe, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to increased political risk in some countries. Significant and currently unforeseeable political changes may have a major impact on the ability to implement or operate projects in these countries as well as to make funds available or withdraw them again. Interference with the property rights of Kapsch TrafficCom or problems with business practices and activities may also arise. Kapsch TrafficCom includes these risks in the evaluation of such projects.\n\n## 2.2.4 Financial risks.\n\nForeign exchange risk. As a global company, Kapsch TrafficCom maintains branches and subsidiaries in many countries outside the Euro zone. Consequently, transaction risks arise from possible exchange rate fluctuations,\n\nwhich may be reflected in the consolidated financial statements as exchange rate losses or gains. Kapsch TrafficCom strives as far as possible to avoid these transaction risks in the amount of the net currency positions from the respective projects or to hedge them, if necessary. However, because the net currency position at the respective payment flow deadlines is often difficult to predict, hedging is only possible to a limited extent.\n\nThe remaining exchange rate risk is accepted and included in the business planning. Due to the conversion of individual financial statements of the subsidiaries outside the Euro zone into the Group currency of the Euro, Kapsch TrafficCom is also subject to a translation risk. In addition, long-term disadvantageous exchange rate changes can also cause a change in the position of Kapsch TrafficCom relative to competitors, such as when products or services based on a euro-cost structure can no longer be offered at competitive prices outside the Euro zone.\n\n*Financial risks arise from exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations as well as loans. Sufficient liquidity increases the flexibility and the ability*\n\n*An ongoing and consistent innovation process supports the strong market position*\n\n*The international growth is opening up new opportunities*\n\n*but also poses risks*\n\n*to take quick action*\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nInterest rate risk. Within the framework of project financing, the Group regularly agrees to variable interest rates that are tied to market interest rates (e.g. Euribor). In this context, there is an interest rate risk, which — where material — is hedged by suitable financial instruments.\n\nLiquidity risk. Sufficient financial resources have to be available for Kapsch TrafficCom to meet its payment obligations at all times. The availability of medium- and long-term financing is necessary for the implementation of large-scale projects, such as the implementation of a nationwide tolling system with an agreed delayed payment by a major client, and for the acquisition of companies. In addition, the execution of large projects regularly requires the provision of bank guarantees, some of which are extensive, as collateral for bid obligations (bid bonds) or to secure possible warranty claims (performance bonds).\n\nIn financing agreements, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to the usual limitations of its business policy, such as with regard to taking on additional borrowings, the use of assets as collateral or the provision of guarantees and sureties in favor of third parties. The availability of financing and bank guarantees depends not only on market conditions but in particular on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. A lack of liquid assets (even if the Group is otherwise essentially solvent), of financing or of bank guarantees could in turn have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. The Group continuously monitors compliance with all covenants in connection with loan agreements.\n\nLiquidity risk is counteracted by ongoing Group-wide cash flow planning. This enables potential liquidity bottlenecks to be identified at an early stage and appropriate countermeasures to be taken in time.\n\nCredit risk. Kapsch TrafficCom is exposed to the risk of non-payment by customers. The main customers of Kapsch TrafficCom are to a large extent state agencies, especially in connection with the implementation or operation of nation-wide or regional tolling and traffic management systems. Kapsch TrafficCom also acts as a subcontractor to third parties (for example concessionaires, general contractors, etc.) in public sector projects. The scope of a potential non-payment varies depending on the size of the order and can have a noticeable impact on the earnings situation in the case of individual large projects. The creditworthiness of new and existing customers is evaluated, and hedging is performed according to the assessment of the existing non-payment risk. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom takes advantage of offers from public institutions, such as OeKB (Oesterreichische Kontrollbank), EKN (Exportkredit- namnden; Swedish National Export Credits Guarantee Board) and MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency), to hedge against the non-payment risk on the basis of guarantees. Moverover, there is a risk that counterparties of both original and derivative financial instruments (including financial institutions assumed to have good credit ratings) cannot meet their payment liabilities when due. A payment default or the need to impair receivables could have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\n## 2.2.5 Personnel risk.\n\nThe success of Kapsch TrafficCom depends to a significant extent on key personnel, in particular technical experts with many years of specific experience. In addition, the ability to recruit qualified employees with state-of-the-art technology knowledge, to integrate them into the Company and to retain them in the long term is of high importance for the success of the Group. The loss of important employees in key positions and difficulties in recruiting personnel can have a negative impact on the success of the Group.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has been proactively implementing measures to counteract this risk for several years. These include, for example, an internal career and training platform that allows employees to advance their careers autonomously and away from approval processes. Attractive offers such as bonus systems or further training opportunities addi- tionally support these efforts. A periodic employee survey as well as an \"OpenLine2CEO\" to Georg Kapsch enable the management to identify current concerns, worries and wishes as well as the general mood and to respond appropriately.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.6 Legal risk.\n\nI A large number of regulations and legal requirements must be observed in connection with participation in public sector tenders, the establishment and operation of tolling and mobility solutions, acquisitions and cooperations as well as capital market issues. It may take a considerable administrative, technical and commercial effort to capture, enforce and monitor all compliance requirements. If applicable regulations or official requirements cannot be met, this can lead to severe penalties and also reduce the ability of (successfully) taking part in future tenders as well as restrict the continuation of the relevant business activity.\n\nThe expansion of business activities into new regions and into select new business fields tends to increase the risk of patent violations or the violation of intellectual property rights (IPR). This can result in financial damages from court actions. Kapsch TrafficCom attempts to counteract this risk as far as possible by performing an evaluation of possible IPR violations prior to entry into new markets or regions, for example. However, it is not possible to completely avoid this risk.\n\nChanges in the geopolitical situation, such as military conflicts, can lead to the legal framework becoming more complex as a result of sanctions and embargoes being imposed. In order to remain compliant with the respective requirements, Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the relevant regulations.\n\n## 2.2.7 Cyber-risk.\n\nAs a core process of ISO/IEC 27001, Kapsch TrafficCom has a uniform risk management process for information security that is integrated into corporate risk management. The structured approach to considering risks related to information security is derived from Kapsch TrafficCom's business processes and represents a holistic approach. The risk management process is implemented in all companies whose IT is fully integrated into the Group IT, regardless of whether they are formally certified in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 or not.\n\n## 2.2.8 Operational risks.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's involvement in the realization of complex tolling and traffic management projects as well as in the production of components entails certain operational risks, including risks in the areas of health, safety, environment and quality (HSSEQ). In order to adequately mitigate these risks, Kapsch TrafficCom has developed internal processes that meet the requirements of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. In addition, aspects of ISO 9001 were integrated in order to meet quality management standards, and at individual locations also aspects of ISO 50001 in order to efficiently organize energy management and optimize energy consumption.\n\nLocal legal requirements sometimes exceed ISO standards, therefore Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the legal requirements in the countries in which it operates. This ensures that the operational standards always comply with the strictest local regulations.\n\nThrough regular training and further education, Kapsch TrafficCom strengthens the awareness and skills of its employees with regard to HSSEQ topics. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom utilizes ongoing audits and performance analyses to monitor and continuously improve compliance with these standards. This systematic approach not only helps to minimize risks, but also promotes sustainable corporate management and increases customer satisfaction.\n\n## 2.2.9 Opportunities.\n\nThe enterprise risk management approach of Kapsch TrafficCom not only addresses risks but also encompasses the regular identification, evaluation and management of opportunities. The goal of these efforts is to manage the strategic orientation of the product portfolio and market activities throughthe early identification of opportunities and to develop corresponding potential.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nMarket opportunities exist in geographic diversification as well as increasing expansion of the customer and product portfolios, driven in part by the following factors::\n\n- Opportunities arise from so-called change requests requests for changes from customers that only arise in the course of project execution. These change requests result in extensions to the contractual delivery components and are priced and paid for separately.\n- In addition, the increasing financing requirements of infrastructure projects and the growing need to relieve government budgets are creating opportunities both to open up new tolling markets in so-called emerging and developing countries and to expand activities in already developed markets.\n- The global rise in traffic volumes and the associated impact on the environment and society open up further opportu- nities in the area of mobility solutions, as, for example, toll collection, traffic management and demand management are increasingly being used as controlling instruments in environmental and traffic policy. In both segments, this creates opportunities to further develop and market the portfolio in line with the new requirements\n- Furthermore, demands with regard to increasing the productivity of vehicles and vehicle operations, as well as the rising comfort expectations of travelers, are opening up opportunities by expanding the functionalities of existing systems. This offers opportunities to acquire new customers or to serve both public-sector customers and end customers with new concepts. This particularly applies in the area of tolling services.\n\nOther opportunities. Continuous innovation, technical advancements and the acquisition of new technologies by means of corporate acquisitions create opportunities for Kapsch TrafficCom to improve efficiency and performance of customer systems and to gain a technological edge over competitors with regard to the performance and functionality of the offered systems.\n\n## 2.2.10 Overall assessment of the risk situation.\n\nFrom the current perspective, no risks have been identified that could endanger the continued operations of Kapsch TrafficCom. Due to the geographic diversification, the continuous expansion of the product and solution portfolio as well as the development of new business models through selected new ITS solutions, the business activities of Kapsch TrafficCom could be positioned more broadly without the need to step outside the core business area. The concentration of risk in individual regions and in individual large projects was thereby reduced.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.3 Internal control system with respect to the accounting process.\n\nAs in the previous year, the Group-wide uniform documentation of all controls for achieving the key controlling goals was advanced again in the financial year 2023/24. This aims to increase efficiency and at the same time reduce risk in the Group as well as to show alternative courses of action to management.\n\nThe basis of the processes for Group accounting and reporting is an accounting manual (IFRS Accounting Manual), that is issued and regularly updated by the Kapsch Group. In this manual, the essential accounting and reporting requirements based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are specified throughout the Group. Another important basis of the internal control system (ICS) are the Group guidelines, work instructions and process descriptions.\n\nCentral elements of the ICS are execution of the principle of dual control and the segregation of duties as well as defined actions for monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of operating activities, the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with relevant legal regulations. In this regard, Kapsch TrafficCom acts based on international standards and best practices, such as COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework.\n\nThe accounting of business transactions in Kapsch TrafficCom is managed by a variety of software solutions. In a number of countries, the accounting has been outsourced to local tax accountants due to the small size of the subsid- iaries. The individual companies submit reporting packages to the head office on a monthly basis containing all relevant accounting data pertaining to the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow accounting. This data is then entered into the central consolidation system OneStream on a monthly basis. The financial information is reviewed at Group level by Kapsch TrafficCom AG and forms the basis for interim reporting.\n\nThe Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board in regular meetings about the economic development in the form of consolidated presentations consisting of segment reporting, earnings development with budget and yearon-year comparison, forecasts, consolidated financial statements, personnel and order development as well as selected key financial figures.\n\nIn accordance with local requirements, responsibility for the implementation and monitoring of the internal control system lies with the relevant local management. The management of the individual subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and designing an internal control system in line with the requirements of the respective company with regard to the accounting process and for ensuring compliance with the Group-wide guidelines and regulations.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *3 Other disclosures.*\n\n## 3.1 Disclosures on capital, share, voting and control rights and related agreements.\n\nThe fully paid-in share capital of Kapsch TrafficCom AG amounts to EUR 14.3 million. It is divided into 14.3 million shares. There are no legal or statutory caps or restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or the transfer of shares. KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH held roughly 63.3% of the shares as of March 31, 2024. In connection with the refinancing, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH pledged all of its shares in Kapsch TrafficCom AG in favor of the financing banks in financial year 2023/24. This also results in restrictions customary in the market with respect to the transfer of the shares and a corresponding requirement for the consent of these banks.\n\nKAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of DATAX HandelsgmbH, whose shares are held (partly indirectly, partly directly) in equal parts by Traditio-Privatstiftung and Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung, two private foundations under the Austrian Private Foundation Act. Each of these private foundations is managed by its own Executive Board, with no individual serving on both boards. The beneficiaries of these private foundations are Georg Kapsch and members of his family (Traditio-Privatstiftung) as well as Elisabeth Kapsch and members of her family (Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung).\n\nThere was no other shareholder holding more than 10% of the voting rights in Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of March 31, 2024. In the financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom did not acquire or dispose of any treasury shares and did not hold any as of the balance sheet date.\n\nNo shares with special control rights exist. No restrictions exist with respect to the exercising of the voting right by employees with capital participation. There are no special provisions regarding the appointment and recall of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the modification of the articles of association.\n\nThe company currently has no conditional capital authorizing the Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares without (further) referral to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nConventional \"change of control\" clauses, which may lead to termination of the contract, relate to financing agreements, such as the promissory note bond (\"Schuldscheindarlehen\") and further financing, totaling about EUR 94 million, or are related to individual customer contracts.\n\nNo compensation agreements exist between Kapsch TrafficCom AG and its Executive Board and Supervisory Board Members or employees for the event of a public takeover offer.\n\n## 3.2 Corporate-Governance-Report.\n\nIn accordance with C-rule 61 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, it is pointed out that the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report can be accessed on the internet at https://www.kapsch.net/en/ir/Corporate-Governance.\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\nAlfredo Escribá Gallego Executive Board member\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.*\n\n## *Primaries.*\n\n## Balance sheet as at March31, 2024.\n\n| in EUR                                                                                          | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| ASSETS                                                                                          |                |                |\n| A.

General principles.\n\nThe financial statements as at March 31, 2024 have been prepared in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the UGB (Austrian Company Code) as amended.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the previous form of presentation has been maintained.\n\nThe financial statements, prepared under Austrian generally accepted accounting principles, present a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, the financial situation of the Company, as well as its results of operations.\n\nAccounting and valuation methods are based on generally accepted accounting principles. Section 201 para. 2 UGB was adhered to, as were the provisions on classification and valuation of balance sheet and income statement items under sections 195 to 211 and 222 to 235 UGB. The income statement was prepared in accordance with the total expenditure format.\n\nThe principle of completeness was observed in preparing the financial statements. With regard to the valuation, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern was assumed.\n\nThe principle of individual valuation was applied in the valuation of assets and liabilities\n\nTaking into account the principle of prudence, the Company only reported the profits realized as of the balance sheet date. All identifiable risks and impending losses occurred until the balance sheet date were taken into account.\n\nEstimates are based on prudent assessment. If statistical experience exists for similar circumstances, it was taken into account by the Company in its estimates\n\nFighting in Ukraine. The global economy recovered quickly from the effects of the conflict in Ukraine. To date, there has been no significant impact on the risk situation.\n\n## B. Group relations.\n\nThe Company is a 63.291% subsidiary of KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, and thus is related to its shareholder and its affiliated companies as a group company.\n\nDATAX HandelsgmbH, Vienna, prepares the consolidated financial statements for the largest group of companies. These consolidated financial statements are deposited at the Commercial Court Vienna.\n\nThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements for the smallest group of companies.\n\nWith regard to the disclosure on the legal and economic relations with affiliated companies, the protection-of-interest clause pursuant to section 242 UGB was used\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n## C. Accounting and valuation methods.\n\nThe previously applied accounting and valuation methods have been maintained\n\n## 1. Fixed assets.\n\nPurchased intangible assets and tangible assets are valued at acquisition cost less scheduled straight-line amortization/depreciation charged according to the estimated useful life of the assets\n\nLow-value fixed assets with individual acquisition costs of up to EUR 1,000.00 (previous year EUR 800.00) were fully written off in the year of acquisition or production\n\n## 1.1 Intangible assets.\n\nAcquired IT software is amortized based on a useful life of between four and eight years.\n\nIn the reporting year, intangible assets in the amount of EUR 0.00 (prior year: EUR 0k) were acquired from affiliated companies\n\n## 1.2 Tangible assets.\n\nTangible assets were depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following useful lives:\n\n|                                               | Years |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Investments in leasehold buildings            | 2-12  |\n| Technical equipment and machinery             | 2-5   |\n| Other equipment, factory and office equipment | 2-15  |\n\nNo write-downs were charged in the financial year.\n\nAdditions to fixed assets are depreciated according to the date of their initial use\n\n## 1.3 Financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets are stated at acquisition costs or the lower market values at the balance sheet date. Write-downs/ write-ups are made only in case a diminution/increase in value is expected to be permanent.\n\n## Write-ups of fixed assets.\n\nWrite-ups of fixed assets are made when the reasons for the extraordinary depreciation no longer apply. The write-up is made up to a maximum of the net book value, which results taking into account the normal depreciation that would have had to be made in the meantime.\n\n## 2. Current assets.\n\n## 2.1 Inventories.\n\nThe stocks of purchased goods, recorded by means of electronic data processing, were stated using the moving average price method. Inventories denominated in foreign currencies were stated using the exchange rate at the date of acquisition. Where required, write-downs were made to the lower replacement costs. A proportional deduction from acquisition or production cost was made for goods with diminished usability or marketability, which was derived from the respective inventory turnover ratio.\n\nServices not yet invoiced were stated at acquisition or production cost which include direct costs as well as proportionate material and production overheads.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn case of long-term contracts, no administrative and selling overheads were capitalized, directly attributable finance cost was capitalized depending on the project. At the balance sheet date, there are no services not yet invoiced for which finance cost was capitalized. Expenses for social benefits were not included. To provide for losses from pending transactions arising from the projects, the asset affected is written off or provisions are set up.\n\n## 2.2 Receivables and other assets.\n\nReceivables and other assets were stated at nominal values. Identifiable risks were considered in the valuation of the individual receivables by write-downs. Non-interest-bearing receivables or receivables bearing particularly low interest were discounted.\n\nReceivables in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the original transaction or the lower bank buying rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.3 Cash on hand, cash at banks.\n\nCash on hand and cash at banks denominated in foreign currencies are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the original transaction or the lower rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 3. Prepaid expenses and deferred charges.\n\nPrepaid expenses include payments effected before the balance sheet date as far as they relate to expenses for a specific time after the balance sheet date\n\n## 4. Deferred tax assets.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized on differences between the valuation according to company law and the valuation according to tax law with respect to assets, accruals and provisions, accounts payable, prepaid expenses and deferred charges as well as deferred income which are expected to decrease in later financial years.\n\nSince the financial year 2021/2022, the option to recognise deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards (internal loss carryforwards that are kept evident within the framework of group management and offset against future positive tax results) has been used\n\nDeferred tax assets for existing tax loss carryforwards are created to the extent that there are sufficient deferred tax liabilities or there are convincing, substantial indications that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilize these loss carryforwards in the future (planning horizon of six years, whereby the Group applies appropriate discounts in later planning periods due to greater uncertainty in the utilization of the loss carryforwards).\n\nDeferred taxes are valued using a tax rate of 23% for all differences (previous year: 23% for temporary differences that are eliminated in the following financial year and 23% for the other temporary differences and loss carryforwards) without taking discounting into account.\n\nDeferred tax assets were offset against deferred tax liabilities because it is legally possible to offset the actual tax refund claims against the actual tax liabilities.\n\n## 5. Accruals and provisions.\n\nThe accruals and provisions were set up in accordance with the principle of prudence at the estimated amounts.\n\nThe accruals for severance payments and the provisions for anniversary bonuses were calculated as stated in the AFRAC (Austrian Financial Reporting and Auditing Committee) opinion 27 \"Accruals for pensions and severance payments, provisions for anniversary bonuses and comparable obligations falling due in the long term under the provisions of the Austrian Company Code\" (June 2022, available in German only) pursuant to accepted actuarial methods in accordance with IAS 19 using the projected unit credit method.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nA discount rate of 3,55% (prior year: 4.0%) was used for the calculation of the provisions for anniversary bonuses and a discount rate of 3.50% (prior year: 3.95%) for the calculation of accruals for severance payments. A rate of 3.0% (prior year: 3,0%) was assumed for salary increases. Furthermore, the calculation was based on the earliest possible retirement age in accordance with the transitional statutory provisions and the mortality tables AVÖ 2018-P ANG for salaried employees. Staff turnover rates were determined based on the period of service.\n\nThe interest rate used is the interest rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nAll changes in personnel-related accruals and provisions (including interest expense) were recorded entirely in personnel expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of prudence, other accruals and provisions take into account all risks identifiable at the time the balance sheet was prepared and all liabilities uncertain as to their amounts or bases. Other accruals and provisions were stated at the best possible estimate of the settlement amount\n\n## 6. Accounts payable.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of prudence, accounts payable were valued at the settlement amount.\n\nPayables in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the original transaction or the higher bank selling rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\nExchange gains or losses from foreign currency valuation are recorded entirely in the operating result (other operating income or other operating expense)\n\n## D.

Moreover in a separate contract the Group company MTS Maut & Telematik Services GmbH (MTS), Germany, had been awarded the contract for the \"automatic control of the passenger vehicle toll\".\n\nOn June 18, 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled contrary to expectations that the passenger vehicle toll in its planned form, where in Germany accredited vehicles receive a tax relief simultaneously, violates the principles of the European Union. The customer terminated on the following day the contracts for the implementation and operation of the passenger vehicle toll effective September 30, 2019.\n\nThe operating parties of the terminated contract for the project \"Toll collection\" are Kapsch TrafficCom, CTS EVEN-TIM and autoTicket. In December 2019, they jointly asserted claims in the amount of around EUR 560,000 k against the Federal Republic of Germany. The responsible minister is disputing this claim. This matter was therefore need to be resolved before an arbitration tribunal.\n\nIn March 2022 Kapsch TrafficCom received an interim arbitration award which affirms a claim for compensation of autoTicket against the Federal Republic of Germany on the merits. Consequently, in July 2023, an arbitration decision was reached with mutually agreed terms, compelling the Federal Republic of Germany to make a payment of TEUR 243,000. The developments described led to an increase in sales revenue of EUR 66.3 million and a significantly improved net cash flow from operating activities of EUR 68.3 million.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Derivative financial instruments.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, derivative financial instruments break down as follows and are included in the following balance sheet items\n\n| Figures as of March 31, 2023   | Nominal amount | Number | Fair value 1) | Book value | Balance sheet item |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------|---------------|------------|--------------------|\n| Type of financial instrument   |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| Interest rate-related products |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| Interest rate swap (05/2025)   |                | 1      | 715,964.73    | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate swap (05/2025)   |                | 1      | -62,498.60    | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate swap (09/2027)   |                | 1      | 1,262,883.11  | 0.00       | n/a                |\n\n1) A positive amount in this column refers to a positive fair value, a negative amount to a negative fair value.\n\n| Figures as of March 31, 2023   | Nominal amount | Number | Fair value 1) | Book value | Balance sheet item |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------|---------------|------------|--------------------|\n| Type of financial instrument   |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| FX Rate Swap                   |                | 1      | 240,308.77    | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate-related products |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| Interest rate swap (12/2026)   | EUR 20,000,000 | 1      | 1,418,479.49  | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate swap (09/2027)   | EUR 25,000,000 | 1      | 2,055,612.57  | 0.00       | n/a                |\n\n1) A positive amount in this column refers to a positive fair value, a negative amount to a negative fair value.\n\nThe fair value corresponds to the market value.\n\n## E.

Report on the Financial Statements.*\n\n## Audit Opinion.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, which comprise the balance sheet as at March 31, 2024, the income statement for the financial year then ended and the notes.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements comply with legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2024, and of its financial performance for the financial year then ended in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\n## Basis for Opinion.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 (hereinafter EU Regulation) and Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing. Those standards require the application of the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of the auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n## Key Audit Matters.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe have structured key audit matters as follows:\n\n- Description\n- Audit approach and key observations\n- Reference to related disclosures\n\n## 1 Valuation oh shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as loans to and loan receivables from affiliated companies and participating interests.\n\n## Description.\n\nAs a holding company, Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, holds material shares in affiliated companies (book values in the amount of EUR 138,442k) and participating interests (book values in the amount of EUR 2,556k) as at March 31, 2024. Moreover, loans in the amount of\n\nEUR 58,214k as well as loan receivables from affiliated companies in the amount of EUR 17,394k and from participating interests in the amount of EUR 0k exist.\n\nPursuant to section 204 para. 2 UGB, shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as loans are to be written down in case a diminution in value occurs that is expected to be permanent. Pursuant to section 207 UGB, the strict lower of cost or market principle is to be taken into account for current assets (loan receivables). Write-ups are made if the reasons for the write-down no longer apply, however they are capped at acquisition cost.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, write-downs on the shares in affiliated companies in the amount of EUR 6,327k were made based on the tests for write-downs (thereof EUR 1,930k on Kapsch TraffiCom S.A.S, Colombia, and EUR 4,154k on Kapsch Telematic Service GmbH (KTS), Austria). In the financial year under review, for the participating interest in Auto Ticket GmbH, a distribution-related write-down on the book value under tax on equity attributable to Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, was made in the amount of EUR 25,710k. The book value of the participating interest after the write-down amounts to EUR 2,556k. The Traffic Technology Services Inc., USA was sold during the fiscal year, resulting in loss amounting to TEUR 3.215.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the expected business development, in the financial year 2023/24, write-downs on loan receivables from affiliated companies were made in the amount of EUR 4,006k. These write-downs relate in the amount of EUR 3,574k to Kapsch TrafficCom Services USA and in the amount of EUR 432k to Intelligent Mobility Solutions. No write-downs on loan receivables from participating interests were made.\n\nNo requirement for value adjustment of the book value of loans to affiliated companies has been identified.\n\nManagement believes that no further diminutions in value or reversals of write-downs (up to a maximum of the amount of acquisition cost) apply to shares in affiliated companies, participating interests as well as loans to and loan receivables from affiliated companies and participating interests as at March 31, 2024 and that, consequently, no further write-downs or write-ups are required.\n\nValuation of shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as in loans and loan receivables requires management to make material estimates on future market developments and the probability of the subsidiaries winning contracts in the planning period. This is particularly true for implementation projects with regard to tolling systems in the Tolling segment, where the order inflow is very volatile and contracts are usually awarded based on invitations to tender, which usually is associated with certain uncertainties. Moreover, there is a significant area of judgement involved in the valuation, in particular with regard to the discount rate and the long-term growth rate. With regard to the financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of shares in affiliated companies and participating interests due to these estimation uncertainties and it was therefore identified as key audit matter. The valuation of loans is also subject to significant management estimates. These estimates relate to the future prospects of the subsidiaries and their ability to repay the outstanding loans. Due to this uncertainty, there is a risk of overstatement of loans and loan receivables in the financial statements, which is why they were also identified as a key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe assessed management's approach to the valuation of shares in affiliated companies and loans to affiliated companies to determine whether it appropriately identifies a potential need for diminutions in value.\n\nWe first gained an understanding of the valuation model itself and the key value drivers of the current values.\n\nWith the partial involvement of our internal valuation experts, we examined whether the selected valuation method complies with recognized valuation principles and analyzed and critically assessed the main drivers for future development (such as net sales, expenses, project planning, investments, changes in working capital) as well as the main risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them with management. The assumptions regarding the discount rate and the growth rate were checked by means of external market and industry data, and the calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy. In addition, we have checked if the corresponding loan receivables have been adjusted in value.\n\nThe valuation models used by the Company are suitable to assess the valuation of the shares in affiliated companies and the participating interests as well as the loans and loan receivables. The assumptions and valuation parameters used in the valuation are reasonable.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nFor further information, reference is made to the notes to the financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, Section D. Comments on items in the balance sheet \"Shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as loans to affiliated companies\" and \"Current assets, Receivables\".\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2 Estimates and assumptions regarding net sales, services not yet invoiced and project-related accruals in the accounting of inventories.\n\n## Description.\n\nServices not yet invoiced as at March 31, 2024 amount to EUR 2,645k, project-related accruals including accruals for impending losses amount to EUR 6,168k. Implementation projects, in particular, require an ongoing assessment and update of the contract costs and the risks from fulfilling the contracts which may result from technical and time delays, supply chain bottlenecks or other external framework conditions and influence the project margin. Furthermore, damages or contractual penalties can arise from these contracts which have to be considered in the project valuation and require a risk assessment. The major projects of the Company usually are technologically complex individual contracts with specific terms of contract and therefore have to be assessed individually with regard to revenue recognition and project risks.\n\nDue to the material impact of the major projects, in particular during the construction phase, on the Company's financial position and financial performance and the considerable estimates involved in the accounting for these contracts, there is the risk that the project revenue, the result and the related services not yet invoiced and project-related accruals contain a material misstatement, and this was therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWithin the framework of our risk-based audit approach, we gained an understanding of the processes and internal controls relevant for the accounting of construction contracts and tested the effectiveness of selected internal controls. This mainly referred to internal controls in connection with the approval of order calculation upon the conclusion of new contracts as well as approval of the ongoing recalculation. In the course of our detailed audit procedures, we requested the project valuations for random samples of projects and reperformed the calculation of the accruals/deferrals and accruals for those projects based on plan revenue and costs as well as the costs incurred up until the balance sheet date. We looked at project requests, customer contracts, Supervisory Board minutes, the project budgeting tool as well as detailed cost estimates and held discussions with the project managers and the management team regarding the status of the project, project risks and planning assumptions. In assessing the appropriateness of the estimates, a particular focus was on the review of the regular update of plan assumptions, in particular on the planned cost to complete and the planned project margin. In order to assess the accuracy of the estimates, we requested and checked the purchase orders and contracts for both actual and planned revenue.\n\nThe valuation methods used and the underlying assumptions in the valuation of the project are reasonable and comply with the provisions of the UGB.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nFor further information, reference is made to the notes to the financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, Section C. Accounting and valuation methods \"2.1. Inventories\" and \"5. Accruals and provisions\" as well as Section D. Comments on items in the balance sheet under \"Accruals and provisions\".\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3 Recognition of deferred tax assets.\n\n## Description.\n\nIn the financial statements, deferred tax assets in the amount of EUR 22.502k (prior year: EUR 27,323k) are reported which are mainly attributable to internal loss carry-forwards from the tax group. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets up to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences as well as unused tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In the case of a history of losses, capitalization only occurs to the extent that there is convincing substantial evidence that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future. The planning horizon in this context is six years.\n\nThe recognition of deferred taxes requires management to make significant estimates as regards future market and business development within the planning horizon, which is usually subject to a degree of uncertainty. With regard to the financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of deferred tax assets due to these estimation uncertainties, and they were therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are plausible and transparent, and we analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (revenue growth, earnings margin, investment planning). Furthermore, we analyzed and critically assessed the adjustments to the tax planning result. The calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy and the tax rates used were reconciled with external sources. We evaluated in particular whether there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax loss carryforwards can be utilized. Further, we evaluated whether the disclosures on deferred taxes provided in the notes are appropriate.\n\nThe model used by the Company is suitable to recognize deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of the UGB. The assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by UGB are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Company's disclosures on the recognition of deferred taxes are included in Section C. Accounting and valuation methods under \"Deferred tax assets\" as well as Section D. Comments on items in the balance sheet under \"Deferred tax assets\".\n\n## 4 Restructuring of financing.\n\n## Description.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, bank loans and overdrafts in the amount of EUR 60,886k (prior year: EUR 113,981k) exist, thereof, no liabilities with a remaining maturity of less than one year exist (prior year: EUR 69,881k). In addition, promissory note loans in the amount of EUR 8,510k (prior year: EUR 31,508k) exist, thereof EUR 9k (prior year: EUR 23,007k) short-term.\n\nIn the previous financial year 2022/23, the adverse business development, particularly with regard to profitability and the associated liquidity and debt, has led management to prepare a comprehensive restructuring concept with the help of an external advisor, which includes measures to improve profitability and reduce working capital, but is also intended to create a basis for sustainable future growth. This restructuring concept also forms the basis for the refinancing agreement concluded by Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, with its main financial creditors on May 31, 2023, which was concluded until May 25, 2025, in which a comprehensive refinancing of current financial liabilities (including the promissory note bonds) was agreed. Existing financing in the amount of EUR 106.3 million was extended until May 25, 2025, and new financing was concluded by this date. This includes a refinancing agreement of 50% of the promissory note bond in the amount of EUR 11.5 million that has matured in mid-June 2023 and the provision of EUR 4.25 million as an additional operating loan by a promissory note creditor. In this context, the Company has agreed to make early repayments from surplus cash and cash equivalents (cash sweep), from extraordinary inflows and from pending proceedings, and to not distribute any dividends. In the course of the refinancing, additional customary covenants and conditions were agreed with the financial creditors, compliance with which will be closely monitored and reported on by the external advisors in the future. The main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, pledged all its shares held in the Company (around 63.6% of the share capital) as collateral. The Company also undertook to utilize the entire existing authorized capital to the extent of 10% of the share capital.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024 to the restructuring agreement, the maturity of the non-current loans was extended to March 31, 2026 with the condition that EUR 4 million must be repaid early on a quarterly basis from December 31, 2024.\n\nThe measures for ensuring sufficient liquidity implemented by management in the prior years were continued in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nDue to the material impact of the refinancing on the assets and liabilities and financial situation as well as the going concern assumption of the Group, this was identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nThe refinancing from the previous year, which was concluded on May 31, 2023, was revalued by the management. We first gained an understanding of the calculation and whether a significant contract adjustment in accordance with AFRAC 14 has been made. The model for the calculation was evaluated and the cash flows analyzed. These were compared using detailed documentation on the loan agreements and interest payments in order to verify the underlying values of the model. The present values of the original cash flows were compared with the present values of the adjusted cash flows and it was checked whether this is a significant contract adjustment – considering qualitative and quantitative aspects. The result was that no significant contract adjustment has been made and the difference is recognized in the income statement.\n\nWe checked the agreements dated May 31, 2023 as well as the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, on refinancing and assessed the resulting impact on the assets and liabilities, financial situation and results of operations as well as the going concern assumption of the Company and assessed the related disclosures made by the Executive Board in the consolidated financial statements. In this process, we first gained an understanding of the planning process and model. We examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the plan included in the restructuring concept prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. We analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (such as revenue and cost planning, changes in working capital as well as liquidity planning) as well as the essential risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them in meetings with the management. We interviewed the management on the status of the implementation of the measures.\n\nFurthermore, on the basis of the planning calculations, we assessed whether the Company will be able to fulfil the future repayment obligation included in the supplementary agreement.\n\nMoreover, we assessed the management's measures implemented to ensure sufficient liquidity and checked whether the monitoring implemented by management in this regard (daily monitoring of the group-wide liquidity portfolio and weekly 12-weeks cash flow forecasts) continue to be performed.\n\nBased on the information we have collected and as agreed in the refinancing agreement dated May 31, 2023 and in the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, regular monitoring and external reporting will be carried out by the external advisor to ensure ongoing and appropriate monitoring of liquidity and compliance with the intended implementation of the measures from the restructuring concept.\n\nThe application of the accounting method based on the going concern assumption is appropriate\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Company's disclosures on refinancing are included in the notes under \"Subsequent events\" under Section F. \"Other disclosures\".\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Other Information.\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements, the management report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Financial Statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU Regulation and with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU Regulation and with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n## We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risks of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, on measures taken to eliminate identified threats or on applied safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements.\n\n## Comments on the Management Report for the Company.\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the financial statements and as to whether the management report was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian standards on auditing for the audit of the management report.\n\n## Opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Company was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations, comprising the details in accordance with section 243a UGB, and is consistent with the financial statements.\n\n## Statement.\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the financial statements and due to the obtained understanding concerning the Company and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report came to our attention.\n\n## Additional Information in Accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation.\n\nWe were elected as statutory auditor at the ordinary general meeting dated September 6, 2023.

He is wearing a dark suit jacket, a white collared shirt, and a dark blue tie with a subtle pattern. The background is a plain white, which puts the focus entirely on the man. He has a slight smile and is looking directly at the camera.\n\nIn financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom reached key milestones, giving us a solid base for the future. On the one hand, our financial and net assets position as well as the results of operations have improved significantly compared to the previous year; on the other hand, we have achieved significant project progress and were awarded new contracts, which will increasingly be reflected in revenue, earnings and liquidity. We are well on track, however our operating result is still unsatisfactory and we still have some way to go. Above all,\n\nwe need to increase project margins.\n\n*Financial year 2023/24: Key milestones achieved – solid basis for the future.* \n\n## Milestones.\n\nThe most significant event was undoubtedly the settlement agreement reached in the arbitration proceedings between our joint venture auto-Ticket and the Federal Republic of Germany in July 2023. This led to a net cash inflow totaling EUR 109 million in the reporting period, which is reflected in EBIT with EUR 79 million and enabled the repayment of financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 88 million – ultimately significantly more than the cash inflow of at least EUR 80 million announced in July.\n\nIn addition, we reached an agreement with our bank partners in May 2023 to restructure our financing. One component of this agreement was the capital increase that we conducted in November. Another component is the waiver of dividend distributions during the contract term, which was extended to the end of March 2026 a few weeks ago.\n\nOur project successes in the past financial year were also impressive. We were able to reach several milestones in existing projects, which will lead to good incoming payments. In addition, order intake increased by 53% to EUR 734 million compared to the previous year. The order backlog at the end of the year amounted to EUR 1.4 billion, which is 15% more than in the previous year and corresponds to 2.5 times revenue. Naturally, this new business is not yet reflected in revenue for the 2023/24 financial year. Furthermore, the operation of the tolling system in the Gauteng province in South Africa was extended again by one month. We expect a prolongation until mid-November 2024 on a reduced scope.\n\nOur key financial indicators have improved significantly on the basis of these developments.\n\n## Financial development.\n\nAt EUR 539 million, net revenues were slightly below the previous year, but we were able to achieve a slight increase in invoiced sales of EUR 558 million compared to the previous year. A customer credit note, deferred revenues from processed orders in the past and margin value adjustments led to the reported reduction.\n\n*Financial and net assets position as well as results of operations have improved significantly.* \n\nIn terms of costs, the progress of our restructuring is clearly visible. Only the cost of materials continued to rise due to further price increases, ongoing delivery difficulties and enormous inflation.\n\nThe EBIT of EUR 70 million is significantly higher than the previous year, not only but mainly due to one-time effects. The settlement agreement in Germany with EUR 79 million and the reversal of a value adjustment on receivables with EUR 5 million had a positive effect. Negative one-time effects resulted from the further reduction in margins by a total of EUR 25 million for projects to be completed, primarily in North America. After analyzing the projects, we have now taken targeted precautions that allow us to assume today that we will not have to report any further negative one-time effects in this regard. Furthermore, restructuring costs of around EUR 3 million were recorded. Adjusted for these one-time effects, the EBIT of EUR 15 million was significantly higher than in the previous year (EUR 5 million).\n\nThe financial result declined to EUR -30 million in the financial year 2023/24, primarily reflecting the one-time costs in connection with the restructuring of financing and higher interest rates.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR 62 million and free cash flow to a considerable EUR 106 million, mainly due to the settlement agreement in Germany and the sale of an investment in the USA.\n\nThe developments described above led to a significant improvement in our key financial indicators: Equity increased by EUR 32 million to EUR 83 million, raising the equity ratio to 19% after 11% in the previous year. Net debt decreased by EUR 80 million to EUR 106 million, primarily as a result of lower financial liabilities, which include lease liabilities of EUR 36 million. The gearing was thus reduced to 127%.\n\n## Strategic progress.\n\nWe are pleased with the new orders we have been awarded, not only because of their size, but also with regard to our strategy. Four years ago, we defined Strategy 2027 based on the market development we expected. We are increasingly seeing this change in new orders, which include toll services and connected vehicles.\n\nWith a view to building on our technology and market lead and shaping the future with our portfolio, we are currently conducting a comprehensive review of Strategy 2027. As a first step, we sold one investment that was not part of our strategic core business in March and one in April 2024. This also brought and continues to bring us further cash inflows.\n\nAdvancement to us also means further refining our \"Green Vision\", which is based on sustainable products and a sustainable company. During the reporting period, we analyzed the potential impact of our business activities on people and the environment along our entire value chain, as well as the associated financial risks and opportunities. With the involvement of our stakeholders, we have thus identified the material sustainability matters for Kapsch TrafficCom and can now address these in a focused manner.\n\n## Outlook.\n\nIn the financial year 2024/25, we will complete our strategy review and further expand our sustainability manage-\n\nment with additional concepts and key figures. In financial terms, we expect revenue growth to exceed market growth in the current financial year. The operating result (EBIT) should show a slight improvement *Revenue growth over market growth and* compared to the result adjusted for one-time effects of EUR 15 million, whereby positive one-time effects are also possible again.\n\n*Outlook 2024/25: slight improvement in earnings (EBIT).*\n\nI would like to thank our employees, whose expertise, innovation, motivation and day-to-day commitment make Kapsch TrafficCom the pioneer for sustainable mobility that we are. I would also like to thank our long-term investors for their trust and hope that they will continue to support us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Capital markets.*\n\nKapsch TrafficCom AG has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange in the prime market segment since June 26, 2007. The shares are included in Austrian indices, as well as the sustainability index VÖNIX.\n\n## Investor Relations activities in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nIn addition to regular and occasion-related publications, Kapsch TrafficCom's investor relations team is available for investor inquiries and actively takes opportunities to intensify contact with capital market participants. In the reporting period, this included participation in six investor conferences and the execution of a roadshow as well as numerous direct meetings, telephone calls and e-mails.\n\n## Capital increase.\n\nAt the end of May 2023, Kapsch TrafficCom agreed on a financing restructuring with its major financial creditors, which puts the financing structure on a longer-term basis. In accordance with this agreement, Kapsch TrafficCom AG conducted a capital increase of 10% of the existing share capital in November 2023, which was successfully placed with the pro rata participation of the main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH. The 1,300,000 new shares have been traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange since November 24, 2023, increasing the number of shares to 14,300,000.\n\n## Share price development.\n\nThe price of the Kapsch TrafficCom share continuously declined in financial year 2023/24, starting from a closing price of EUR 12.50 on March 31, 2023. Two strong price movements were notable in the reporting period: The agreement to restructure the financing was followed by a brief drop to EUR 10.00 at the beginning of June, from which the share price quickly recovered. On July 5, 2023, the day of the settlement agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany, an equally brief upward movement enabled the share price to reach its high for the reporting period (intraday) of EUR 13.65. On March 28, 2024, the share closed at EUR 8.50, 32.0% lower than a year earlier. The benchmark index ATX Prime recorded an increase of 9.7% in the reporting period.\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/8 description: This line graph compares the performance of KTC and ATX Prime from April 2023 to March 2024.

Kapsch TrafficCom aims to resume dividend payments as soon as it is economically justifiable and also permissible from the Company's perspective and ideally to return to the dividend policy suspended in 2020. The core of this policy was the payment of a minimum dividend of either EUR 1.00 per share or one third of consolidated earnings per share, whichever was higher.\n\n## Shareholder structure.\n\nAt the end of the financial year 2023/24, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, as the core shareholder, held 63.3% of the of the shares, as in the previous year. As part of financing agreements in January and May 2023, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH pledged all of its shares in favor of the financing banks. This also results in restrictions customary in the market with respect to the transfer of the shares and a corresponding requirement for the consent of the banks.\n\nThe free float amounted to 36.7%, with around 16.7% held by institutional investors, mainly from continental Europe (including Austria), and around 18.2% by retail investors, according to information from a shareholder identification as of March 31, 2024.\n\nImage /page/10/Figure/10 description: The image shows two pie charts that describe the shareholder structure and institutional investors by region.

In the eurozone in particular, however, persistently high energy prices and interest rates as well as weak household consumption burdened the economy. Key interest rates were initially raised further and then remained constant over the course of 2023. Inflation rates therefore stabilized at a high level and eventually declined again significantly.\n\n## Global supply chain situation.\n\nThe global supply chain situation normalized over the course of 2023 after the pandemic-related bottlenecks. Both availability and delivery times improved in the second half of 2023. However, there were disruptions on two important shipping routes in the first few months of 2024: Conflicts in the Red Sea led to a significant decline in trade via the Suez Canal, and traffic slowed down in the Panama Canal due to water shortages caused by the severe drought. The effects were reflected in increased transport times and costs, although the duration and extent of the disruptions could not yet be estimated at the end of the financial year.\n\n## Interest rates.\n\nBoth the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (FED) in the USA continued the gradual increase in key interest rates that began in 2022 in the first months of the financial year. In Europe, the interest rate for main refinancing operations and the interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were raised from 3.50%, 3.75% and 3.00% respectively in March 2023 to 4.50%, 4.75% and 4.00% respectively by September 2023. The FED also raised interest rates in two further steps from 4.75% to 5.00% in March 2023 to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% from July 2023. Interest rates then remained constant and were recently expected to be followed by interest rate cuts.\n\n## Inflation.\n\nThe measures taken by central banks to control the enormous inflation took effect in the 2023/24 financial year, with inflation stabilizing at the beginning of 2023 and falling significantly in the following months.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global inflation rate averaged 6.8% in 2023 after 8.7% in the previous year. In Austria, it remained higher at 7.7% in 2023 (previous year: 8.6%) and was also significantly higher than the inflation rate in the eurozone of 5.4% (previous year: 8.4%). According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), the development in the first quarter of 2024 suggests a further slowdown in inflation in Austria. Inflation plays a significant role for Kapsch TrafficCom, particularly in connection with personnel costs.\n\nImage /page/11/Figure/15 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Inflation 2022-2024.

The influence of the currency on the business development results from the internationality of the Group with a large number of projects as well as locations in the USA and other countries where invoicing is done in USD. In the financial year 2023/24, the Euro (EUR) trended sideways within a narrow range against the US dollar. The average for the reporting period was EUR/USD 1.08 (previous year: 1.04) with a maximum of 1.13 on July 18, 2023 and a minimum of 1.05 on October 3, 2023.\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/2 description: The image is a line graph titled \"EUR-USD development.\" The x-axis represents months from April 2023 to March 2024, and the y-axis represents values from 0.95 to 1.15. The line on the graph shows the EUR-USD development over time. The source is listed as European Central Bank, April 2024.\n\n#### Global economic performance.\n\nThe IMF estimates a global GDP growth rate of 3.2% for 2023 (previous year: 3.5%). This growth was primarily driven by a strong second half of the year in the USA and in major\n\nemerging and developing countries, which recovered quickly from the effects of the COVID pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n*Global economic performance 2023: +3.2%*\n\nAccordingly, GDP growth in both the USA (2.5%) and the emerging and developing countries (4.3%) exceeded forecasts. In the eurozone, however, the gross domestic product nearly stagnated at 0.4%. This is due to weak household consumption, persistently high energy prices and weaker manufacturing and corporate investment as a result of high interest rates.\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/8 description: This bar chart shows the GDP growth from 2022 to 2024. The y-axis is labeled '(in %)' and ranges from -1 to 5. The x-axis shows the following categories: World, USA, Emerging markets, Euro area, and Austria. For the 'World' category, the GDP growth is 3.5 in 2022, 3.2 in 2023, and 3.2 in 2024. For the 'USA' category, the GDP growth is 1.9 in 2022, 2.5 in 2023, and 2.7 in 2024. For the 'Emerging markets' category, the GDP growth is 4.1 in 2022, 4.3 in 2023, and 4.2 in 2024. For the 'Euro area' category, the GDP growth is 3.4 in 2022, 0.4 in 2023, and 0.8 in 2024. For the 'Austria' category, the GDP growth is 4.8 in 2022, -0.7 in 2023, and 0.4 in 2024.

The gross domestic product showed a decline of 0.7% in 2023 after an increase of 4.8% in the previous year. According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), this was primarily due to the low demand for capital goods in connection with the high interest rates. *BIP in Austria 2023: -0.7%*\n\nExports fell by 0.2%, mainly due to significantly lower exports of services. Investments declined by 2.4%; the construction industry in particular recorded a collapse in demand. The high inflation rate and the resulting lower real disposable income as well as high energy prices also reduced household consumption by 0.3%.\n\nImage /page/13/Figure/3 description: This line graph, titled \"Export, investment & consumption growth in Austria 2021-2024.

The Paris Agreement is an important global climate protection agreement and was adopted in December 2015 at the Paris Climate Change Conference. The European Commission (as part of the \"European Green Deal\") and the USA are pursuing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Road traffic plays a significant role here, as it is responsible for a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas emissions. Both traffic management and tolling solutions are recognized tools for influencing traffic and means of transportation.\n\nNeed for traffic infrastructure and its maintenance. Studies expect not only an increase in the global population, but also more private vehicles on the roads. As the volume of vehicles grows, it will be inevitably necessary to increase investments in road construction and maintenance. This is usually extremely expensive. At the same time, the increasing number of hybrid or electric vehicles is having a negative impact on mineral oil tax revenues. This means that an increase in the need for alternative financing models, including tolling solutions, can be assumed.\n\nUrbanization. The percentage of people living in cities is increasing. Whereas in the year 1800 only 2% of the world's population was urban, in 2007 for the first time more than half of the world's population lived in cities. Based on a current figure of around 56%, the United Nations forecasts that the urban population will account for more than 60 % of the population in 2030 and around 68% in 2050. At the same time, the world's population will rise from around 7.9 billion people today to 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050. It is precisely in urban areas that private and professional mobility gives rise to major challenges. After all, houses cannot be moved at will to expand roads or even rebuild them. Furthermore, as the urban population grows, there will be an increase in the volume of business within a city as well as with business partners outside of the city. Since products must be delivered, a higher urban population tends to bring about an increase in the volume of transportation.\n\nNew means of transportation and services. Analysts expect that urban passenger traffic will more than double by 2050. Autonomous vehicles could intensify this trend. The existing road infrastructure will not be able to meet these needs. This results in two consequences: the increased use of public transport and shared means of transportation, and – if no appropriate countermeasures are taken – more extensive congestion. In addition, the trend toward electric vehicles will continue. While this reduces immediate CO₂ emissions, the particulate matter problem will remain.\n\nConnected vehicles. Technological advances in the exchange of information between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle, V2V), between vehicles and traffic infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure, V2I), and in the area of autonomous driving are rapid. Already today, these developments are enabling increasingly better and more extensive applications for better driving comfort and greater driving safety. In addition, the new communication channels and the enormous volumes of data enable substantial improvements in traffic management.\n\nData and artificial intelligence. Open data and open interfaces enable more extensive and higher-performing applications. Connected vehicles are an important data source. Machine learning and artificial intelligence create new opportunities for data analysis, simulation, forecasting, and management.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nData security. Due to the use of large amounts of data, the protection of personal data and how it is handled is becoming increasingly important.\n\nFundamental changes in the business environment of Kapsch TrafficCom. The aforementioned market drivers have already sparked the following trends:\n\n- While the ITS industry relied heavily on hardware in the past, it is increasingly shifting towards software platforms. More and more, module solutions and cloud applications are playing a role.\n- Offered services (anything-as-a-service) put the focus on the user and are integrated into platforms and devices preferred by them.\n- Payment solutions are integrated into vehicle technology, and new payment technologies will enter the market.\n- Intelligent traffic infrastructure can be achieved with more affordable sensors, modules, and connection technologies. Specific domain knowledge and the need for customer-specific solutions will remain significant, however.\n- New solutions can be rolled out on a global scale.\n\n#### 1.1.3 Business performance 2023/24.\n\nIn financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom reached key milestones that placed the company back on a solid base for the future: In May 2023, a financing restructuring was agreed with the major financial creditors, which led to a longer-term financing structure and has since been extended until March 2026. In July, a settlement agreement was reached in the arbitration proceedings between the autoTicket joint venture and the Federal Republic of Germany conducted due to the termination of the operations contract for the collection of the passenger car toll. This led to a significant improvement in the financial and asset position. The earnings also improved as a result.\n\nAlthough net revenues were slightly below the previous year's figure, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to achieve an increase in invoiced revenues compared to the previous year and numerous project successes, which indicate a future increase in revenues and earnings.\n\nProject successes. The operation projects continued to perform well and several implementation projects were transitioned to the operation phase. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to win several new projects in the reporting period. Of particular strategic importance are those that point the path to the future of roads with tolling services and connected vehicles.\n\nThe company was awarded two interconnected contracts in the tolling segment in Switzerland: firstly, the implementation of the collection system for the performance-based heavy vehicle fee (after the balance sheet date) and its operation, and secondly, the corresponding vehicle equipment and registration system for the trucks as well as customer service for the toll service provider for at least eight years. Together, Kapsch TrafficCom thus supplies all essential elements for this state-of-the-art system.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the further expansion of the tolltickets network. With the purchase of a single toll box, drivers can since then seamlessly use the road network in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal – a cornerstone for the tolling services business segment in Europe.\n\nIn the segment of traffic management, Kapsch TrafficCom sees a particularly increasing demand for urban traffic management and low emission zones. In addition, the implementation and subsequent operation of a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) with hardware and software for construction site areas were awarded in a highway project in Germany. Shortly after the end of the financial year, Kapsch TrafficCom was awarded a pioneering contract in Florida, USA: In Pinellas County, intersections will be equipped with modern technology to prevent accidents involving pedestrians, and a system that combines predictive analyses with traffic distribution algorithms is designed to help proactively reduce traffic congestion.\n\nOrder intake reached a remarkable EUR 734 million in the reporting period (previous year: EUR 480 million), and the order backlog amounted to EUR 1.4 billion at the end of the year, 15% higher than in the previous year.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.2 Financial and non-financial performance indicators.\n\n## 1.2.1 Results of operations.\n\nRevenues. Revenues of Kapsch TrafficCom amounted to EUR 538.8 million in the financial year 2023/24 and were therefore 2.6% (EUR 14.6 million) below the previous year. While invoiced revenues1) of EUR 557.8 million were despite a customer credit note in the amount of EUR 5.5 million even higher than in the previous year (EUR 549.7 million), deferred revenues from orders processed in the past and margin value adjustments contributed to the fact that the reported net revenues were lower. Business dynamics declined slightly over the course of the year, particularly outside Europe. Revenues declines were recorded in all business areas – implementation (-7.0%), operation (-0.4%) and components (-2.0%).\n\nGeographically, the breakdown of Group revenues was as follows:\n\n- EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa): 51.7% (previous year: 49.3%)\n- Americas region (North, Central and South America): 43.1% (previous year: 45.0%)\n- APAC region (Asia-Pacific): 5.2% (previous year: 5.7%)\n\n## Revenues by region.\n\nThe EMEA region generated slight sales growth and continued to make the largest contribution to revenues. In the Americas and APAC regions, on the other hand, there was a decline after the growth of previous years.\n\n| in EUR million | 2022/23 | 2023/24 | +/-    |\n|----------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| EMEA           | 272.9   | 278.7   | 2.1%   |\n| Implementation | 45.8    | 56.7    | 23.9%  |\n| Operations     | 195.1   | 185.8   | -4.7%  |\n| Components     | 32.1    | 36.2    | 12.8%  |\n| Americas       | 249.0   | 232.4   | -6.6%  |\n| Implementation | 105.1   | 86.8    | -17.4% |\n| Operations     | 97.1    | 105.2   | 8.4%   |\n| Components     | 46.8    | 40.5    | -13.6% |\n| APAC           | 31.5    | 27.7    | -12.1% |\n| Implementation | 13.2    | 9.1     | -31.0% |\n| Operations     | 10.1    | 9.9     | -1.9%  |\n| Components     | 8.2     | 8.7     | 5.7%   |\n| Total          | 553.4   | 538.8   | -2.6%  |\n\nIn the 2023/24 financial year, 8.50 million on-board units were sold, 7.9% fewer than in the previous year (9.23 million units). While revenues in the Americas declined and remained at the previous year's level in EMEA, growth was recorded in the APAC region, particularly in Australia.\n\nOther operating income increased to EUR 81.3 million in the financial year 2023/24. The increase resulted primarily from the agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany (EUR 66.3 million) and operating foreign currency gains of EUR 10.2 million (previous year: EUR 10.6 million). It also includes income from research funding programs in the amount of EUR 2.1 million (previous year: EUR 1.3 million).\n\nFrom the 2023/24 financial year, gains from derivative contracts will not be presented in other operating income, but rather as \"Gains from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments\" under financial income. The previous year's figures were adjusted accordingly in the amount of EUR 2.4 million.\n\nCost of materials and other production services increased by 4.6% (EUR 10.2 million) to EUR 232.7 million (previous year: EUR 222.6 million) despite the decline in revenues. The ratio of materials and other purchased manufacturing services to revenues therefore increased to 43.2% (previous year: 40.2%).\n\n<sup>1)</sup> Invoiced revenues = invoiced revenues - revenue deductions - credit notes - contractual penalties\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel expenses decreased by EUR 5.5 million to EUR 242.4 million in financial year 2023/24 (previous year: EUR 247.9 million) due to favorable currency developments and, in some cases, lower inflation-related salary indexation in several countries. As of March 31, 2024, the Kapsch TrafficCom Group employed a total of 4,054 people, which was 15 people or 0.4% more than on the previous year's reporting date. The personnel ratio (ratio of personnel expenses to revenues) amounted to 45.0% (previous year: 44.8%).\n\nOther operating expenses decreased by EUR 3.0 million or 3.9% to EUR 73.2 million in the financial year 2023/24. The change was mainly due to the positive deviation in connection with the reversal of an allowance (EUR -10.1 million), although this was partially offset by the increase in legal and consulting costs of EUR 2.8 million due to legal disputes, higher communication and IT expenses (EUR +3.0 million) and increased travel expenses (EUR +1.1 million).\n\nThe proportional result from associates and joint ventures of EUR 15.4 million (previous year: EUR -1.7 million) is mainly attributable to the joint venture autoTicket GmbH in Germany.\n\nEBITDA. The operating result before amortization, depreciation and impairment (EBITDA) of EUR 88.5 million was significantly higher than the previous year's figure of EUR 27.1 million (adjusted). The EBITDA margin thus rose to 16.4% (previous year: 4.9%, adjusted).\n\nExpenses for amortization and depreciation amounted to EUR 18.3 million in the financial year 2023/24 and were therefore – with a slight increase in net investments – lower than in the previous year (EUR 21.8 million).\n\nEBIT. The operating result (EBIT) of EUR 70.3 million was significantly higher than the previous year's value of EUR 5.2 million (adjusted).\n\nThe results in the 2023/24 financial year were influenced by the following special effects:\n\n- In July 2023, the joint venture autoTicket GmbH reached a settlement with the Federal Republic of Germany and received an amount of EUR 243 million. The cash inflow to Kapsch TrafficCom AG from this settlement to date amounted to EUR 109.2 million. The special effect from Germany led to an increase in EBIT of EUR 79.2 million, of which EUR 15.4 million is reported as share of profit from associates and joint ventures.\n- After an agreement was reached with a customer regarding overdue receivables, the allowances for these receivables were reversed in the amount of EUR 10.1 million. In contrast, a credit note was issued in the amount of EUR 5.5 million, which led to a reduction in revenue. The EBIT effect therefore amounted to EUR 4.5 million.\n- For some projects in the Americas region, the project margins were adjusted, revenues and contract assets from customer contracts were reduced and provisions for onerous contracts were recognized. Only projects that had been a heavy burden on the Group for years were taken into account. Kapsch TrafficCom assumes that these project-related legacy burdens have now been finally eliminated. This had a negative effect of EUR -25.3 million on EBIT.\n- Costs in relation to the restructuring are reflected in EBIT in the amount of EUR 3.2 million.\n\nAdjusted for these one-off effects, EBIT in the financial year 2023/24 would have amounted to EUR 15.1 million and EBITDA would have amounted to EUR 33.3 million.\n\nFinancial result. The financial result decreased from EUR -13.9 million (adjusted) in the previous year to EUR -30.1 million in the financial year 2023/24. The most significant differences resulted from the increase in interest expenses and the one-off costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of the financing, which reduced the net interest result from EUR -5.0 million in the previous year to EUR -22.0 million. In addition, hyperinflation adjustments in the amount of EUR -7.0 million (previous year: EUR -5.1 million), the reversal of an allowance for a loan to an associated company in the amount of EUR 2.4 million and effects from exchange rate changes in the amount of EUR -0.5 million (previous year: EUR -2.2 million) were recognized in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nProportional result from associated companies and joint ventures from financial investments. The contribution to earnings from Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, amounted to EUR -3.2 million (previous year: EUR -1.3 million), including a loss of EUR 2.3 million from the sale of the shares.\n\nIncome taxes. Tax expenses in the financial year amounted to EUR 14.6 million (previous year: EUR 14.4 million). The tax expense results from the higher earnings before taxes and the use of loss carryforwards in Austria, which reduced the deferred taxes recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nResult for the period. The result for the period was clearly positive at EUR 22.3 million (previous year: EUR -24.2 million). A result of EUR 23.2 million (previous year: EUR -24.8 million) was attributable to the equity holders in the Group. This corresponds to earnings per share of EUR 1.72 (previous year: EUR -1.91).\n\nOther comprehensive income. This item mainly includes currency translation differences and revaluations of post-employment benefit obligations. The other comprehensive income amounted to EUR -1.7 million (previous year: EUR -2.1 million)\n\nTotal comprehensive income. The comprehensive income as the sum of the result for the period and other comprehensive income amounted to EUR 20.6 million (previous year: EUR -26.3 million).\n\n## 1.2.2 Results of operations by segment.\n\n## Tolling.\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/5 description: The image contains the text \"Tolling revenues by regions.\"\n\nImage /page/18/Figure/6 description: The image is a donut chart showing the distribution of something across three regions: Americas, EMEA, and APAC. The Americas account for 43.7%, EMEA accounts for 50.0%, and APAC accounts for 6.3%.\n\nRevenues. In the financial year 2023/24, revenues in the tolling segment decreased by 6.2% from EUR 403.4 million to EUR 378.3 million. Revenues contributed 70.2% (previous year: 72.8%) to total revenues.\n\nIn the EMEA region, a moderate increase in revenues of 1.2% (EUR 2.2 million) to EUR 189.3 million was achieved in the reporting year. This development was primarily due to new implementation projects in France and Spain, which were won in the previous year but only led to higher revenues in the reporting period. In other countries, however, there was a decline in revenues, mainly due to the completion of an implementation project in Poland in the previous year and lower component sales in Austria, Greece, Portugal and Denmark.\n\nIn the Americas region, revenues in the tolling segment decreased by 12.9% to EUR 165.2 million, making EMEA once again the region with the highest revenues for Kapsch TrafficCom. The decline was particularly noticeable in the USA, where Kapsch TrafficCom focused on stabilizing existing projects. Other countries in Latin America, such as Chile, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Argentina, also contributed to the decline in revenues. This is due to the completion of implementation projects in the previous year, which no longer generated revenue in the 2023/24 financial year. The largest positive deviations came from new implementation and operations projects in Mexico and Brazil.\n\nFollowing growth in the previous year, the APAC region suffered a 10.4% decline in revenues in the 2023/24 financial year, generating revenues of EUR 23.8 million. This decline was particularly noticeable in Australia, the strongest country in the region, where there were delays in some implementation projects. In contrast, the components business developed in a positive way\n\n## Segment tolling by business type.\n\n| in EUR million  | 2022/23      | 2023/24      | +/-          |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| <b>Revenues</b> | <b>403.4</b> | <b>378.3</b> | <b>-6.2%</b> |\n| Implementation  | 119.4        | 96.7         | -19.0%       |\n| Operations      | 202.5        | 207.7        | 2.6%         |\n| Components      | 81.5         | 73.9         | -9.3%        |\n| EBIT1)          | -9.3         | 54.3         | —            |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\nEBIT. The operating result in the tolling segment amounted to EUR 54.3 million after EUR -9.3 million in the previous year (adjusted). This positive development is primarily due to the settlement reached in the arbitration proceedings regarding the termination of the operator agreement for the collection of the infrastructure charge in Germany. The development of profitability in the toll segment was mixed in the financial year 2023/24: while the contribution to earnings from operating projects increased significantly, the components business declined slightly. In particular, high costs in connection with the completion of some implementation projects as well as the adjustment and the associated provisions for the projects to be completed in the Americas had a dampening effect.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe costs of materials and other purchased production services decreased by 6.3%. This decrease was partly due to the lower proportion of implementation projects, which always have higher material costs. Personnel expenses decreased due to favorable currency developments and restructuring measures. Depreciation and amortization decreased by 16.0% to EUR 13.4 million, mainly because it was possible to optimize rental office space and thus also the capitalized lease agreements. Other operating expenses decreased by EUR 8.1 million to EUR 47.4 million. The operating foreign currency result in the tolling segment amounted to EUR 2.9 million (previous year: EUR 2.8 million) and thus made a positive contribution to EBIT, as in the previous year.\n\n## Traffic management.\n\n## Traffic management revenues by regions.\n\nImage /page/19/Figure/3 description: This image is a donut chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. The regions are Americas (41.9%), EMEA (55.7%), and APAC (2.4%).\n\nRevenues. In the financial year 2023/24, revenues in the traffic management segment amounted to EUR 160.5 million, a rise of 7.0% on the previous year's figure of EUR 150.0 million, and contributed 29.8% (previous year: 27.2%) to total revenues. Implementation revenues increased by 25.2% compared to the previous year, and Kapsch TrafficCom also recorded a significant increase in revenues in the components business, particularly in France, Morocco and Greece. The EMEA region continued to make the largest contribution to revenues in the traffic management segment at 55.7% or EUR 89.5 million. Revenues in the Americas region increased by 13.4% to EUR 67.2 million in the financial year 2023/24. Revenues in the APAC region decreased sharply. At EUR 3.9 million, **55,7%** | it was 20.4% below the previous year's figure of EUR 4.9 million.\n\n#### Segment traffic management by business type.\n\n| in EUR million  | 2022/23      | 2023/24      | +/-         |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| <b>Revenues</b> | <b>150.0</b> | <b>160.5</b> | <b>7.0%</b> |\n| Implementation  | 44.6         | 55.9         | 25.2%       |\n| Operations      | 99.8         | 93.2         | -6.6%       |\n| Components      | 5.6          | 11.5         | >100%       |\n| <b>EBIT1)</b>   | <b>14.6</b>  | <b>15.9</b>  | <b>9.3%</b> |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\nEBIT. EBIT in the traffic management segment amounted to EUR 15.9 million in the financial year and was therefore also above the previous year (EUR 14.6 million, adjusted). This increase was mainly due to the 7.0% rise in revenues with slightly lower expenses for materials and purchased services. Personnel expenses fell by 2.0% to EUR 63.5 million and depreciation and amortization decreased by 17.1% to EUR 4.3 million. The operating foreign currency result had a negative impact of EUR -0.6 million in the financial year 2023/24.\n\n## 1.2.3 Net assets position.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's total assets as of March 31, 2024 amounted to EUR 443.7 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 480.1 million).\n\n## Assets.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment decreased by EUR 6.2 million compared to March 31, 2023, mainly due to scheduled depreciation. Intangible assets decreased by EUR 3.9 million essentially due to current amortisation.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures decreased by EUR 21.1 million. The main effect was derived from the positive proportional result of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR 15.5 million; EUR 30.0 million was paid out in dividends by this company. The share in Traffic Technology Services, Inc, USA, was sold thereby also reducing the interests in associates by EUR 7.3 million.\n\nOther non-current financial assets and investments decreased by a total of EUR 11.8 million. This was mainly due to the repayment of financing from the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany (EUR -12.9 million) and the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA (EUR -3.8 million). The effect was partially offset by the reversal of an allowance on loans in the amount of EUR 2.4 million.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets amounted to EUR 45.6 million as of March 31, 2024 (previous year: EUR 49.8 million). The majority of deferred tax assets relate to loss carryforwards in the USA, Austria, Brazil and Spain.\n\nInventories increased by EUR 2.7 million to EUR 47.8 million, largely due to higher stock levels in the manufacturing companies in Austria and Canada.\n\nTrade receivables and other current assets increased by EUR 13.5 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in invoiced sales. The higher invoiced sales also led to a reduction in non-current and current contract assets by a total of EUR 5.5 million.\n\nAt EUR 33.4 million, cash and cash equivalents were lower than in the previous year (EUR 45.2 million), mainly due to the repayment of financial liabilities and the reduction in trade payables.\n\nA total amount of EUR 11 million was identified as assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. In addition to property, plant, and equipment, this specifically included trade receivables and other current assets as well as cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Liabilities and equity.\n\nThe development of financial liabilities clearly reflects the restructuring of financing and the repayments following the cash inflow from Germany: Non-current financial liabilities increased by EUR 33.4 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to the reclassification between non-current and current financial liabilities according to maturity (EUR 38.2 million). Current financial liabilities were reduced in particular through repayments in the amount of EUR 105.7 million from EUR 131.2 million to EUR 12.8 million.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, non-current lease liabilities amounted to EUR 26.9 million (previous year: EUR 32.2 million), with the decrease mainly resulting from the reduction of rental space. Current lease liabilities amounted to EUR 9.2 million (previous year: EUR 11.6 million).\n\nNon-current and current contract liabilities increased by EUR 17.0 million due to further work on ongoing projects.\n\nTrade payables were reduced by EUR 12.1 million to EUR 62.9 million compared to the previous year, with part of these liabilities relating to invoices not yet received for purchased services.\n\nCurrent provisions increased by EUR 3.6 million compared to the previous year and amounted to EUR 22.4 million as at March 31, 2024 (previous year: EUR 18.9 million). The increase mainly related to the recognition of project provisions and provisions for impending losses in connection with projects.\n\nEquity increased by EUR 32.1 million to EUR 83.4 million as of March 31, 2024 due to the positive result for the period and the capital increase. The equity ratio increased from 10.7% in the previous year to 18.8% in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nA total amount of EUR 4 million was identified as liabilities held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. This specifically included short-term financial liabilities, trade payables, other liabilities and accruals.\n\n## 1.2.4 Financial position.\n\n## Cash flow.\n\nThe operating result was clearly positive in the reporting period and amounted to EUR 70.3 million (previous year: EUR 5.2 million, adjusted) due to the increase in other operating income in connection with the agreement with Germany. The improved result impacted cash flow from operating activities, which amounted to EUR 61.9 million in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year: EUR 2.7 million, adjusted). The cash flow from earnings amounted to EUR 67.0 million (previous year: EUR 11.4 million) and the change in net working capital amounted to EUR -5.1 million (previous year: EUR -8.6 million).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following effects were responsible for the change in net working capital: Trade receivables, current contract assets and other current assets increased by a total of EUR 16.8 million (previous year: decrease by EUR 11.8 million). Inventories also increased by EUR 2.7 million (previous year: increase by EUR 10.3 million). The increase in current contract liabilities and other current liabilities, net of the decrease in trade payables in the amount of EUR 10.6 million (previous year: decrease by EUR 0.5 million) and the addition to current provisions in the amount of EUR 3.8 million (previous year: decrease by and utilization of EUR 9.6 million) could not compensate for this effect.\n\nCash flow from investing activities amounted to EUR 43.8 million in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year: EUR -0.2 million). Investments in property, plant and equipment increased to EUR -5.7 million (previous year: EUR -3.6 million). Payments for the purchase of securities, investments and other non-current financial assets included financing of the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, in the amount of EUR -1.3 million (previous year: EUR -1.5 million), as well as financing of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR -0.5 million (previous year: EUR -3.0 million).\n\nIn contrast, the cash inflow from the repayment of the financing of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR 12.9 million and the cash inflow from the sale of the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, in the amount of EUR 7.9 million had a very positive effect. In addition, there was a cash inflow from the dividend of the joint venture autoTicket GmbH, Germany, in the amount of EUR 30 million in the 2023/24 financial year. Altogether, this resulted in a clearly positive cash flow from investing activities.\n\nThe sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities is the free cash flow. It\n\namounted to EUR 105.7 million in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year: EUR 2.5 million, adjusted) and was significantly higher compared to the previous year due to the effect of the settlement of the arbitration\n\n*Free cash flow: EUR 105.7 million*\n\nproceedings in Germany and the sale of the shares in Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA.\n\nCash flow from financing activities was clearly negative in the 2023/24 financial year at EUR -111.6 million (previous year: EUR -13.1 million, adjusted). The change was mainly due to the repayment of current financial liabilities in the amount of EUR -105.5 million (previous year: EUR -18.4 million), also as a result of the restructuring of financing arrangements, the addition of new borrowings in the amount of EUR 28.3 million (of which EUR 0.8 million are non-current) and the ongoing repayment of lease liabilities in the amount of EUR -11.8 million. The interest paid on financing and the associated costs amounted to EUR -26.7 million (previous year: EUR -8.6 million, adjusted). These were recognized in cash flow from financing activities for the first time in the 2023/24 financial year (previous year adjusted).\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 amounted to EUR 33.4 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 45.2 million).\n\n## Key figures.\n\nNet debt as of March 31, 2024 was EUR 106.0 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 186.3 million) and thus EUR 80.3 million below the previous year. This development resulted mainly from the reduction of financial liabilities by EUR 85.0 million. The simultaneous increase in equity by EUR 32.1 million reduced the gearing ratio to 127.1% (March 31, 2023: 363.1%).\n\nNet working capital amounted to EUR 78,5 million (March 31, 2023: EUR 79.4 million).\n\n## 1.2.5 Non-financial information.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom Group prepares a separate consolidated Non-Financial Report that fulfils the legal requirements pursuant to section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.3 Research and development.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24 Kapsch TrafficCom invested 5% of its revenues in generic development, development support and product management.\n\nIn line with the corporate strategy \"Strategie 2027\" Kapsch TrafficCom launched a multi-year technology transformation program in the financial year 2021/22. The goal of this program is to safeguard and modernize the company's technology portfolio and reinforce its leadership in the marketplace. The emphasis is on advancing an agile way of working, developing the company's technology stack faster and more flexibly as well as adapting the current product and solution portfolio to the ever-evolving market requirements. This enables a faster time to market and more efficient delivery of solutions, resulting in improved revenues and margins.\n\nWith a strong focus on customers and their needs, the transformation is based on four pillars:\n\n*A technology transformation program aims at efficient delivery of state-of-the-art solutions.*\n\n- Product portfolio. In the product area, the product management team was strengthened. The team was also given responsibility to manage and steer the portfolio by means of a holistic view and a portfolio strategy aimed at consolidation and optimization. This identifies commonalities and synergies and builds on intelligent platforms.\n- Technology stack. The technology stack evolution allows Kapsch TrafficCom to accelerate the migration to the cloud as well as the adoption of new technologies and architectures. The technology stack is the frame for standardizing and developing technologies.\n- Organization and processes. Kapsch TrafficCom introduced SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework©) to continuously improve its software engineering methodology, organization and processes. This system and software engineering methodology leverages industry-standard agile principles to enable the development of the most complex software and cyber-physical systems and to promote customer centricity. The initial pilot projects showed successful outcomes in software development. The key improvements included better alignment with customer requirements, enhanced quality through early defect detection and increased predictability by adapting swiftly to changes. In the next step, these methods will be expanded to other teams in order to accelerate and improve the quality of software releases, with a focus on effectively meeting customer needs.\n- Culture. Fostering and nurturing a culture of collaboration, curiosity and innovation is the fourth pillar of transformation and a key success factor.\n\nIn the financial year 2022/23, the patent portfolio of Kapsch TrafficCom was further optimized. The focus was on topics of high strategic importance. As of March 31, 2024, the patent portfolio consisted of 118 patent families with 824 individual patents and 41 pending patent applications. In the financial year, three new patent families were filed in the field of tolling and one patent family was discontinued.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom strives to mitigate the risk of patent infringements and to foster the patenting of new ideas. Hence, the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management focuses on supporting product management and product development. Patent analysis in various areas ensures that products and solutions are actually free to operate. Based on these patent analyses and the expertise gained from them, Kapsch TrafficCom also intends to file more of its own patents in order to secure its freedom to operate and its unique selling proposition for its products and solutions.\n\nIn addition, the global patent monitoring system was further established. Its task is to analyze patent applications from competitors and in relevant technology segments in order to gain a better overview of competitors' strategies.\n\nThe development expenses of Kapsch TrafficCom amounted to EUR 80.0 million in the financial year 2023/24 (previous year: EUR 78.3 million). This corresponds to 14.8% (previous year: 14.2%) of total Group revenues. They are divided as follows:\n\n- Expenses for customer-specific developments: EUR 55.4 million (previous year: EUR 51.3 million)\n- Expenses for product management, development support and generic development: EUR 24.5 million (previous year: EUR 27.1 million)\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *2 Anticipated development and risks.*\n\n## 2.1 Outlook to financial year 2024/25.\n\nFor the financial year 2024/25, the management expects revenues to grow above the forecasted average annual market growth of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. The operating result (EBIT) should show a slight improvement compared to the result adjusted for one-time effects of EUR 15.1 million, whereby positive one-time effects are also possible again.\n\n*Expectation for financial year 2024/25:*\n\n*Revenue growth above market growth*\n\n*Slight improvement in earnings (EBIT)* \n\n## Revenues.\n\nRevenues continue to be affected by the economic and political uncertainties in connection with the global conflicts. In the past financial year, net revenues were also negatively impacted by a customer credit note and deferred revenues.\n\nThe high order intake and order backlog will increasingly be reflected in revenues and form a solid basis for further growth. In the medium term, it should at least be possible to return to the pre-crisis revenue level of almost EUR 740 million in the 2018/19 financial year.\n\n## EBIT (operating result).\n\nThe EBIT of the past year was influenced by many one-time effects, both positive and negative. Kapsch TrafficCom is therefore utilizing the figure of EUR 15.1 million adjusted for these one-time effects as a starting point for further development.\n\nDespite the improved situation, the focus remains on costs. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom is analyzing its process organization from bottom to top according to a Zero Base Approach in order to avoid project difficulties of the past in the future. The aim is to increase efficiency through global standards and tools.\n\n## Liquidity.\n\nThe increase in invoiced revenues in the reporting period and the recently awarded projects will be reflected in earnings and liquidity. In addition, the restructuring of financing has led to a longer-term financing structure. In May 2024, the term of the existing restructuring agreement, including all credit lines, was extended until March 31, 2026.\n\nAs of the reporting date, Kapsch TrafficCom had already generated around half of the further cash inflows from pending proceedings and other measures of at least EUR 30 million targeted in the half-year 2023/24: The total net cash inflow from the settlement agreement in Germany was around EUR 5 million higher than expected; the sale of two investments that are not part of the strategic core business also generated inflows of around EUR 11 million, of which the sale of the investment in TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited (TMT), South Africa, (EUR 3 million) took place after the balance sheet date. The management is still aiming for further cash inflows to reduce net debt further. The aim is to achieve a minimum level of net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0x in the longer term.\n\nIn connection with this, the aim is also to release the dividend block and lift the pledge on the shares of the core shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\n## Non-financial targets.\n\nThe company's non-financial targets can be found in the separate non-financial report in accordance with Section 267a UGB.\n\n## Corporate governance.\n\nThe mandates of Franz Semmernegg and Harald Sommerer as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board will expire in financial year 2024/25. Both will leave the Board. In the course of the new elections, the Supervisory Board is to be intentionally positioned more strongly as an advisory body to the Executive Board.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Strategy 2027.\n\nGlobal megatrends as well as growing awareness and legal requirements regarding climate and environmental protection are increasing the demand for comprehensive and intelligent transportation solutions. More and more, this confirms that Kapsch TrafficCom is addressing the right issues with its Strategy 2027, even if implementation is taking longer than originally assumed due to the market situation.\n\nA comprehensive strategy review was launched in the past financial year and is still ongoing. One of the first changes resulting from this was the sale of the non-core investments Traffic Technology Services, Inc. in the USA (TTS) and TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited in South Africa (TMT).\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is still predominantly perceived as a hardware provider. In fact, however, the company is already more of a provider of software and services; this development and change will continue – while retaining the hardware component – and will be shaped in the strategy review.\n\n## 2.2 Risk report.\n\n## 2.2.1 Risk management.\n\nThe enterprise-wide risk management process (Enterprise Risk Management, ERM) of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework, an internationally recognized standard for risk management.\n\nThe risk management process aims at an early identification, assessment, and management of those risks that can significantly affect the achievement of the strategic and operating objectives of the company. The primary goal is not risk avoidance, but the controlled and conscious handling of risks and the timely recognition and exploitation of opportunities that arise. In this way, ERM makes a valuable contribution to corporate management.\n\nAs part of ERM, major risks are identified, quantified, and globally aggregated on a quarterly basis. The risk report derived from this enables the concise assessment and monitoring of the major business risks. The report is sent to the Executive Board, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, and the first reporting level. The Audit Committee is informed immediately by the Executive Board about important events. The Supervisory Board also deals with the effectiveness of the risk management system as part of its monitoring of the Executive Board. The design and implementation aspects of the risk management system are reviewed annually by the auditor in accordance with Rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (ÖCGK) to ensure that the system is adequately designed and implemented. To further strengthen risk management, internal audits are carried out after this external audit to assess the operational effectiveness of the system. This proactive approach enables Kapsch TrafficCom to continuously improve and ensure the effectiveness of its risk management in day-to-day operations.\n\nThe project-oriented risk management encompasses both customer projects and internal development projects. Using institutionalized processes, an analysis of all relevant risks and opportunities is already carried out in the course of offer preparation. Consequently, a basis is created for decisions and for the timely planning and implementation of control measures.\n\n*Risk management entails the identification, assessment and control of risks.*\n\nThe main generic risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom and the general handling of these risks are briefly discussed in the following. The environmental, social and governance impacts, risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom are explained in the separate non-financial report.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.2 Industry-specific risks.\n\nVolatility of new orders. Kapsch TrafficCom's most relevant customer groups include primarily government agencies and municipal authorities as well as private concessionaires, public-private partnerships and consumers. Larger contracts\n\nare usually tendered. Until a contract is actually awarded to Kapsch TrafficCom, there are a number of uncertainty factors both within and outside of the company's area of influence. For example, political changes, appeals or lawsuits by unsuccessful bidders can lead to a delay in the awarding of a contract, to its cancellation or to a modification of the tender.\n\nThere is also the risk that offers made by Kapsch TrafficCom will not succeed for technological, financial, formal or other reasons.\n\nThe expansion into new business areas is aimed at increasing revenue growth and smoothing out revenue spikes in order to achieve a more stable revenue development. This is to be achieved in particular by further broadening the customer and product portfolio and by increasing the share of revenue from the operating business (technical and commercial operations of systems usually previously set up by the company) and from the tolling service business. The latter is typically commissioned on a long-term basis and is therefore characterized by better predictable revenues.\n\nThe economic situation of relevant national economies, possible government investment programs, changes in political priorities, an increasing focus on sustainability, trade conflicts, military conflicts or epidemics can have a significant impact on incoming orders.\n\nRisks of project execution. Intelligent transportation solutions are often technically complex and challenging systems, that must be implemented within a strict timeframe. However, the actual project environment cannot be\n\nfully analyzed and taken into account during the preparation of an offer. Therefore, uncertainties remain with regard to integration efforts for third-party systems, efforts for interfaces and other factors accelerating or delaying the handling of projects. Unavoidable dependencies on suppliers and service providers can also have a negative effect on the\n\n*Technical challenges and tight schedules cause typical project risks.*\n\nquality and timely completion of a project. All of these factors thus affect the risk of missed deadlines and/or system and product defects.\n\nIn connection with the installation of systems, Kapsch TrafficCom is generally contractually obligated to issue performance and delivery date guarantees. If the contractual services are not fulfilled or if deadlines are exceeded, penalties and damages usually have to be paid, in some cases even damages for lost toll revenue. Significant missed deadlines can also result in premature termination of a contract by the customer. A significant delay in a project, a clear failure to meet the contractually agreed performance criteria or failed implementation of a project could reduce the chances of success in future tenders. There is also the risk that projects of Kapsch TrafficCom cannot be realized at the previously calculated costs. Due to the strong social opposition to toll systems that is sometimes encountered, the risk of a late or limited start to toll collection exists, which can have further consequences on revenues, profitability and payment flows in the operation project.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom employs project management methods and project risk management procedures based on the IPMA (International Project Management Association) standards in order to minimize such risks in projects.\n\nLong-term contracts with public agencies. For many projects, contracts are awarded by public agencies. Framework agreements and service contracts in connection with tolling or traffic management projects may include terms and conditions that are not negotiable in a tender process and that may be disadvantageous for Kapsch TrafficCom. Some multi-year contracts contain demanding requirements regarding the targeted performance of the implemented systems, components and processes. Failure to meet these requirements can result in considerable contractual penalties, obligations to pay damages or termination of the contract. On the other hand, in some contracts substantial bonus payments may be earned in the case of over-performance. Moreover, for long-term contracts, the achievable margins may deviate from the original calculations due to cost changes.\n\n*Geographic diversification and expansion of the product portfolio contribute to stabilizing revenues.* \n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nContracts may entail liabilities relating to a loss of profit by customers, product liabilities and other liabilities. Kapsch TrafficCom strives to include appropriate limitations of liability in contracts. However, there can be no assurance that all contracts will contain sufficient limitations of liability or that they will be enforceable under applicable law.\n\nRisks in the supply chain. As a manufacturer of high-tech, multi-component devices and as a supplier of these devices and/or third-party products in the context of tolling and traffic management projects, Kapsch TrafficCom is dependent on the functional capability of the supply chain. It is essential to receive ordered components on time in order to ensure that they are available for ongoing projects when needed. At the same time, the components must be of good quality and offered at a reasonable price to achieve satisfactory financial results.\n\nThe situation on the global market for semi-conductors can be significantly affected by shifts in production capacity, geopolitical changes in the main production regions and disruptions in logistics. This can lead to the unavailability of the necessary components as well as fluctuations in delivery times and prices and cause difficulties in ongoing projects. Financial or operational difficulties at individual suppliers can also lead to delays in delivery, additional costs or a deterioration in the price-performance ratio of the components if supplier substitution is necessary.\n\nThis risk is limited by the fact that Kapsch TrafficCom ensures that at least two suppliers from different countries of origin are utilized for critical materials, insofar as this is economically feasible.\n\n## 2.2.3 Strategic risks.\n\nAbility to innovate. The strong market position of Kapsch TrafficCom is based to a large extent on its ability to develop high quality, efficient and reliable systems, components, solutions and services. Kapsch TrafficCom is\n\ncommitted to ongoing and consistent innovation. In order to maintain its high technological standards, Kapsch TrafficCom invests in research and development activities. However, if Kapsch TrafficCom does not succeed in developing innovative systems, components, solutions and services in line with market requirements, this may be detrimental to its competitive position.\n\n*An ongoing and consistent innovation process supports the strong market position.*\n\n*The international growth is opening up new opportunities*\n\n*but also poses risks.*\n\nSince the striving for innovation leadership is based to a large extent on technology, internal know-how and intellectual property, the global increase in product piracy and reverse engineering may have negative impacts on the market position of Kapsch TrafficCom. The company therefore places great importance on protecting technologies and the company's internal know-how, such as through patents and non-disclosure agreements with relevant contractual partners. On the other hand, newly developed systems, components, solutions or services may also infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\nAcquisition and integration of companies as part of the Group's growth. The Group's growth can be organic as well as through selected acquisitions or the establishment of joint ventures. In the course of these activities, it is\n\nnecessary to overcome a number of challenges in order to achieve the desired goals and synergies, as well as to realize the expected opportunities arising from the acquisition of new technologies and market knowhow.\n\nCountry risk. Due to the further expansion of business activities in countries outside of Europe, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to increased political risk in some countries. Significant and currently unforeseeable political changes may have a major impact on the ability to implement or operate projects in these countries as well as to make funds available or withdraw them again. Interference with the property rights of Kapsch TrafficCom or problems with business practices and activities may also arise. Kapsch TrafficCom includes these risks in the evaluation of such projects.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.4 Financial risks.\n\nForeign exchange risk. As a global company, Kapsch TrafficCom maintains branches and subsidiaries in many countries outside the Euro zone. Consequently, transaction risks arise from possible exchange rate fluctuations,\n\nwhich may be reflected in the consolidated financial statements as exchange rate losses or gains. Kapsch TrafficCom strives as far as possible to avoid these transaction risks in the amount of the net currency positions from the respective projects or to hedge them, if necessary. However, because the net currency position at the respective payment flow deadlines is often difficult to predict, hedging is only possible to a limited extent. The remaining exchange rate risk is accepted and included\n\n*Financial risks arise from exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations as well as loans. Sufficient liquidity increases the flexibility and the ability to take quick action.*\n\nin the business planning. Due to the conversion of individual financial statements of the subsidiaries outside the Euro zone into the Group currency of the Euro, Kapsch TrafficCom is also subject to a translation risk. In addition, long-term disadvantageous exchange rate changes can also cause a change in the position of Kapsch TrafficCom relative to competitors, such as when products or services based on a euro-cost structure can no longer be offered at competitive prices outside the Euro zone.\n\nInterest rate risk. Within the framework of project financing, the Group regularly agrees to variable interest rates that are tied to market interest rates (e.g. Euribor). In this context, there is an interest rate risk, which — where material — is hedged by suitable financial instruments.\n\nLiquidity risk. Sufficient financial resources have to be available for Kapsch TrafficCom to meet its payment obligations at all times. The availability of medium- and long-term financing is necessary for the implementation of large-scale projects, such as the implementation of a nationwide tolling system with an agreed delayed payment by a major client, and for the acquisition of companies. In addition, the execution of large projects regularly requires the provision of bank guarantees, some of which are extensive, as collateral for bid obligations (bid bonds) or to secure possible warranty claims (performance bonds).\n\nIn financing agreements, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to the usual limitations of its business policy, such as with regard to taking on additional borrowings, the use of assets as collateral or the provision of guarantees and sureties in favor of third parties. The availability of financing and bank guarantees depends not only on market conditions but in particular on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. A lack of liquid assets (even if the Group is otherwise essentially solvent), of financing or of bank guarantees could in turn have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. The Group continuously monitors compliance with all covenants in connection with loan agreements.\n\nLiquidity risk is counteracted by ongoing Group-wide cash flow planning. This enables potential liquidity bottlenecks to be identified at an early stage and appropriate countermeasures to be taken in time.\n\nCredit risk. Kapsch TrafficCom is exposed to the risk of non-payment by customers. The main customers of Kapsch TrafficCom are to a large extent state agencies, especially in connection with the implementation or operation of nation-wide or regional tolling and traffic management systems. Kapsch TrafficCom also acts as a subcontractor to third parties (for example concessionaires, general contractors, etc.) in public sector projects. The scope of a potential non-payment varies depending on the size of the order and can have a noticeable impact on the earnings situation in the case of individual large projects. The creditworthiness of new and existing customers is evaluated, and hedging is performed according to the assessment of the existing non-payment risk. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom takes advantage of offers from public institutions, such as OeKB (Oesterreichische Kontrollbank), EKN (Exportkreditnämnden; Swedish National Export Credits Guarantee Board) and MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency), to hedge against the non-payment risk on the basis of guarantees. Moverover, there is a risk that counterparties of both original and derivative financial instruments (including financial institutions assumed to have good credit ratings) cannot meet their payment liabilities when due. A payment default or the need to impair receivables could have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.5 Personnel risk.\n\nThe success of Kapsch TrafficCom depends to a significant extent on key personnel, in particular technical experts with many years of specific experience. In addition, the ability to recruit qualified employees with state-of-the-art\n\ntechnology knowledge, to integrate them into the Company and to retain them in the long term is of high importance for the success of the Group. The loss of important employees in key positions and difficulties in recruiting personnel can have a negative impact on the success of the Group.\n\n*Kapsch TrafficCom is taking attractive measures to counteract personnel risk.*\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has been proactively implementing measures to counteract this risk for several years. These include, for example, an internal career and training platform that allows employees to advance their careers autonomously and away from approval processes. Attractive offers such as bonus systems or further training opportunities additionally support these efforts. A periodic employee survey as well as an \"OpenLine2CEO\" to Georg Kapsch enable the management to identify current concerns, worries and wishes as well as the general mood and to respond appropriately.\n\n## 2.2.6 Legal risk.\n\nA large number of regulations and legal requirements must be observed in connection with participation in public sector tenders, the establishment and operation of tolling and mobility solutions, acquisitions and cooperations as well as capital market issues. It may take a considerable administrative, technical and commercial effort to capture, enforce and monitor all compliance requirements. If applicable regulations or official requirements cannot be met, this can lead to severe penalties and also reduce the ability of (successfully) taking part in future tenders as well as restrict the continuation of the relevant business activity.\n\nThe expansion of business activities into new regions and into select new business fields tends to increase the risk of patent violations or the violation of intellectual property rights (IPR). This can result in financial damages from court actions. Kapsch TrafficCom attempts to counteract this risk as far as possible by performing an evaluation of possible IPR violations prior to entry into new markets or regions, for example. However, it is not possible to completely avoid this risk.\n\nChanges in the geopolitical situation, such as military conflicts, can lead to the legal framework becoming more complex as a result of sanctions and embargoes being imposed. In order to remain compliant with the respective requirements, Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the relevant regulations.\n\n## 2.2.7 Cyber-risk.\n\nAs a core process of ISO/IEC 27001, Kapsch TrafficCom has a uniform risk management process for information security that is integrated into corporate risk management. The structured approach to considering risks related to information security is derived from Kapsch TrafficCom's business processes and represents a holistic approach. The risk management process is implemented in all companies whose IT is fully integrated into the Group IT, regardless of whether they are formally certified in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 or not.\n\n## 2.2.8 Operational risks.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's involvement in the realization of complex tolling and traffic management projects as well as in the production of components entails certain operational risks, including risks in the areas of health, safety, environment and quality (HSSEQ). In order to adequately mitigate these risks, Kapsch TrafficCom has developed internal processes that meet the requirements of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. In addition, aspects of ISO 9001 were integrated in order to meet quality management standards, and at individual locations also aspects of ISO 50001 in order to efficiently organize energy management and optimize energy consumption.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nLocal legal requirements sometimes exceed ISO standards, therefore Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the legal requirements in the countries in which it operates. This ensures that the operational standards always comply with the strictest local regulations.\n\nThrough regular training and further education, Kapsch TrafficCom strengthens the awareness and skills of its employees with regard to HSSEQ topics. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom utilizes ongoing audits and performance analyses to monitor and continuously improve compliance with these standards. This systematic approach not only helps to minimize risks, but also promotes sustainable corporate management and increases customer satisfaction.\n\n## 2.2.9 Opportunities.\n\nThe enterprise risk management approach of Kapsch TrafficCom not only addresses risks but also encompasses the regular identification, evaluation and management of opportunities. The goal of these efforts is to manage the strategic orientation of the product portfolio and market activities through\n\nthe early identification of opportunities and to develop corresponding potential.\n\n*The early identification of opportunities opens up new potential.*\n\nMarket opportunities exist in geographic diversification as well as increasing expansion of the customer and product portfolios, driven in part by the following factors\n\n- Opportunities arise from so-called change requests requests for changes from customers that only arise in the course of project execution. These change requests result in extensions to the contractual delivery components and are priced and paid for separately.\n- In addition, the increasing financing requirements of infrastructure projects and the growing need to relieve government budgets are creating opportunities both to open up new tolling markets in so-called emerging and developing countries and to expand activities in already developed markets.\n- The global rise in traffic volumes and the associated impact on the environment and society open up further opportunities in the area of mobility solutions, as, for example, toll collection, traffic management and demand management are increasingly being used as controlling instruments in environmental and traffic policy. In both segments, this creates opportunities to further develop and market the portfolio in line with the new requirements.\n- Furthermore, demands with regard to increasing the productivity of vehicles and vehicle operations, as well as the rising comfort expectations of travelers, are opening up opportunities by expanding the functionalities of existing systems. This offers opportunities to acquire new customers or to serve both public-sector customers and end customers with new concepts. This particularly applies in the area of tolling services.\n\nOther opportunities. Continuous innovation, technical advancements and the acquisition of new technologies by means of corporate acquisitions create opportunities for Kapsch TrafficCom to improve efficiency and performance of customer systems and to gain a technological edge over competitors with regard to the performance and functionality of the offered systems.\n\n## 2.2.10 Overall assessment of the risk situation.\n\nFrom the current perspective, no risks have been identified that could endanger the continued operations of Kapsch TrafficCom. Due to the geographic diversification, the continuous expansion of the product and solution portfolio as well as the development of new business models through selected new ITS solutions, the business activities of Kapsch TrafficCom could be positioned more broadly without the need to step outside the core business area. The concentration of risk in individual regions and in individual large projects was thereby reduced.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.3 Internal control system with respect to the accounting process.\n\nAs in the previous year, the Group-wide uniform documentation of all controls for achieving the key controlling goals was advanced again in the financial year 2023/24. This aims to increase efficiency and at the same time reduce risk in the Group as well as to show alternative courses of action to management. *The uniform documentation of all*\n\n## *controls is being advanced.*\n\nThe basis of the processes for Group accounting and reporting is an\n\naccounting manual (IFRS Accounting Manual), that is issued and regularly updated by the Kapsch Group. In this manual, the essential accounting and reporting requirements based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are specified throughout the Group. Another important basis of the internal control system (ICS) are the Group guidelines, work instructions and process descriptions.\n\nCentral elements of the ICS are execution of the principle of dual control and the segregation of duties as well as defined actions for monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of operating activities, the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with relevant legal regulations. In this regard, Kapsch TrafficCom acts based on international standards and best practices, such as COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework.\n\nThe accounting of business transactions in Kapsch TrafficCom is managed by a variety of software solutions. In a number of countries, the accounting has been outsourced to local tax accountants due to the small size of the subsidiaries. The individual companies submit reporting packages to the head office on a monthly basis containing all relevant accounting data pertaining to the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow accounting. This data is then entered into the central consolidation system OneStream on a monthly basis. The financial information is reviewed at Group level by Kapsch TrafficCom AG and forms the basis for interim reporting.\n\nThe Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board in regular meetings about the economic development in the form of consolidated presentations consisting of segment reporting, earnings development with budget and year-on-year comparison, forecasts, consolidated financial statements, personnel and order development as well as selected key financial figures.\n\n*The ICS is implemented locally and monitored centrally.*\n\nIn accordance with local requirements, responsibility for the implementation\n\nand monitoring of the internal control system lies with the relevant local management. The management of the individual subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and designing an internal control system in line with the requirements of the respective company with regard to the accounting process and for ensuring compliance with the Group-wide guidelines and regulations.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *3 Other disclosures.*\n\n## 3.1 Disclosures on capital, share, voting and control rights and related agreements.\n\nThe fully paid-in share capital of Kapsch TrafficCom AG amounts to EUR 14.3 million. It is divided into 14.3 million shares. There are no legal or statutory caps or restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or the transfer of shares. KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH held roughly 63.3% of the shares as of March 31, 2024. In connection with the refinancing, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH pledged all of its shares in Kapsch TrafficCom AG in favor of the financing banks in financial year 2023/24. This also results in restrictions customary in the market with respect to the transfer of the shares and a corresponding requirement for the consent of these banks.\n\nKAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of DATAX HandelsgmbH, whose shares are held (partly indirectly, partly directly) in equal parts by Traditio-Privatstiftung and Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung, two private foundations under the Austrian Private Foundation Act. Each of these private foundations is managed by its own Executive Board, with no individual serving on both boards. The beneficiaries of these private foundations are Georg Kapsch and members of his family (Traditio-Privatstiftung) as well as Elisabeth Kapsch and members of her family (Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung).\n\nThere was no other shareholder holding more than 10% of the voting rights in Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of March 31, 2024. In the financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom did not acquire or dispose of any treasury shares and did not hold any as of the balance sheet date.\n\nNo shares with special control rights exist. No restrictions exist with respect to the exercising of the voting right by employees with capital participation. There are no special provisions regarding the appointment and recall of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the modification of the articles of association.\n\nThe Company currently has no conditional capital authorizing the Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares without (further) referral to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nConventional \"change of control\" clauses, which may lead to termination of the contract, relate to financing agreements, such as the promissory note bond (\"Schuldscheindarlehen\") and further financing, totaling about EUR 94 million, or are related to individual customer contracts.\n\nNo compensation agreements exist between Kapsch TrafficCom AG and its Executive Board and Supervisory Board Members or employees for the event of a public takeover offer.\n\n## 3.2 Corporate Governance Report.\n\nIn accordance with C-rule 61 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, it is pointed out that the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report can be accessed on the internet at https://www.kapsch.net/en/ir/Corporate-Governance.\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief

global supplier of superior technologies, solutions and services of the ITS market (Intelligent Transportation Systems). Intelligent Transportation Systems support and optimize the traffic. They use therefore information and communication solutions.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom operates in two segments: Tolling and Traffic Management.\n\n## Tolling.\n\nThis segment comprises activities relating to the implementation and the technical and commercial operation of toll collection systems. Projects are generally awarded by public agencies or private concessionaires in the context of tender procedures. Toll collection systems may comprise both individual road sections and nation-wide road networks. The manufacture and procurement of components both for the expansion and adaptation of the systems installed by Kapsch TrafficCom and on behalf of third parties complete the portfolio of Kapsch TrafficCom; toll services for business customers and private customers further complete it.\n\n## Traffic Management.\n\nThis segment primarily comprises activities relating to the implementation and operation of systems and solutions for controlling traffic and mobility behavior, as well as the relating components business. The strategic focus is on the areas of traffic optimization, decision intelligence (analysis, simulation and prediction of traffic) and the operation of mobility platforms and services. One basis for this is the use of increasing amounts of data for analysis, simulation and intelligent control of traffic flows and mobility behavior. Customers in the traffic management segment are mainly public authorities but also private companies.\n\n## 1.1 Group structure and consolidated group.\n\nThe parent company (reporting entity) of this group is Kapsch TrafficCom AG. The company is a joint stock corporation incorporated and domiciled in, Am Europlatz 2, 1120 Vienna, Austria.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, held a share of 63.3% in Kapsch TrafficCom AG. KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH is a 100%-subsidiary of DATAX HandelsgmbH, Vienna, which is the controlling entity of Kapsch TrafficCom AG and the ultimate parent of Kapsch Group. The shares of Kapsch TrafficCom AG are listed in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange since June 26, 2007.\n\nThe consolidated group as well as changes in the scope of consolidation are included in note 29.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of Preparation.\n\nPursuant to Section 245a Austrian Commercial Code (UGB), the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\nFor ease of presentation, amounts have been rounded and, unless indicated otherwise, are presented in thousands of Euros (EUR k). However, calculations are done using exact amounts, including the digits not shown, which may lead to rounding differences.\n\n## 1.3 Accounting and valuation principles.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024 are prepared under the historical cost concept, with the exception of financial instruments measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. The measurement was made accordingly at the balance sheet date. Pertinent explanations can be found within the scope of the corresponding accounting policies. The accounting and valuation principles, which form the basis for these consolidated financial statements, were applied unchanged to the previous period and supplemented by new mandatory guidelines applicable from the financial year. Note 34 provides a detailed description of all accounting and valuation principles, including new accounting and valuation principles to be applied.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.4 Material accounting estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future developments. These influence the amount and presentation of assets and liabilities reported at the balance sheet date as well as income and expenses recorded during the reporting period. Estimates are made by the Executive Board to the best of their knowledge. Nevertheless, the actual values may differ from these estimates. All estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will generally differ from actual results.\n\nIn particular, estimates and assumptions regarding the following areas have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\n\n## 1.4.1 Revenue recognition for contract work.\n\nThe Group applies the rules of IFRS 15. Revenue for implementation projects, that fulfill the criteria of IFRS 15.35 for revenue recognition over time, is recognized in accordance with the corresponding stage of completion, with an expected profit margin already being assumed. The stage of completion is determined by an input orientated method using the ratio between the costs already incurred and the expected total costs of the corresponding contract. This requires to continuously estimate and update the planned costs arising from the contract as well as the risks arising from project management. This may result from technical difficulties, delays in the schedule or difficulties with sub-suppliers or other external general conditions, and which influence the profit margin of the project. Furthermore, these projects may also lead to damages or penalties that are to be considered during the project evaluation and which require an assessment of risks. For most contracts, contract revenue is defined and includes fixed elements and partly variable elements that are assessed by probability as to their amounts and timing. Large-scale orders of the Group are usually technically complex individual orders based on specific terms and conditions which therefore are to be critically assessed with regard to revenue recognition and project risks on an individual basis. Details to the revenue recognition are included in note 34.3 and sensitivity analysis is included in note 20.\n\n## 1.4.2 Estimated impairment of goodwill.\n\nIn accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 13 and 34, the Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable amount of cash generating units is determined on the basis of the calculation of the value in use. Therefore assumptions must be made and used as a basis for this. Sensitivities for the acquired goodwill are detailed in note 13.\n\n## 1.4.3 Recognition of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group reviews the recognition of deferred tax assets at least on an annual basis. These deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to offset the temporary differences. Deferred taxes on loss carryforwards are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and, in particular in the case of a history of losses, there is convincing substantial evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future to utilize these loss carryforwards. Assumptions must be made and used as a basis for this. The sensitivities are listed in note 17.\n\n## 1.4.4 Other estimates and assumptions.\n\nFurther areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements include impairment of inventories, assumption of useful lives for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, assumptions and interest rates related to liabilities from post-employment benefits to employees, assumptions and interest rates related to leasing contracts, as well as provisions for warranties and losses for onerous contracts. Sensitivity analyses of the assumptions made by the Group are included in the respective notes.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2 Segment information.\n\n## Operating segments.\n\nAn operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses. The operating results of the segments are regularly reported to the Executive Board (chief operating decision maker). Resource allocation decisions are reviewed based on these segments. The Executive Board has identified two reportable segments (as described in note 1 and 34.4):\n\n## ■ Tolling\n\n■ Traffic Management\n\nThe segment results, as well as capital expenditure, depreciation and impairment and other non-cash-effective positions for the reporting period and the previous financial year are as follows:\n\n|                                                                 | 2022/23        |                            |                | 2023/24        |                            |                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------|\n|                                                                 | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Manage-<br>ment | Total          | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Manage-<br>ment | Total          |\n| Invoiced sales                                                  | 394,811        | 154,934                    | 549,745        | 396,491        | 161,339                    | 557,831        |\n| Accrued sales                                                   | 8,570          | -4,900                     | 3,670          | -18,190        | -798                       | -18,989        |\n| <b>Revenues</b>                                                 | <b>403,380</b> | <b>150,035</b>             | <b>553,415</b> | <b>378,301</b> | <b>160,541</b>             | <b>538,842</b> |\n| Implementation                                                  | 119,389        | 44,620                     | 164,009        | 96,681         | 55,870                     | 152,551        |\n| Operations                                                      | 202,486        | 99,789                     | 302,274        | 207,730        | 93,210                     | 300,940        |\n| Components                                                      | 81,506         | 5,626                      | 87,132         | 73,890         | 11,461                     | 85,351         |\n| Operating result1)                                              | -9,331         | 14,576                     | 5,245          | 54,328         | 15,930                     | 70,258         |\n| EBIT margin1)                                                   | -2.3%          | 9.7%                       | 0.9%           | 14.4%          | 9.9%                       | 13.0%          |\n| Capital expenditure2)                                           | 20,015         | 6,458                      | 26,473         | 8,013          | 5,222                      | 13,235         |\n| Depreciation and impairment                                     | 16,584         | 5,237                      | 21,821         | 13,934         | 4,342                      | 18,276         |\n| Other non-cash-effective positions                              | 4,420          | -1,280                     | 3,140          | -10,457        | 781                        | -9,676         |\n| Share of operating result from associates<br>and joint ventures | -1,479         | -201                       | -1,681         | 15,418         | 0                          | 15,418         |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\n2) Capital expenditure includes also capital expenditure for right-of-use assets from leases (see note 12 and 13).\n\nThe business types implementation, operations and components also correspond to performance obligations pursuant to IFRS 15.\n\nThe segment assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date are as follows:\n\n|                                            | March 31, 2023 |                       |         | March 31, 2024 |                       |         |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------|----------------|-----------------------|---------|\n|                                            | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Management | Total   | Tolling        | Traffic<br>Management | Total   |\n| Segment assets                             | 228,859        | 90,664                | 319,523 | 218,517        | 110,242               | 328,758 |\n| Interests in associates and joint ventures | 24,736         | 0                     | 24,736  | 3,592          | 0                     | 3,592   |\n| Segment liabilities                        | 153,460        | 84,067                | 237,527 | 158,117        | 94,308                | 252,424 |\n\nThe segment assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, other non-current assets, non-current and current contract assets, non-current and current lease receivables, inventories, trade receivables and other current assets as well as current tax receivables.

Accordingly, autoTicket GmbH, a joint venture between Kapsch TrafficCom and CTS EVEN-TIM, received an amount of EUR 243 million from the Federal Republic of Germany. An amount of EUR 66.3 million is recognized in other operating income.\n\nOperating foreign exchange gains mainly related to exchange rate fluctuations from the Argentine Peso and the Canadian Dollar against the US Dollar and the Euro.\n\nIncome from the sale of subsidiaries in the previous financial year refers mainly to the sale of Arce Mobility Solutions, S.A.\n\nIn connection with the restructuring of financing, Kapsch TrafficCom standardized the reporting of gains and losses from derivatives designated to hedge foreign currency risk and interest rate risk and has reported all effects from these hedging instruments in the financial result since the 2023/24 financial year.

These losses are primarily attributable to exchange rate fluctuations of the Argentine peso, the Chilean peso, and the South African rand against the euro and the US dollar.\n\nCommunication and IT expenses rose by EUR 2,968 k compared to the previous financial year, with significant increases in the USA and Austria. Legal and consulting costs increased by EUR 2,762 k, primarily due to attorney fees associated with the restructuring agreement.\n\nThe losses from deconsolidation of companies primarily resulted from the liquidation of Streetline Inc., based in Foster City, USA.\n\nFollowing an agreement with a customer regarding overdue receivables, the impairment allowance for these receivables, amounting to EUR 10.1 million, was reversed. The agreement included an instalment payment plan of EUR 4.5 million and a credit note for the receivables totalling EUR 5.6 million, which was also recognized in revenue.\n\n## 8 Expenses for amortization, depreciation and impairment.\n\n|                                               | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment | -17,330 | -14,064 |\n| Amortization of intangible assets             | -4,491  | -4,191  |\n| Impairment on intangible assets               | 0       | -21     |\n| Total                                         | -21,821 | -18,276 |\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment also includes depreciation of right-of-use assets from leases (EUR 10,057 k). Details can be found in note 12. The decrease in depreciation of property, plant, and equipment mainly involves depreciation on right-of-use assets from building leases. This is primarily due to an office building lease in the USA that was terminated early in the 2022/23 financial year.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 9 Financial result.\n\n|                                                                                               | 2022/23<br>(adjusted) | 2023/24        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Interest income                                                                               | 2,087                 | 1,838          |\n| Interest income from leases                                                                   | 11                    | 14             |\n| Income from securities, recognized at fair value through profit or loss                       | 36                    | 118            |\n| Income from investments, recognized at fair value through profit or loss                      | 436                   | 153            |\n| Income from accrued interest of non-current receivables                                       | 0                     | 156            |\n| Gains from derivative financial instruments1)                                                 | 2,352                 | 1,206          |\n| Income from hyperinflation adjustment2)                                                       | 0                     | -0             |\n| Exchange rate gains from financing activities                                                 | 2,514                 | 2,907          |\n| <b>Finance income1)2)</b>                                                                     | <b>7,437</b>          | <b>6,393</b>   |\n| Interest expense                                                                              | -7,131                | -23,951        |\n| Interest expenses from leases                                                                 | -1,493                | -1,477         |\n| Expense from investments, recognized at fair value through profit or loss                     | -21                   | -11            |\n| Expense from interest accretion of non-current liabilities                                    | -11                   | -452           |\n| Losses from financial instruments                                                             | -31                   | -1,804         |\n| Expense from hyperinflation adjustment2)                                                      | -5,109                | -7,007         |\n| Exchange rate losses from financing activities                                                | -4,717                | -3,402         |\n| Interest expense from liabilities from post-employment benefits<br>to employees (see note 25) | -260                  | -710           |\n| Interest expense from liabilities from anniversary bonuses<br>to employees (see note 25)      | -15                   | -51            |\n| Expense from the disposal of financial assets                                                 | -167                  | -24            |\n| Impairment of financial assets                                                                | -2,350                | 0              |\n| Reverse of impairment of financial assets                                                     | 0                     | 2,350          |\n| <b>Finance cost2)</b>                                                                         | <b>-21,305</b>        | <b>-36,539</b> |\n| <b>Financial result1)</b>                                                                     | <b>-13,869</b>        | <b>-30,146</b> |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year.\n\n2) Adjustment previous year: netting of income from hyperinflation adjustment and expense from hyperinflation adjustment.\n\nIn the previous financial year, the interest expense totalled EUR -23,951 k, mainly attributed to the financing restructuring agreement reached in May 2023, which markedly exceeded the previous year's figures. A return to a market-standard interest rate is anticipated for the upcoming financial years.\n\nArgentina is classified as a hyperinflationary economy. The gains and losses from hyperinflation adjustments are reflected in the financial results. Since the gains and losses were not offset in the previous year but were offset in the 2023/24 financial year under hyperinflation expenses, a netting of the previous year's gain from hyperinflation amounting to EUR 825 k with hyperinflation expenses (hyperinflation expenses 2022/23 pre-adjustment: EUR -5,935 k) was conducted.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses primarily arose from fluctuations in foreign currencies related to intercompany financing. These notably affected subsidiaries in Zambia (Zambian Kwacha against South African Rand) and Argentina (Argentinian Peso against US Dollar).\n\nThe Group employs derivative financial instruments to hedge or minimize both interest rate and currency risks. While the Profit and Loss effects from interest rate hedging were already disclosed in the financial results, hedging related to currency risk was previously shown in operational activities due to the global business operations involving various currencies with countries and business partners.\n\nFollowing an analysis with a clear distinction between operational and financial effects in the 2023/24 financial year resulting from modifications in financing restructuring, the (positive) hedge effects concerning foreign exchange risk (primarily from hedging an intercompany loan from an EUR to a USD company) are now retrospectively reported in the financial results. The \"Operational gains from derivative contracts\" previously shown in other operating income for the previous year from derivative contracts amounting to EUR 2,352 k were accordingly reclassified into financial income for the previous year.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a result of adjustments to prior year figures regarding gains from derivative financial instruments, the following previous year positions changed as follows (first value corresponds to value before adjustment): EBIT from EUR 7,597 k to EUR 5,245 k, EBIT margin from 1.4% to 0.9%, EBIT for toll segment from EUR -7,617 k to EUR -9,331 k, toll segment EBIT margin from -1.9% to -2.3%, EBIT for traffic management segment from EUR 15,213 k to EUR 14,576 k, traffic management segment EBIT margin from 10.1% to 9.7%, EBITDA from EUR 29,418 k to EUR 27,066 k, EBITDA margin from 5.3 % to 4.9 %, financial income from EUR 5,910 k to EUR 7,437 k (including reclassification for the offsetting of hyperinflation results amounting to EUR -825 k), financial result from EUR -16,221 k to EUR -13,869 k, cash flow from result - other adjustments position from EUR -11,199 k to EUR -8,847 k, net debt to EBITDA from 6.33 to 6.88.\n\n## 10 Income taxes.\n\n|                                            | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Current income taxes                       | -6,311  | -11,888 |\n| Changes in deferred taxes                  | -8,039  | -2,724  |\n| Total                                      | -14,350 | -14,611 |\n| thereof income/expense from group taxation | -26     | 0       |\n\nThe reasons for the difference between the arithmetic tax expense/income based on the Austrian corporate income tax rate1) of 23% (previous year: 23%) and the recognized tax expense/income are as follows:\n\n|                                                                              | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Result before income taxes                                                   | -9,890  | 36,876  |\n| Arithmetic tax expense/income                                                | 2,275   | -8,481  |\n| Effects of different tax rates in the Group                                  | -566    | -1,029  |\n| Unrecognized deferred tax assets on current tax losses and                   |         |         |\n| impairment of previously recognized tax losses                               | -10,524 | -4,853  |\n| Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrecognized previous-year tax losses | 0       | 4,518   |\n| Change of tax rate                                                           | -2,073  | 0       |\n| Tax allowances claimed and other permanent tax differences                   | 4,341   | -12,130 |\n| Income and expenses not subject to tax and other differences                 | -6,156  | 7,216   |\n| Tax effects from previous periods                                            | -1,648  | 147     |\n| Recognized tax expense/income                                                | -14,350 | -14,611 |\n\nUnrecognized deferred tax assets for current losses and write-downs of previously recognized losses mainly relate to unrecognized losses in the USA and Brazil.

Among other things, this provides for a gradual reduction in the corporation tax rate from 25% to 23% (2023: 24%, 2024: 23%). For annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements with a reporting date after January 20, 2022, the theoretical tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the new tax rates. The tax rate to be used is the rate that is likely to be applied when the temporary difference underlying the deferred tax is realized (reversed). As there were no significant realizations of deferred taxes in the 2023/24 financial year, the corporate income tax rate of 23% applicable from 2024 was used for the calculation - in line with the consolidated financial statements as at March 31, 2023.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 11 Other comprehensive income.\n\n|                                                                              | 2022/23       |                     |               | 2023/24       |                     |               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                                                              | Before taxes  | Tax expense/ income | After taxes   | Before taxes  | Tax expense/ income | After taxes   |\n| Remeasurements of liabilities from post-employment benefits                  | 2,076         | -410                | 1,666         | -1,346        | 305                 | -1,041        |\n| Currency translation differences                                             | -4,400        | 0                   | -4,400        | -715          | 0                   | -715          |\n| Currency translation differences from net investments in a foreign operation | 818           | -188                | 630           | 141           | -33                 | 109           |\n| <b>Fair value changes recognized in equity</b>                               | <b>-1,506</b> | <b>-598</b>         | <b>-2,104</b> | <b>-1,919</b> | <b>272</b>          | <b>-1,647</b> |\n\nThe USD loans granted by Kapsch TrafficCom AG to a subsidiary in the USA were classified as net investments in a foreign operation in accordance with IAS 21, as the Executive Board of Kapsch TrafficCom AG does not plan to repay these loans in the foreseeable future and repayment is not probable.

The restructuring measures include improvements of processes, optimizations of procurement, optimizations on the sales side, improvements of project processing, focusing on and improving net working capital as well as selective personnel measures.\n\nThe results of this impairment test are described below.\n\n## 13.2.1 Key assumptions for impairment testing.\n\nThe following key assumptions for determining of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units were made:\n\n|                                     | 2022/23      | 2023/24      |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Determination of recoverable amount | Value in use | Value in use |\n| Detailed planning period            | 4 years      | 6 years      |\n| Terminal value growth rate          | 2.00%        | 2.00%        |\n| Market risk premium                 | 5.71%        | 6.08%        |\n| Risk-free rate                      | 2.29%        | 2.42%        |\n\nIn the case of all cash-generating units of the Group, the market side is generally based on a project business in which the Group is commissioned to set up a tolling or traffic management system. In connection with this, longterm operation business can often be generated. In addition, system extensions (e.g. through additional routes or additional applications) and/or further ongoing component deliveries for these customers can also be provided within the framework of such long-term contracts. This characteristic of the project business is also reflected in the market planning process of the individual cash-generating units.\n\nThe Group plans each customer project for each performance obligation as carefully as possible in its project planning tool. Projects, in which systems have already been set up and where there are still medium- and long-term operations business and several years of experience with customers, can be planned very reliable. In these cases, the further development and the potential for additional business can usually be planned very reliably over the entire remaining term. For new implementation projects, the uncertainties regarding technical implementation, timing and quantities are higher. In general, the closer the award dates of such implementation projects are, the more reliable planning is in this respect. Implementation projects for which the Group has already been selected as a supplier or which are even already in the implementation phase can also be planned with particular accuracy. Projects, which are unlikely to be won or executed at the time of budgeting, are not included in the budget or medium-term planning. Uncertainties, delays and deviations can never be completely ruled out in the project business, however such risks are minimized in the best possible way by professional project management and controlling. Furthermore, planning \n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nincludes the sale of components that are not related to construction projects. This, too, can generally be estimated very well on the basis of many years of experience.\n\nIn the CGU Tolling-Americas, there are a large number of projects and demand for tolling systems, primarily in the USA but also in Latin American countries, which are assessed according to their probability and are included in the planning accordingly. Strong demand for traffic management projects (especially road safety and traffic monitoring systems) is also expected in the CGU TM-Americas and has been included in the planning accordingly.\n\nThe focus in the region EMEA is on Europe, although selected projects in Africa and the Middle East continue to be included in these CGUs. In the CGU Tolling-EMEA, demand for tolling systems remains strong, not least because of the budget constraints in many public budgets. Already won, prepared or potential implementation and operation projects, as well as their expansion, are included in the planning according to their probability. In the CGU TM-EMEA, management expects an increasing demand for traffic management systems, especially for road telematics solutions in urban areas. This is also included accordingly in the planning of this CGU.\n\nThe planning for the CGU Tolling-APAC is based on finalized implementation projects, current operation projects, their extensions, tenders either in preparation or already in progress within this region. Road telematics solutions are an essential part of the planning in the CGU TM-APAC as they are in other regions. Different projects in the field of road safety and traffic monitoring systems are expected.\n\nDelivery of components is an integral part of the plan in all Tolling CGUs.\n\nIn connection with the hostilities in Ukraine and their potential impact on the Group's business in the surrounding countries of Russia and Belarus (where projects are predominantly handled in the Tolling-EMEA CGU area), it should be noted that uncertainties and risks in these countries have also been taken into account in the planning as part of flat-rate discounts based on an overall Group view.\n\n## 13.2.2 Peer Group.\n\nIn addition to Kapsch TrafficCom AG, the peer group assumed for the impairment test comprises another eleven peer companies, of which only seven companies were relevant for determining the parameters in the financial year 2023/24 (2022/23: eleven companies – thereof six relevant). The composition of the companies in the peer group has not changed since the previous year. The debt/equity ratio of the peer group in the financial year 2023/24 was 22.5% (2022/23: 22.3%); the unlevered beta factor was 0.8 (2022/23: 0.87).\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 13.2.3 Results of the impairment test.\n\n|                                                                                                              | Tolling- |        |        | TM-      |        |        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|--------|\n| 2023/24                                                                                                      | Americas | EMEA   | APAC   | Americas | EMEA   | APAC   |\n| Carrying amount of goodwill allocated<br>to the CGU                                                          | 11,771   | 0      | 7,371  | 3,364    | 0      | 230    |\n| Carrying amount of intangible assets<br>with indefinite useful life allocated to<br>the CGU (excl. goodwill) | 0        | 232    | 0      | 0        | 64     | 0      |\n| Value in use of the CGU                                                                                      | 70,154   | 95,027 | 50,006 | 39,656   | 55,161 | 27,729 |\n| Carrying amount of the CGU                                                                                   | 45,871   | 75,613 | 10,908 | 26,210   | 30,701 | 469    |\n| Discount rate                                                                                                | 9.0%     | 14.1%  | 8.2%   | 17.0%    | 9.3%   | 8.1%   |\n| Discount rate before tax                                                                                     | 12.3%    | 18.7%  | 10.9%  | 23.1%    | 12.0%  | 10.3%  |\n| Break-even discount rate before tax                                                                          | 18.2%    | 24.0%  | 112.2% | 36.8%    | 34.6%  | 187.2% |\n\nThe recoverability of all goodwill as of March 31, 2024, was confirmed through impairment tests.

These refer to a further capital contribution in Copiloto Colombia S.A.S., Colombia, of EUR 279 k. In addition, the company NATRAS AG was founded together with a partner, in which Kapsch TrafficCom AG holds 50% of the shares. The addition for this company amounted to EUR 270 k.\n\nThe disposal of EUR 6,272 k related to the derecognized carrying amount of the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, which was sold in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nThe agreement in the arbitration proceedings between the joint venture autoTicket GmbH and the Federal Republic of Germany had a significant impact on the development of the carrying amount of shares in associated companies and joint ventures.\n\n## Associated companies.\n\n## Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA.\n\nIn March 2024, the shares in the associated company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, which was previously accounted for using the equity method, were sold. The sale led to the deconsolidation of the company. As of March 31, 2024, the carrying amount of the investment was EUR 0 (March 31, 2023: EUR 7,278 k) and Kapsch TrafficCom's share was 0.00% (March 31, 2023: 42.44%). The proportional result from this associate amounted to EUR -1,006 k in 2023/24 (2022/23: EUR -1,266 k) and is reported in the result before taxes after the financial result. In addition, a loss from the disposal of the associated company of EUR 2,230 k was recognized in earnings before taxes after the financial result. The loss on disposal results from the selling price of EUR 7,893 k less an offsetting loan of EUR 3,851 k and the carrying amount of EUR 6,272 k.\n\n## Joint ventures.\n\nThe joint ventures include autoTicket GmbH, Germany, Copiloto Colombia S.A.S., Colombia, and NATRAS AG. These companies are also accounted for using the equity method.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n## autoTicket GmbH, Deutschland.\n\nAs of August 13, 2018, the company autoTicket GmbH, Germany, (autoTicket) was acquired together with CTS EVENTIM AG & Co. KGaA as a shell company. Kapsch TrafficCom holds 50% of the shares and accounts for the company as a joint venture using the equity method. As the activities and strategy of autoTicket are part of Kapsch TrafficCom's core business, the proportional results (2023/24: EUR 29,498 k and 2022/23: EUR -1,765 k) are disclosed separately in the operating result (Item: \"Proportional result from associates and joint ventures\"). The increase in earnings in this financial year is due to the settlement of the arbitration proceedings with the Federal Republic of Germany. As a result, autoTicket GmbH received an amount of EUR 243 million in July 2023.\n\nIn February 2024, the distribution of a dividend was resolved, which was split equally amongst the shareholders.

as well as shares in investment funds.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Fair value-hierarchies and determination of fair value.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities must be classified to one of the three following fair value-hierarchies:\n\n- Level 1: There are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. In the Group, listed equity instruments are attributed to level 1.\n- Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques based on direct or indirect observable market data. This category comprises securities that are not regularly traded on a stock market, derivative financial instruments and financial liabilities. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:\n\t- Quoted market prices are used for securities.\n\t- The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n\t- The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted to present value.\n\t- The fair value of financial liabilities classified as level 2 was derived through discounting the gross cash flows over the contracted term at a risk-adjusted observable interest rate.\n- Level 3: Financial instruments whose valuation information is not based on observable market data are classified to this category. Variable purchase price components (earn-out) fall into this category, for example. They are based on agreed conditions and the expectation of the future sales/earnings development of the respective subsidiaries.

In these consolidated financial statements, tax loss carry-forwards amounting to EUR 370,281 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 351,596 k) are not recognized due to the unsecure potential for future taxable income. The not recognized tax loss carry-forwards relate to a small extent to Austria and primarily to foreign subsidiaries in Spain, in the USA, Brazil and in Zambia and are, for the predominant part, not expiring or not before 2031. All other deferred tax assets have been recognized in the respective Group companies as future deductible items.\n\nSensitivity analyzes indicate that the deferred tax assets would deviate from the previously assumed estimates by around EUR +3,686 k or EUR -3,686 k in the event of a change in earnings before taxes of +/-10%.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, taking maturities into account, when there is a legally enforceable right to offset tax assets against tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets/liabilities are attributable to the following positions:\n\n|

In case the assumptions made for the impairment of inventories would change by +/-10%, the effect would be approximately EUR -4,781 k and EUR +4,781 k (March 31, 2023: EUR -4,510 k or EUR +4,510 k).\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 19 Trade receivables and other current assets.\n\n|                                                          | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Trade receivables                                        | 98,117         | 98,489         |\n| Allowance for bad debt                                   | -13,418        | -2,670         |\n| Trade receivables – net                                  | 84,699         | 95,819         |\n| Receivables from tax authorities (other than income tax) | 14,629         | 15,228         |\n| Current lease receivables                                | 567            | 474            |\n| Other receivables and prepaid expenses                   | 18,110         | 19,953         |\n| Total                                                    | 118,005        | 131,474        |\n\nFor details on current lease receivables see note 24.\n\nOther receivables and prepaid expenses mainly include prepaid expenses in the amount of EUR 12,331 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 10,862 k), other prepayments received in the amount of EUR 5,506 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 3,262 k) and deposits in the amount of EUR 2,031 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 2,346 k).\n\nAllowance for bad debt developed as follows:\n\n|                                          | Allowances | ECL<br>according<br>to IFRS 9 | March 31,<br>2023 | Allowances | ECL<br>according<br>to IFRS 9 | March 31,<br>2024 |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Balance as of March 31 of previous year  | -4,401     | -1,567                        | -5,968            | -11,637    | -1,781                        | -13,418           |\n| Additions                                | -7,719     | -335                          | -8,054            | -456       | -78                           | -535              |\n| Utilization                              | 54         | 121                           | 175               | 12         | 764                           | 776               |\n| Disposals                                | 275        | 0                             | 275               | 10,201     | 0                             | 10,201            |\n| Currency translation differences         | 154        | 0                             | 154               | 69         | 0                             | 69                |\n| Assets held for sale                     | 0          | 0                             | 0                 | 238        | 0                             | 238               |\n| Balance as of March 31 of financial year | -11,637    | -1,781                        | -13,418           | -1,574     | -1,096                        | -2,670            |\n\nThe decrease in allowances for trade receivables mainly relates to a long-standing customer in the EMEA region, with whom an agreement regarding overdue receivables was reached in April 2023, resulting in the reversal of allowances in the amount of EUR 10.1 million.\n\nMaturity structure of trade receivables:\n\n|                    | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|--------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Not yet due        | 52,228         | 61,323         |\n| Overdue            |                |                |\n| 1-30 days          | 9,433          | 9,387          |\n| 31-60 days         | 3,154          | 5,459          |\n| 61-90 days         | 1,870          | 2,438          |\n| 91-180 days        | 7,776          | 7,240          |\n| 181-270 days       | 2,146          | 3,930          |\n| More than 271 days | 21,511         | 8,712          |\n| Total              | 98,117         | 98,489         |\n\nTotal trade receivables are with 73.0% not due or overdue for 1-30 days (March 31, 2023: 62.8%).

These relate exclusively to the last open projects, which have contributed negatively to earnings for many years. A solution for these projects is being worked on intensively.\n\nImpairment on contract assets amounted to EUR 382 k as of March 31, 2024 (March 31, 2023: EUR 408 k) and relates to the expected impairments according to IFRS 9. In the statement of comprehensive income for 2023/24, income in the amount of EUR 26 k (2022/23: EUR 1,141 k) was recognised.\n\nAn amount of EUR 28,777 k of the contract liabilities in total amounting to EUR 31,512 k as of March 31, 2023 was recognized in revenues in the financial year 2023/24 (2022/23: EUR 18,859 k).\n\nThe future revenues from performance obligations that are unsatisfied are as follows:\n\n|                       | 2022/23   | 2023/24   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Future revenues       | 1,186,933 | 1,360,948 |\n| Total up to 1 year    | 401,716   | 368,044   |\n| Between 1 and 2 years | 196,415   | 201,584   |\n| Between 2 and 3 years | 128,719   | 152,610   |\n| Between 3 and 4 years | 86,851    | 122,543   |\n| Between 4 and 5 years | 74,639    | 90,012    |\n| More than 5 years     | 298,593   | 426,155   |\n\nIn case the margins would change by +/-10% compared to the assumptions made, the sensitivity analysis indicates that operating result would change by approximately EUR +5,520 k and EUR -4,939 k (2022/23: EUR +6,005 k and EUR -5,272 k).\n\n## 21 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n|                          | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Cash on hand             | 41             | 32             |\n| Deposits held with banks | 45,187         | 33,344         |\n| Total                    | 45,228         | 33,376         |\n\nThe carrying amounts of this item represent cash and cash equivalents at the end of the reporting period as presented in the cash flow statement.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 22 Equity.\n\n## Share capital.\n\nThe registered share capital of the company amounts to EUR 14,300,000 (March 31, 2023: EUR 13,000,000) as a result of a capital increase carried out in November 2023. The share capital was fully paid and is divided into 14,300,000 ordinary shares (March 31, 2023: 13,000,000 ordinary shares). Each share entitles the holder to one vote. There are no caps or restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or the transfer of shares. The pro rata amount of share capital per ordinary share is EUR 1.00.\n\n## Authorized capital.\n\nThe 2021 Annual General Meeting resolved to create new authorized capital of up to 10% of the share capital, excluding shareholders' subscription rights. The Executive Board is authorized until September 28, 2026, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company's share capital in one or more tranches by up to 10% and to set the issue price and the issue conditions. The shareholders' subscription rights to the new shares issued from the authorized capital was excluded. The company currently has no conditional capital that authorizes the Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares without (repeated) consideration by the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Capital increase.\n\nThe offer period for the capital increase resolved on this date ended on November 21, 2023, in which a total of 1,300,000 new no-par value bearer shares with voting rights (ordinary shares) were issued, of which 477,217 shares were issued against cash contributions and 822,783 shares against contributions in kind. The issue and subscription price was EUR 9.00 per new share and the gross proceeds amounted to EUR 11.7 million. EUR 0.2 million in transaction costs were deducted from the capital reserve of EUR 10.4 million.\n\n## Authorization of repurchase of shares.\n\nAn authorisation to repurchase shares granted by the Annual General Meeting of September 10, 2019 expired on March 10, 2022. As of March 31, 2024, Kapsch TrafficCom held, as in the previous year, no treasury shares, no shares retained for options and no conversion rights.\n\n## Capital reserve.\n\nCapital reserve includes those reserves that have not been established from results of prior periods.\n\n## Other reserves.\n\nOther reserves contain effects of changes in the interest held in subsidiaries as well as reserves from other comprehensive income, for example currency translation differences, remeasurements of liabilities from post-employment benefits after deduction of deferred taxes as well as changes of the cash flow hedge reserve after deduction of deferred taxes.\n\n## Consolidated retained earnings.\n\nRetained earnings include accumulated results of the period attributable to the equity holders of the company less dividends paid.\n\n## Dividends paid.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, as in the previous year, no dividends were paid by Kapsch TrafficCom AG. No dividends were distributed to non-controlling interests in the financial year 2023/24 either (financial year 2022/23: EUR 251 k).\n\n## Non-controlling interests.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the third party shares in the equity of fully consolidated subsidiaries. Changes in non-controlling interests due to acquisitions, formations, liquidations or disposals of subsidiaries are presented in one line \"Effects from changes in the scope of consolidation\" in the statement of changes in equity in the financial year 2023/24, as none of these transactions in the financial year 2023/24 represent a material effect on their own.

acquisitions as well as for an operating loan.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Kapsch TrafficCom AG reached an agreement on a comprehensive refinancing of short-term financial liabilities (including promissory note bonds) with its major financial creditors. Existing financing in the amount of EUR 106.3 million was extended until May 25, 2025. The restructuring measures include improvements in processes, optimizations in procurement, optimizations on the sales side, improvements in project processing, focusing on and improving net working capital as well as selective personnel measures. The aim was to materially reduce net debt by at least EUR 60 million and to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0x in the longer term.\n\nIn addition, new financing was concluded, with which half of the seven-year promissory note bond (EUR 11.5 million) were repaid. On the other hand, one of these promissory note creditors provided an additional loan in the amount of EUR 4.25 million, which also had a term until May 25, 2025. New financing, was subject to increased terms in line with market conditions; in addition, the financial creditors were entitled to a repayment premium in certain cases (also for existing financing). In order to achieve the targeted reduction in current net debt, the company has agreed to make early repayments from surplus cash and cash equivalents (cash sweep), from extraordinary inflows and from pending proceedings (particularly those in Germany) and to not distribute any dividends. The company's dividend policy therefore remains suspended. As part of the refinancing of financial liabilities, new, customary covenants (net debt/EBITDA and equity ratio) and conditions were agreed with the financial creditors for the next two years. Compliance with these covenants and the implementation status of the operational measures were closely monitored and reported on with the support of an external consultant.\n\nThe main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH supported the restructuring – in addition to loans totaling EUR 5 million already granted at the end of 2022 – by pledging all of its shares held in the company, which currently corresponds to around 63.3% of the company's share capital.\n\nThe company also undertook to use the entire existing authorized capital to the extent of 10% of the company's share capital (corresponding to 1.3 million new shares in the company) to create sufficient liquidity, whereby the main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH was entitled to contribute financial support already provided. The capital increase was carried out on November 21, 2023 (see note 22).\n\nFurthermore, a new financing line for KTC USA Inc., USA, was agreed in June 2023, which can be utilized up to USD 20 million. As at the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024, the relevant utilization was EUR 3.6 million.\n\nThe Group was able to significantly reduce its financial liabilities in the past financial year, primarily due to the inflow of funds from the German arbitration proceedings. In accordance with a defined waterfall principle, all new financing was initially repaid and older loans were subsequently serviced, whereby it was ensured that all banks involved were serviced in proportion to the outstanding loan amount. In total, repayments of EUR 87.5 million were made in two tranches (September 2023 and March 2024). As a result, Kapsch TrafficCom AG already significantly exceeded its net debt reduction target in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nIn May 2024, the term of the existing restructuring agreement, including all outstanding credit lines, was extended until March 31, 2026. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom AG commits to make repayments totaling EUR 20 million between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2025.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 24 Lease liabilities.\n\n|                               | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Non-current lease liabilities | 32,199         | 26,932         |\n| Current lease liabilities     | 11,595         | 9,158          |\n|                               | 43,794         | 36,090         |\n\nMovements of right-of-use assets from leases and classifications are included in note 12 Property, plant and equipment.

Retirement benefit obligations were valued based on an interest rate of 3.50% (2022/23: 3.95%) for the Euro zone and based on an interest rate of 4.90% (2022/23: 4.90%) for Canada as well as compensation increases based on a rate of 2.5%–3.50% (2022/23: 3.00%–5.50%). An interest rate of 3.50%–3.55% (2022/23: 3.95%–4.00% ) was used for the obligations from anniversary bonuses and 9.48% in Mexico (2022/23: 8.90%) and a value of 3.00%–5.50% (2022/23: 3.00%–5.50%) for salary increases. In addition, the calculation was based on the earliest possible statutory retirement age including transition provisions and using the mortality tables AVO 2018-P ANG (2022/23: AVO 2018-P ANG) by Pagler & Pagler for Austria and the 2014 Canadian Pension Mortality Private Tables for Canada.\n\n#### Termination benefits.\n\nThis item essentially comprises legal and contractual claims of employees in Austria or their dependents on one-time severance payments. These may arise, in particular, on the basis of an employer's notice, amicable solution to the employment relationship, retirement or death of the employee. In the case of severance payments, the Group bears the risk of inflation resulting from salary adjustments, which simultaneously lead to higher severance payments. For employees who have joined Kapsch TrafficCom in Austria after December 31, 2002, payments into an external employee benefit fund are made on a monthly basis so that the Group does not normally incur any severance payments. Similar severance obligations also exist in other countries, such as in Mexico.\n\nThe following amounts are recognized in the balance sheet and the statement of comprehensive income for termination benefits:\n\n|                                                  | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Carrying amount as of March 31 of previous year  | 9,419   | 8,143   |\n| Remeasurements (actuarial gains / losses)        | -890    | 497     |\n| Current service cost                             | 192     | 629     |\n| Interest expense                                 | 78      | 265     |\n| Payments                                         | -780    | -1,624  |\n| IC-Transfer                                      | 67      | 165     |\n| Currency translation differences                 | 58      | 43      |\n| Carrying amount as of March 31 of financial year | 8,143   | 8,119   |\n| Total, included in the staff costs (note 6)      | 192     | 629     |\n| Total, included in the financial result (note 9) | 78      | 265     |\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nRemeasurements of liabilities from post-employment benefits to employees are attributable to the following positions:\n\n|                                                            | 2022/23 | 2023/24 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Remeasurements from changes in demographic assumptions     | -3      | 26      |\n| Remeasurements from changes in financial assumptions       | -1,301  | 205     |\n| Remeasurements from other changes (experience adjustments) | 414     | 267     |\n| Total                                                      | -890    | 497     |\n\nThe expected allocation for termination benefits for the next financial year 2024/25 amounts to EUR 373 k.

and service provider, the Group issues product warranties at the time of sale to its customers. Usually, under the terms of the warranty contract, the Group has the obligation to repair or replace manufacturing or software defects that become apparent within the period under guarantee. When the Group expects warranty claims on products sold or services rendered during the period under guarantee, a corresponding provision is set up in the financial statements. Based on the expectation that the majority of the expenditure will be incurred in the short or medium term, the best estimate for the cost of warranty is used for the recognition of the provision. Likewise, historical data is taken into account in the calculation of the provision amount. According to past experience, it is probable that there will be claims under the warranties. It is expected that an amount of EUR 17 k will be used in the first half of the financial year 2024/25, EUR 1,286 k in the second half of the year and the remaining amount of EUR 323 k in the following financial years.\n\nCurrent provisions of EUR 17,326 k have been recognized for losses from onerous contracts in the financial year 2023/24. A significant amount relates to various implementation projects of an American subsidiary that cannot be completed with a profit. The additions to current provisions for onerous contracts in the financial year 2023/24 also result primarily from the USA. A utilization in the amount of EUR 1,412 k is expected in the first half of the financial year 2024/25 and EUR 15,914 k in the second half of the year.\n\nThe provisions for projects (excluding impending losses) mainly relate to current costs and repair services for current toll projects. It is expected that an amount of EUR 632 k will be used in the first half of the financial year 2024/25, EUR 909 k in the second half of the financial year and the remaining amount of EUR 25 k in the following financial years.\n\nProvisions for legal fees, costs of litigation and contract risks mainly relate to current legal cases and consulting costs. It is expected that the amount of EUR 550 k will be used in the first half and the amount of EUR 595 k will be used in the second half of the financial year 2024/25.\n\nOf the remaining provision for restructuring costs, utilization in the amount of EUR 2 k is expected in the first half of the subsequent financial year 2024/25.\n\nOther provisions mainly include provisions for taxes and duties, provisions for commissions, bonuses and claims for damages. The utilization in financial year 2023/24 relates to a provision of EUR 1,700 k for claims for damages in Austria. In the financial year 2023/24, the reclassification of other current provisions includes the reclassification to \"liabilities held for sale\". It is expected that an amount of EUR 606 k will be used in the first half of the financial year 2024/25, EUR 524 k in the second half of the year and the remaining amount of EUR 1,462 k in the following financial years.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 27 Other liabilities and deferred income.\n\n|                                                        | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Other employee liabilities                             | 22,323         | 25,499         |\n| Liabilities to tax authorities (other than income tax) | 9,358          | 9,007          |\n| Other prepayments received                             | 3,322          | 10,019         |\n| Refund Liabilities                                     | 724            | 114            |\n| Sundry liabilities and deferred income                 | 7,937          | 7,354          |\n| Total                                                  | 43,664         | 51,992         |\n\nOther employee liabilities comprise liabilities to employees and board members, including liabilities for outstanding vacation and accruals for special payments as well as liabilities in connection with personnel costs (social security, etc.).\n\nThe increase in other prepayments received is mainly due to advanced prepayments from projects in Brazil and Germany.\n\nThe sundry liabilities and deferred income essentially include provisions for invoices not yet received or passive accruals of invoices.\n\n## 28 Contingent liabilities and other commitments as well as disclosure to German infrastructure charge.\n\nThe Group's contingent liabilities primarily result from large-scale projects. Operating activities require the disclosure of bid bonds or performance bonds for major projects, which are issued by financial institutes and insurance companies. In case the contractual obligations cannot be fulfilled, there is a risk of utilization, that can result in a recourse claim of the financial institute or insurance company against the Group.\n\nThe contingent liabilities and other commitments solely comprise obligations owed to third parties and are in line with standard industry practice. They detail as follows:\n\n|                                         | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| North America (toll collection systems) | 26,595         | 26,752         |\n| Australia (toll collection systems)     | 14,568         | 14,271         |\n| Total                                   | 41,164         | 41,023         |\n\nFurther performance and bid bonds from financial institutes or insurance companies, where an outflow of resources is deemed unlikely, amount to EUR 197,322 k (2022/23: EUR 248,347 k) and are not included in the balance sheet or in the contingent liabilities.\n\nAssets of Kapsch TrafficCom AB, Sweden, in the amount of EUR 10,412 k (March 31, 2023: EUR 10,638 k) were pledged as collateral for contingent liabilities in favor of a Swedish bank.\n\n## German infrastructure charge.\n\nIn 2018 the joint venture autoTicket GmbH (autoTicket), Germany, was commissioned to levy the German infrastructure charge (\"passenger vehicle toll\"). Moreover in a separate contract the Group company MTS Maut & Telematik Services GmbH (MTS), Germany, had been awarded the contract for the \"automatic control of the passenger vehicle toll\".\n\nOn June 18, 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled contrary to expectations that the passenger vehicle toll in its planned form, where in Germany accredited vehicles receive a tax relief simultaneously, violates the principles of the European Union. The customer terminated on the following day the contracts for the implementation and operation of the passenger vehicle toll effective September 30, 2019.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe operating parties of the terminated contract for the project \"Toll collection\" are Kapsch TrafficCom, CTS EVEN-TIM and autoTicket. In December 2019, they jointly asserted claims in the amount of around EUR 560,000 k against the Federal Republic of Germany. The responsible minister is disputing this claim. This matter was therefore need to be resolved before an arbitration tribunal.\n\nIn March 2022 Kapsch TrafficCom received an interim arbitration award which affirms a claim for compensation of autoTicket against the Federal Republic of Germany on the merits. Consequently, in July 2023, an arbitration decision was reached with mutually agreed terms, compelling the Federal Republic of Germany to make a payment of EUR 243,000 k. This arbitration decision yielded a one-time EBIT impact of EUR 79.5 million and a cash inflow of EUR 109.2 million during the financial year.\n\nMTS Maut & Telematik Services GmbH (MTS) is fully consolidated and a 100% subsidiary of Kapsch TrafficCom AG. As a result of the termination of the contract for the automatic control of the toll, the parties of the contract (Kapsch TrafficCom AG and MTS) asserted claims against the Federal Republic of Germany as well.\n\n## 29 Interests in subsidiaries\n\n## Consolidated group.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 the consolidated group (including parent company Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna) consists of 59 entities (March 31, 2023: 59 entities).

This group includes Kapsch TrafficCom AG and its Austrian subsidiaries. Consequently, all income tax effects from the group taxation on these member companies are treated as transactions with a related party. In the 2020/21 financial year, the positive tax allocation from Kapsch TrafficCom to the Austrian tax group leader, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, was adjusted. Since then, deferred tax assets from losses have been recognized instead of short-term tax receivables. The utilization of these loss carryforwards is shown under deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nThe change in trade payables and other liabilities includes a reduction in long-term financial liabilities by EUR 5,083 k due to the capital increase and an increase in trade payables by EUR 4,418 k to KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\nKAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, the majority shareholder of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, participated in the capital increase in proportion to its existing 63.291% shareholding. This participation was made through contributions in kind (receivables from Kapsch TrafficCom AG). KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH acquired 822,783 new shares, equivalent to 63.291% of the new shares issued, through these contributions. The value of the 822,783 new shares raised via contributions in kind amounts to EUR 7.4 million, representing a 5.75% share of the increased share capital. These new shares were also pledged to banks by KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\n## Affiliated companies.\n\nTrade payables decreased by EUR 3,498 k to Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft and by EUR 2,489 k to Kapsch Partner Solutions.\n\nIn connection with the use of the Kapsch trademark and logo, the Group is charged license fees by Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft, Vienna. These fees amount to 0.5% of the Group's total net sales to third parties. The expenses incurred for this in the 2023/24 financial year amounted to EUR 2,696 k (2022/23: EUR 2,501 k).\n\nServices in the field of Human Resources (payroll accounting, administration, recruiting, labor law consulting, personnel development, and personnel secondments) and the provision of apprentices and trainees are centrally provided for the Group by Kapsch Partner Solutions GmbH, Vienna. As of March 1, 2024, the Human Resources department was transferred from Kapsch Partner Solutions GmbH, Vienna, to Kapsch TrafficCom AG. In the 2023/24 financial year, expenses for this services amounted to EUR 1,484 k (2022/23: EUR 1,269 k) for the Group.\n\nFurthermore, in the 2023/24 financial year, transactions with the affiliated company Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft for license fees amounted to EUR 2,691 k. In addition, Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft charged Kapsch TrafficCom AG for the use of the consolidation software and the reallocation of a membership fee. Other expenses of the Group from transactions with affiliated companies related to insurance contracts amounting to EUR 52 k (2022/23: EUR 368 k),\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nwhich cover several Group companies. The remaining expenses to affiliated companies concerned other goods and services provided to the Group.\n\nThe expenses from transactions with affiliated companies in the 2023/24 financial year included the costs for the provision of the central consolidation system by Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft amounting to EUR 137 k (2022/23: EUR 128 k).\n\nAdditionally, affiliated companies supplied hardware (IT equipment) and provided maintenance and services for various customer projects on behalf of the Group amounting to EUR 57 k (2022/23: EUR 200 k).\n\nThe rental income of the Group from subleasing to affiliated companies amounted to EUR 0 k in the 2023/24 financial year (2022/23: EUR 6 k). The remaining revenues with affiliated companies related to other goods and services provided.\n\n## Associated companies and joint ventures.\n\nThe change in trade receivables and other long- and short-term assets from joint ventures relates to the repayment of loans by autoTicket GmbH, which were included in the consolidated financial statements in the previous year with a balance of EUR 12,274 k.\n\nThe liabilities from trade payables and other liabilities to joint ventures, as well as the expenses to joint ventures included in the previous year, are attributable to the consortium MyConsorzio, which is reported as an other investment starting from the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nIn March 2024, the shares in the associate company Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, were sold. The expenses from associated companies include the reversal of an impairment for a loan, which was impaired in the previous year and repaid in the 2023/24 financial year, amounting to EUR 2,350 k, as well as the disposal of the investment amounting to EUR -2,230 k (2022/23: EUR -2,350 k).\n\nIncome from joint ventures amounted to EUR 53 k in the 2023/24 financial year (2022/23: EUR 170 k) and mainly includes interest charges to autoTicket GmbH, Germany.\n\n## Other related parties.\n\nThe pension obligations to other related parties are included in trade payables and other liabilities including pension benefits and contain a pension obligation (pensions in payment) to the widow of Karl Kapsch, a former board member of Kapsch Aktiengesellschaft.\n\nDetails of compensation and other payments to executive bodies are presented in note 37.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 32 Risk management.\n\nIn regard to the risks of the Group as well as risk management, we refer to item 2.2 in the management report for the Group. The impact of financial risks as described in the management report for the Group, in particular foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, is disclosed in the following:\n\n## 32.1 Foreign exchange risk.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk. This risk originates from business transactions that are executed in a currency which is not in conformity with the functional currency of the respective subsidiary (hereinafter referred to as \"foreign currency\"). The foreign exchange risk exists in relation to assets and liabilities as well as net investments of foreign business locations not in the Euro zone. During the consolidation process these positions have to be translated to the Group currency Euro.\n\nFrom Group perspective, the most relevant foreign currency was the US Dollar in the financial year 2023/24. Because the terms of agreement are stipulated in Euro, no foreign exchange risk arises in the Group with regard to the Belorussian ruble.\n\nCustomer orders are mainly invoiced in the local currencies of the respective Group companies. Only in cases in which the Group expects to be exposed to significant foreign exchange risk, major orders denominated in foreign currencies are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\nArgentina has been classified as a hyperinflationary country since July 1, 2018. The remeasurement in accordance with IAS 29 has been made. The financial statements including comparative figures have been adjusted due to the change in public purchasing power of the Argentine Peso. In the financial year 2023/24 the expenses from hyperinflation adjustment amounted to EUR 7,007 k (2022/23, adjusted: EUR 5,109 k).\n\nThe following table simulates the effect of changes in the exchange rate on the result before taxes. To do so a change in exchange rate of ceteris paribus +/-10% relating to current and non-current receivables and payables as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively has been assumed. The line \"EUR\" in the table below shows the total impact ceteris paribus of the change to the Euro on the result before taxes for all subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the Euro. The impact on equity would be insignificantly different.\n\n|          | Effect on result before taxes |                 |                 |                 |\n|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|          | 2022/23                       |                 | 2023/24         |                 |\n| Currency | Volatility +10%               | Volatility -10% | Volatility +10% | Volatility -10% |\n| USD      | -8,406                        | 10,322          | -7,322          | 8,950           |\n| ZAR      | 166                           | -203            | 1,129           | -1,380          |\n| SEK      | 560                           | -684            | 331             | -404            |\n| GBP      | 54                            | -66             | -17             | 21              |\n| BGN      | -1,128                        | 1,379           | 1,113           | -1,361          |\n| EUR      | 3,338                         | -5,210          | 4,339           | -5,303          |\n\n## 32.2 Interest rate risk.\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk arising from fluctuations in the value of financial instruments, other balance sheet items (e.g. receivables and payables) and/or cash flows due to fluctuations in the market interest rates. For fixed interest balance sheet items, the risk comprises the present value risk. In case the market interest rate for the financial instrument fluctuates, either a profit or a loss may result if the financial instrument is sold prior to maturity.\n\nIn the case of variable interest balance sheet items, the risk relates to the cash flow. With variable interest financial instruments, adjustments in the interest rates may result from changes in the market interest rates. Such changes would entail changes in interest payments. The portion of variable interest-bearing financial liabilities (financial liabilities and lease liabilities) amounts to 64%. If the market interest rate had been 50 basis points higher (lower) (+/- 0.5%) as of March 31, 2024, this, as in the previous year, would not have had any material impact on the result of the Group. In the Group, derivative instruments exist to minimize interest rate risk of financial liabilities.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 32.3 Liquidity risk.\n\nThe ongoing monitoring, control and measurement of financial and liquidity positions is carried out at the level of the operational entities, is monitored and optimized in the overall group.\n\nThe Group provides sufficient liquidity by maintaining suitable financial reserves, by issuing bonds, through customer prepayments and the continuous reconciliation of the terms of receivables, liabilities and financial assets. To this end, cash flow forecasts are prepared at regular intervals for short-term periods (the next twelve weeks), on a quarterly basis for the medium term (current financial year) as well as for long-term periods (in accordance with long-term payment obligations, particularly those arising from loans). Suitable measures for ensuring sufficient liquidity are then deducted from these forecasts.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom avoids becoming dependent on individual banks by making sure that the financial structure is always distributed over several partner financial institutions. Major repayment obligations of typically long-term contracts (such as corporate bonds or maturing repayments of long-term loans) are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate measures are initiated at an early stage (either cash flow monitoring or timely refinancing) to ensure agreed payment obligations.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom employs a risk-averse investment strategy. Liquid funds are held such that they are generally available in the short term and can therefore be used quickly whenever needed. When it comes to securities, conservative security funds, which are actively managed on an ongoing basis and include an appropriate share of bonds, are used as a rule for the coverage and hedging of pension obligations. In the event of international financial market turbulence, however, the financial investments made might still develop unfavorably or individual securities might even become untradeable. This might result in reductions in value and impairments, which in turn have a negative impact on the financial result and equity of Kapsch TrafficCom. Such a crisis also increases the default risk of individual issuers of securities or their customers. In addition, the Group might for strategic reasons acquire a direct interest in individual entities by purchasing shares. A sufficiently bad performance of these entities might also necessitate an impairment, which in turn leads to the mentioned negative impact on the financial result and equity.\n\nCash flows (gross cash flows including interest) show the liquidity risk of future periods and are split into:\n\n- First half year of the next financial year\n- Second half year of the next financial year\n- Between 1 and 2 years\n- Between 2 and 3 years\n- Between 3 and 4 years\n- Between 4 and 5 years\n- More than 5 years\n\nThis information is included in note 23 and 24.\n\n## 32.4 Credit risk.\n\nAs part of the Group's risk management policy, the Group only engages in business relationships with third parties deemed to be creditworthy and has implemented policies to ensure that the Group sells only to customers with appropriate credit histories. In addition, the Group monitors its receivables balances on an ongoing basis in order to limit its exposure to bad debts. Kapsch TrafficCom endeavors to reduce the risk of customer default as best as possible by obligatory credit checks before contract signing or, in the case of large projects, by additionally collateralizing payments. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely ruled out that there will be individual payment defaults that would have a material negative impact on the earnings and liquidity development of Kapsch TrafficCom in the case of an event of default.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the case of large toll collection projects, there is a credit risk essentially in the phase of the construction of the toll system. There is no concentration of credit risk relating to trade receivables since the Group generally has a large number of customers worldwide. Based on the Group's experiences, the default risk for trade receivables can be considered low. The maximum credit risk corresponds to the following book values:\n\n|                                                    | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Other non-current financial assets and investments | 16,217         | 4,135          |\n| Non-current contract assets                        | 3,867          | 2,603          |\n| Non-current lease receivables                      | 741            | 225            |\n| Other non-current assets                           | 3,571          | 5,755          |\n| Other current financial assets                     | 1,909          | 1,375          |\n| Current contract assets                            | 82,213         | 77,954         |\n| Trade receivables and other current assets         | 117,438        | 131,000        |\n| Current lease receivables                          | 567            | 474            |\n| Current income tax receivables                     | 4,873          | 5,005          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 45,228         | 33,376         |\n| Total                                              | 276,623        | 261,902        |\n\n## 33 Capital management.\n\nCapital management pursues value-oriented and sustainable corporate management on the basis of the income statement in individual operating segments. Key performance indicators for the balance sheet and other economic criteria as well as the long-term development of the Group are also monitored and included in the management. Capital management is considered to be a central element for ensuring the medium- and long-term going concern. An important indicator for the capital structure is the equity ratio calculated from the equity (including non-controlling interests) as a percentage of the balance sheet total. The capital management strategy at Kapsch TrafficCom also aims, among other things, at ensuring that Group companies have sufficient equity to meet local requirements. On the Group level, the aim is that the equity ratio in the financial year should remain within a range of roughly 25% to 35% on average. A major key performance indicator that is also often used in the covenants of the Group's loan agreements is the \"Gearing in relation to EBITDA\". Here, the Group is aiming for a range between 2.0 and 3.5. It indicates whether there is a balanced relationship between the company's net debt and operating earnings power. The Group is constantly checking the observance of all the covenants in connection with loan agreements.\n\nIn the past financial year 2023/24, the Group significantly improved both key figures. The equity ratio increased from 10.7% to 18.8% and net debt in relation to EBITDA was reduced from 6.88 (adjusted) to 1.20. This was due to several factors. This was due to several factors: on the one hand, the Group achieved an outstandingly successful consolidated result in the past financial year; on the other hand, the Group was able to increase its equity through the successful placement of new shares and used the cash inflow from Germany mostly to reduce its financial debt. As a result, the Group significantly exceeded the key figures agreed with the banks at all points.\n\nThe Group's own target and value for the equity ratio has therefore not yet been achieved. Nevertheless, this target remains upright and the Group is aiming to get closer to it over the next few years through active capital management and to achieve it again as quickly as possible. The measures introduced to reduce costs and increase efficiency should also contribute to this.\n\nAnother important goal is the securing of sufficient liquidity necessary in the short and long term to ensure a successful going concern. As in previous years, also in the financial year 2023/24 the Group attached the greatest importance to active liquidity management (both by monitoring the Group-wide amount of liquidity daily and substantially increasing the reliability of the weekly 12-week cash flow forecasts). Also the payment management was professionalized in the financial year and, for example, the essential and long-standing suppliers and business partners have made corresponding payment agreements.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of May 31, 2023, a strategically important restructuring of the Group's financing was successfully finalised with the main banks of Kapsch TrafficCom AG (see note 23). Part of this agreement is the implementation of measures to improve net working capital and liquidity. In May 2024 an extension of this agreement until March 31, 2026 was agreed (see note 36).\n\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 33.4 million as of the balance sheet date. The related decrease compared to the previous year (March 31, 2023: EUR 45.2 million) is due to the scheduled repayment in financial liabilities of EUR 85 million and also lease liabilities of EUR 7.7 million. In total, additional loans amounting EUR 5.3 million were taken out. Furthermore, the change in net working capital in the amount EUR -5.1 million – in particular, trade accounts payable were reduced by EUR 12.1 million – contributed to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNet debt was reduced by EUR 80.3 million in the past financial year.\n\nBesides the mentioned short and medium term targets for liquidity, repayment, and refinancing, the financing of the future course of growth and maintaining and optimal capital structure are also major goals in the Group's capital management over the medium and long term.\n\nNet debt and gearing in relation to EBITDA as well as gearing and the equity ratio as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                                   | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Non-current financial liabilities | 58,472         | 91,906         |\n| Current financial liabilities     | 131,170        | 12,751         |\n| Non-current lease liabilities     | 32,199         | 26,932         |\n| Current lease liabilities         | 11,595         | 9,158          |\n| Total financial liabilities       | 233,435        | 140,747        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents         | -45,228        | -33,376        |\n| Other current financial assets    | -1,909         | -1,375         |\n| Net debt                          | 186,299        | 105,996        |\n| Equity                            | 51,306         | 83,423         |\n| Gearing                           | 363.1%         | 127.1%         |\n| EBITDA1)                          | 27,066         | 88,534         |\n| Gearing in relation to EBITDA1)   | 6.88           | 1.20           |\n| Equity ratio                      | 10.7%          | 18.8%          |\n\n1) Adjustment previous year: presentation of gains from derivative financial instruments in financial income, which were presented under other operating income in the previous year; further information is provided in note 9.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/2024, the Group withdrew from its financial investment in Traffic Technology Services, Inc., USA, and is also taking further steps to withdraw from non-strategic business areas or investments in order to minimise the related risk.\n\n## 34 Accounting and valuation principles.\n\nThe accounting and valuation principles, which form the basis for these consolidated financial statements, were applied unchanged to the previous period and supplemented by new mandatory IFRS and IFRIC applicable from the financial year.\n\n## 34.1 Consolidation.\n\n## 34.1.1 Subsidiaries.\n\nSubsidiaries are all companies (including structured companies) where the Group exerts its control. The control in this sense means that the Group is exposed to fluctuating returns arising from its interest in the subsidiary, is in possession of entitlements to these returns and has the ability to influence such returns by virtue of its position of \n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\npower with respect to the associated company. Subsidiaries are included within the consolidated financial statements (full consolidation) as from the time when the parent company has acquired control over the subsidiary. They are deconsolidated at the time when such control is relinquished.\n\nAll Group internal assets and liabilities, equity, expenses and income as well as unrealized gains and losses from transactions between Group companies are completely eliminated in the course of Group consolidation. In case of consolidation processes affecting profit or loss, income tax effects are taken into consideration and deferred taxes are recognized.\n\n## 34.1.2 Transactions with non-controlling interests.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with equity owners of the Group. Depending on the ownership structure, the Group splits the gains or losses as well as all components of the comprehensive income to the interests of the parent company and the non-controlling interests. Even in the event of a negative balance of the non-controlling interests, the total comprehensive income is attributed to the parent company and the non-controlling interests. For purchases of non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant interest acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity, unless a change in the percentage of shares held leads to a loss of control of the interest.\n\nIf the Group loses its control over any of the companies, the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary are to be removed from the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining interest is to be remeasured at fair value and regarded as the initially recognized value of a financial asset pursuant to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement or as acquisition costs in case of the addition of an interest in an associated company or joint venture. Any resulting gains or losses which are attributable to the controlling interest are recognized in the income statement. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income with respect to the former subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This means that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to the result for the period.\n\n## 34.1.3 Joint arrangements.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements.\n\nThe Group differentiates according to the contractual arrangements at which decisions are made unanimously, concerning rights and obligations of the controlling parties between joint ventures and joint operations. Parties belonging to a joint venture enjoy rights to net assets. In the consolidated financial statements, the result, assets and liabilities are included subject to the equity method.\n\nIn the case of the equity method, the interests in joint ventures are initially recognized at acquisition costs. After this, the carrying value of the interests goes up or down according to the share of the Group in profit or loss as well as in any changes in the other comprehensive income of the joint venture. If the share in the (cumulative) losses of a joint venture exceeds the carrying value of the joint venture (including all long-term interests which are to be allocated to the commercial substance after the net investment of the Group in the joint venture), then the Group is not to recognize the excessive loss share unless it has entered into legal or constructive obligations for the joint venture or has made liabilities or provisions for the joint venture. In the case of accumulated losses, a positive carrying amount is only recognised after the accumulated losses have been offset.\n\nUnrealized gains or losses from transactions between Group companies and joint ventures are to be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements in the amount of the share of the Group in the joint venture. Unrealized losses are not eliminated if the transaction gives any indication that there may be an impairment of the asset transferred.\n\nThe accounting and valuation principles of joint ventures correspond to those of the parent company.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nProportional results from joint ventures are split in the presentation in the income statement. Results from joint ventures whose activities and strategic alignments are part of Kapsch TrafficCom's core business are reported in the operating result. Results from other joint ventures are reported in the result before income taxes after the financial result.\n\nIf there are rights to assets and obligations for liabilities as a result of a contractual agreement it is a joint operation. Recognition in the consolidated financial statements is proportional.\n\n## 34.1.4 Associated companies.\n\nAssociated companies are entities in which the Group has a significant but not a controlling influence, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Associated companies are reported using the equity method and initially recognized at acquisition costs. Following the acquisition date, the share of the Group in the result of the associate is recorded in the statement of comprehensive income and the share of changes in other comprehensive income is recognized in other comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment being made to the carrying amount of the interest. Dividends received from the associated company reduce the carrying amount of the interest. Goodwill arising on acquisition of associated companies is not separately shown but recorded as part of the carrying amount of associated companies.\n\nIf the percentage of shares held in an associated company is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the profit or loss for the period where appropriate.\n\nThe cumulative shares of the Group in the profits and losses as well as in the other comprehensive income of the associated company after the acquisition are offset against the carrying amount of the investment. If the Group's share in the losses of an associate, including any unsecured receivables, equals or exceeds its interest in that associated company, the Group will not disclose any additional losses. A liability or provision is only recognized if the Group has entered into legal or constructive obligations for the associated company or has made payments for the associated company.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group checks whether there are any indications showing that the investment in an associate is impaired. If this is the case, the impairment requirement is determined as the difference arising from the carrying amount of the interest of the associate and the corresponding recoverable amount and recognized separately in the income statement. Significant unrealized gains from transactions between the Group and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\n\nProportionate results from associated companies are split in the presentation in the income statement. Results from associated companies whose activities and strategic directions are part of the core business of Kapsch TrafficCom are reported in the operating result. Results from other associated companies are reported in the result before income taxes after the financial result.\n\nThe accounting and valuation principles of associated companies correspond substantially to those of the parent company.\n\n## 34.1.5 Business combinations.\n\nBusiness combinations are recognised by the Group using the acquisition method as of the acquisition date. The acquisition date relates to the date of transfer of control to the Group.\n\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition is the fair value of the assets transferred, the equity interests issued by the Group and the liabilities incurred or assumed as at the transaction date. In addition, they include the fair value of any recognized assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in full as incurred.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, any assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed in a business combination are measured at their full fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the entity or result from statutory, contractual or other legal rights. No new restructuring provisions may be recognized\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nwithin the scope of the purchase price allocation. Any remaining positive differences, which compensate the seller with market opportunities that cannot be identified more closely and with development potential, are capitalized as goodwill in the respective cash generating units (CGUs).\n\nAny contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is measured in accordance with IFRS 9 and a resulting profit or loss recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.\n\nAny hidden reserves and liabilities uncovered are carried forward in line with the corresponding assets and liabilities. The determination of the fair values requires certain estimates and assumptions, in particular of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, of the liabilities assumed as well as of the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's net assets.\n\nThe Group determines the goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n\n- the fair value of the consideration transferred plus\n- the value recognized of all recognized non-controlling interests in the acquiree plus\n- the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree if the combination is achieved in stages – less\n- the net amount (in general of the fair values) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities.\n\nIf the excess is negative, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognized only upon re-examination of the allocation directly in the result for the period.\n\n## 34.1.6 Non-current assets held for sale.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, Kapsch TrafficCom indirectly holds 82.9% of the shares in TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited (TMT), South Africa, through its subsidiary KTC-ZA Holding Proprietary Limited, South Africa. TMT is a provider of road safety law enforcement solutions and automatic fare collection for public transportation. By the year-end, a negotiated purchase price agreement for the sale of TMT was already in place, so the criteria of IFRS 5 are considered met. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of TMT have been classified as 'held for sale.' The closing occurred in April 2024.\n\nAn overview of the assets and liabilities held for sale can be found in the following table:\n\n|                                                    | March 31, 2024 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                      | 1,594          |\n| Intangible assets                                  | 3              |\n| Other non-current financial assets and investments | 292            |\n| Deferred tax assets                                | 939            |\n| Trade receivables and other current assets         | 4,814          |\n| Current contract assets                            | 348            |\n| Current tax receivables                            | 74             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 2,929          |\n|                                                    |                |\n| Non-current lease liabilities                      | 140            |\n| Current financial liabilities                      | 1,931          |\n| Current lease liabilities                          | 149            |\n| Trade payables                                     | 979            |\n| Current contract liabilities                       | 2              |\n| Current provisions                                 | 276            |\n| Other liabilities and deferred income              | 529            |\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe criteria were met shortly before the balance sheet date, meaning that ongoing depreciation and amortisation has not been terminated, as no material effect is expected. Only property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets fall under the measurement assessment of IFRS 5, and therefore, no impairment is expected due to immateriality.\n\n## 34.1.7 Foreign currency translation.\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is Kapsch TrafficCom's presentation currency.\n\n## Translation of foreign financial statements.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, financial statements of foreign subsidiaries (except for foreign entities from hyperinflationary countries) that have a functional currency different from the Euro which are included in the consolidated financial statements are translated as follows:\n\nThe statement of comprehensive income of foreign entities is translated into the Group's presentation currency at average exchange rates of the financial year, balance sheets at the prevailing closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. The reference rates of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Deutsche Bundesbank, which are accessible via the Austrian Central Bank's (Österreichische Nationalbank) website, serve as the basis for the translation. If no current exchange rates are available, this will result in the use of the exchange rates as disclosed by the national banks that are derived from market information providers (Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters). Differences arising from the currency translation of foreign operations into Euro are recognized in other comprehensive income and collected in equity. If control of the foreign entity is lost, exchange rate differences accumulated in equity are reclassified and presented as part of the gain/loss from the disposal.\n\nPursuant to IAS 29, a separate measurement is required for hyperinflationary countries. As in accordance with IAS 21, monetary items are translated into the reporting currency of the Group using the prevailing closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured either at adjusted cost, or at net realizable value or at fair value. Argentina has been classified as a hyperinflationary country since July 1, 2018. All items in the statement of comprehensive income are to be restated as of the date of initial recognition of the income and expenses in the financial statements, using the general price index. A restatement in accordance with IAS 29 applies. Effects from hyperinflation are included in the financial result and in equity.\n\nAs the business activities of Kapsch TrafficCom in Russia are not material, there is no significant risk from the fluctuations of the Russian ruble.\n\nGoodwill and adjustments to the fair value in connection with the acquisition of a foreign company are treated as the assets and liabilities of the foreign company in question and converted in the course of initial consolidation at the transaction rate and subsequently converted with the key date exchange rate as at the financial statements key date of the business operation.\n\n|     | 2022/23               |                                        | 2023/24               |                                        |\n|-----|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     | Average exchange rate | Exchange rate as at balance sheet date | Average exchange rate | Exchange rate as at balance sheet date |\n| AUD | 1.52                  | 1.63                                   | 1.65                  | 1.66                                   |\n| CAD | 1.38                  | 1.47                                   | 1.46                  | 1.47                                   |\n| GBP | 0.86                  | 0.88                                   | 0.86                  | 0.86                                   |\n| SEK | 10.81                 | 11.28                                  | 11.49                 | 11.53                                  |\n| USD | 1.05                  | 1.09                                   | 1.08                  | 1.08                                   |\n| ZAR | 17.67                 | 19.33                                  | 20.29                 | 20.52                                  |\n\nThe main exchange rates used during the financial year are shown below:\n\n## Foreign currency transactions.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate as of the transaction date or, in case of new measurements, as at the time of the measurement. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary items \n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nin the balance sheet, which are capitalized at costs in a foreign currency are translated with the exchange rate applicable at the day of the transaction; non-monetary items which were recognized at the fair value in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of measurement.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses which are attributable to the translation of cash and cash equivalents as well as financial receivables and financial liabilities are presented in the statement of comprehensive income within the financial result. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income in other operating income or other operating expenses.\n\nThis excludes foreign exchange gains and losses from monetary items to be received from/to be paid to foreign operations which are designated as part of a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Such foreign exchange gains and losses are initially recognized in other comprehensive income and are then reclassified from equity to profit or loss if the net investment is sold (see note 11).\n\n## 34.2 Fair value measurement.\n\nThe fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n\nTo the greatest extent possible, the Group uses observable market data for the fair value measurement of assets or liabilities. Depending on the availability of observable input factors and their impact on the fair value measurement as a whole, the fair value is assigned to one of 3 levels in the following fair value-hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date.\n- Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n- Level 3: Inputs at this level are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\n\n## 34.3 Revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". Assessment of each contract is based on the five-step model:\n\n- Identify the contract with a customer\n- Identify the performance obligations\n- Determine the transaction price\n- Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations\n- Recognize revenue either over time or at a point in time\n\nA customer is defined as a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities in exchange for a consideration. It is assessed if the contracts meet the criteria in accordance with IFRS 15.9, in particular the enforceable right to consideration. It is furthermore assessed if the consideration the identity is entitled to is enforceable and revenue is probable (see note 32.4. Credit risk).\n\nThe Group identified the following performance obligations:\n\nImplementation projects include the construction of toll collection systems for both individual road sections and nationwide road networks as well as the construction of systems for traffic monitoring, traffic control and traffic safety. Components such as on-board units which are necessary for putting the system into a condition ready for operation, are considered part of the implementation projects. Major software upgrades that are agreed in operation projects as well as implementation within the context of service concession arrangement also fall under this performance obligation.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nImplementation projects meet the criteria for \"satisfaction of the performance obligation over time\", as the Group creates assets that do not have an alternative use and the Group thus has an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date. The stage of completion is derived from the ratio of the costs already incurred and the estimated total costs of the corresponding order.\n\nOperation projects mainly include the operation and maintenance of toll collection systems for both individual road sections and nation-wide road networks as well as the operation and maintenance of systems for traffic monitoring, traffic control and traffic safety. Operation within the context of service concession contracts also falls under this performance obligation.\n\nRevenue from operation projects is recognized over time since the customer receives the benefits as the entity performs.\n\nThe sale of components that are not made under an implementation or operation project also constitutes a separate performance obligation. As for the sale of components, revenue is recognized as the control of the component is transferred.\n\nThere are no warranty obligations beyond those required by law.\n\nThe transaction price is mostly fixed but some contracts may also contain elements of variable consideration which are usually bonuses or penalties. They are taken into account if and to the extent that the payment is probable or if penalties are improbable. The transaction price typically refers to the price of the individual performance obligation as the price is set on basis of the costs including a reasonable margin. Cross-subsidizations are not part of the business model of Kapsch TrafficCom. It is therefore for most contracts not necessary to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations. For service concession arrangements, the transaction price is estimated for each performance obligation. In such cases, allocation is made based on the expected-cost-plus-margin approach. For contracts with a significant financing component, the consideration is adjusted by the interest component.\n\nContract assets are capitalized if the services are rendered before the consideration is received. Contract liabilities are recognized if the amount of consideration exceeds the amount of performance rendered. Service concession arrangements including the concession right to receive fees result in an intangible asset. That intangible asset increases with construction progress, thus revenue is recognized according to the stage of completion.\n\nCertain costs arising in the course of initiating or performing a contract have to be recognized under IFRS 15 if the criteria are met. Those costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term of the project.\n\nOther income is recognized by the Group as follows:\n\n- Revenue from recharged expenses is recognized on the basis of the accumulated amounts in accordance with the respective agreements,\n- Interest income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method,\n- Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## 34.4 Segment information.\n\nThe reporting on operating segments is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision- maker (management approach). The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources to the operating segments and assessing their performance. The Executive Board of Kapsch TrafficCom has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.5 Property, plant and equipment.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recognized at acquisition and production cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets in accordance with the group policies.\n\nProperties are not subject to scheduled depreciation. The useful lives generally range between 5 to 26 years for plants and buildings on leasehold land, 4 to 20 years for technical equipment and machinery, and 3 to 10 years for other equipment, factory, and office equipment. The assets' useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, in case of evidence leading to an adjustment. An asset's carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The impairment test is carried out in accordance with IAS 36 and is described in chapter 34.7.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of those assets which were replaced is derecognized. Expenses for repairs and maintenance which do not necessitate a significant replacement investment (i.e. day-today servicing) are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nThe difference between the proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment and the carrying amount is recognized as profit or loss in the result from operating activities.\n\n## 34.6 Intangible assets.\n\n## 34.6.1 Goodwill.\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries. It represents the excess of the consideration transferred for the acquisition beyond the Group's interest in net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities.\n\nGoodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Group carries out the annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter. In addition, the Group carries out impairment tests during the year if a triggering event occurs that may cause the asset to be impaired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs) or groups of cash generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and have reported the goodwill. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe impairment loss of goodwill is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. No write-ups on goodwill are made.\n\n## 34.6.2 Concessions and rights.\n\nComputer software, trademarks, and similar rights are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred for acquisition and amortized linearly over their estimated useful lives of 4 to 15 years. Acquired customer agreements (toll contracts, maintenance agreements) are recognized at acquisition costs and amortized over estimated useful lives that generally range between 2 and 10 years.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.6.3 Research and development costs.\n\nResearch expenditures are recognized as an expense. Costs incurred for development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognized as intangible assets if the following criteria are fulfilled:\n\n- It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;\n- management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;\n- there is an opportunity to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- adequate technical, financial, and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and\n- the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.\n\nOther development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognized as an expense. The costs for producing the intangible asset are capitalized as from the point in time when the above criteria are initially met. Development costs previously recognized as an expense cannot be subsequently capitalized. Capitalized development costs are amortized, as soon as they are available for use, using the straight-line method on the basis of the normal useful life, which generally ranges between 3 and 15 years.\n\nCapitalized development assets are tested for impairment annually in accordance with IAS 36 as long as they are not yet available for use.\n\n## 34.7 Impairment of non-financial assets.\n\nAssets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use – are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's net selling price and its value in use. At entity level an impairment is posted if there is any indication that an asset may be impaired and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognised. Hereon at the level for cash generating units the goodwill is tested. First, the goodwill is amortized by the amount of the impairment. If the impairment is higher than the carrying amount of the goodwill, the carrying amounts of the other assets of these cash-generating units (CGUs) are proportionately reduced.\n\nThe value in use of a cash generating unit corresponds to the present value, calculated using the discounted cash flow method, of the future cash flows which the entity will receive from the cash generating unit. In order to determine the value in use, the expected future cash flows plus taxes based on the post-tax discount rate that reflects the current market expectations with regard to the interest effect and the specific risks of the cash generating units, are discounted to their present values. In the process, the current planning, covering a period of four years (detailed forecast period) and approved by Management, is used as the basis with subsequent transition to perpetuity. The growth rates according to the detailed forecast period are based on historical growth rates and on external studies on the future medium-term market development.\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell is determined using an appropriate valuation model which is based on the medium-term planning.\n\nThe difference between the recoverable amount of assets and their carrying value is reported as profit (in the case of a reversal of an impairment loss) or loss in the operating result. Profits are not reported as revenues. For assets (other than goodwill) for which an impairment loss has been recognized in the past, a check is carried out on each subsequent balance sheet date to determine if any reversal of impairment is required.\n\nThe residual carrying values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted as necessary.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.8 Borrowing costs.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are capitalized to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. A qualifying asset is an asset that requires a substantial period of time (with regard to the Group at least twelve months) to be made ready for its intended use or sale.\n\nInvestment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization within a specific period.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, the criteria for a qualified asset were not fulfilled for any assets.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## 34.9 Government grants.\n\nGovernment grants with regard to purchased non-current assets are deferred and taken through profit or loss over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. Government grants are recognized at their fair value, provided it is virtually certain that the Group will comply with all attached conditions and the grant will be received.\n\nDue to materiality considerations, government grants are not disclosed separately in the financial statements but are included in other current liabilities and deferred income.\n\nOther grants received as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred are immediately taken through profit or loss and included in other operating income.\n\nAlso grants referring to the COVID-19-pandemic and for reliefs of the effects of the pandemic fall under this point and thus are included in other operating income in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## 34.10 Leasing.\n\nIFRS 16 \"Leases\" specifies the recognition, measurement, presentation as well as disclosure requirements with regard to leases in financial statements. As for Kapsch TrafficCom, this mainly relates to buildings, motor vehicles and IT equipment. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset on the underlying asset and a liability that represents its liability to lease payments. Extension and termination options are recognized if virtually certain.\n\nThe lessor continues to distinguish between finance or operating leases for accounting purposes. Kapsch Traffic-Com has sub-leasing contracts with affiliated companies as well as the parent company and therefore discloses lease receivables instead of right-of-use assets from leases. which are classified as finance leases. The Group only acts as lessor to an insignificant extent, and thus does not expect any material impact on the Group's financial statements from such leases.\n\nThe Group applies exemptions regarding short-term leases with a term of not more than twelve months and leases of low-value assets (around EUR 5 k). Those leases will not be recognized in the balance sheet, instead, payments made for such leases will continue to be recognized as expenses.\n\nFor the calculation of the present value of liabilities from leasing contracts the incremental borrowing rate according to the corresponding maturity is calculated and applied. The incremental borrowing rate is derived from a risk free rate of the corresponding maturity, adjusted for country, currency and enterprise risks.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.11 Financial instruments.\n\nFinancial instruments include financial assets (such as securities, investments, loans, trade receivables, and cash and cash equivalents) as well as financial liabilities (such as bonds and loans, trade payables, and derivative financial instruments).\n\nFinancial instruments are first recognized at fair value.\n\n## 34.11.1 Financial assets.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets are subdivided as follows:\n\n- amortized cost,\n- fair value through profit or loss or\n- fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe classification is based on whether the instrument is classified as equity or debt.\n\nGenerally, equity investments are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss. In the case of equity instruments that are not held for trading, in accordance with IFRS 9, an entity can make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to classify equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (without recycling). The assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income without recycling. The gains and losses resulting from these assets are recognised in other comprehensive income without recycling.\n\nFair values are determined by transactions in an active market or, where there is no active market, by applying valuation techniques.\n\nAll purchases or sales are recognised on the settlement date and the cost of acquisition includes transaction costs. In the case of investments in debt instruments, the classification is based on the company's business model or managing financial assets and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost if they meet the following two conditions and are not designated as at fair value through profit or loss:\n\n- they are held in a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows and\n- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. If not material, they are not discounted. Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and parts of other financial receivables and assets fall into this category.\n\nFinancial assets that are neither held in the business model to collect the contractual cash flows nor held in the business model to collect and sell the contractual cash flows are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Assets may be designated or also fall into this category if the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding. The assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. The fair values are determined through transactions on an active market or, if there is no active market, by using valuation techniques. Debt instruments that do not include solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding, and derivative financial instruments fall into this category. Such derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency risks continue to be accounted for as hedging instruments in accordance with IAS 39.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are such debt instruments that are held in the business model hold to collect the contractual cash flows and sell, and that are solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding. Those financial assets that fulfill the requirement of the FVOCI-business model and that are not optional designated at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income. The fair values are determined through transactions on an active market or, if there is no active market, by using valuation techniques. When financial assets are disposed, the difference between the proceeds from the disposal and the carrying amount is recognized as expense or income in the statement of comprehensive income. The amount stated in equity is additionally recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial instruments whose maturity does not exceed twelve months after the balance sheet date are stated as current assets, all others are stated as non-current assets.\n\n## 34.11.2 Cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits held at call and other bank balances, which are convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Changes in cash and cash equivalents are presented in the cash flow statement. Overdrafts are reported in the balance sheet under current financial liabilities.\n\n## 34.11.3 Financial liabilities.\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost or at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nFinancial liabilities are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. They are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs incurred and subsequently at amortized cost, taking into account the effective interest method. Financial liabilities with a remaining term of up to one year are reported as current liabilities; if the remaining term is longer, they are reported under non-current liabilities. Liabilities from current accounts are disclosed under current financial liabilities on the balance sheet. Borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income on an accrual basis. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured at the current rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nFinancial liabilities include non-current and current financial liabilities, lease liabilities, trade payables, as well as portions of other liabilities.\n\nThere are no liabilities that were designated at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 34.11.4 Derivative financial instruments.\n\nDerivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into. They are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognizing gains or losses depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has a group-wide treasury policy in place to generally regulate hedging transactions. If necessary the Group documents and recognizes the hedging transactions in accordance with IAS 39. As of March 31, 2024 no cash flow hedges nor fair value hedges are recognized in the financial statements.\n\nIn addition to that, the Group has derivatives that hedge an asset or a liability. They are therefore measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value corresponds to the value which the relevant entity would receive or have to pay upon liquidation of the deal on the balance sheet date. Positive fair values at the balance sheet date are recognized under financial assets and negative fair values under financial liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within the financial result. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are presented in note 15.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the case of net investments in a foreign operation, exchange rate differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reclassified from equity to profit or loss on the sale or partial disposal of the foreign operation or the repayment of the amounts owed.\n\n## 34.11.5 Impairment of financial assets.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, recognition of expected credit losses applies to the following financial assets:\n\n- Trade receivables\n- Contract assets\n- Lease receivables\n- Cash and cash equivalent\n\nThe Group uses for trade receivables as well as for contract assets without a significant financing component and for lease receivables the simplified impairment model and accordingly calculates impairment at the amount of the lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit loss model) based on a provision matrix in which financial assets are structured according to ageing and the respective default rates are determined for different maturity bands. The age structure breaks down as follows: not past due, 1–30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, 91–180 days, 181–270 days, more than 270 days past due. For financial assets Kapsch TrafficCom expects a loss if contractual payments are past due 270 days or more.\n\nIn preparing the provision matrix, historical data on actually incurred defaults as well as forward-looking information and expectations are taken into account by overall estimating a potential loss by Kapsch TrafficCom. For forward-looking information and expectations changes in country specific CDS spreads are taken into account as the CDS-market represents all publicly available information and expectations in regard of market-related changes. The financial assets are allocated to different regions and credit risk and/or the changes to credit risk for the corresponding region are taken into account. Contract assets represent receivables not yet invoiced and do not significantly differ from trade receivables from comparable contracts as regards the risk criteria. Therefore, the same default rates as for receivables not past due are applied. The impairment of lease receivables is not material as of March 31, 2024. Financial assets are written off if no reasonable expectation of recovery exists. For example the debtor is insolvent or no agreement is possible and therefore the cash inflow cannot be anticipated anymore.\n\nAny impairment on cash and cash equivalents would be insignificant and was thus not taken into consideration.\n\nThe Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence of impairment of each significant individual financial asset or group of financial assets. If such evidence exists, the Group accounts for that impairment, and the proportionate loss previously recognized in equity for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income is removed from equity and recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. The cumulative loss reclassified from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in profit or loss. If in subsequent periods the fair value of the impaired financial instrument increases and that increase is directly related to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income, the Group reverses the impairment loss.\n\n## 34.12 Inventories.\n\nInventories are stated at cost or, if lower, at net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average price method. Production cost includes all directly attributable expenses and fixed and variable overheads (based on normal operating capacity) incurred in connection with production. It excludes, however, borrowing costs as they cannot be allocated to a qualifying asset. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling expenses.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.13 Employee benefits.\n\nThe Group provides various post-employment benefits to employees and other long-term benefits either based on individual agreements or in accordance with local labor law provisions.\n\nA defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate nongroup entity (fund). The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.\n\nNext to the defined contribution plans, there are defined benefit plans. Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service, and compensation.\n\nThe projected unit credit method is used for the calculation of liabilities arising from pension obligations and termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19. According to this method, post-employment costs for employee benefits are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in such a way that scheduled costs are spread over the employees' years of service on the basis of an expert opinion by a qualified actuary, who completely remeasures the schemes annually. The obligations for pension payments are calculated at the present value of future benefits using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds whose term roughly equals the term of the liability. The liability recognized on the balance sheet with respect to defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCosts arising from defined benefit plans from pension obligations and termination benefits include the following components:\n\n- Service costs include current as well as past service costs as well as gains or losses from benefit changes or curtailments. Service costs are recognized in profit or loss within personnel expenses.\n- The net interest cost on the defined benefit obligation or plan asset. This component is included in interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income.\n- Remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation or net asset. These are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\n\nContributions paid by the Group under a defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the statement of comprehensive income under personnel expenses in the period in which they occur.\n\nFor the calculation of liabilities arising from obligations for anniversary bonuses in accordance with IAS 19, the projected unit credit method is used. Anniversary bonuses are special lump-sum payments stipulated in the collective agreement and dependent on compensation and years of service. Eligibility is determined by a certain number of service years. The calculation of liabilities arising from obligations for anniversary bonuses is performed in a similar way as the calculation for liabilities arising from termination benefits. Current service costs are recognized within personnel expenses, net interest costs are recognized in interest expense in the statement of comprehensive income. Remeasurements are recognized within personnel expenses.\n\n## 34.14 Provisions.\n\nProvisions are recognized in the balance sheet in the event of a current legal or constructive obligation to third parties due to past events when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If such a reliable estimate is not possible, no provisions are set up. Provisions are measured based on the present value of the estimated settlement amount. The settlement amount is the best possible estimate of an expense on the basis of which a current obligation might be settled at the balance sheet date or transferred to a third party. This estimate takes into account future cost increases that are foreseeable and likely to occur on the balance sheet date. If material, the provisions are discounted using a pre-tax interest rate that takes into account current market expectations regarding the interest effect and the risks specific to the obligation. Increases in the provision resulting from pure compounding are recognized as interest expense in the income statement.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nProvisions for warranties and liabilities for construction flaws, serial and system problems mainly serve as coverage for obligations for free repairs and replacement deliveries, in accordance with the general sales and delivery conditions or due to individual agreements, and are measured on the basis of the group of obligations, using rates based on past experience regarding direct labor and material costs incurred, overheads, replacement deliveries, or rebates. A provision is recognized for the best estimate of the costs incurred for defects to be rectified under the warranty for products sold before the balance sheet date.\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognized if the expected benefit to be derived from the contract is less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the amount from the fulfillment of the contract or any compensation payments in case of non-performance, whichever is lower. The recognition of impairment losses on assets dedicated to such onerous contracts is, however, established prior to the recognition of the provisions for onerous contracts.\n\nProvisions for restructuring are recognized if the criteria of IAS 37 are fulfilled and includes the directly linked costs of restructuring, that are compulsory in the course of the restructuring and not referring to any current activities. Restructuring measure were communicated and started in the financial year 2020/21 in Kapsch TrafficCom. The majority of the measures were carried out in the financial year 2021/22 and 2022/23 and the provision was utilized accordingly.\n\n## 34.15 Current and deferred income tax.\n\nThe tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is generally recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Only taxes that relate to items recognized in other comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws applicable at the balance sheet date in the countries where the subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. The local Management is responsible together with the local fiscal representative for the preparation of tax returns, particularly relating to matters subject to interpretations and for setting up debt provisions, if reasonable, for amounts payable to tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax assets/liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred tax assets/liabilities arise from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither IFRS profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss, except for those transactions arising from initial recognition of the leasing in accordance with IFRS 16, they are not recognised. Likewise, deferred taxes are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax assets/liabilities are determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. In addition, it is to be assumed that such temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets for unused tax loss carried forward are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and, in particular in the case of a losses history, there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future against which these unused tax losses can be utilized. A planning horizon of six years is used, with the Group applying appropriate deductions in later planning periods due to greater uncertainties in the utilisation of the loss carry forward.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed annually at the balance sheet date and revalued if it is no longer likely that sufficient taxable income will be available to realize such assets partially or in full.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\n## 34.16 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom classifies non-current assets as \"held for sale\" if the benefit arising from the remaining carrying amount is to be realized predominately through the sale and not through the further use of the asset. The assets are remeasured in accordance with IFRS 5 immediately prior to their classification as \"held for sale\". The assets are subsequently measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is initially allocated to goodwill and subsequently to the other assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, and recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## 34.17 Contingent liabilities.\n\nWith regard to contingent liabilities, the Group classifies the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits as remote, and a liability does not have to be recognized yet pursuant to IFRS.\n\nContingent liabilities occur for two reasons. For one, they comprise possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events that are at least partly beyond the Group's con trol. For another, they comprise present obligations that fail to meet general or special recognition standards (i.e. the amount of an obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability or an outflow of resources to settle the obligations is not deemed probable).\n\n## 34.18 New and amended standards and interpretations that have been adopted by the EU and applied for the first time in financial year 2023/24.\n\n|                                           | New/amended IFRS                                                                                             | Published by the IASB<br>and adopted by the EU | Applicable to<br>financial years<br>beginning on or after | Material impact on<br>group's consolidated<br>financial statements |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IFRS 17                                   | Insurance Contracts                                                                                          | June 2020                                      | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 8                                     | Amendments to IAS 8:<br>Definition of Accounting Estimates                                                   | February 2021                                  | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 1,<br>IFRS<br>Practice<br>Statement 2 | Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS<br>Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of<br>Accounting policies                   | February 2021                                  | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 12                                    | Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax<br>related to Assets and Liabilities arising<br>from a Single Transaction | May 2021                                       | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 12                                    | Amendments to IAS 12: International<br>Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules                                   | May 2021                                       | January 1, 2023                                           | None                                                               |\n\nThe application did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. IFRS 17 was published in May 2017 as a replacement for IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. The valuation model of IFRS 17 is based on the determination of the current settlement values of insurance contracts, so that their valuations have to be adjusted in each reporting period due to changes in estimates. The new rules will affect the financial statements and key figures of all entities that have insurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary or investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nFrom today's perspective, no significant effects on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group are expected.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nAmendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates. It clarifies how to distinguish between changes in accounting policies and accounting estimates.\n\nThe distinction is important because changes in estimates affect future business prospectively and events, such as changes in accounting methods, however, retrospectively to the past transactions and events and the current period are to be applied.\n\nFrom today's perspective, there are no significant effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations expected.\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies. IAS 1 clarifies that entities shall disclose all material accounting policies. Previously, the standard referred to significant accounting policies. The amendments define what is meant by \"significant accounting policies\" and how to identify them. They also clarify that immaterial information on accounting policies need not be disclosed. However, if it is disclosed, this must not obscure significant information about accounting policies.\n\nFrom today's perspective, there are no significant effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations expected.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single\n\nTransaction. IAS 12 clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommis sioning obligations. The main change in Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) is an exemption from the initial recognition exemption provided in IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24. Accordingly, the initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions in which equal amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition. This is also explained in the newly inserted paragraph IAS 12.22A. According to the amendments, deferred taxes are to be recognised for transactions in which arise taxable and deductible temporary differences of the same amount on initial recognition.\n\nFrom today's perspective, there are no significant effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations expected.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12: International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules are:\n\n- an exception to the requirements in IAS 12 under which an entity does not recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities,\n- deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the OECD's second pillar of income taxes and does not disclose them,\n- an entity shall disclose that it has applied the exception,\n- the requirement for an entity to disclose separately its current tax expense (income) relating to second pillar income taxes,\n- the requirement for an entity to recognise its actual second pillar tax expense (income) in periods when second pillar legislation has been enacted or\n- substantially enacted but not yet substantively enacted, provides known or reasonably estimable,\n- information that helps users of the financial statements to understand the second pillar income taxes resulting from these laws,\n- the requirement for an entity to apply the exemption and the requirement to disclose that it has applied the exemption immediately after the amendments are published and retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8.\n\nFrom today's perspective, no material effects on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations are expected as Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, as Group revenues do not exceed the minimum threshold of EUR 750 million.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 34.19 Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and that have not been prematurely adopted by the Group.\n\n|        | New/amended IFRS                                                                                                                                  | Published by the IASB<br>and adopted by the EU | Applicable to<br>financial years<br>beginning on or after | Material impact on<br>group's consolidated<br>financial statements |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IAS 1  | Presentation of Financial Statements:<br>Classification of Liabilities as Current or<br>Non-current and Non-current Liabilities<br>with Covenants | January, 2020                                  | January 1, 2024                                           | None                                                               |\n| IAS 16 | Amendments to IFRS 16: Lease Liability<br>in a Sale and Leaseback                                                                                 | September, 2022                                | January 1, 2024                                           | None                                                               |\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current: Amendments to the requirements introduced by classifying liabilities as current or non-current in relation to how an entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or non-current in particular circumstances: affect only the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position, not the amount or timing of recognition of any asset, liability income or expenses, or the information that entities disclose about those items.\n\nAmendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period and align the wording in all affected paragraphs to refer to the \"right\" to defer settlement by at least twelve months and make explicit that only rights in place \"at the end of the reporting period\" should affect the classification of a liability; clarify that classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability; and make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services.\n\nOnly covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current.

These shares were held by a subsidiary of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, KTC-ZA Holding Proprietary Limited, South Africa. The sale resulted in the disposal of assets with a value of EUR 11.0 million and liabilities with a value of EUR 4.0 million. The selling price including variable components is expected to amount to EUR 2.7 million. The overall effects of the deconsolidation will be published in the quarterly highlights for the first quarter of the financial year 2024/25.\n\n## Winning a major infrastructure project in Switzerland.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom AG announced on April 30, 2024 that it had been contracted by the Swiss Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (BAZG) to supply the heavy goods vehicle (HGV) road fee collection system and to manage the technical operation until at least the end of 2032.

The increase in remuneration is primarily due to the profit-based remuneration. Expenses from termination and pension benefits for the Executive Board amounted to EUR 32 k (2022/23: EUR 36 k). In total, this results in total compensation for the Executive Board (before offsetting against provisions) of EUR 3,171 k in the 2023/24 financial year (2022/23: EUR 1,974 k).\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, the following persons served on the Supervisory Board:\n\n- Franz Semmernegg (Chairman)\n- Harald Sommerer (Deputy-Chairman)\n- Sabine Kauper (until September 6, 2023)\n- Monika Brodey (from September 6, 2023)\n- Sonja Hammerschmid\n\nDelegated by the works council:\n\n- Christian Windisch\n- Claudia Rudolf-Misch (until November 22, 2023)\n- Robert Kutschera (from November 22, 2023)\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe compensation paid to the members of the Supervisory Board in the financial year 2023/24 amounted to EUR 120 k (2022/23: EUR 120 k).\n\nAs in previous years, no advances or loans were granted to members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board, nor were any guarantees issued in their favor.\n\n## Proposed appropriation of retained earnings.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement on the financial restructuring, the Executive Board will propose to the 2024 Annual General Meeting not to distribute a dividend for the financial year 2023/24 and to carry forward the retained earnings to new account.\n\nAuthorized for issue:\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\nAlfredo Escribá Gallego Executive Board member\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Statement of all Members of the Executive Board.*\n\n## *Pursuant to Sec. 124 (1) Stock Exchange Act 2018.*\n\nWe declare to the best of our knowledge that the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group as required by the applicable accounting standards, that the Consolidated Management Report gives a true and fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, so that a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group is obtained and that the Consolidated Management Report describes the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group.\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\nSignature\n\nAlfredo Escribá Gallego Executive Board member\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *Auditor's Report Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements.*\n\n## Audit Opinion.\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2024, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply with legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2024, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs) and the additional requirements under section 245a Austrian Company Code.\n\n## Basis for Opinion.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing. Those standards require the application of the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of the auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n## Key Audit Matters.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe have structured key audit matters as follows:\n\n- Description\n- Audit approach and key observations\n- Reference to related disclosures\n\n## 1 Recoverability of the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units including goodwill.\n\n## Description.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements contain goodwill in the amount of EUR 22,735 k under the item intangible assets, of which EUR 11,771 k is allocated to the cash-generating unit Tolling-Americas and EUR 7,371 k to the cash-generating unit Tolling-APAC. The Group carries out an impairment test at least once a year and if evidence occurs indicating impairment (impairment test in accordance with IAS 36). In the financial year 2023/24, the impairment test did not indicate a need for impairment. Moreover, the consolidated financial statements as at March 31, 2024 include other intangible assets in the amount of EUR 5,140 k and property, plant and equipment in the amount of EUR 45,960 k.\n\nThe CGU Tolling-Americas includes goodwill whose recoverability is significantly determined by business development in North America. In this region, significant losses were incurred in the prior financial years which mainly result from considerable cost overruns and adjustments to planned costs and margins for material projects. As a result, the management identified, resolved on and implemented measures which are expected to lead to a positive development of results in the future. In North America, the financial year 2023/24 was still significantly affected by these restructuring measures and by a period of consolidation and reorganization. Margins for some implementation projects in the US also had to be further adjusted. There is still a negative contribution to earnings in the CGU Tolling-Americas in the amount of EUR -13,192 k (prior year: EUR -20,652 k). Based on the impairment test, no need for impairment exists for the CGUs Tolling-Americas and TM-Americas, with recoverability depending on achieving the return to profitable business planning in the future.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in March 2022, sanctions resulted in an impact on Kapsch TrafficCom's business in Belarus and are presented in the CGU Tolling-EMEA. Despite the existing sanctions and the associated supply restrictions, there are currently no material negative effects, especially in the important operation of the Austrian-wide toll system for cars and trucks, which runs until 2032. The planning calculation on which the impairment test is based assumes stable ongoing operations. No need for impairment exists for this CGU as at March 31, 2024.\n\nTesting carrying amounts of cash-generating units including goodwill for impairment requires significant estimates to be made by management regarding the future market development and the probability of winning individual major contracts during the planning period. This is particularly true for implementation projects with regard to tolling systems in the Tolling segment, where the order inflow is very volatile and contracts are usually awarded based on invitations to tender, which usually is associated with certain uncertainties. Moreover, there is significant area of judgement involved in the valuation, in particular with regard to the discount rate and the assumptions for the terminal value. With regard to the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of goodwill due to these estimation uncertainties and it was therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of significant forward-looking estimates and significant assumptions to derive the future cash flows as well as whether the calculation model used complies with the requirements of IAS 36. Internal evaluation experts were partly involved.\n\nWithin our audit and by partly involving our evaluation experts, we first gained an understanding of the planning logic, the planning process and the planning model as well as the impairment test (identification and definition of cash-generating units, determination of the recoverable amount, analysis of impairment, determination of discount rate and growth rate as well as calculation model).\n\nWe examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the plan prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. We analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (revenue growth, earnings margin, working capital, investment planning) as well as the essential risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them in meetings with the management. The parameters used to determine a discount rate in line with the risk level and the assumptions relating to the long-term growth rate were checked by means of external market and industry data, and the calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy. Further, we evaluated whether the disclosures on impairment testing provided in the notes are appropriate. This included, in particular, the assessment and recalculation of sensitivity analyses performed to assess the risk of possible deviations from revenues and earnings assumptions as well as from the discount and growth rates used.\n\nThe valuation model used by the Company is appropriate to carry out an impairment test as required by IFRS (impairment test in accordance with IAS 36). The assumptions and valuation parameters used in the valuation are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by IAS 36 are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nFurther information on this key audit matter is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note 12 \"Property, plant and equipment\", 13 \"Intangible assets\" and note 34.6.1 \"Goodwill\" in section 34 \"Accounting and valuation principles\".\n\n## 2 Estimates and assumptions regarding the recognition of revenue from implementation projects.\n\n## Description.\n\nA significant part of the Group's revenues and earnings contributions reported during the financial year comes from the construction of toll systems (tolling) and from the construction of systems for controlling traffic and mobility patterns (traffic management).\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, from the total revenue in the amount of EUR 538,842k, revenue in the amount of EUR 152,551 k related to the implementation of tolling and traffic management systems. The non-current and current contract assets as at March 31, 2024 amount to EUR 80,557 k (thereof EUR 21,312 k from Kapsch TrafficCom USA), and the non-current and current contract liabilities amount to EUR 48,517 k (thereof EUR 28,517 k from Kapsch TrafficCom USA). In addition, provisions for losses from onerous contracts were set up in the amount of \n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nEUR 17,326 k (thereof EUR 15,033 k from Kapsch TrafficCom USA) in order to provide for potential future losses from the further processing of projects.\n\nThe Group realizes revenues for its implementation projects in accordance with IFRS 15 based on the percentage of completion, which is determined from the ratio of the costs already incurred to the estimated total costs for the respective contract. This requires an ongoing assessment and update of the contract costs and the risks from fulfilling the contracts, which may result from technical problems, delays or problems with subcontractors or other external framework conditions and influence the contract margin. Furthermore, damages or contractual penalties can arise from these contracts which have to be considered in the project valuation and require a risk assessment. For single contracts, a variable consideration is included in the transaction price, which also leads to estimates. Numerous projects of the Group usually are technologically complex individual contracts with specific terms of contract and therefore have to be assessed individually with regard to revenue recognition and project risks.\n\nDue to, among others, a lack of resources with regard to qualified employees and delays in the acceptance of various projects due to the insufficient maturity of the software solution, considerable cost overruns in North America and adjustments to planned costs and margins for various projects occurred in the recent past, resulting in an impact on revenue recognition pursuant to IFRS 15. In the financial year 2023/24, progress was made on the percentage of completion of the projects concerned, but due to the provisions of the customer contracts further adjustments to the expected total costs in the amount of EUR 25,272 k of these projects had to be taken into account in the current financial year which led to further negative margin adjustments.\n\nDue to the material impact of the projects, in particular during the construction phase, on the Group's assets and liabilities, financial situation and results of operations and the significant estimates involved in the accounting for these contracts, there is the risk that the revenues from implementation projects and therefore the Group's result and the project-related balance sheet items contain a material misstatement, and this was therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWithin the framework of our risk-based audit approach, we gained an understanding of the revenue process and internal controls and tested the effectiveness of selected internal controls. This mainly referred to internal automatic and manual controls in connection with the approval of order calculation upon the conclusion of new contracts as well as approval of the ongoing recalculation. We tested the controls regarding the IT system used throughout the Group for revenue recognition in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue Engine\". Using samples, we recalculated the accurate determination of revenues based on percentage of completion. Based on selected samples we looked at project requests, customer contracts, Supervisory Board minutes, the project budgeting tool as well as detailed cost estimates and held discussions with the project managers and the management team regarding the status of the project, project risks and planning assumptions. In assessing the appropriateness of the estimates, a particular focus was on the review of the regular update of plan assumptions, in particular on the planned cost to complete and the planned project margin. We requested and checked the purchase orders and contracts for both actual and planned revenue. We examined the appropriateness of the disclosures on uncertainties with regard to estimation and examined the calculation of the sensitivity figures by 10% in the case of a change in the planned project margin (profit margin) in absolute terms.\n\nAs in the prior year, we performed extended audit procedures with regard to the projects in North America (the subsidiary Kapsch TrafficCom US). In particular, we checked the effectiveness of project controlling controls and discussed with local management and the project managers in charge the risk provisions and cost adjustments as well as the most recent approved planning for the sample projects examined, and critically assessed it.\n\nThe valuation methods and underlying assumptions applied for revenue recognition from implementation projects are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by IFRS 15 are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Group's disclosures on revenue recognition are included in note 1.4.1 \"Revenue recognition for contract work\", in note 2 \"Segment information\", in note 20 \"Contract assets and contract liabilities\", note 26 \"Provisions\" as well as in note 34.3 \"Revenue recognition\" in section 34 \"Accounting and valuation principles\".\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3 Recognition of deferred tax assets.\n\n## Description.\n\nDeferred tax assets in the amount of EUR 45,568 k are reported in the consolidated financial statements, mainly resulting from tax loss carry-forwards in the amount of EUR 36,863 k predominantly in Austria in the amount of EUR 20,192 k (intragroup loss carry-forward via group taxation) and the US in the amount of EUR 9,615k. The Group recognizes deferred tax assets up to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences as well as unused tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In the case of a history of losses, deferred tax assets are capitalized on loss carry-forwards to the extent that there is convincing substantial evidence that sufficient taxable income, taking into account the potential time limitation for using such loss carry-forwards, will be available in the future. The planning horizon in this context is six years.\n\nReviewing the recognition of deferred taxes requires management to make significant estimates as regards future market and business development as well as the chance of making profits with individual major contracts within the planning horizon, which is usually subject to a degree of uncertainty. With regard to the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of deferred tax assets due to these estimation uncertainties, and they were therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the multiyear plan prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board, and we analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (revenue growth, earnings margin, investment planning). Furthermore, we analyzed and critically assessed the adjustments to the tax planning result, which also takes into account future positive one-off effects with substantial indications. The calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy and the tax rates used were reconciled with external sources. To the extent that a loss history was available, we evaluated in particular whether there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. Further, we evaluated whether the disclosures on deferred tax assets provided in the notes are appropriate. In particular, this included the sensitivity analyses determined to assess the risk of potential deviations from earnings assumptions.\n\nThe model used by the Company is suitable to recognize deferred tax assets in accordance with IAS 12. The assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by IAS 12 are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Group's disclosures on deferred taxes are included in note 1.4.3. The Group's disclosures on deferred taxes are included in note 1.4.3. \"Recognition of deferred tax assets\", note 10 \"Income taxes\", note 17 \"Deferred tax assets/ liabilities\" and note 34.15 \"Current and deferred income tax\" in section 34 \"Accounting and valuation principles\".\n\n## 4 Restructuring of financing.\n\n## Description.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, non-current liabilities in the amount of EUR 91,906 k (prior year: EUR 58,472 k) and current financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 12,751 k (prior year: EUR 131,170 k) exist.\n\nIn the previous financial year 2022/23, the adverse business development, particularly with regard to profitability and the associated liquidity and debt, has led management to prepare a comprehensive restructuring concept with the help of an external advisor, which includes measures to improve profitability and reduce working capital, but is also intended to create a basis for sustainable future growth. This restructuring concept also forms the basis for the refinancing agreement concluded by Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, with its main financial creditors on May 31, 2023, which was concluded until May 25, 2025, in which a comprehensive refinancing of current financial liabilities (including the promissory note bonds) was agreed. Existing financing in the amount of EUR 106.3 million was extended until May 25, 2025, and new financing was concluded by this date. This includes a refinancing agreement of 50% of the promissory note bond in the amount of EUR 11.5 million that has matured in mid-June 2023 and the provision of EUR 4.25 million as an additional operating loan by a promissory note creditor. In this context, the Company has agreed to make early repayments from surplus cash and cash equivalents (cash sweep), from extraordinary inflows and from pending proceedings, and to not distribute any dividends. In the course of the refinancing, additional customary covenants and conditions were agreed with the financial creditors, compliance with which will be closely monitored and reported on by the external advisors in the future. The main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, pledged all its shares held in the Company (around 63.6% of the share \n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\ncapital) as collateral. The Company also undertook to utilize the entire existing authorized capital to the extent of 10% of the share capital.\n\nIn a supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024 to the restructuring agreement, the maturity of the non-current loans was extended to March 31, 2026 with the condition that EUR 4 million must be repaid early on a quarterly basis from December 31, 2024.\n\nThe measures for ensuring sufficient liquidity implemented by management in the prior years were continued in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nDue to the material impact of the refinancing on the assets and liabilities and financial situation as well as the going concern assumption of the Group, this was identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nThe refinancing from the previous year, which was concluded on May 31, 2023, was revalued by the management in accordance with IFRS 9. We first gained an understanding of the calculation and whether a modification in accordance with IFRS 9 exists. The model for the calculation was evaluated and the cash flows analyzed. These were compared using detailed documentation on the loan agreements and interest payments in order to verify the underlying values of the model. The present values of the original cash flows were compared with the present values of the adjusted cash flows and it was checked whether a change was less than 10%, which means that the recognition of a modification is appropriate and the difference is recognized in the income statement.\n\nIn general, the calculation in the model appears plausible and essentially fulfils the requirements of IFRS 9.\n\nWe checked the agreements dated May 31, 2023 as well as the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, on refinancing and assessed the resulting impact on the assets and liabilities, financial situation and results of operations as well as the going concern assumption of the Company and assessed the related disclosures made by the Executive Board in the consolidated financial statements. In this process, we first gained an understanding of the planning process and model. We examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the plan included in the restructuring concept prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. We analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (such as revenue and cost planning, changes in working capital as well as liquidity planning) as well as the essential risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them in meetings with the management. We interviewed the management on the status of the implementation of the measures.\n\nFurthermore, on the basis of the planning calculations, we assessed whether the Company will be able to fulfil the future repayment obligation included in the supplementary agreement.\n\nMoreover, we assessed the management's measures implemented to ensure sufficient liquidity and checked whether the monitoring implemented by management in this regard (daily monitoring of the group-wide liquidity portfolio and weekly 12-weeks cash flow forecasts) continue to be performed.\n\nBased on the information we have collected and as agreed in the refinancing agreement dated May 31, 2023 and in the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, regular monitoring and external reporting will be carried out by the external advisor to ensure ongoing and appropriate monitoring of liquidity and compliance with the intended implementation of the measures from the restructuring concept.\n\nThe application of the accounting method based on the going concern assumption is appropriate.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Group's disclosure on refinancing is included in note 36 \"Events after the reporting period\", the disclosures on monitoring liquidity in note 33 \"Capital management\".\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Other Information.\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the management report for the Group and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs), and the additional regulations of section 245a Austrian Company Code, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAAs part of an audit in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risks of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, on measures taken to eliminate identified threats or on applied safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements.\n\n## Comments on the Management Report for the Group.\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report for the Group is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report for the Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian standards on auditing for the audit of the management report for the Group\n\n## Opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations, comprising the details in accordance with section 243a UGB and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Statement.\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report for the Group came to our attention.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Additional Information in Accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation.\n\nWe were elected as statutory auditor at the ordinary general meeting dated September 6, 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on November 7, 2023.

In the eurozone in particular, however, persistently high energy prices and interest rates as well as weak household consumption burdened the economy. Key interest rates were initially raised further and then remained constant over the course of 2023. Inflation rates therefore stabilized at a high level and eventually declined again significantly\n\n## Global supply chain situation.\n\nThe global supply chain situation normalized over the course of 2023 after the pandemic-related bottlenecks. Both availability and delivery times improved in the second half of 2023. However, there were disruptions on two important shipping routes in the first few months of 2024: Conflicts in the Red Sea led to a significant decline in trade via the Suez Canal, and traffic slowed down in the Panama Canal due to water shortages caused by the severe drought. The effects were reflected in increased transport times and costs, although the duration and extent of the disruptions could not yet be estimated at the end of the financial year.\n\n## Interst rates.\n\nBoth the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (FED) in the USA continued the gradual increase in key interest rates that began in 2022 in the first months of the financial year. In Europe, the interest rate for main refinancing operations and the interest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were raised from 3.50%, 3.75% and 3.00% respectively in March 2023 to 4.50%, 4.75% and 4.00% respectively by September 2023. The FED also raised interest rates in two further steps from 4.75% to 5.00% in March 2023 to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% from July 2023. Interest rates then remained constant and were recently expected to be followed by interest rate cuts.\n\n## Inflation.\n\nThe measures taken by central banks to control the enormous inflation took effect in the 2023/24 financial year, with inflation stabilizing at the beginning of 2023 and falling significantly in the following months.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global inflation rate averaged 6.8% in 2023 after 8.7% in the previous year. In Austria, it remained higher at 7.7% in 2023 (previous year: 8.6%) and was also significantly higher than the inflation rate in the eurozone of 5.4% (previous year: 8.4%). According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), the development in the first quarter of 2024 suggests a further slowdown in inflation in Austria. Inflation plays a significant role for Kapsch TrafficCom, particularly in connection with personnel costs.\n\n## Currencies\n\nFor Kapsch TrafficCom, the development of the US Dollar (USD) is of particular importance in the foreign exchange markets. The influence of the currency on the business development results from the internationality of the Group with a large number of projects as well as locations in the USA and other countries where invoicing is done in USD. In the financial year 2023/24, the Euro (EUR) trended sideways within a narrow range against the US dollar. The average for the reporting period was EUR/USD 1.08 (previous year: 1.04) with a maximum of 1.13 on July 18, 2023 and a minimum of 1.05 on October 3, 2023.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Global economic performance.\n\nThe IMF estimates a global GDP growth rate of 3.2% for 2023 (previous year: 3.5%). This growth was primarily driven by a strong second half of the year in the USA and in major emerging and developing countries, which recovered quickly from the effects of the COVID pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nAccordingly, GDP growth in both the USA (2.5%) and the emerging and eveloping countries (4.3%) exceeded forecasts. In the eurozone, however, the gross domestic product nearly stagnated at 0.4%. This is due to weak household consumption, persistently high energy prices and weaker manufacturing and corporate investment as a result of high interest rates.\n\n## Austria.\n\nHigh interest rates and high inflation rates characterized the Austrian economy in the financial year 2023/24. The gross domestic product showed a decline of 0.7% in 2023 after an increase of 4.8% in the previous year. According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), this was primarily due to the low demand for capital goods in connection with the high interest rates.\n\nExports fell by 0.2%, mainly due to significantly lower exports of services. Investments declined by 2.4%; the construction industry in particular recorded a collapse in demand. The high inflation rate and the resulting lower real disposable income as well as high energy prices also reduced household consumption by 0.3%.\n\n## 1.1.2 Definition of market.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is a globally renowned provider of transportation solutions for sustainable mobility. Innovative solutions in the application fields of tolling and tolling services, traffic management and demand management contribute to a healthier world without congestion.\n\n## Vision and mission.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's mission is to develop innovative transportation solutions for sustainable mobility. Road users should be able to arrive at their destination conveniently, safely, efficiently, and on time with a minimal environmental impact.\n\n## Target markets.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom addresses the market for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These support and optimize traffic (including infrastructure, vehicles, users and industry) and use information and communication technologies for this purpose.\n\nGrand View Research places the global market size at EUR 27.1 billion in the year 2023 (USD 29.91 billion, converted at an exchange rate of 0.9045 as of December 31, 2023), and expects it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.\n\nWithin the ITS market, Kapsch TrafficCom focuses on tolling and tolling services as well as traffic management and demand management. Core regions of business activity are EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa), Americas (North, Central and South America) and APAC (Asia-Pacific).\n\n## Addressable market.\n\nThe addressable market for the company had a volume of EUR 6.4 billion in the financial year 2023/24 according to internal calculations. The market is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.9% to EUR 8.7 billion until financial year 2027/28\n\n## Market drivers.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has identified the following market drivers:\n\nEnvironmental protection. The Paris Agreement is an important global climate protection agreement and was adopted in December 2015 at the Paris Climate Change Conference. The European Commission (as part of the \"European Green Deal\") and the USA are pursuing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nRoad traffic plays a significant role here, as it is responsible for a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas emissions. Both traffic management and tolling solutions are recognized tools for influencing traffic and means of transportation.\n\nNeed for traffic infrastructure and its maintenance. Studies expect not only an increase in the global population, but also more private vehicles on the roads. As the volume of vehicles grows, it will be inevitably necessary to increase investments in road construction and maintenance. This is usually extremely expensive. At the same time, the increasing number of hybrid or electric vehicles is having a negative impact on mineral oil tax revenues. This means that an increase in the need for alternative financing models, including tolling solutions, can be assumed.\n\nUrbanization. The percentage of people living in cities is increasing. Whereas in the year 1800 only 2% of the world's population was urban, in 2007 for the first time more than half of the world's population lived in cities. Based on a current figure of around 56%, the United Nations forecasts that the urban population will account for more than 60% of the population in 2030 and around 68% in 2050. At the same time, the world's population will rise from around 7.9 billion people today to 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050. It is precisely in urban areas that private and professional mobility gives rise to major challenges. After all, houses cannot be moved at will to expand roads or even rebuild them. Furthermore, as the urban population grows, there will be an increase in the volume of business within a city as well as with business partners outside of the city. Since products must be delivered, a higher urban population tends to bring about an increase in the volume of transportation.\n\nNew means of transportation and services. Analysts expect that urban passenger traffic will more than double by 2050. Autonomous vehicles could intensify this trend. The existing road infrastructure will not be able to meet these needs. This results in two consequences: the increased use of public transport and shared means of trans- portation, and – if no appropriate countermeasures are taken – more extensive congestion. In addition, the trend toward electric vehicles will continue. While this reduces immediate CO₂ emissions, the particulate matter problem will remain.\n\nConnected vehicles. Technological advances in the exchange of information between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle, V2V), between vehicles and traffic infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure, V2I), and in the area of autonomous driving are rapid. Already today, these developments are enabling increasingly better and more extensive applications for better driving comfort and greater driving safety. In addition, the new communication channels and the enormous volumes of data enable substantial improvements in traffic management.\n\nData and artificial intelligence. Open data and open interfaces enable more extensive and higher-performing applications. Connected vehicles are an important data source. Machine learning and artificial intelligence create new opportunities for data analysis, simulation, forecasting, and management.\n\nData security. Due to the use of large amounts of data, the protection of personal data and how it is handled is becoming increasingly important.\n\nFundamental changes in the business environment of Kapsch TrafficCom. The aforementioned market drivers have already sparked the following trends:\n\n- While the ITS industry relied heavily on hardware in the past, it is increasingly shifting towards software platforms. More and more, module solutions and cloud applications are playing a role.\n- Offered services (anything-as-a-service) put the focus on the user and are integrated into platforms and devices preferred by them.\n- Payment solutions are integrated into vehicle technology, and new payment technologies will enter the market.\n- Intelligent traffic infrastructure can be achieved with more affordable sensors, modules, and connection technologies. Specific domain knowledge and the need for customer-specific solutions will remain significant, however.\n- New solutions can be rolled out on a global scale.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.1.3 Business performance 2023/24.\n\nIn financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom reached key milestones that placed the company back on a solid base for the future: In May 2023, a financing restructuring was agreed with the major financial creditors, which led to a longer-term financing structure and has since been extended until March 2026. In July, a settlement agreement was reached in the arbitration proceedings between the autoTicket joint venture and the Federal Republic of Germany conducted due to the termination of the operations contract for the collection of the passenger car toll. This led to a significant improvement in the financial and asset position. The earnings also improved as a result.\n\nAlthough net revenues were slightly below the previous year's figure, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to achieve an increase in invoiced revenues compared to the previous year and numerous project successes, which indicate a future increase in revenues and earnings.\n\nProject successes. The operation projects continued to perform well and several implementation projects were transitioned to the operation phase. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom was able to win several new projects in the reporting period. Of particular strategic importance are those that point the path to the future of roads with tolling services and connected vehicles.\n\nThe company was awarded two interconnected contracts in the tolling segment in Switzerland: firstly, the implementation of the collection system for the performance-based heavy vehicle fee (after the balance sheet date) and its operation, and secondly, the corresponding vehicle equipment and registration system for the trucks as well as customer service for the toll service provider for at least eight years. Together, Kapsch TrafficCom thus supplies all essential elements for this state-of-the-art system.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the further expansion of the tolltickets network. With the purchase of a single toll box, drivers can since then seamlessly use the road network in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal – a cornerstone for the tolling services business segment in Europe.\n\nIn the segment of traffic management, Kapsch TrafficCom sees a particularly increasing demand for urban traffic management and low emission zones. In addition, the implementation and subsequent operation of a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) with hardware and software for construction site areas were awarded in a highway project in Germany. Shortly after the end of the financial year, Kapsch TrafficCom was awarded a pioneering contract in Florida, USA: In Pinellas County, intersections will be equipped with modern technology to prevent accidents involving pedestrians, and a system that combines predictive analyses with traffic distribution algorithms is designed to help proactively reduce traffic congestion.\n\nIncoming orders reached a remarkable EUR 734 million in the reporting period (previous year: EUR 480 million), and the order backlog amounted to EUR 1.4 billion at the end of the year, 15% higher than in the previous year\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.2 Financial and non-financial performance indicators.\n\n## 1.2.1 Results of operations\n\nKapsch TrafficCom AG's revenue reached EUR 221.9 million in the 2023/24 financial year, significantly higher than the previous year's figure of EUR 155.1 million. The increase is mainly due to the offsetting of EUR 66.3 million relating to the agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany. In the toll segment, revenue amounted to EUR 193.0 million (previous year: EUR 129.8 million). In the traffic management segment, revenue also increased from EUR 25.3 million in the previous year to EUR 28.9 million in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR 50.0 million compared to the previous year (EUR 42.9 million). The average number of employees increased by 17 to 449 people.\n\nOther operating expenses decreased by EUR 16.8 million to EUR 48.5 million (previous year: EUR 65.3 million). The change was mainly due to lower expenses for write-downs on loans and receivables from affiliated companies\n\nThe operating result of Kapsch TrafficCom AG amounted to EUR 33.3 million in the reporting year and was thus significantly higher than the previous year's figure of EUR -40.6 million. It was influenced by the following one-off effects:\n\n- The joint venture autoTicket GmbH reached a settlement with the Federal Republic of Germany in July 2023 and received an amount of EUR 243 million. The cash inflow to Kapsch TrafficCom AG from this settlement to date amounted to EUR 109.2 million. This one-off effect had a positive impact on Kapsch TrafficCom AG's EBIT by EUR 79.2 million.\n- After an agreement was reached with a customer regarding overdue receivables, these receivables were written off in the amount of EUR 10.1 million, while a credit note of EUR 5.5 million was issued, which led to a reduction in revenues.\n\nThe financial result improved by EUR 74.3 million to EUR 7.5 million (previous year: EUR -66.8 million). The main deviation is due to the fact that massive write-downs were made on affiliated companies in the previous year.\n\n## 1.2.2 Net assets positions.\n\nTotal assets of EUR 398.8 million as of the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024 decreased by EUR 18.9 million compared to the end of the 2022/23 financial year (March 31, 2023: EUR 418.1 million).\n\nFixed assets decreased by EUR 39.2 million to EUR 210.0 million as of March 31, 2024 (previous year: EUR 249.2 million). The change is mainly due to the decrease in financial assets totaling EUR 33.4 million in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nInventories increased from EUR 6.0 million to EUR 7.1 million. This is due to an increase in inventory items of almost EUR 1.0 million.\n\nGroup receivables, also include receivables from companies in which participiations are held (including loans), increased from EUR 174.2 million in the previous year to EUR 193.5 million in the reporting year 2023/24.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of EUR 2.0 million were at the previous year's level of EUR 2.0 million.\n\nAt EUR 198.9 million, equity was significantly higher than the comparative figure as of March 31, 2023 (EUR 151.7 million). The equity ratio increased significantly to 49,9% as of March 31, 2024 (previous year: 36.3%)\n\nLong-term liabilities increased from EUR 89.9 million in the previous year to EUR 100.2 million as of the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024. The main reason for this is the reclassification of short-term liabilities to long-term liabilities. Group liabilities increased by EUR 3.6 million to EUR 81.4 million (previous year: EUR 77.8 million). Other liabilities increased from EUR 6.6 million in the previous year to EUR 7.6 million as of the balance sheet date of March 31, 2024.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.2.3 Financial position.\n\nThe net cash flow from operating activities was significantly positive in the reporting period due to the increase in sales revenues and other operating income related to the agreement with Germany and amounted to EUR 96.7 million (previous year: -30.6 million).\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities of EUR -3.2 million (previous year: EUR 18.4 million) results mainly from payments for financial investments.\n\nThe net cash flow from financing activities was negative in the 2023/24 financial year at EUR -93.6 million (previous year: EUR 2.1 million). The change results, also as a result of the restructuring of financing, primarily from the repayment of short-term financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 76.1 million.\n\nThe cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 amounted to EUR 2.0 million (March 31, 2023 EUR 2.0 million)\n\n## 1.2.4 Non-Financial information.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom Group prepares a separate consolidated non-financial report that fulfils the legal requirements pursuant to section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB)\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.3 Research and develpoment.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24 Kapsch TrafficCom invested 5% of its revenues in generic development, development support and product management.\n\nIn line with the corporate strategy \"Strategie 2027\" Kapsch TrafficCom launched a multi-year technology transformation program in the financial year 2021/22. The goal of this program is to safeguard and modernize the company's technology portfolio and reinforce its leadership in the marketplace. The emphasis is on advancing an agile way of working, developing the company's technology stack faster and more flexibly as well as adapting the current product and solution portfolio to the ever-evolving market requirements. This enables a faster time to market and more efficient delivery of solutions, resulting in improved revenues and margins.\n\nWith a strong focus on customers and their needs, the transformation is based on four pillars:\n\n- Product portfolio. In the product area, the product management team was strengthened. The team was also given responsibility to manage and steer the portfolio by means of a holistic view and a portfolio strategy aimed at consoli- dation and optimization. This identifies commonalities and synergies and builds on intelligent platforms.\n- Technology stack. The technology stack evolution allows Kapsch TrafficCom to accelerate the migration to the cloud as well as the adoption of new technologies and architectures. The technology stack is the frame for standardizing and developing technologies\n- Organization and processes. Kapsch TrafficCom introduced SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework©) to continuously improve its software engineering methodology, organization and processes. This system and software engineering methodology leverages industry-standard agile principles to enable the development of the most complex software and cyber-physical systems and to promote customer centricity. The initial pilot projects showed successful outcomes in software development. The key improvements included better alignment with customer requirements, enhanced quality through early defect detection and increased predictability by adapting swiftly to changes. In the next step, these methods will be expanded to other teams in order to accelerate and improve the quality of software releases, with a focus on effectively meeting customer needs.\n- Culture. Fostering and nurturing a culture of collaboration, curiosity and innovation is the fourth pillar of transformation and a key success factor.\n\nIn the financial year 2022/23, the patent portfolio of Kapsch TrafficCom was further optimized. The focus was on topics of high strategic importance. As of March 31, 2024, the patent portfolio consisted of 118 patent families with 824 individual patents and 41 pending patent applications. In the financial year, three new patent families were filed in the field of tolling and one patent family was discontinued.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom strives to mitigate the risk of patent infringements and to foster the patenting of new ideas. Hence, the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management focusses on supporting product management and product development. Patent analysis in various areas ensures that products and solutions are actually free to operate. Based on these patent analyses and the expertise gained from them, Kapsch TrafficCom also intends to file more of its own patents in order to secure its freedom to operate and its unique selling proposition for its products and solutions.\n\nIn addition, the global patent monitoring system was further established. Its task is to analyze patent applications from competitors and in relevant technology segments in order to gain a better overview of competitors' strategies.\n\nThe development expenses of Kapsch TrafficCom amounted to EUR 51.7 million in the financial year 2023/24 (previous year: EUR 43.6 million).\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *2 Anticipated develpoment and risks.*\n\n## 2.1 Outlook to financial year 2024/25.\n\nFor the financial year 2024/25, the management expects revenues to grow above the forecasted average annual market growth of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. The operating result (EBIT) should show a slight improve- ment compared to the result adjusted for one-time effects of EUR 15.1 million, whereby positive onetime effects are also possible again.\n\n*Expectation for financial year 2024/25: Revenue growth above market growth Slight improvement in EBIT*\n\n## Revenues.\n\nRevenues continue to be affected by the economic and political uncertainties in connection with the global conflicts. In the past financial year, net revenues were also negatively impacted by a customer credit note and deferred revenues.\n\nThe high order intake and order backlog will increasingly be reflected in revenues and form a solid basis for further growth. In the medium term, revenuess of at least EUR 200 million should be possible again.\n\n## EBIT (operating result).\n\nThe EBIT of the past year was influenced by many one-time effects, both positive and negative. Kapsch TrafficCom is therefore utilizing the figure of EUR 5 million adjusted for these one-time effects as a starting point for further development.\n\nDespite the improved situation, the focus remains on costs. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom is analyzing its process organization from bottom to top according to a Zero Base Approach in order to avoid project difficulties of the past in the future. The aim is to increase efficiency through global standards and tools.\n\n## Liquidity.\n\nThe increase in invoiced revenues in the reporting period and the recently awarded projects will be reflected in earnings and liquidity. In addition, the restructuring of financing has led to a longer-term financing structure. In May 2024, the term of the existing restructuring agreement, including all credit lines, was extended until March 31, 2026.\n\nAs of the reporting date, Kapsch TrafficCom had already generated around half of the further cash inflows from pending proceedings and other measures of at least EUR 30 million targeted in the half-year 2023/24: The total net cash inflow from the settlement agreement in Germany was around EUR 5 million higher than expected; the sale of the investment Traffic Technology Services Inc., USA, which is not part of the strategic core business, also brought in an inflow of around EUR 7.9 million. The management is still aiming for further cash inflows to reduce net debt further. The aim is to achieve a minimum level of net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.0x in the longer term.\n\nIn connection with this, the aim is also to release the dividend block and lift the pledge on the shares of the core shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH.\n\n## Non-financial targets.\n\nThe company's non-financial targets can be found in the separate non-financial report in accordance with Section 267a UGB.\n\n## Corporate governance.\n\nThe mandates of Franz Semmernegg and Harald Sommerer as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board will expire in financial year 2024/25. Both will leave the Board. In the course of the new elections, the Supervisory Board is to be intentionally positioned more strongly as an advisory body to the Executive Board.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Strategy 2027.\n\nGlobal megatrends as well as growing awareness and legal requirements regarding climate and environmental protection are increasing the demand for comprehensive and intelligent transportation solutions. More and more, this confirms that Kapsch TrafficCom is addressing the right issues with its Strategy 2027, even if implementation is taking longer than originally assumed due to the market situation.\n\nA comprehensive strategy review was launched in the past financial year and is still ongoing. One of the first changes resulting from this was the sale of the non-core investments Traffic Technology Services, Inc. in the USA (TTS) and TMT Services and Supplies Proprietary Limited in South Africa (TMT).\n\nKapsch TrafficCom is still predominantly perceived as a hardware provider. In fact, however, the company is already more of a provider of software and services; this development and change will continue – while retaining the hardware component – and will be shaped in the strategy review.\n\n## 2.2 Risk report.\n\n## 2.2.1 Risk management.\n\nThe enterprise-wide risk management process (Enterprise Risk Management, ERM) of the Kapsch TrafficCom Group is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework, an internationally recognized standard for risk management.\n\nThe risk management process aims at an early identification, assessment, and management of those risks that can significantly affect the achievement of the strategic and operating objectives of the company. The primary goal is not risk avoidance, but the controlled and conscious handling of risks and the timely recognition and exploitation of opportunities that arise. In this way, ERM makes a valuable contribution to corporate management.\n\nAs part of ERM, major risks are identified, quantified, and globally aggregated on a quarterly basis. The risk report derived from this enables the concise assessment and monitoring of the major business risks. The report is sent to the Executive Board, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, and the first reporting level. The Audit Committee is informed immediately by the Executive Board about important events. The Supervisory Board also deals with the effectiveness of the risk management system as part of its monitoring of the Executive Board. The design and implementation aspects of the risk management system are reviewed annually by the auditor in accord- ance with Rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (ÖCGK) to ensure that the system is adequately designed and implemented. To further strengthen risk management, internal audits are carried out after this exter- nal audit to assess the operational effectiveness of the system. This proactive approach enables Kapsch TrafficCom to continuously improve and ensure the effectiveness of its risk management in day-to-day operations. The project-oriented risk management encompasses both customerprojects and internal development projects. Using institutionalized processes, an analysis of all relevant risks and opportunities is already carried out in the course of offer preparation. Consequently, a basis is created for decisions and for the timely planning and implementation of control measures.\n\nThe main generic risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom and the general handling of these risks are briefly discussed in the following. The environmental, social and governance impacts, risks and opportunities of Kapsch TrafficCom are explained in the separate non-financial report.\n\n## 2.2.2 Industry-specific risks.\n\nVolatility of new orders. Kapsch TrafficCom's most relevant customer groups include primarily government agencies and municipal authorities as well as private concessionaires, public-private partnerships and consumers. Larger\n\ncontracts are usually tendered. Until a contract is actually awarded to Kapsch TrafficCom, there are a number of uncertainty factors both within and out- side of the company's area of influence. For example, political changes, appeals or lawsuits by unsuccessful bidders can lead to a delay in the awarding of a contract, to its cancellation or to a modification of the\n\n*Geographic diversification and expansion of the product portfolio contribute to stabilizing revenues*\n\ntender. There is also the risk that offers made by Kapsch TrafficCom will not succeed for technological, financial, formal or other reasons.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe expansion into new business areas is aimed at increasing revenue growth and smoothing out revenue spikes in order to achieve a more stable revenue development. This is to be achieved in particular by further broadening the customer and product portfolio and by increasing the share of revenue from the operating business (technical and commercial operations of systems usually previously set up by the company) and from the tolling service business. The latter is typically commissioned on a long-term basis and is therefore characterized by better predictable revenues.\n\nThe economic situation of relevant national economies, possible government investment programs, changes in political priorities, an increasing focus on sustainability, trade conflicts, military conflicts or epidemics can have a significant impact on incoming orders.\n\nRisks of project execution. Intelligent transportation solutions are often technically complex and challenging systems, that must be implemented within a strict timeframe. However, the actual project environment cannot be\n\nfully analyzed and taken into account during the preparation of an offer. Therefore, uncertainties remain with regard to integration efforts for thirdparty systems, efforts for interfaces and other factors accelerating or delaying the handling of projects. Unavoidable dependencies on suppliers and service providers can also have a negative effect on the quality\n\n*Technical challenges and tight schedules cause typical project risks*\n\nand timely completion of a project. All of these factors thus affect the risk of missed deadlines and/or system and product defects.\n\nIn connection with the installation of systems, Kapsch TrafficCom is generally contractually obligated to issue performance and delivery date guarantees. If the contractual services are not fulfilled or if deadlines are exceeded, penalties and damages usually have to be paid, in some cases even damages for lost toll revenue. Significant missed deadlines can also result in premature termination of a contract by the customer. A significant delay in a project, a clear failure to meet the contractually agreed performance criteria or failed implementation of a project could reduce the chances of success in future tenders. There is also the risk that projects of Kapsch TrafficCom cannot be realized at the previously calculated costs. Due to the strong social opposition to toll systems that is sometimes encountered, the risk of a late or limited start to toll collection exists, which can have further consequences on revenues, profitability and payment flows in the operation project.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom employs project management methods and project risk management procedures based on the IPMA (International Project Management Association) standards in order to minimize such risks in projects.\n\nLong-term contracts with public agencies. For many projects, contracts are awarded by public agencies. Frame- work agreements and service contracts in connection with tolling or traffic management projects may include terms and conditions that are not negotiable in a tender process and that may be disadvantageous for Kapsch TrafficCom. Some multi-year contracts contain demanding requirements regarding the targeted performance of the implemented systems, components and processes. Failure to meet these requirements can result in considerable contractual penalties, obligations to pay damages or termination of the contract. On the other hand, in some contracts substantial bonus payments may be earned in the case of over-performance. Moreover, for long-term contracts, the achievable margins may deviate from the original calculations due to cost changes.\n\nContracts may entail liabilities relating to a loss of profit by customers, product liabilities and other liabilities. Kapsch TrafficCom strives to include appropriate limitations of liability in contracts. However, there can be no assurance that all contracts will contain sufficient limitations of liability or that they will be enforceable under applicable law.\n\nRisks in the supply chain. As a manufacturer of high-tech, multi-component devices and as a supplier of these devices and/or third-party products in the context of tolling and traffic management projects, Kapsch TrafficCom is dependent on the functional capability of the supply chain. It is essential to receive ordered components on time in order to ensure that they are available for ongoing projects when needed. At the same time, the components must be of good quality and offered at a reasonable price to achieve satisfactory financial results.\n\nThe situation on the global market for semi-conductors can be significantly affected by shifts in production capacity, geopolitical changes in the main production regions and disruptions in logistics. This can lead to the unavailability of the necessary components as well as fluctuations in delivery times and prices and cause difficulties in ongoing projects. Financial or operational difficulties at individual suppliers can also lead to delays in delivery, additional costs or a deterioration in the price-performance ratio of the components if supplier substitution is necessary.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis risk is limited by the fact that Kapsch TrafficCom ensures that at least two suppliers from different countries of origin are utilized for critical materials, insofar as this is economically feasible.\n\n## 2.2.3 Strategic risks.\n\nAbility to innovate. The strong market position of Kapsch TrafficCom is based to a large extent on its ability to develop high quality, efficient and reliable systems, components, solutions and services. Kapsch TrafficCom is\n\ncommitted to ongoing and consistent innovation. In order to maintain its high technological standards, Kapsch TrafficCom invests in research and development activities. However, if Kapsch TrafficCom does not succeed in developing innovative systems, components, solutions and services in line with market requirements, this may be detrimental to its competitive position.\n\nSince the striving for innovation leadership is based to a large extent on technology, internal know-how and intellectual property, the global increase in product piracy and reverse engineering may have negative impacts on the market position of Kapsch TrafficCom. The company therefore places great importance on protecting technologies and the company's internal know-how, such as through patents and non-disclosure agreements with relevant contractual partners. On the other hand, newly developed systems, components, solutions or services may also infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n\nAcquisition and integration of companies as part of the Group's growth. The Group's growth can be organic as well as through selected acquisitions or the establishment of joint ventures. In the course of these activities, it is\n\nnecessary to overcome a number of challenges in order to achieve the desired goals and synergies, as well as to realize the expected opportunities arising from the acquisition of new technologies and market knowhow.\n\nCountry risk. Due to the further expansion of business activities in countries outside of Europe, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to increased political risk in some countries. Significant and currently unforeseeable political changes may have a major impact on the ability to implement or operate projects in these countries as well as to make funds available or withdraw them again. Interference with the property rights of Kapsch TrafficCom or problems with business practices and activities may also arise. Kapsch TrafficCom includes these risks in the evaluation of such projects.\n\n## 2.2.4 Financial risks.\n\nForeign exchange risk. As a global company, Kapsch TrafficCom maintains branches and subsidiaries in many countries outside the Euro zone. Consequently, transaction risks arise from possible exchange rate fluctuations,\n\nwhich may be reflected in the consolidated financial statements as exchange rate losses or gains. Kapsch TrafficCom strives as far as possible to avoid these transaction risks in the amount of the net currency positions from the respective projects or to hedge them, if necessary. However, because the net currency position at the respective payment flow deadlines is often difficult to predict, hedging is only possible to a limited extent.\n\nThe remaining exchange rate risk is accepted and included in the business planning. Due to the conversion of individual financial statements of the subsidiaries outside the Euro zone into the Group currency of the Euro, Kapsch TrafficCom is also subject to a translation risk. In addition, long-term disadvantageous exchange rate changes can also cause a change in the position of Kapsch TrafficCom relative to competitors, such as when products or services based on a euro-cost structure can no longer be offered at competitive prices outside the Euro zone.\n\n*Financial risks arise from exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations as well as loans. Sufficient liquidity increases the flexibility and the ability*\n\n*An ongoing and consistent innovation process supports the strong market position*\n\n*The international growth is opening up new opportunities*\n\n*but also poses risks*\n\n*to take quick action*\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nInterest rate risk. Within the framework of project financing, the Group regularly agrees to variable interest rates that are tied to market interest rates (e.g. Euribor). In this context, there is an interest rate risk, which — where material — is hedged by suitable financial instruments.\n\nLiquidity risk. Sufficient financial resources have to be available for Kapsch TrafficCom to meet its payment obligations at all times. The availability of medium- and long-term financing is necessary for the implementation of large-scale projects, such as the implementation of a nationwide tolling system with an agreed delayed payment by a major client, and for the acquisition of companies. In addition, the execution of large projects regularly requires the provision of bank guarantees, some of which are extensive, as collateral for bid obligations (bid bonds) or to secure possible warranty claims (performance bonds).\n\nIn financing agreements, Kapsch TrafficCom is subject to the usual limitations of its business policy, such as with regard to taking on additional borrowings, the use of assets as collateral or the provision of guarantees and sureties in favor of third parties. The availability of financing and bank guarantees depends not only on market conditions but in particular on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. A lack of liquid assets (even if the Group is otherwise essentially solvent), of financing or of bank guarantees could in turn have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom. The Group continuously monitors compliance with all covenants in connection with loan agreements.\n\nLiquidity risk is counteracted by ongoing Group-wide cash flow planning. This enables potential liquidity bottlenecks to be identified at an early stage and appropriate countermeasures to be taken in time.\n\nCredit risk. Kapsch TrafficCom is exposed to the risk of non-payment by customers. The main customers of Kapsch TrafficCom are to a large extent state agencies, especially in connection with the implementation or operation of nation-wide or regional tolling and traffic management systems. Kapsch TrafficCom also acts as a subcontractor to third parties (for example concessionaires, general contractors, etc.) in public sector projects. The scope of a potential non-payment varies depending on the size of the order and can have a noticeable impact on the earnings situation in the case of individual large projects. The creditworthiness of new and existing customers is evaluated, and hedging is performed according to the assessment of the existing non-payment risk. In addition, Kapsch TrafficCom takes advantage of offers from public institutions, such as OeKB (Oesterreichische Kontrollbank), EKN (Exportkredit- namnden; Swedish National Export Credits Guarantee Board) and MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency), to hedge against the non-payment risk on the basis of guarantees. Moverover, there is a risk that counterparties of both original and derivative financial instruments (including financial institutions assumed to have good credit ratings) cannot meet their payment liabilities when due. A payment default or the need to impair receivables could have an extremely adverse impact on the net assets, financial position and earnings situation of Kapsch TrafficCom.\n\n## 2.2.5 Personnel risk.\n\nThe success of Kapsch TrafficCom depends to a significant extent on key personnel, in particular technical experts with many years of specific experience. In addition, the ability to recruit qualified employees with state-of-the-art technology knowledge, to integrate them into the Company and to retain them in the long term is of high importance for the success of the Group. The loss of important employees in key positions and difficulties in recruiting personnel can have a negative impact on the success of the Group.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom has been proactively implementing measures to counteract this risk for several years. These include, for example, an internal career and training platform that allows employees to advance their careers autonomously and away from approval processes. Attractive offers such as bonus systems or further training opportunities addi- tionally support these efforts. A periodic employee survey as well as an \"OpenLine2CEO\" to Georg Kapsch enable the management to identify current concerns, worries and wishes as well as the general mood and to respond appropriately.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.2.6 Legal risk.\n\nI A large number of regulations and legal requirements must be observed in connection with participation in public sector tenders, the establishment and operation of tolling and mobility solutions, acquisitions and cooperations as well as capital market issues. It may take a considerable administrative, technical and commercial effort to capture, enforce and monitor all compliance requirements. If applicable regulations or official requirements cannot be met, this can lead to severe penalties and also reduce the ability of (successfully) taking part in future tenders as well as restrict the continuation of the relevant business activity.\n\nThe expansion of business activities into new regions and into select new business fields tends to increase the risk of patent violations or the violation of intellectual property rights (IPR). This can result in financial damages from court actions. Kapsch TrafficCom attempts to counteract this risk as far as possible by performing an evaluation of possible IPR violations prior to entry into new markets or regions, for example. However, it is not possible to completely avoid this risk.\n\nChanges in the geopolitical situation, such as military conflicts, can lead to the legal framework becoming more complex as a result of sanctions and embargoes being imposed. In order to remain compliant with the respective requirements, Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the relevant regulations.\n\n## 2.2.7 Cyber-risk.\n\nAs a core process of ISO/IEC 27001, Kapsch TrafficCom has a uniform risk management process for information security that is integrated into corporate risk management. The structured approach to considering risks related to information security is derived from Kapsch TrafficCom's business processes and represents a holistic approach. The risk management process is implemented in all companies whose IT is fully integrated into the Group IT, regardless of whether they are formally certified in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 or not.\n\n## 2.2.8 Operational risks.\n\nKapsch TrafficCom's involvement in the realization of complex tolling and traffic management projects as well as in the production of components entails certain operational risks, including risks in the areas of health, safety, environment and quality (HSSEQ). In order to adequately mitigate these risks, Kapsch TrafficCom has developed internal processes that meet the requirements of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. In addition, aspects of ISO 9001 were integrated in order to meet quality management standards, and at individual locations also aspects of ISO 50001 in order to efficiently organize energy management and optimize energy consumption.\n\nLocal legal requirements sometimes exceed ISO standards, therefore Kapsch TrafficCom continuously monitors the legal requirements in the countries in which it operates. This ensures that the operational standards always comply with the strictest local regulations.\n\nThrough regular training and further education, Kapsch TrafficCom strengthens the awareness and skills of its employees with regard to HSSEQ topics. Furthermore, Kapsch TrafficCom utilizes ongoing audits and performance analyses to monitor and continuously improve compliance with these standards. This systematic approach not only helps to minimize risks, but also promotes sustainable corporate management and increases customer satisfaction.\n\n## 2.2.9 Opportunities.\n\nThe enterprise risk management approach of Kapsch TrafficCom not only addresses risks but also encompasses the regular identification, evaluation and management of opportunities. The goal of these efforts is to manage the strategic orientation of the product portfolio and market activities throughthe early identification of opportunities and to develop corresponding potential.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nMarket opportunities exist in geographic diversification as well as increasing expansion of the customer and product portfolios, driven in part by the following factors::\n\n- Opportunities arise from so-called change requests requests for changes from customers that only arise in the course of project execution. These change requests result in extensions to the contractual delivery components and are priced and paid for separately.\n- In addition, the increasing financing requirements of infrastructure projects and the growing need to relieve government budgets are creating opportunities both to open up new tolling markets in so-called emerging and developing countries and to expand activities in already developed markets.\n- The global rise in traffic volumes and the associated impact on the environment and society open up further opportu- nities in the area of mobility solutions, as, for example, toll collection, traffic management and demand management are increasingly being used as controlling instruments in environmental and traffic policy. In both segments, this creates opportunities to further develop and market the portfolio in line with the new requirements\n- Furthermore, demands with regard to increasing the productivity of vehicles and vehicle operations, as well as the rising comfort expectations of travelers, are opening up opportunities by expanding the functionalities of existing systems. This offers opportunities to acquire new customers or to serve both public-sector customers and end customers with new concepts. This particularly applies in the area of tolling services.\n\nOther opportunities. Continuous innovation, technical advancements and the acquisition of new technologies by means of corporate acquisitions create opportunities for Kapsch TrafficCom to improve efficiency and performance of customer systems and to gain a technological edge over competitors with regard to the performance and functionality of the offered systems.\n\n## 2.2.10 Overall assessment of the risk situation.\n\nFrom the current perspective, no risks have been identified that could endanger the continued operations of Kapsch TrafficCom. Due to the geographic diversification, the continuous expansion of the product and solution portfolio as well as the development of new business models through selected new ITS solutions, the business activities of Kapsch TrafficCom could be positioned more broadly without the need to step outside the core business area. The concentration of risk in individual regions and in individual large projects was thereby reduced.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.3 Internal control system with respect to the accounting process.\n\nAs in the previous year, the Group-wide uniform documentation of all controls for achieving the key controlling goals was advanced again in the financial year 2023/24. This aims to increase efficiency and at the same time reduce risk in the Group as well as to show alternative courses of action to management.\n\nThe basis of the processes for Group accounting and reporting is an accounting manual (IFRS Accounting Manual), that is issued and regularly updated by the Kapsch Group. In this manual, the essential accounting and reporting requirements based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are specified throughout the Group. Another important basis of the internal control system (ICS) are the Group guidelines, work instructions and process descriptions.\n\nCentral elements of the ICS are execution of the principle of dual control and the segregation of duties as well as defined actions for monitoring the effectiveness and efficiency of operating activities, the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with relevant legal regulations. In this regard, Kapsch TrafficCom acts based on international standards and best practices, such as COSO Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework.\n\nThe accounting of business transactions in Kapsch TrafficCom is managed by a variety of software solutions. In a number of countries, the accounting has been outsourced to local tax accountants due to the small size of the subsid- iaries. The individual companies submit reporting packages to the head office on a monthly basis containing all relevant accounting data pertaining to the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow accounting. This data is then entered into the central consolidation system OneStream on a monthly basis. The financial information is reviewed at Group level by Kapsch TrafficCom AG and forms the basis for interim reporting.\n\nThe Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board in regular meetings about the economic development in the form of consolidated presentations consisting of segment reporting, earnings development with budget and yearon-year comparison, forecasts, consolidated financial statements, personnel and order development as well as selected key financial figures.\n\nIn accordance with local requirements, responsibility for the implementation and monitoring of the internal control system lies with the relevant local management. The management of the individual subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and designing an internal control system in line with the requirements of the respective company with regard to the accounting process and for ensuring compliance with the Group-wide guidelines and regulations.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *3 Other disclosures.*\n\n## 3.1 Disclosures on capital, share, voting and control rights and related agreements.\n\nThe fully paid-in share capital of Kapsch TrafficCom AG amounts to EUR 14.3 million. It is divided into 14.3 million shares. There are no legal or statutory caps or restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or the transfer of shares. KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH held roughly 63.3% of the shares as of March 31, 2024. In connection with the refinancing, KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH pledged all of its shares in Kapsch TrafficCom AG in favor of the financing banks in financial year 2023/24. This also results in restrictions customary in the market with respect to the transfer of the shares and a corresponding requirement for the consent of these banks.\n\nKAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of DATAX HandelsgmbH, whose shares are held (partly indirectly, partly directly) in equal parts by Traditio-Privatstiftung and Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung, two private foundations under the Austrian Private Foundation Act. Each of these private foundations is managed by its own Executive Board, with no individual serving on both boards. The beneficiaries of these private foundations are Georg Kapsch and members of his family (Traditio-Privatstiftung) as well as Elisabeth Kapsch and members of her family (Children of Elisabeth-Privatstiftung).\n\nThere was no other shareholder holding more than 10% of the voting rights in Kapsch TrafficCom AG as of March 31, 2024. In the financial year 2023/24, Kapsch TrafficCom did not acquire or dispose of any treasury shares and did not hold any as of the balance sheet date.\n\nNo shares with special control rights exist. No restrictions exist with respect to the exercising of the voting right by employees with capital participation. There are no special provisions regarding the appointment and recall of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the modification of the articles of association.\n\nThe company currently has no conditional capital authorizing the Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares without (further) referral to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nConventional \"change of control\" clauses, which may lead to termination of the contract, relate to financing agreements, such as the promissory note bond (\"Schuldscheindarlehen\") and further financing, totaling about EUR 94 million, or are related to individual customer contracts.\n\nNo compensation agreements exist between Kapsch TrafficCom AG and its Executive Board and Supervisory Board Members or employees for the event of a public takeover offer.\n\n## 3.2 Corporate-Governance-Report.\n\nIn accordance with C-rule 61 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, it is pointed out that the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report can be accessed on the internet at https://www.kapsch.net/en/ir/Corporate-Governance.\n\nVienna, June 18, 2024\n\nGeorg Kapsch Chief Executive Officer\n\nAlfredo Escribá Gallego Executive Board member\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.*\n\n## *Primaries.*\n\n## Balance sheet as at March31, 2024.\n\n| in EUR                                                                                          | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| ASSETS                                                                                          |                |                |\n| A.

General principles.\n\nThe financial statements as at March 31, 2024 have been prepared in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the UGB (Austrian Company Code) as amended.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the previous form of presentation has been maintained.\n\nThe financial statements, prepared under Austrian generally accepted accounting principles, present a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, the financial situation of the Company, as well as its results of operations.\n\nAccounting and valuation methods are based on generally accepted accounting principles. Section 201 para. 2 UGB was adhered to, as were the provisions on classification and valuation of balance sheet and income statement items under sections 195 to 211 and 222 to 235 UGB. The income statement was prepared in accordance with the total expenditure format.\n\nThe principle of completeness was observed in preparing the financial statements. With regard to the valuation, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern was assumed.\n\nThe principle of individual valuation was applied in the valuation of assets and liabilities\n\nTaking into account the principle of prudence, the Company only reported the profits realized as of the balance sheet date. All identifiable risks and impending losses occurred until the balance sheet date were taken into account.\n\nEstimates are based on prudent assessment. If statistical experience exists for similar circumstances, it was taken into account by the Company in its estimates\n\nFighting in Ukraine. The global economy recovered quickly from the effects of the conflict in Ukraine. To date, there has been no significant impact on the risk situation.\n\n## B. Group relations.\n\nThe Company is a 63.291% subsidiary of KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, and thus is related to its shareholder and its affiliated companies as a group company.\n\nDATAX HandelsgmbH, Vienna, prepares the consolidated financial statements for the largest group of companies. These consolidated financial statements are deposited at the Commercial Court Vienna.\n\nThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements for the smallest group of companies.\n\nWith regard to the disclosure on the legal and economic relations with affiliated companies, the protection-of-interest clause pursuant to section 242 UGB was used\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n## C. Accounting and valuation methods.\n\nThe previously applied accounting and valuation methods have been maintained\n\n## 1. Fixed assets.\n\nPurchased intangible assets and tangible assets are valued at acquisition cost less scheduled straight-line amortization/depreciation charged according to the estimated useful life of the assets\n\nLow-value fixed assets with individual acquisition costs of up to EUR 1,000.00 (previous year EUR 800.00) were fully written off in the year of acquisition or production\n\n## 1.1 Intangible assets.\n\nAcquired IT software is amortized based on a useful life of between four and eight years.\n\nIn the reporting year, intangible assets in the amount of EUR 0.00 (prior year: EUR 0k) were acquired from affiliated companies\n\n## 1.2 Tangible assets.\n\nTangible assets were depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following useful lives:\n\n|                                               | Years |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Investments in leasehold buildings            | 2-12  |\n| Technical equipment and machinery             | 2-5   |\n| Other equipment, factory and office equipment | 2-15  |\n\nNo write-downs were charged in the financial year.\n\nAdditions to fixed assets are depreciated according to the date of their initial use\n\n## 1.3 Financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets are stated at acquisition costs or the lower market values at the balance sheet date. Write-downs/ write-ups are made only in case a diminution/increase in value is expected to be permanent.\n\n## Write-ups of fixed assets.\n\nWrite-ups of fixed assets are made when the reasons for the extraordinary depreciation no longer apply. The write-up is made up to a maximum of the net book value, which results taking into account the normal depreciation that would have had to be made in the meantime.\n\n## 2. Current assets.\n\n## 2.1 Inventories.\n\nThe stocks of purchased goods, recorded by means of electronic data processing, were stated using the moving average price method. Inventories denominated in foreign currencies were stated using the exchange rate at the date of acquisition. Where required, write-downs were made to the lower replacement costs. A proportional deduction from acquisition or production cost was made for goods with diminished usability or marketability, which was derived from the respective inventory turnover ratio.\n\nServices not yet invoiced were stated at acquisition or production cost which include direct costs as well as proportionate material and production overheads.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn case of long-term contracts, no administrative and selling overheads were capitalized, directly attributable finance cost was capitalized depending on the project. At the balance sheet date, there are no services not yet invoiced for which finance cost was capitalized. Expenses for social benefits were not included. To provide for losses from pending transactions arising from the projects, the asset affected is written off or provisions are set up.\n\n## 2.2 Receivables and other assets.\n\nReceivables and other assets were stated at nominal values. Identifiable risks were considered in the valuation of the individual receivables by write-downs. Non-interest-bearing receivables or receivables bearing particularly low interest were discounted.\n\nReceivables in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the original transaction or the lower bank buying rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.3 Cash on hand, cash at banks.\n\nCash on hand and cash at banks denominated in foreign currencies are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the original transaction or the lower rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 3. Prepaid expenses and deferred charges.\n\nPrepaid expenses include payments effected before the balance sheet date as far as they relate to expenses for a specific time after the balance sheet date\n\n## 4. Deferred tax assets.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized on differences between the valuation according to company law and the valuation according to tax law with respect to assets, accruals and provisions, accounts payable, prepaid expenses and deferred charges as well as deferred income which are expected to decrease in later financial years.\n\nSince the financial year 2021/2022, the option to recognise deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards (internal loss carryforwards that are kept evident within the framework of group management and offset against future positive tax results) has been used\n\nDeferred tax assets for existing tax loss carryforwards are created to the extent that there are sufficient deferred tax liabilities or there are convincing, substantial indications that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilize these loss carryforwards in the future (planning horizon of six years, whereby the Group applies appropriate discounts in later planning periods due to greater uncertainty in the utilization of the loss carryforwards).\n\nDeferred taxes are valued using a tax rate of 23% for all differences (previous year: 23% for temporary differences that are eliminated in the following financial year and 23% for the other temporary differences and loss carryforwards) without taking discounting into account.\n\nDeferred tax assets were offset against deferred tax liabilities because it is legally possible to offset the actual tax refund claims against the actual tax liabilities.\n\n## 5. Accruals and provisions.\n\nThe accruals and provisions were set up in accordance with the principle of prudence at the estimated amounts.\n\nThe accruals for severance payments and the provisions for anniversary bonuses were calculated as stated in the AFRAC (Austrian Financial Reporting and Auditing Committee) opinion 27 \"Accruals for pensions and severance payments, provisions for anniversary bonuses and comparable obligations falling due in the long term under the provisions of the Austrian Company Code\" (June 2022, available in German only) pursuant to accepted actuarial methods in accordance with IAS 19 using the projected unit credit method.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nA discount rate of 3,55% (prior year: 4.0%) was used for the calculation of the provisions for anniversary bonuses and a discount rate of 3.50% (prior year: 3.95%) for the calculation of accruals for severance payments. A rate of 3.0% (prior year: 3,0%) was assumed for salary increases. Furthermore, the calculation was based on the earliest possible retirement age in accordance with the transitional statutory provisions and the mortality tables AVÖ 2018-P ANG for salaried employees. Staff turnover rates were determined based on the period of service.\n\nThe interest rate used is the interest rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nAll changes in personnel-related accruals and provisions (including interest expense) were recorded entirely in personnel expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of prudence, other accruals and provisions take into account all risks identifiable at the time the balance sheet was prepared and all liabilities uncertain as to their amounts or bases. Other accruals and provisions were stated at the best possible estimate of the settlement amount\n\n## 6. Accounts payable.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of prudence, accounts payable were valued at the settlement amount.\n\nPayables in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the original transaction or the higher bank selling rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\nExchange gains or losses from foreign currency valuation are recorded entirely in the operating result (other operating income or other operating expense)\n\n## D.

Moreover in a separate contract the Group company MTS Maut & Telematik Services GmbH (MTS), Germany, had been awarded the contract for the \"automatic control of the passenger vehicle toll\".\n\nOn June 18, 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled contrary to expectations that the passenger vehicle toll in its planned form, where in Germany accredited vehicles receive a tax relief simultaneously, violates the principles of the European Union. The customer terminated on the following day the contracts for the implementation and operation of the passenger vehicle toll effective September 30, 2019.\n\nThe operating parties of the terminated contract for the project \"Toll collection\" are Kapsch TrafficCom, CTS EVEN-TIM and autoTicket. In December 2019, they jointly asserted claims in the amount of around EUR 560,000 k against the Federal Republic of Germany. The responsible minister is disputing this claim. This matter was therefore need to be resolved before an arbitration tribunal.\n\nIn March 2022 Kapsch TrafficCom received an interim arbitration award which affirms a claim for compensation of autoTicket against the Federal Republic of Germany on the merits. Consequently, in July 2023, an arbitration decision was reached with mutually agreed terms, compelling the Federal Republic of Germany to make a payment of TEUR 243,000. The developments described led to an increase in sales revenue of EUR 66.3 million and a significantly improved net cash flow from operating activities of EUR 68.3 million.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Derivative financial instruments.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, derivative financial instruments break down as follows and are included in the following balance sheet items\n\n| Figures as of March 31, 2023   | Nominal amount | Number | Fair value 1) | Book value | Balance sheet item |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------|---------------|------------|--------------------|\n| Type of financial instrument   |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| Interest rate-related products |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| Interest rate swap (05/2025)   |                | 1      | 715,964.73    | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate swap (05/2025)   |                | 1      | -62,498.60    | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate swap (09/2027)   |                | 1      | 1,262,883.11  | 0.00       | n/a                |\n\n1) A positive amount in this column refers to a positive fair value, a negative amount to a negative fair value.\n\n| Figures as of March 31, 2023   | Nominal amount | Number | Fair value 1) | Book value | Balance sheet item |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|--------|---------------|------------|--------------------|\n| Type of financial instrument   |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| FX Rate Swap                   |                | 1      | 240,308.77    | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate-related products |                |        |               |            |                    |\n| Interest rate swap (12/2026)   | EUR 20,000,000 | 1      | 1,418,479.49  | 0.00       | n/a                |\n| Interest rate swap (09/2027)   | EUR 25,000,000 | 1      | 2,055,612.57  | 0.00       | n/a                |\n\n1) A positive amount in this column refers to a positive fair value, a negative amount to a negative fair value.\n\nThe fair value corresponds to the market value.\n\n## E.

Report on the Financial Statements.*\n\n## Audit Opinion.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, which comprise the balance sheet as at March 31, 2024, the income statement for the financial year then ended and the notes.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements comply with legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2024, and of its financial performance for the financial year then ended in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\n## Basis for Opinion.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 (hereinafter EU Regulation) and Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing. Those standards require the application of the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of the auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n## Key Audit Matters.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe have structured key audit matters as follows:\n\n- Description\n- Audit approach and key observations\n- Reference to related disclosures\n\n## 1 Valuation oh shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as loans to and loan receivables from affiliated companies and participating interests.\n\n## Description.\n\nAs a holding company, Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, holds material shares in affiliated companies (book values in the amount of EUR 138,442k) and participating interests (book values in the amount of EUR 2,556k) as at March 31, 2024. Moreover, loans in the amount of\n\nEUR 58,214k as well as loan receivables from affiliated companies in the amount of EUR 17,394k and from participating interests in the amount of EUR 0k exist.\n\nPursuant to section 204 para. 2 UGB, shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as loans are to be written down in case a diminution in value occurs that is expected to be permanent. Pursuant to section 207 UGB, the strict lower of cost or market principle is to be taken into account for current assets (loan receivables). Write-ups are made if the reasons for the write-down no longer apply, however they are capped at acquisition cost.\n\nIn the financial year 2023/24, write-downs on the shares in affiliated companies in the amount of EUR 6,327k were made based on the tests for write-downs (thereof EUR 1,930k on Kapsch TraffiCom S.A.S, Colombia, and EUR 4,154k on Kapsch Telematic Service GmbH (KTS), Austria). In the financial year under review, for the participating interest in Auto Ticket GmbH, a distribution-related write-down on the book value under tax on equity attributable to Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, was made in the amount of EUR 25,710k. The book value of the participating interest after the write-down amounts to EUR 2,556k. The Traffic Technology Services Inc., USA was sold during the fiscal year, resulting in loss amounting to TEUR 3.215.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the expected business development, in the financial year 2023/24, write-downs on loan receivables from affiliated companies were made in the amount of EUR 4,006k. These write-downs relate in the amount of EUR 3,574k to Kapsch TrafficCom Services USA and in the amount of EUR 432k to Intelligent Mobility Solutions. No write-downs on loan receivables from participating interests were made.\n\nNo requirement for value adjustment of the book value of loans to affiliated companies has been identified.\n\nManagement believes that no further diminutions in value or reversals of write-downs (up to a maximum of the amount of acquisition cost) apply to shares in affiliated companies, participating interests as well as loans to and loan receivables from affiliated companies and participating interests as at March 31, 2024 and that, consequently, no further write-downs or write-ups are required.\n\nValuation of shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as in loans and loan receivables requires management to make material estimates on future market developments and the probability of the subsidiaries winning contracts in the planning period. This is particularly true for implementation projects with regard to tolling systems in the Tolling segment, where the order inflow is very volatile and contracts are usually awarded based on invitations to tender, which usually is associated with certain uncertainties. Moreover, there is a significant area of judgement involved in the valuation, in particular with regard to the discount rate and the long-term growth rate. With regard to the financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of shares in affiliated companies and participating interests due to these estimation uncertainties and it was therefore identified as key audit matter. The valuation of loans is also subject to significant management estimates. These estimates relate to the future prospects of the subsidiaries and their ability to repay the outstanding loans. Due to this uncertainty, there is a risk of overstatement of loans and loan receivables in the financial statements, which is why they were also identified as a key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe assessed management's approach to the valuation of shares in affiliated companies and loans to affiliated companies to determine whether it appropriately identifies a potential need for diminutions in value.\n\nWe first gained an understanding of the valuation model itself and the key value drivers of the current values.\n\nWith the partial involvement of our internal valuation experts, we examined whether the selected valuation method complies with recognized valuation principles and analyzed and critically assessed the main drivers for future development (such as net sales, expenses, project planning, investments, changes in working capital) as well as the main risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them with management. The assumptions regarding the discount rate and the growth rate were checked by means of external market and industry data, and the calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy. In addition, we have checked if the corresponding loan receivables have been adjusted in value.\n\nThe valuation models used by the Company are suitable to assess the valuation of the shares in affiliated companies and the participating interests as well as the loans and loan receivables. The assumptions and valuation parameters used in the valuation are reasonable.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nFor further information, reference is made to the notes to the financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, Section D. Comments on items in the balance sheet \"Shares in affiliated companies and participating interests as well as loans to affiliated companies\" and \"Current assets, Receivables\".\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2 Estimates and assumptions regarding net sales, services not yet invoiced and project-related accruals in the accounting of inventories.\n\n## Description.\n\nServices not yet invoiced as at March 31, 2024 amount to EUR 2,645k, project-related accruals including accruals for impending losses amount to EUR 6,168k. Implementation projects, in particular, require an ongoing assessment and update of the contract costs and the risks from fulfilling the contracts which may result from technical and time delays, supply chain bottlenecks or other external framework conditions and influence the project margin. Furthermore, damages or contractual penalties can arise from these contracts which have to be considered in the project valuation and require a risk assessment. The major projects of the Company usually are technologically complex individual contracts with specific terms of contract and therefore have to be assessed individually with regard to revenue recognition and project risks.\n\nDue to the material impact of the major projects, in particular during the construction phase, on the Company's financial position and financial performance and the considerable estimates involved in the accounting for these contracts, there is the risk that the project revenue, the result and the related services not yet invoiced and project-related accruals contain a material misstatement, and this was therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWithin the framework of our risk-based audit approach, we gained an understanding of the processes and internal controls relevant for the accounting of construction contracts and tested the effectiveness of selected internal controls. This mainly referred to internal controls in connection with the approval of order calculation upon the conclusion of new contracts as well as approval of the ongoing recalculation. In the course of our detailed audit procedures, we requested the project valuations for random samples of projects and reperformed the calculation of the accruals/deferrals and accruals for those projects based on plan revenue and costs as well as the costs incurred up until the balance sheet date. We looked at project requests, customer contracts, Supervisory Board minutes, the project budgeting tool as well as detailed cost estimates and held discussions with the project managers and the management team regarding the status of the project, project risks and planning assumptions. In assessing the appropriateness of the estimates, a particular focus was on the review of the regular update of plan assumptions, in particular on the planned cost to complete and the planned project margin. In order to assess the accuracy of the estimates, we requested and checked the purchase orders and contracts for both actual and planned revenue.\n\nThe valuation methods used and the underlying assumptions in the valuation of the project are reasonable and comply with the provisions of the UGB.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nFor further information, reference is made to the notes to the financial statements of Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, Section C. Accounting and valuation methods \"2.1. Inventories\" and \"5. Accruals and provisions\" as well as Section D. Comments on items in the balance sheet under \"Accruals and provisions\".\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3 Recognition of deferred tax assets.\n\n## Description.\n\nIn the financial statements, deferred tax assets in the amount of EUR 22.502k (prior year: EUR 27,323k) are reported which are mainly attributable to internal loss carry-forwards from the tax group. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets up to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences as well as unused tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In the case of a history of losses, capitalization only occurs to the extent that there is convincing substantial evidence that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future. The planning horizon in this context is six years.\n\nThe recognition of deferred taxes requires management to make significant estimates as regards future market and business development within the planning horizon, which is usually subject to a degree of uncertainty. With regard to the financial statements, there is a risk of an overstatement of deferred tax assets due to these estimation uncertainties, and they were therefore identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nWe examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are plausible and transparent, and we analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (revenue growth, earnings margin, investment planning). Furthermore, we analyzed and critically assessed the adjustments to the tax planning result. The calculation model was tested for mathematical accuracy and the tax rates used were reconciled with external sources. We evaluated in particular whether there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax loss carryforwards can be utilized. Further, we evaluated whether the disclosures on deferred taxes provided in the notes are appropriate.\n\nThe model used by the Company is suitable to recognize deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of the UGB. The assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable. The disclosures in the notes required by UGB are complete.\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Company's disclosures on the recognition of deferred taxes are included in Section C. Accounting and valuation methods under \"Deferred tax assets\" as well as Section D. Comments on items in the balance sheet under \"Deferred tax assets\".\n\n## 4 Restructuring of financing.\n\n## Description.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, bank loans and overdrafts in the amount of EUR 60,886k (prior year: EUR 113,981k) exist, thereof, no liabilities with a remaining maturity of less than one year exist (prior year: EUR 69,881k). In addition, promissory note loans in the amount of EUR 8,510k (prior year: EUR 31,508k) exist, thereof EUR 9k (prior year: EUR 23,007k) short-term.\n\nIn the previous financial year 2022/23, the adverse business development, particularly with regard to profitability and the associated liquidity and debt, has led management to prepare a comprehensive restructuring concept with the help of an external advisor, which includes measures to improve profitability and reduce working capital, but is also intended to create a basis for sustainable future growth. This restructuring concept also forms the basis for the refinancing agreement concluded by Kapsch TrafficCom AG, Vienna, with its main financial creditors on May 31, 2023, which was concluded until May 25, 2025, in which a comprehensive refinancing of current financial liabilities (including the promissory note bonds) was agreed. Existing financing in the amount of EUR 106.3 million was extended until May 25, 2025, and new financing was concluded by this date. This includes a refinancing agreement of 50% of the promissory note bond in the amount of EUR 11.5 million that has matured in mid-June 2023 and the provision of EUR 4.25 million as an additional operating loan by a promissory note creditor. In this context, the Company has agreed to make early repayments from surplus cash and cash equivalents (cash sweep), from extraordinary inflows and from pending proceedings, and to not distribute any dividends. In the course of the refinancing, additional customary covenants and conditions were agreed with the financial creditors, compliance with which will be closely monitored and reported on by the external advisors in the future. The main shareholder KAPSCH-Group Beteiligungs GmbH, Vienna, pledged all its shares held in the Company (around 63.6% of the share capital) as collateral. The Company also undertook to utilize the entire existing authorized capital to the extent of 10% of the share capital.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024 to the restructuring agreement, the maturity of the non-current loans was extended to March 31, 2026 with the condition that EUR 4 million must be repaid early on a quarterly basis from December 31, 2024.\n\nThe measures for ensuring sufficient liquidity implemented by management in the prior years were continued in the financial year 2023/24.\n\nDue to the material impact of the refinancing on the assets and liabilities and financial situation as well as the going concern assumption of the Group, this was identified as key audit matter.\n\n## Audit approach and key observations.\n\nThe refinancing from the previous year, which was concluded on May 31, 2023, was revalued by the management. We first gained an understanding of the calculation and whether a significant contract adjustment in accordance with AFRAC 14 has been made. The model for the calculation was evaluated and the cash flows analyzed. These were compared using detailed documentation on the loan agreements and interest payments in order to verify the underlying values of the model. The present values of the original cash flows were compared with the present values of the adjusted cash flows and it was checked whether this is a significant contract adjustment – considering qualitative and quantitative aspects. The result was that no significant contract adjustment has been made and the difference is recognized in the income statement.\n\nWe checked the agreements dated May 31, 2023 as well as the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, on refinancing and assessed the resulting impact on the assets and liabilities, financial situation and results of operations as well as the going concern assumption of the Company and assessed the related disclosures made by the Executive Board in the consolidated financial statements. In this process, we first gained an understanding of the planning process and model. We examined whether the assumptions used in the future cash flows are in line with the plan included in the restructuring concept prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board. We analyzed and critically assessed the essential drivers for future development (such as revenue and cost planning, changes in working capital as well as liquidity planning) as well as the essential risks for possible deviations from the planning assumptions and discussed them in meetings with the management. We interviewed the management on the status of the implementation of the measures.\n\nFurthermore, on the basis of the planning calculations, we assessed whether the Company will be able to fulfil the future repayment obligation included in the supplementary agreement.\n\nMoreover, we assessed the management's measures implemented to ensure sufficient liquidity and checked whether the monitoring implemented by management in this regard (daily monitoring of the group-wide liquidity portfolio and weekly 12-weeks cash flow forecasts) continue to be performed.\n\nBased on the information we have collected and as agreed in the refinancing agreement dated May 31, 2023 and in the supplementary agreement dated May 31, 2024, regular monitoring and external reporting will be carried out by the external advisor to ensure ongoing and appropriate monitoring of liquidity and compliance with the intended implementation of the measures from the restructuring concept.\n\nThe application of the accounting method based on the going concern assumption is appropriate\n\n## Reference to related disclosures.\n\nThe Company's disclosures on refinancing are included in the notes under \"Subsequent events\" under Section F. \"Other disclosures\".\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Other Information.\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements, the management report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Financial Statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU Regulation and with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU Regulation and with Austrian Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n## We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risks of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, on measures taken to eliminate identified threats or on applied safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements.\n\n## Comments on the Management Report for the Company.\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the financial statements and as to whether the management report was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian standards on auditing for the audit of the management report.\n\n## Opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Company was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations, comprising the details in accordance with section 243a UGB, and is consistent with the financial statements.\n\n## Statement.\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the financial statements and due to the obtained understanding concerning the Company and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report came to our attention.\n\n## Additional Information in Accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation.\n\nWe were elected as statutory auditor at the ordinary general meeting dated September 6, 2023.
