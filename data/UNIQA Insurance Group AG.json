It explains the concepts and measures in place as well as specific targets and impacts.\n\nThe following topics in particular are of material importance in terms of environmental matters: commitment to climate action, commitment to European climate targets, and advice on and prevention of natural disasters. We are tackling these challenges by supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy through our investments and insurance products. It is also our aim to structure our own operational management in an exemplary fashion, taking our environmental and social targets into account.\n\n#### **UNIQA climate strategy**\n\nWe took our first major step towards implementing our own climate strategy in early 2019, when we approved UNIQA's decarbonisation policy to phase out coal in our investments and underwriting. To pursue more general climate targets, we acceded to the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) in 2021 and the Green Finance Alliance in 2022, committing ourselves to more binding targets. One major success in 2023 was the validation of our interim targets for 2030 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), both for our investment portfolio and for our own operational management.\n\nThe key objectives in UNIQA's climate strategy are as follows:\n\n- Pursuit of climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement in investments and underwriting, and operational ecology in compliance with both EU climate change mitigation and climate change adaption targets\n- Net-zero emissions in our business model by 2040 in Austria, and by 2050 throughout the entire Group\n- Pursuit of and compliance with science-based interim targets for 2025, 2030 and 2035 based on climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement\n- Increase in sustainable investments to more than €2 billion by 2025\n- Prevention of any negative impact on other EU environmental targets\n- Compliance with minimum social standards\n\nWe define net-zero emissions as (a) the reduction of our scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions to zero at best or to a residual level that is compatible with achieving net-zero emissions at global or sectoral level in corresponding scenarios or sector paths within the framework of the 1.5 degrees Celsius target; and (b) the neutralisation of all residual emissions to the net-zero target year and all greenhouse gas emissions subsequently released into the atmosphere.\n\n# Validation of our climate targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n\nOur interim targets to reduce CO2 in our investments and own operational management by 2030 have been successfully reviewed and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) since December 2023. The initiative defines and promotes targets based on scientific findings and independently verifies these targets set by companies. These science based 1.5 degrees Celsius targets are based on a simple principle: they focus on the amount of emissions that must be reduced in order to achieve the central aim of the Paris Agreement – to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In line with the SBTi framework, we have set interim targets for our investment portfolio for 2030 in four areas, which account for 23 per cent of our total investment volume. We are focusing on project financing and corporate loans for power generation, other long-term corporate loans, and listed stocks and corporate bonds. We will implement our Science Based Targets by 2030 with our commitment activities and decarbonisation target trajectory. The UNIQA Group has also set itself SBTi interim targets for our operational management. We are specifically committed to reducing our direct Scope 1 and indirect Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42 per cent by 2030 compared to the baseline year 2021.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Environmental matters in investment**\n\nIn our investment strategy, we are guided by the principles of sustainability, commit ourselves to the climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement to achieve net-zero emissions across the Group by 2050, and actively promote decarbonisation as a company and investor. By focusing the analysis of our portfolio on CO2, we identify climate risks and opportunities at an early stage and can assess how ready our issuers are for the transformation in line with the Paris Agreement. Failure to comply with ESG criteria in our investment decisions not only has a negative impact on the environment and society, but also carries the risk of reputational damage. Targeted sustainable investments contribute to financing the transformation, reduce our exposure to ESG risks and increase sustainability-related opportunities. We engage in intensive dialogue with companies and asset managers to fulfil our role as an investor.\n\n#### Decarbonisation strategy\n\nAs part of our membership in the United Nations Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) and the Austrian Green Finance Alliance (GFA), we are committed to the gradual decarbonisation of our portfolio in order to be optimally aligned with the climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement and achieve net-zero emissions for our investments throughout the Group by 2050.\n\nThis year's successful validation of our interim climate targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) rounds off our sustainability strategy for investments. By 2030, we aim to gradually transform our portfolio and reduce our Scope 3 emissions, which are largely generated in Scope 3.15 (Investments) by our investments. We also encourage our investors to set science-based climate targets themselves. By working with our specialist data provider ISS (Institutional Shareholder Services), we are able to carry out a detailed analysis of our investments in relation to various sustainability factors.\n\nThese data on our investees are necessary, among other things, to ensure our exclusion or phase-out strategy, which provides for the following limitations:\n\n#### **Coal**\n\n- First coal exclusion criteria from 2019\n- No new direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the coal business from 2024\n- Phase-out of existing direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the coal business by 2030\n- New investment products offered will only be coal-free\n\n#### **Oil**\n\n- Orderly withdrawal from oil by 2030\n- No new direct investments in the expansion of oil infrastructure projects from 2025\n- No new direct investments in companies with more than 30 per cent of their revenue from the oil sector from 2025\n- Divestment of direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the oil business by 2030\n\n#### **Natural gas**\n\n- Orderly withdrawal from natural gas by 2035\n- No new direct investments in the expansion of natural gas infrastructure projects from 2026\n- No new direct investments in companies with more than 30 per cent of their revenue from the natural gas sector from 2026\n- Divestment of direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the natural gas business by 2035\n- If a company has SBTi-validated targets, carries out EU taxonomy-aligned activities or publicly commits to the Paris Agreement, an exception can be made for our limits.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Nuclear energy**\n\n- No new direct investments in the expansion of nuclear infrastructure projects from 2025\n- Divestment of investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from nuclear energy by 2035\n- If a company has SBTi-validated targets, carries out EU taxonomy-aligned activities or publicly commits to the Paris Agreement, an exception can be made for our limits.\n\n#### Carbon emission intensity\n\nOur decarbonisation target trajectory focuses on individual issuers whose greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the weighted average carbon emission intensity (WACI). This key indicator is calculated for companies as the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions relative to the company's revenue, weighted by our investment volume. We are also observing Scope 3 emissions, but are not currently including them in the key indicator. Once we have meaningful reports on corporate Scope 3 emissions, we plan to take them into account.\n\nWe use the values for 2021 as the baseline to measure our activities and targets. On this basis, the UNIQA portfolio's WACI has fallen by 29 per cent from 2021 to 2023 and by 27 per cent since the previous year. This shows the improvement in the efficiency of the companies in which we are invested, with regard to their Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in relation to their revenue. As such, we have reached our emissions reduction target of 15 per cent compared to 2021, which was set for the beginning of 2025, a year earlier. The decrease from 2022 to 2023 is mainly due to the reduction in the emission intensity of our existing investments.\n\n|                                                                                      | 2021<br>(baseline year) | 2022 | 2023 | 2025<br>(target) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------|------|------------------|\n| Weighted average carbon emission intensity<br>[Scope 1 & 2 t CO₂e/€ million revenue] | 99                      | 96   | 701) | 84               |\n\n1) The Executive Board's remuneration for 2023 was linked, among other things, to the WACI key indicator.\n\n#### Carbon Risk Rating\n\nThe Carbon Risk Rating is an overall assessment of companies and countries on a scale of 0 to 100 for climate risk management, determined by ISS. A higher rating indicates improved carbon management. For companies, the assessment is based on more than 100 industry-specific indicators that classify the carbon risk at industry and subsector level. For states, the rating assesses the government's effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate risks. The rating is weighted by investment volume. In 2023, our rating improved by 4 per cent compared with 2022, partly due to our investment decisions and partly due to an improvement in internal risk management at the companies we invested in.\n\n## ESG performance score\n\nThe ESG performance score monitors the ESG profile of our investments and ranges from 0 to 100, with over 50 considered \"Prime\" and showing above average ESG performance. The score is composed of industry-specific and cross-industry indicators with different weighting depending on the industry. The topics cover dealing with suppliers, the standard of corporate governance in the company as well as environmental aspects. The score is weighted by investment volume. Our ESG performance score remained relatively stable at the ISS Prime level of 51.6 in 2023 compared with 2022.\n\n|                       | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|\n| ESG performance score | 51.3 | 51.6 |\n\n|                    | 2022 | 2023 |\n|--------------------|------|------|\n| Carbon Risk Rating | 50.2 | 52.4 |\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Absolute financed emissions\n\nAbsolute financed emissions provide an indication of the carbon emissions that we finance through our investments in companies and countries. The indicator is calculated by multiplying our holding in a company by its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We obtain this data from ISS. UNIQA's financed emissions increased by 7 per cent compared with 2022, but are still 21 per cent below their 2021 level. In 2023, the share of companies that have set themselves SBTi emission reduction targets in the total emissions financed by UNIQA increased to 31 per cent (compared with 24 per cent in 2022). For this reason, we expect a future reduction in our corporate portfolio's financed emissions.\n\n**2022 2023** Financed emissions from corporate investments* [t CO2 e] 383,746 409,714 Share of financed corporate investment emissions with targets approved by SBTi* 24% 31%2)\n\n* The coverage of financed emissions from our investments in listed companies, corporate bonds (excluding collateralised debt) and corporate loans was 77 per cent for 2023.\n\nIn line with our NZAOA membership, we started monitoring other country-specific issues for government bonds in 2023 using the PCAF methodology3). The monitoring is to be used in future for NZAOA reporting and a key indicator is to be derived as a basis for future targets. We are reporting for the first time on the absolute emissions financed from government bonds for 2023.\n\n|                                             | Volume<br>invested<br>(EUR) | Carbon<br>emissions 2023<br>(Scope 1)<br>[t CO₂e]4) |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Financed emissions from<br>government bonds | 6,029,700,423               | 2,088,428                                           |\n\nThe coverage of the total financed emissions from our investments in listed companies, corporate bonds (excluding collateralised debt), corporate loans and government bonds was 47 per cent for 2023. In the near future, we plan to increase this coverage by engaging in other asset classes.\n\n2) The Executive Board's remuneration for 2023 was linked, among other things, to the SBTi percentage.\n\n- 3) PCAF methodology: (investment position in government bonds (EUR)/GDP adjusted for purchasing power (EUR) * country's Scope 1 production emissions [t CO₂e])\n4) The data are taken from the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) database. The data cover 100 per cent of direct investments in government bonds.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 2023 reporting year, we continued to pursue our goal of zero violations with respect to legal regulations. Despite our legal initiatives and compliance measures, there were four cases of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the reporting year that resulted in monetary penalties totalling €276,700 (2022: €19,572). In the 2023 reporting year, €445,778 in fines were also paid for two violations of laws and regulations from previous years (of which €395,778 in Hungary and €50,000 in Serbia). In the course of the reporting year, a total of nine proceedings were brought due to significant violations of applicable laws and regulations, against which appeals were lodged during the reporting period. Fines were imposed in six of these cases and non-monetary sanctions were imposed in three cases.\n\nIn contrast, as in the previous year, no confirmed breaches of anti-corruption or money laundering legislation were recorded in the 2023 reporting year. In 2022, there were proceedings due to anti-competitive behaviour, cartel and monopoly practices. In the course of settlement talks, the UNIQA Group was obliged to pay €422,330; this fine was the lowest of all the insurance companies investigated by the competition authority. There were no further legal proceedings due to anti-competitive behaviour, cartels or monopolies in 2023.\n\nIn the reporting year as in the previous year, no violations of regulations resulting in fines or sanctions or of voluntary codes of conduct were identified in connection with product and service information and labelling. In contrast to the previous year, in which one incident occurred that resulted in a warning, a total of eight incidents were registered in the reporting year, each of which resulted in a warning.\n\nIn the reporting year, the anti-corruption regulations were communicated to all members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board of the UNIQA Group, as well as to employees of UNIQA Austria. The e-learning training course on the Code of Conduct was successfully completed by 66.6 per cent of the nine members of the UNIQA Group Management Board and 88.3 per cent of UNIQA Austria employees overall. For members of the UNIQA Group Supervisory Board, the training focus in 2023 was on money laundering prevention and issuer compliance. In 2024, members of the UNIQA Group Supervisory Board will focus on anti-corruption training. In the international insurance companies18), 95.3 per cent of members of the management bodies and 76.6 per cent of employees took part in anti-corruption training.\n\nIn 2023, the EU Whistleblower Directive was transposed into several national laws. Since 2018, the UNIQA Group has had a portal where information on non-compliance in the UNIQA Group's insurance companies can be submitted. The portal was updated in 2023 and expanded to include non-insurance companies. Information can be submitted by UNIQA employees, but also by external persons, which goes beyond the legal obligation. This is of course also anonymous.\n\n| Topic   | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                               | 2024 targets                                                                                  |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reports | Implementation of the EU Whistleblower Directive in those<br>insurance and non-insurance companies that are covered<br>by the relevant local regulations | Reports and documentation of conflicts of interest are<br>reviewed and, if necessary, amended |\n\n<sup>18)</sup> The key figures include data from the following countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and Ukraine.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Disclosures according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation**\n\n# **Premiums in non-life insurance and taxonomyeligible activities**\n\n# Discretionary judgements and interpretation requirements\n\nIn view of the interpretations by the European Commission only at the end of December 2023 and the first application of the new provisions on taxonomy alignment, current market practice shows that not all details are sufficiently specified and that a common understanding and uniform application in the market need to be developed in order to achieve consistency and comparability.\n\n#### Reporting principles\n\nUnder the Taxonomy Regulation, insurance companies are required to disclose an indicator in relation to their non-life insurance business. European legislators have therefore defined certain business lines of non-life insurance that are considered environmentally sustainable in relation to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation.\n\nIn non-life insurance, we carried out detailed research, according to the regulations from Annex X to the Delegated Regulation (2021/2178), on approximately 40 non-life insurance lines with respect to all premium elements, based on the premiums written, separated by direct and indirect business and before and after any reinsurance. Underwriting specialists analysed the content of insured benefits and scope of cover to establish whether they were adapted to the impacts of climate change. As a result of different cover being issued in places, the private customer business and industrial/commercial business were analysed separately and classified in relation to the insurance activity's taxonomy eligibility and conformity. The proportion of premiums in the analysed non-life insurance lines were then combined into the categories as defined in the Delegated Regulation. Similarly, the proportion of taxonomy-eligible economic activities in relation to the total non-life insurance premiums written (before reinsurance) was then determined and, for the first time, the premium was broken down into premium proportions for climate change adaptation in accordance with the draft Commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (third Commission Notice). This was based on long-term loss histories resulting from recognised climate-related risks. Technical screening criteria (TSC), compliance with minimum social safeguards (MSS) and do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria laid down in the Delegated Regulation were also checked.\n\n# Limited data availability or documentation\n\nThe abovementioned evidence could not be documented for the private customer business, standardised SME business and active reinsurance business and therefore could not be included in the Taxonomy-aligned premium. Although both the technical screening criteria and the do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria were largely met in the context of the major customer business in a tailor-made contract for partial premiums on insurance cover for natural disasters that are also linked to climate change, the proportioning approach to taxonomy-aligned premiums was also abandoned in this customer segment due to the still insufficient assurance of all the minimum social safeguards being met.\n\nIn line with the current interpretation by the European Commission, only the part which can be applied to the cover of climate-related risks was used for the calculation of the previous year's comparative figure from the premiums. The calculation with the (split) premiums for this purpose now yields 8.51 per cent taxonomy eligibility for 2022 instead of 48.1 per cent taxonomy eligibility (see 2022 report), as shown in the previous year's report without the premium split.\n\nThe details can be found in the table below (template according to Annex X of the Delegated Regulation).\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                                                                              | Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation |                                 |                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                              | Absolute premiums,<br>2023                            | Proportion of premiums,<br>2023 | Proportion of premiums,<br>2022 |\n| Economic activities                                                                                                                                          | €                                                     | %                               | %                               |\n| A.1.

Our Taxonomy classification is conducted with the support of the external data provider ISS STOXX. Since the 2022 financial year was the first time that non-financial undertakings were included in taxonomy alignment reporting, the taxonomy alignment KPIs for the UNIQA Group's revenue and operating expenses are based exclusively on data from non-financial undertakings.\n\nThe published assessment criteria for the first two climate targets set under the EU Taxonomy Regulation were included.\n\nThe draft Commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (third Commission Notice) dated 21 December 2023 was also critically reviewed.\n\nWe took note of FAQ 2 but kept to the IFRS consolidation basis in order to continue to ensure comparability with the consolidated financial statements. This legal view seems acceptable to us, as nothing to the contrary is stated in the Taxonomy Regulation itself.\n\n#### **Reporting principles**\n\nAt the time of reporting, there are still different interpretations as to how to apply the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the associated Delegated Regulations. Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures therefore take into account what we currently know.\n\nThe calculation of the company-related KPIs in accordance with Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation refers to the investments of UNIQA Insurance Group AG (UIG) published in the UIG consolidated Group Report 2023. For the unconsolidated investment funds due to lack of control, FAQ 4 was noted and the IDW interpretation (IDW QA from 1 December 2023) was subsequently applied, which states that the fund wrap can be used. All further regulatory developments on this will be closely monitored.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Do no significant harm (DNSH)       |                                      |                         |                  |                                       |                   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Climate change<br>mitigation<br>Y/N | Water and marine<br>resources<br>Y/N | Circular economy<br>Y/N | Pollution<br>Y/N | Biodiversity<br>and ecosystems<br>Y/N | Minimum safeg<br> |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n\n#### **Limited data availability or documentation**\n\nA.2 Non-life insurance and reinsurance underwriting Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable\n\nB.

This section describes that the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard contain wordings and definitions that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties. Management describes how they have made the necessary interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard. Due to the inherent risk that undefined legal terms can be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainty. Our audit opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n# **Responsibility of Management and the Supervisory Board**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the (consolidated) non-financial report in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard.\n\nManagement's responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the (consolidated) non-financial reporting (in particular the selection of key issues) as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. This responsibility also includes the interpretation of the wordings and definitions contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard, and management is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a (consolidated) non-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for examining the (consolidated) non-financial report.\n\n# **Auditor's Responsibility**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on our procedures performed and evidence obtained as to whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the (consolidated) non-financial report as at 31 December 2023 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with section 267a UGB and Article 8 of the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (\"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard.\n\nWe performed our engagement in accordance with the professional standards applicable in Austria with regard to KFS/PG 13 \"Other assurance engagements\" as well as the International Standards on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) \"Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information\". These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on independence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nThe selection of the procedures lies in the sole discretion of the auditor and comprised, in particular, the following:\n\n- Interviewing the relevant employees responsible for the analysis of materiality considering the concerns of external stakeholders to update the understanding of the procedure for identifying material sustainability matters\n- Assessment of risks regarding the essential non-financial matters / disclosures\n- Updating the overview of the policies pursued by the Company, including due diligence processes implemented with regard to environmental, social and labour matters, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and bribery\n- Updating the understanding of reporting processes by interviewing the relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations\n- Evaluating the reported disclosures by performing analytical procedures regarding non-financial performance indicators, interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations\n- Assessment of the process for identifying investments qualifying as Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned and activities qualifying as Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned in the underwriting business and the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial reporting by interviewing the relevant employees and inspecting selected internal documentation to assess whether the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation have been adequately addressed\n- Evaluating the presentation and completeness of the disclosures and non-financial information pursuant to section 267a UGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe following was not part of our engagement:\n\n- Examining the prior-year figures, forward-looking information or data from external surveys\n- Examining the correct transfer of data and references from the (consolidated) financial statements to the non-financial reporting; and\n- Examining the information and disclosures on the website or further references on the internet\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\nNeither an audit nor a review of financial statements is objective of our engagement. Furthermore, neither the disclosure and solution of fraud, such as e.g., embezzlement or other kinds of fraudulent acts and wrongful doings, nor the assessment of the effectiveness and profitability of the management are objectives of our engagement.\n\n# **Restriction of Use**\n\nBecause our report is prepared solely for and on behalf of the client, it does not constitute a basis for any reliance on its contents by other third parties. Therefore, no claims of other third parties can be derived from it. We consent to the publication of our report together with the (consolidated) non-financial report. However, the publication may only take place in the complete version certified by us.\n\n# **General Conditions of Contract**\n\nOur report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions (AAB 2018) enclosed to this report, which also apply towards third parties.\n\nVienna 15 March 2024\n\nPwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH\n\nWerner Stockreiter Austrian Certified Public Accountant\n\nsigned\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n**(Consolidated) Non-Financial Report 2023**\n\n",

Group AG have appointed the law firm andréewitch & partner rechtsanwälte GmbH to provide consulting services on matters involving IT law. Supervisory Board member Markus Andréewitch holds a 60 per cent stake in this company. A new partner of andréewitch & partner rechtsanwälte GmbH will assume responsibility for the existing mandate from UNIQA to provide legal advice. Markus Andréewitch does not personally contribute to the advisory services. The advisory services are remunerated at arm's length. The Supervisory Board has provided its consent for the mandate to provide legal advice to continue.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **The work and activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees**\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises the Management Board in its strategic planning and projects. It decides on the matters assigned to it by law, the Articles of Association and its rules of procedure. The Supervisory Board is responsible for supervising the management of the company by the Management Board. It is comprised of ten shareholder representatives and five employee representatives, and it convened for nine meetings in 2023. Two decisions were made by way of circular resolution. All members of the Supervisory Board attended more than half of the meetings of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year either in person or virtually via telephone or video conference.\n\nA **Committee for Board Affairs** has been appointed to handle the relationship between the company and the members of its Management Board relating to employment and salary; this committee also acts as the **Nominating and Remuneration Committee** (for the Management Board) and is composed of the members of the Executive Committee of the Supervisory Board. In 2023, the Committee discussed the remuneration of the Management Board, dealt with the preparation of the Remuneration Reports for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in alignment with the remuneration policy established for each as well as with the succession planning of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board over several meetings.\n\nThe **Working Committee** of the Supervisory Board is only called upon to make decisions if the urgency of the matter means that the decision cannot wait until the next meeting of the Supervisory Board. It is the Chairman's responsibility to assess the urgency of the matter. The resolutions passed must be reported in the next meeting of the Supervisory Board. Generally, the Working Committee can make decisions on any issue that is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board, but this does not include issues of particular importance or matters that must be decided upon by the full Supervisory Board by law. The Working Committee did not convene for any meetings in 2023.\n\nThe **Audit Committee** of the Supervisory Board performs the duties assigned to it by law. The Audit Committee convened for three meetings, which were also attended by the statutory auditor of the (consolidated) financial statements, and there were also discussions with the auditor without the presence of the Management Board. The meetings dealt with all the documents relating to the financial statements, the Corporate Governance Report, the appropriation of profit proposed by the Management Board and the report on the audit of the risk management (all for the 2022 financial year); in addition, PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH was again proposed for selection as statutory auditor for the 2024 financial year. The planning of the 2023 audits of the companies of the consolidated group was discussed with the auditor, and the statutory auditor reported on the results of preliminary audits. In particular, the Audit Committee received quarterly reports from Internal Audit concerning audit areas and material findings based on the audits conducted and the compliance officer reported on her activities on an ongoing basis. The accounting process was monitored on the basis of specific circumstances.\n\nThe **Investment Committee** advises the Management Board with regard to its investment policy; it has no decision-making authority. The Investment Committee held four meetings during which the members discussed the capital investment strategy, questions concerning capital structure and the focus of risk management and asset liability management.\n\nThe **IT Committee** dealt with the ongoing monitoring of project progress in the implementation of the UNIQA Insurance Platform and other IT projects over the course of four meetings.\n\nThe **Digital Transformation Committee** held four meetings in 2023 in which it dealt with the digitalisation of core processes, the reduction in complexities in the product portfolio and the consolidation of digital work processes related to customers and employees.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **Supervisory Board's Human Resources and General Remuneration Committee (\"HR Committee\")** held four meetings on diversity and inclusion matters, employee development and talent management issues, as well as executive remuneration schemes and employee participation programmes. The Committee also dealt intensively with the progress of the implementation of the HR strategy within the framework of UNIQA 3.0. The HR Committee's activities are closely coordinated with the Personnel Committee.\n\nThe chairs of the respective committees informed the full Supervisory Board about the meetings and their committees' work.\n\nFor information concerning the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees, please also refer to the details in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs the shareholder representatives are composed of the same individuals, the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG meets in a joint session with the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG.\n\n#### **Independence of the Supervisory Board**\n\nAll members of the Supervisory Board elected during the Annual General Meeting have declared their independence under Rule 53 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. Both Anna Maria D'Hulster and Jutta Kath also fulfil the criteria of Rule 54 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, as they are neither shareholders with a stake of more than 10 per cent nor do they represent the interests of such shareholders.\n\nA Supervisory Board member is considered independent if he or she is not in any business or personal relationship with the company or its Management Board that represents a material conflict of interest and is therefore capable of influencing the behaviour of the member concerned.\n\nUNIQA has established the following additional criteria for determining the independence of a Supervisory Board member:\n\n- The Supervisory Board member should not have been a member of the Management Board or a senior executive of the company or a subsidiary of the company in the past five years.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not maintain or have maintained within the last year any business relationship with the company or a subsidiary of the company that is material for the Supervisory Board member concerned. This also applies to business relationships with companies in which the Supervisory Board member has a significant economic interest, but does not apply to functions performed on decision-making bodies in the Group.\n- The Supervisory Board member must not have been a statutory auditor of the company or a shareholder or salaried employee of the auditing company within the last three years.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not be a member of the Management Board of another company in which a Management Board member of the company is a member of the other company's Supervisory Board unless one of the companies is a member of the other company's group or holds an investment in the other company.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not be a member of the Supervisory Board for longer than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a business investment or who are representing the interests of such a shareholder.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not be a close family relative (direct descendant, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, niece or nephew) of a Management Board member or of persons who are in one of the positions described in the above points.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Measures to promote women on the Management Board, the Supervisory Board and in executive positions**\n\nA community the size of ours at UNIQA lives and breathes through diversity. We value and respect each other, regardless of gender, age, origin, physical ability, religion or ideology. Our employees are just as diverse as our customers. A diverse workforce helps us to better understand our customers and better serve their different needs. For us, the guiding principle \"Living better together\" is only fulfilled when equal rights and equal opportunities are given in their entirety.\n\nUNIQA is convinced that diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion promote employee loyalty to the company as well as their innovative potential and productivity. Since they lead to higher customer satisfaction and better financial results, diversity and inclusion are also a decisive factor for economic success and growth.\n\nWith Marie-Valerie Brunner, Anna Maria D'Hulster and Jutta Kath, three women are now on the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG. This means that the proportion of female Supervisory Board members among the elected members (shareholder representatives) reaches the legally required 30 per cent. With Sabine Andre and Irene Berger, two women have also been delegated to the group of employee representatives on the Supervisory Board, which means that this board even has a ratio of 40 per cent female members now. In relation to the full Supervisory Board, the legal quota of women is also exceeded with a share of 33 per cent.\n\nSince 1 April 2023, the nine members of the identical Management Boards of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG have also included a woman, Sabine Pfeffer. This was an important step on the way towards \"more women in management positions\". The UNIQA Group does of course also continue to implement various accompanying measures in addition to its clear commitment to this goal. The objective is to change the framework conditions and prerequisites in such a way that the organisation becomes more permeable overall for women's careers. At 57.9 per cent (2022: 57.8 per cent), the share of women in the total workforce in the UNIQA Group remained stable at the end of 2023. This high proportion is driven primarily by the international insurance companies (62.8 per cent).\n\nThe proportion of women on the Management Boards in the Group is 26.3 per cent and therefore once again fell slightly compared to 2022 (2022: 27.1 per cent). Of a total of 523 managers in Austria, 174 are women, which corresponds to a steady share of over 33 per cent. In the UNIQA Group's international companies, 48.6 per cent of the managers are currently women. This corresponds to an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to the previous year (47.4 per cent). As a result, the proportion of female managers in the entire UNIQA Group rose slightly in 2023 to 43.6 per cent (699 of a total of 1,604 persons) compared to the previous year (43.0 per cent).\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **The concept of diversity**\n\nIn 2022, UNIQA published its own diversity and inclusion strategy for the first time. It serves as the basis and framework for all our activities in this area. As an integral part of our UNIQA 3.0 programme, this strategy is clearly aligned with our Guiding Principles. In addition to specific measurable goals, it also contains a bundle of initiatives that focus primarily on three key areas: equal pay for work of equal value, more women in management positions and employee inclusion.\n\nOur overarching goal is to promote diversity and inclusion at UNIQA. We will continue to pursue the following specific priorities:\n\n- 1. Equal pay for work of equal value\n- 2. Promoting equal opportunities with the clear aim of bringing more women into management positions in the future\n- 3. Generation management old and young together contribute to the success of the company\n- 4. Achieving a work/life balance\n- 5. Utilising internationality and cultural diversity as a strength\n- 6. People with disabilities better inclusion and support\n- 7. Clear commitment to non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and identity\n\nTo create commitment and clear responsibilities, we drew up a Diversity & Inclusion Policy and rolled it out for the entire Group in 2023. By organising international conferences and appointing people to be responsible for the topic in the various countries, a network has been established that drives the relevant concepts forward and facilitates optimal networking throughout the Group.\n\n#### **Equal pay for work of equal value**\n\nA standardised annual process has been established in Austria for evaluating, analysing and developing measures concerning the pay gap. The adjusted pay gap was again below 1 per cent in 2023.\n\nIn the (core) markets of Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, an equal pay analysis was carried out for the first time in 2023. Preparations were made to carry out the analysis in 2024 in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Ukraine.\n\nThe importance of fair pay is underlined not least by the inclusion of a target for the unexplained gender pay gap in the variable component of management remuneration for 2024.\n\n#### **More women in management positions**\n\nIncreasing the proportion of women in management positions continues to be a very high priority for UNIQA. With this goal in mind, a new assessment according to the Women's Career Index was carried out in 2023. Since the first analysis in 2020/21, this proportion has improved from 63 to 77 index points, which is already well above the target value of 70. The decisive factors behind this increase were a number of targeted measures, including the adoption and communication of the diversity and inclusion strategy and the definition of specific measurable targets, the development of guidelines for filling management positions and promotions, mandatory training for all managers on the topic of \"Unconscious Mind. Inclusive Leadership\", the activities of relevant networks, the UNIQA mentoring programme for women and the offer of job/top sharing and part-time management models.\n\nIn Austria, the proportion of women in all management positions increased in 2023 by almost 9 per cent, rising from 26.0 per cent to 28.3 per cent. However, the target of an increase of 5 percentage points remained unachieved at just 2.3 percentage points (on average). This target was therefore once again defined as a priority for the coming years with a focus on top management positions (Board and Board–1 levels). Differentiated approaches are being developed and pursued for UNIQA's other markets, as the starting situation varies from country to country.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Inclusion, as experienced by employees**\n\nAn inclusion index was created to measure targets and developments. This indicates the extent to which UNIQA has already succeeded in creating a working environment in which appreciation, equal opportunities, fairness and belonging can be experienced. In a Group-wide survey, a score of 4.0 (on a five-point scale) was achieved. This exceeded the target of 3.8.\n\n#### **Generation management**\n\nDemographic change and the increasing shortage of skilled labour continue to pose a major challenge for UNIQA. We are responding to this by training our own specialists, which will be further accelerated in 2024 with the implementation of a new apprenticeship programme at our headquarters in Vienna. International mentoring and reverse mentoring programmes as well as trainee programmes in various countries are also planned.\n\n#### **People with disabilities**\n\nUNIQA has actively addressed the issue of disability as a career factor by taking part in the 2023 myAbility Talent Programme. In addition, structural measures were implemented in the UNIQA Tower to create an inclusive working environment for people with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Examples of this include motorised doors, barrier-free sanitary facilities and height-adjustable desks.\n\n#### **Commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion**\n\nWe are committed to the power of diversity and leave no room for intolerance and marginalisation. This is reflected in our Diversity & Inclusion Policy, which was rolled out internationally in 2023 and will be reviewed annually.\n\nThere is now a clearly defined process and clear contact persons in the event of allegations of discrimination. This allows us to offer affected employees a low-threshold option for addressing stressful situations. In addition, a mandatory e-learning programme on the topic of equal treatment has been implemented in Austria.\n\nTwo new networks were also founded in Austria: \"Gemeinsam besser Familie\" (Better together family) and \"Sustainability\". The existing networks \"Women\", \"People with disabilities\", \"Generations\" and \"LGBTQIA+\" offer interested employees the opportunity to get involved in their respective topics.\n\nUNIQA has also supported and emphasised numerous external initiatives in Austria, for example by supporting the Female Founders, the Minerva Award (a prize for greater diversity in business), the Meritus of Pride Biz Austria (LGBT-QIA+), the national women's football team, the Special Olympics and the Austrian Frauenhäuser (women's shelters). We also welcomed the Mentory Club (women), East meets West (LGBTQIA+) and myAbility Business Forum (people with disabilities) to the UNIQA Tower.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Remuneration policy, Remuneration Report**\n\nThe Remuneration Report 2023 for the Management Board and Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG is prepared in accordance with Sections 78c and 98a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting on 3 June 2024 for approval. Furthermore, the remuneration policy pursuant to Sections 78a and 98a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act must be resubmitted to this Annual General Meeting for a vote.\n\n#### **Risk report, directors' dealings**\n\nA comprehensive risk report (Rules 69 and 70 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance) is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The notifications concerning directors' dealings in the year under review (Rule 73 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance) can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Group website at www.uniqagroup.com.\n\n#### **External evaluation**\n\nImplementation of, and compliance with, the individual rules in the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance were evaluated by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH for the 2023 financial year – with the exception of Rules 77 to 83. Rules 77 to 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance are evaluated by the law firm Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH. The evaluation is carried out based mainly on the questionnaire, published by the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance, for the evaluation of compliance with the Code.\n\nThe evaluation by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH and Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH confirming that UNIQA complied with the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in 2023 will be published simultaneously with the annual financial report for the 2023 financial year.\n\nVienna, 7 March 2024\n\nQ.

Walter Rothensteiner was a member of the Supervisory Board for almost 28 years, including for 15 years as Chairman. Following his retirement in June of last year – which became necessary once he had reached the statutory age limit – we continued to focus on the key areas initiated by Walter Rothensteiner for the rest of the year.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of the UNIQA Insurance Group AG, which is also the Supervisory Board of the Group's largest subsidiary UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG, is made up of 15 members: ten shareholder representatives, three of whom are women, and five employee representatives, two of whom are women. Beyond the legal requirements, our Board sees its role as that of a diligent and committed sparring partner for the Management Board. As part of this role, the Supervisory Board monitors the company's performance and reputation in a constructive yet critical manner. We provide strategic momentum, seek dialogue with external guest contributors and experts and attach particular importance to a corporate culture of high ethical principles. We try to anticipate the skills that will be of particular importance for the future development of the global insurance industry and to reflect these in a complementary manner within the Supervisory Board. Yet this also means that training and ongoing professional development of the members of the Supervisory Board is a high priority, as is the way in which they collaborate with one another.\n\n#### **1. What was particularly important to us in 2023**\n\nOur nine meetings were focused on evaluating the implementation of our **\"UNIQA 3.0 – Seeding The Future\" strategic programme**, which comes to an end in December 2024. At the same time, primarily in the second half of 2023, we also worked intensively on the cornerstones for the future Group strategy from 2025 onwards, including questions related to governance and the composition of the Management Board team.\n\nThe Supervisory Board deals with a broad range of topics. While regulatory and supervisory issues are taking up more and more of our time (in addition to the obvious evaluation of operational business development), we continue to focus intensively on **three areas that are of particular importance for UNIQA's long-term development**: cultural transformation, diversity and human development, i.e. the battle for the best talent in challenging labour markets. Along these lines, we have welcomed around 6,000 new employees across the Group in the last three years alone; we are focusing on the strategic importance of the ESG concept with its broadbased impact on product design, asset management and governance; and finally, we are devoting ourselves to the costintensive and demanding process of technological and digital transformation of the company.\n\nWalter Rothensteiner had already reported to you two years ago that we pay particularly close attention to the **quality of our cooperation within the Supervisory Board** and also with the Management Board. In 2021, we therefore appointed Professor Werner H. Hoffmann, Director of the Institute for Strategic Management at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, to provide us with professional support with the structured optimisation of cooperation within the Supervisory Board. We continued this work intensively in the 2023 financial year, including with one personnel change: at the last Annual General Meeting, Rudolf Könighofer, General Director of Raiffeisenlandesbank Burgenland, was elected to the Supervisory Board in place of Walter Rothensteiner. In this role, he is showing great commitment in contributing his many years of experience to the Supervisory Board, especially when it comes to selling Raiffeisen Versicherung products.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2. Timeline and details of our main areas of focus**\n\nIn the course of 2023, the Supervisory Board was regularly informed by the Management Board about the business performance and position of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and the Group as a whole. It also supervised the Management Board's management of the business and fulfilled all the tasks assigned to the Supervisory Board by law and the Articles of Association. At the Supervisory Board meetings, the Management Board presented detailed quarterly reports and provided additional oral as well as written reports. The Supervisory Board was given timely and comprehensive information about measures requiring our approval.\n\nFour information events and special seminars were held for the Supervisory Board in 2023, providing information on the topics of \"Diversity & Inclusion\", \"IT Security\", \"ESG\" and \"Compliance & Regulatory\".\n\n#### **Focus of our deliberations**\n\nThe Supervisory Board held nine meetings in 2023. Our meetings focused on the Group's respective current earnings situation and the Group's further strategic development. The Supervisory Board in particular held three extraordinary meetings in the second half of the year to discuss the plans for the development of the corporate strategy from 2025 as well as governance issues. We also took two decisions by way of circular resolution: the first was on 9 May to approve the implementation of a capital measure by STRABAG SE and the second on 12 May to propose Rudolf Könighofer's election to the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n**•** At our meeting held on **22 February**, we mainly discussed the Group's preliminary results for the 2022 financial year. The 2023 budget was also approved in accordance with the new IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 accounting standards.\n\n- **•** The Supervisory Board meeting on **12 April** focused on the audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 and on the reports from the Management Board with upto-date information on the performance of the Group in the first quarter of 2023. We also discussed the items on the agenda of the 24th Annual General Meeting on 6 June, in particular the proposal for the appropriation of profits, the proposal for the election of Supervisory Board members and the proposal to the Annual General Meeting to re-elect PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH as statutory auditors for the 2024 financial year. The report by auditors PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH and lawyers Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH regarding compliance with the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (ÖCGK) in the 2022 financial year was also acknowledged.\n- **•** At the meeting on **25 May**, we looked in detail at the Group's earnings in the first quarter and development in the ongoing second quarter.\n- **•** The newly elected Supervisory Board was constituted on **6 June** following the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Walter Rothensteiner, stepped down from the Supervisory Board as a result of reaching the statutory age limit. Walter Rothensteiner had held this position for the last eleven years. All in all, he had been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1995. Burkhard Gantenbein succeeded him as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. This event as well as the re-election of the other existing members of the Supervisory Board and Rudolf Könighofer's election to the Supervisory Board resulted in changes to the composition of the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board committees. The Supervisory Board also approved the termination of the remaining volume of the subordinated capital debt issued in 2013 that was still outstanding after the settlement of an exchange offer, effective 31 July 2023.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **•** We met at the registered office of our Polish insurance group company in Warsaw on **23 August** and dealt specifically with the Group's earnings situation in the first half of the year and developments in the ongoing third quarter. The sale of our 75 per cent holding in Raiffeisen Life Russia was also approved, subject to approval by the relevant authorities.\n- **•** The Supervisory Board held three extraordinary meetings on **19 September, 18 October** and **10 November** to discuss the preparations for the development of a new strategic programme from the 2025 financial year onwards, in which the Supervisory Board will be closely involved. Final approval of the programme is scheduled for November 2024. We also discussed governance issues.\n- **•** In addition to reporting on the Group's profits in the first three quarters and ongoing developments in the fourth quarter, our meeting on **22 November** also covered the updated forecast for the 2023 financial year. The 2024 budget put forward by the Management Board and the medium-term planning up to 2028 were also discussed. The acquisition of Warsaw-based Telemedi of Warsaw-based Telemedi, Poland's largest provider of telemedicine services, was also approved. Poland's largest provider of telemedicine services. Cost increases due to rising inflation were also approved for the project to rebuild and merge the Confraternität and Goldenes Kreuz private clinics at the site of the Confraternität private clinic. Finally, we looked at the efficiency of our activities as a Supervisory Board. The decision was also taken to further reduce the size of the Management Board, with the result that it will be made up of seven members in future instead of nine. Peter Eichler and Erik Leyers' terms of office on the Management Board are scheduled to end on 30 June 2024. In order to optimise synergies in the Management Board departments, Wolf-Christoph Gerlach will also take over Erik Leyers' responsibilities and René Knapp those of Peter Eichler. The mandates of the Management Board members were extended until June 2028, with Sabine Pfeffer's mandate running unchanged until the end of 2026 until further notice. Following the discussions at the three extraordinary meetings in September, October and November, the Management Board was finally tasked with drawing up the strategic programme from 2025 onwards.\n\n#### **Committees of the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn addition to the Audit Committee required by law, we have set up and appointed a further six committees in order to ensure that the work of our Supervisory Board is structured effectively.\n\n- **•** The **Committee for Board Affairs** ('Personnel Committee') corresponds with the **Executive Committee of the Supervisory Board** in terms of its composition. The Committee also performs the tasks of a **Nominating and Remuneration Committee** (for the Management Board) in parallel. The Executive Committee or the abovementioned Personnel Committee held several meetings in 2023 for intensive discussions on the progress made in implementing the UNIQA 3.0 strategic programme, as well as on issues relating to the corporate strategy's future direction. The meetings also dealt with the preparation of the remuneration reports for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in alignment with the respective existing remuneration policies as well as remuneration matters relating to the Management Board.\n- **•** The **Audit Committee** held three meetings in the 2023 financial year with representatives of the (Group) auditor PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH also present, with discussions also held with these without the Management Board present. The meeting on 12 April addressed all financial statement documentation, the proposed appropriation of profit and the statutory auditor's report on the audit of the company's risk management. In addition, the 2022 annual report of the Internal Audit department, including the audit plan for the current year and the 2022 annual activity report of the compliance officers, was presented and acknowledged. Furthermore, PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH was once again proposed for election as statutory auditor for the 2024 financial year. At the meeting held on 25 May, the statutory auditor's representatives presented the planning of the audit procedures for the UNIQA Group companies for the 2023 financial year and agreed these with the Committee. At the meeting held on 22 November, representatives of the auditor informed the Committee of the findings from its preliminary audits. In addition, the Committee received quarterly reports from Internal Audit on the areas audited by this department and any material findings that arose from these audit actions, and the Compliance Officer reported on her activities on an ongoing basis. The Committee fulfilled its remit of monitoring the accounting process.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **•** The **Investment Committee** held four meetings during which the members discussed the capital investment strategy, questions concerning capital structure and the focus for risk management and asset liability management.\n- **•** The **IT Committee** held four meetings to discuss the ongoing monitoring of progress in the implementation of the UNIQA Insurance Platform and other IT projects, in particular the project portfolio.\n- **•** The **Digital Transformation Committee** held four meetings devoted to the activities of UNIQA Ventures, CHERRISK and the activities of Mavie Holding, which develops health offerings that go beyond classic insurance products. The progress of insurance products and services available digitally was also evaluated with new and agile ways of working also discussed. As in the previous year, the Committee invited several guest speakers.\n- **•** The **Supervisory Board's Human Resources and General Remuneration Committee** (\"HR Committee\") held four meetings on diversity and inclusion matters, employee development and talent management issues, executive remuneration schemes and employee participation programmes. The Committee also dealt intensively with the progress of the HR strategy within the framework of UNIQA 3.0. The HR Committee's activities are closely coordinated with the Personnel Committee. Guest speakers were invited to the meetings to address specific HR-related topics.\n- **•** The **Working Committee** did not hold any meetings in the past financial year.\n\nThe chairs of the respective committees informed the full Supervisory Board in detail about the meetings and their committees' work.\n\n#### **3. Separate and consolidated financial statements**\n\nThe separate financial statements prepared by the Management Board, the Management Report of UNIQA Insurance Group AG, the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and the Group Management Report for 2023 were audited by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH. The auditor also verified that a combined non-financial report and a consolidated corporate governance report had each been prepared for the 2023 financial year. The audit raised no objections. The separate and consolidated financial statements were each awarded an unqualified audit opinion for 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledged and approved the findings of the audit.\n\nThe evaluation of UNIQA's compliance with the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in the 2023 financial year was carried out by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH, whereas compliance with Rules 77 to 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance was assessed by Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH. The evaluations found that UNIQA had complied with the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in the 2023 financial year – to the extent that they were included in UNIQA's declaration of conformity.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledged the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and approved the 2023 annual financial statements of UNIQA Insurance Group AG. It also endorsed both the Management Report and the Group Management Report. The 2023 annual financial statements were thereby adopted in accordance with Section 96(4) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the proposal for the appropriation of profit submitted by the Management Board. Accordingly, a dividend distribution of €0.57 per share will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 3 June 2024.\n\nThis year, once again, I would like to take the opportunity on behalf of the Supervisory Board to extend my warmest thanks to all employees of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and its Group companies for their huge personal commitment in the past financial year 2023 and to wish them good health and continued success!\n\nVienna, April 2024\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\n-J\n\nBurkhard Gantenbein Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# (Consolidated) **Non-financial report**\n\n#### **About this report**\n\nThis report was prepared in accordance with the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (Directive 2014/95/EU) and covers those sustainability concerns that also reflect our material sustainability topics.\n\nThe concepts described in this report correspond to the content of the 2023 Sustainability Report, which was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The sustainability report is published together with the Group Report on 11 April 2024. This non-financial report, which forms part of our 2023 Group Report, covers the 2023 financial year and, thus, the period running from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. Where appropriate to do so, we compare our progress with the targets communicated the previous year and give an insight into our targets for next year.\n\nUNIQA Insurance Group AG decided to prepare the nonfinancial statement as a separate non-financial report (option in accordance with Section 267a(6) and Section 243b(6) of the Austrian Commercial Code) and to summarise the non-financial report for UNIQA Insurance Group AG and the consolidated non-financial report for the Group. The basis of consolidation is disclosed under Other disclosures in the explanatory notes to the 2023 consolidated financial statements. This report includes information and data relating to UNIQA Insurance Group AG (UNIQA Group). All content and data in this report refer to the UNIQA Group and its fully consolidated Group companies. Should any content or key performance indicators not cover the entire UNIQA Group, this is clearly indicated in the report or explained in more detail in footnotes in the respective sections. The Telemedi Group, a Polish start-up, was acquired to supplement our health insurance services effective 31 December 2023. The company has 49 employees. As the company was acquired just before the financial statements, it cannot be included with corresponding ESG-related data for the 2023 financial year. In mid-2023, UNIQA withdrew completely from the Russian market and concluded the contract for the sale of its subsidiary Raiffeisen Life to the Russian insurance company Renaissance Life and now only operates in 17 countries. As UNIQA continued to assume responsibility for employees and environmental matters in the 2023 financial year, these data are included in this report.\n\nSince UNIQA Insurance Group AG (headquartered in Vienna) does not directly operate the insurance business either domestically or abroad, measures to address environmental, social and employee concerns along with observing human rights, anti-corruption and bribery issues are drawn up at Group level and subsequently implemented in the operating Group companies. Accordingly, as regards the separate financial statements, no other modified or restricted concept is being pursued in any other way.\n\nAs in previous years, PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was commissioned to undertake the limited assurance audit in 2023. Further details on the audit outcomes can be found in the report on the independent audit of the consolidated non-financial report.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Company description**\n\nThe UNIQA Group is one of the leading insurance groups in its two core markets of Austria and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). We offer our customers property and casualty insurance as well as life and health insurance products. As a financial services provider, our aim is to consider sustainability-related risks and include opportunities arising from ESG trends (ESG – Environment, Social, Governance). The next section illustrates our management approach. Further information on our business model can be found in the Strategy section of the Group Report. For information on how the policies are followed and issues are managed, please see the following sections.\n\n#### **Sustainability strategy**\n\nWe carefully address those conditions that we consider conducive to a better life. To do this, we enter into dialogue with stakeholders, experts and the public, share our own approaches and play an active role. Sustainability is therefore a key part of our actions. Thanks to our clear position on this matter, we can encourage understanding and support from all our stakeholders, namely employees, customers, investors and the public.\n\nOur sustainability strategy is designed to be holistic. It ties our economic ambitions to a clear environmental and social commitment to protecting the environment and social responsibility.\n\nOur sustainability strategy was approved in October 2020 and is based on five pillars in addition to our People and Culture base and Governance framework:\n\n- ESG investment policy\n- ESG product policy\n- Sustainable operational management\n- Transparent reporting\n- Stakeholder management\n\nOur fundamental objective in 2023, as in the previous year, was to put this sustainability strategy into operation and embed it within the company by using milestone schedules. Our operational focus is on pillars 1 to 3, supported by transparent reporting (pillar 4) and stakeholder engagement (pillar 5). There is also particular focus on our climate strategy, which we pursue in accordance with recognised regulations (SBTi – Science Based Targets initiative) and as part of the memberships we have joined (NZAOA, GFA, PSI, PRI). More details can be found in the Environmental matters section.\n\n#### **Materiality concept**\n\nUNIQA's success is built on the fact that we understand how the world is changing and how we need to be able to respond to this. Our last materiality analysis took place in 2021 and identified those ESG issues deemed by our stakeholders and our business to be the most important. In 2021, we also conducted a new stakeholder identification process, including the associated weighting. We defined four stakeholder groups from this who are directly affected by our business activities, namely customers, employees, investors and the public.\n\nThe materiality analysis forms the basis for our sustainability approach, sustainability strategy and our reporting. The four most important material topics from a stakeholder perspective in 2021 were cyber risks, digital service and customer focus, advice and prevention for natural disasters as well as training and education of employees.\n\nThe five most important topics from UNIQA's perspective were the health and safety of employees, data security and processing, training and education, commitment to the environment as well as diversity and equal opportunity.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, we initiated a group-wide project aimed at preparing us for the reporting requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), where a \"double materiality analysis\" redefines the reporting limits. The analysis includes the initial collection and assessment of impacts, opportunities and risks along the value chain, involving key stakeholders such as NGOs and rating agencies. It will be completed in 2024 and will form the basis for our future reporting.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **ESG integration**\n\nThe Supervisory Board deals with sustainability reporting each year in the advisory body of the Audit Committee. Here it decides on the sustainability strategy to be pursued. The Group Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board on a quarterly basis, looking at progress with regard to environmental and social targets. The ESG Committee is embedded in the governance of the UNIQA Group and is responsible for advising the Group Executive Board. The Supervisory Board also undertakes training sessions every year in order to improve collective knowledge, skills and experience as regards sustainable development. The Annual General Meeting decides on the assessment of the Supervisory Board's performance when granting the annual discharge.\n\nOur key body for sustainability agendas is the Group ESG Committee, which was formed in 2021. It consists of members of the Management Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and heads of key departments, meets on a quarterly basis and provides the Management Board with recommendations to help them make decisions on ESG matters. The Committee is responsible for integrating and enhancing ESG factors in insurance, investment and asset management activities, along with the strategic definition and continuous development of ESG-related ambitions for the entire UNIQA Group. Its tasks also include drafting and introducing appropriate guidelines. In addition, the Committee is responsible for supervising the implementation of the Group-wide climate strategy and environmental management, as well as supporting the implementation of strategic initiatives and projects in the subsidiaries.\n\nThe Sustainability Management team is part of the Sustainability, Ethics and Public Affairs department, which was newly created in early 2020. It is responsible for operationally managing the integration of ESG factors into the UNIQA Group's core business lines. Proposals regarding ESG integration within the company are drawn up and discussed in ESG working groups formed of ESG specialists and/or representatives of various operational units and departments.\n\nIn 2023, we started to integrate strategic ESG coordinators into the local organisational structure and governance in all the UNIQA Group's countries and regions. The aim is to establish sustainability in local structures to a greater extent and to tailor relevant initiatives, products and strategies to the countries or regions' specific circumstances.\n\nPart of the variable remuneration for the Management Board of the UNIQA Group and managers in our Austrian core market is linked to climate-related interim targets. Linking the short-term incentive programme and sustainability performance highlights the priority given to these targets. This model will be extended from 2024 onwards to the Management Boards in other markets and will also be linked to a social objective. The Management Board of the UNIQA Group had a remuneration target in 2023 on reducing CO2 in operational management at our larger Austrian locations. This target had a weighting of 25 per cent of the annual target bonus. In addition, individual targets were set for the CEO, the CFO and the Board member responsible for ESG with regard to reducing the weighted average carbon intensity of our investment portfolio (WACI), which accounted for 20 per cent of their annual bonus. The long-term incentives (LTI) also reflected this prioritisation of ESG targets. In each case, 20 per cent of the targets were linked to reduction of the WACI and an increase in the proportion of investments that meet the Paris climate targets (in accordance with the criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative, SBTi). Similarly, a provision was introduced for managers in the Austrian core market that 5 per cent of their variable component is to be allocated in each case to CO2 reduction in operations management and to increasing the proportion of Paris target issuers in our investment portfolio, based on the WACI. We report on the progress of the key figures relevant to remuneration in the section on environmental matters.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Sustainability risks**\n\nThe UNIQA Group's core business is to protect its customers from risks, minimise these risks through effective bundling and generate profits. To ensure this, the position of Chief Financial and Risk Officer (CFRO) was created at Group level, which is also established on the management boards at the group companies to ensure that decision-making is riskbased.\n\nIn accordance with the latest amendment to the delegated act of the Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC), sustainability risks must be taken into account in the risk management system. This Directive entered into force on 2 August 2022. Our objective in this context is to develop an appropriate and consistent approach to considering sustainability risks, apply this approach at all times and ensure it is updated regularly. The UNIQA Group's risk management actively takes sustainability factors and their impacts into account, and integrates them into the risk strategy and risk management process as well as into internal and external reports. Sustainability risks are treated as part of the general risk classification and are analysed for short, medium and longterm impacts, monitored and reported on as part of the risk management process. The occurrence of sustainability risks may have an actual or potential material adverse impact on the value of the Group's assets, liabilities, financial position or reputation. The results of the sustainability risk identification and assessment process are intended to help support management decisions as part of the UNIQA Group's product design or investment strategy.\n\nIn 2023, the UNIQA Group focused on refining its long-term climate scenarios, taking into account the experience from the previous reporting period. A quantitative approach was developed for the entire Group, analysing both the physical and transitory risks in the portfolio. The Group identified sustainability risks in the operational risk cycle at an early stage. The starting point was the implementation of upcoming changes resulting from a review of the Solvency II quantitative reporting templates. This involves reporting quantitative data on physical and transitional risks directly to the national supervisory authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). We also improved the process for evaluating outsourcing risks throughout the Group, explicitly taking the sustainability of our outsourcing partners into account. All the relevant ESG data were integrated into our risk analysis software in 2023 to enable the daily monitoring of ESG limit utilisation rates from 2024 onwards.\n\nThe UNIQA Group's Natural Catastrophes Competence Centre (NCCC) deals with the complexity and evolution of natural disasters, especially in connection with climate change. The NCCC plays a crucial role in analysing various risk factors for the Group. This includes understanding the risk exposure that changes over time, identifying risk concentrations and calculating the expected annual losses based on specific natural hazards and locations, both individually and on an aggregated basis. An essential part of the NCCC's work is to analyse scenarios that realistically depict future events, including extreme and rare events, as well as the impacts of climate change under different temperature scenarios with a focus on floods, storms and hail. A key feature of the NCCC's approach is the use of advanced stochastic models that simulate hundreds of thousands of potential natural events. These models are not only state-of-the-art, but are also regularly refined to incorporate the latest data and methods. A unique feature of the NCCC's approach is that two thirds of these models incorporate the UNIQA Group's own historical claims data and thus offer a tailored risk perspective that differs from the non-specific assessments of general market models. The insights gained from these stochastic natural disaster models are fundamental to the Group's comprehensive natural disaster risk management strategy. The NCCC also plays a crucial role in the assessment of the Group's underwriting and reinsurance strategies, in particular through the annual stress scenario tests.\n\nMaterial risks related to non-financial concerns are explained in more detail in the respective sections of this report.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Sustainable investments\n\nThe UNIQA Group finances issuers that contribute to emission reduction or social projects. Depending on the asset class, we are guided by the sustainability definitions for Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds according to International Capital Market Association (ICMA) principles. Funds are included in our sustainable investments in accordance with Article 9 (dark green funds) of the EU Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and thus represent investments with the pursuit of a sustainability goal as defined by the SFDR. Qualified investments in infrastructure projects are also included in our sustainable investments. The sustainable investment strategy is set out in the UNIQA Group Responsible Investment Standard. Investments made are regularly reviewed by the Risk Management team. UNIQA's sustainable investments increased by 67 per cent to €2.17 billion between 2021 and 2023. This enabled us to exceed our target of €2 billion for 2025 a year earlier. This target was previously set in 2021, including investments in Article 8 funds. However, due to our stricter reclassification of what we define as sustainable investments, these funds are no longer included. Nevertheless, we have achieved our target, mainly due to the significant increase in our investments in Green Bonds, which have more than doubled since 2021. In addition, the share of sustainable installations in our overall portfolio almost doubled in 2023, to 10 per cent. Our sustainable investments including Article 8 funds amounted to €1.7 billion in 2022. With Article 8 funds having been removed from our definition of sustainable investments, the figure for 2022 was €1.46 billion.\n\n#### Principal adverse impacts\n\nWith reference to the EU Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) we monitor the diverse criteria for the negative impact of individual issuers on the environment and society – described as principal adverse impacts – and have been reporting on these indicators for the first time since mid-2023 for our investment activities. One focus area is the annual reduction of CO2e emissions. Similarly, we monitor social issues such as non-compliance with the principles of the UN Global Compact or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We do not make any new investments in companies that violate these principles. Furthermore we do not finance any companies involved in the manufacture or sales of anti-personnel landmines, cluster ammunition or chemical and biological weapons. We also do not finance any countries with no tax cooperation arrangements in place with the EU and do not make any investments in their government bonds.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Engagement strategy\n\nAs part of our engagement strategy, which was launched in 2022 and expanded further in 2023, we rely on both proactive and reactive engagement in direct and indirect contact with our investees. This engagement is designed to improve the performance of our investees, especially in terms of their climate strategy and decarbonisation targets and measures. We rely on active dialogue to promote the idea of transition in order to prevent the divestment step if possible.\n\nBy proactive engagement we mean direct bilateral contact with individual companies. The focus is on those companies that together account for 65 per cent of our financed emissions. Over the next four years, we will be supporting these companies to achieve their goals in bilateral discussions with the ESG teams.\n\nBy reactive engagement we mean, on the one hand, collaborative engagement, which we have been pursuing since 2022 as part of our membership in the Climate Action 100+ (CA 100+) investor initiative. In this case, a group of international investors contact one of the 170 companies that have the highest emissions globally, to align its climate strategy and reporting with science-based climate targets.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been pursuing controversial or standards-based engagement, which is led by ISS, since 2023. ISS enables investors to engage with companies that commit serious and structural violations of normative criteria in the areas of corporate governance, human and labour rights, the environment, bribery and corruption or fail to take measures to adequately respond to these violations and to take countermeasures. These include, in particular, violations of the principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) and of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nAs part of our engagement, we try to convince our investees to do the following:\n\n- Implement a governance framework that defines climate risk responsibilities and supervisory duties\n- Take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain in line with the Paris climate target of 1.5 degrees Celsius and set SBTi-validated targets, if not already in place\n- Transparent disclosure to demonstrate the resilience of the corporate strategy with regard to different climate scenarios\n\nWe review our engagement activities on the basis of key indicators. In line with our proactive bilateral engagement strategy, we contacted two companies selected for their high share of our financed emissions and obtained an initial overview of our engagement partners' climate-relevant targets, measures and strategies in 2023. Together, these two companies represent 33 per cent of our financed emissions. As part of our membership in CA 100+, we participated in a collaborative case of engagement last year. Together with ISS, we joined 25 standards-based engagements in the 2023 reporting year. These included 15 cases of social violations and ten cases of environmental violations. In 23 cases, measures or commitments have already been adopted by the companies concerned to remedy the violation. Under our membership in the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, we took part in another collaborative engagement with one of the world's largest asset managers in 2023, focussing on climate-specific issues.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Topic           | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decarbonisation | Successful validation of the interim climate targets for our<br>portfolio by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)                                                                                                                                                                                     | We will continuously improve the ESG quality of our<br>assets by aligning our portfolio more closely with the<br>obligations we have entered into with our memberships.<br>Our decarbonisation and engagement measures will<br>continue in line with our science-based targets in<br>the following year.

Our long-term goal is to cover 65 per cent of our financed emissions through our engagements over the next four years. We plan to cover not only relevant climate issues in our bilateral engagements but also other environmental issues such as biodiversity and water, as well as governance issues.                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n#### **Environmental matters in underwriting in the Retail segment**\n\nAs one of the leading insurers in Central and Eastern Europe, we bear equal responsibility for protecting the personal living standards of our customers and the value added processes of our company. Risk prevention and mitigation are key areas in which environmental and social impacts increasingly need to be incorporated into the advisory approach. Sustainability factors are therefore increasingly being taken into account in the underwriting process as well as products and services within our insurance business.\n\nEvery product development follows a structured, transparent process, which is laid down in our policy and our product development process standard. An internal audit process ensures that any product development in Austria is also examined and evaluated from an ESG perspective. This process was further developed and consolidated in 2023.\n\nUNIQA Austria's life insurance is also adaptable. Thanks to highly flexible policy structures and transparent, easyto-understand cost models, it can be tailored to customers' needs. In endowment life insurance, we launched another UNIQA portfolio in category c (sustainability category according to IDD) in autumn 2023 and thus integrated a standardised product range focused on sustainability for various risk classes.\n\nIn property insurance, UNIQA Austria is focussing on important future issues such as the circular economy and alternative energies. The new \"Privatschutz Wohnen & Freizeit\" household and homeowner insurance launched in 2023 includes, for example, increased natural disaster relief and a module for circular economy and renewable energies.\n\nWe support contemporary medical care in health insurance in Austria, motivating our customers to live healthier lives by building medical centres, expanding our partner network LARA, offering telemedicine surgeries and trained Vital-Coaches.\n\nUNIQA Austria has been offering a new senior citizens' casualty insurance product since 2023. In particular, it provides older customers with security in covering care costs so that their standard of living can be maintained. This contributes to more equal access to care services and reduces social inequalities in healthcare.\n\nIn the bancassurance sector in Austria, we are increasingly focused on funds that take social, ecological and ethical criteria into account when it comes to unit-linked products. We also provide special subsidies for taking out homeowner and household insurance policies with ecological elements such as photovoltaic or solar systems, as well as for motor vehicle insurance for electric vehicles.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nLikewise, we are gradually integrating sustainability into our insurance products on international markets, such as insurance coverage for electric vehicles at UNIQA Czechia and UNIQA Slovakia. UNIQA Poland addresses social needs through enhanced cover, taking into account the needs of older people in relation to specific services, as well as student insurance with a focus on diversity and psychological support.\n\n| Topic                               | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                    | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sustainability in<br>life insurance | Expansion of the UNIQA portfolio in category c<br>(sustainability category according to IDD) for endowment<br>life insurance at UNIQA Austria | Exclusively products with a focus on sustainability in<br>unit-linked life insurance from UNIQA Austria (new green<br>individual funds in categories c and b; funds in category b<br>bear the Austrian eco-label) |\n\n### **Environmental matters in underwriting in the Corporate Business line**\n\nAt a time marked by the challenges of climate change, the role of corporate business is growing beyond the mere coverage of risks. As a facilitator for improving financial resilience, UNIQA is at the interface between the development of the industry and responsibility for sustainability. Sustainability developments have a significant impact on the insurance industry and on the insured companies. These include the increase in climate-related damage and the increased market demand for new sustainable products and product components. The UNIQA Group is responding by integrating ESG risks into the underwriting process, incorporating ESG criteria into customer analysis and disclosing the underwriting portfolio's sustainability performance. These innovations support sustainable business and new technologies.\n\n#### **Sustainability strategy in UNIQA's corporate business**\n\nOur sustainability strategy approach in UNIQA's corporate business comprises three main directions:\n\n#### **1. Advice on strengthening resilience to climate-related risks**\n\nThe UNIQA Group offers companies advice to strengthen their resilience to climate risks and to overcome challenges. \"First-aid measures\" expand the recommendations for risk prevention.\n\n#### **2. Decarbonisation of the underwriting portfolio**\n\nThe UNIQA Group aims to achieve net-zero emissions in the underwriting portfolio by 2040 in Austria, and by 2050 in CEE. Decarbonisation steps include the phase-out of coal (since 2019), oil (by 2030), and gas (by 2035) in corporate business.\n\n#### **3. Development of new sustainability products and components**\n\nUNIQA Corporate Business supports customers in their sustainable economic growth and in developing new sustainable technologies through innovative products. The focus is on the circular economy and environmental liability components in insurance solutions.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Insurance-associated emissions\n\nAs a member of the Austrian Green Finance Alliance (GFA), we aim to report on our insurance-associated greenhouse gas emissions and to set targets to reduce our emissions to net-zero in Austria by 2040 and in CEE by 2050. In the 2023 reporting year, we completed the analysis of our Austrian corporate portfolio for the 2022 financial year using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology for measuring insurance-associated emissions. We also carried out the calculation for 2023 in Austria. 2022 serves as the baseline year for future target tracking. The interim targets up to 2040 and 2050 have been drawn up for the entire UNIQA Group and can be found with the emission levels for Austria in the following table:\n\n| Topic                  | 2022<br>(Baseline) | 2023<br>(Status)  | 2025 | 2030 | 2035 | 2040 | 2045 | 2050 |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| UNIQA<br>Austria       | 20,164*<br>t CO₂e  | 19,722*<br>t CO₂e | -5%  | -20% | -40% | -60% | -    | -    |\n| UNIQA<br>International | n.a.**             | n.a.**            | -5%  | -15% | -25% | -40% | -45% | -50% |\n\n\\* The portfolio's insurance-associated emissions in the property and technology insurance (100 per cent) und motor vehicle liability insurance (30 per cent) business lines. The premium coverage of the portfolio analysed is 53 per cent of the total insurance portfolio of industrial insurance (includes property insurance, liability insurance, transport insurance, and financial lines).\n\n\\*\\* Only emissions from Austria are reported in 2023. In 2024, we will in any case complete the analysis with all EU markets, which together are 85 per cent of the UNIQA International premium. Over the following years, the entire Group will gradually follow in the actual recording and detailed planning.\n\n#### **Proxies and estimates used**\n\n#### a) Calculation of insurance-associated emissions\n\nExternally-sourced industry data on the business activities' carbon emission intensity (Scope 1 & 2) (according to NACE codes) were used to calculate the insurance-associated carbon emissions in the underwriting portfolio. We calculated the total amount of carbon emissions from these data, combined with our customers' business activity, revenue, and annual insurance premium, using the PCAF formula. The calculation corresponds to a PCAF data quality factor of 5.\n\nEstimates: where public information on revenue was not available, other public sources containing the companies' financial data, including estimates, were used. Internal estimates were used for public institutions, companies with negative revenue and non-commercial companies.\n\n#### (b) Definition of decarbonisation targets\n\nThe interim decarbonisation targets were defined taking into account:\n\n- the local decarbonisation ambitions of the main UNIQA markets from a premium volume perspective (Austria, Poland, Czechia/Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria),\n- our portfolio's current industry distribution,\n- major decarbonisation initiatives (such as the phasing out of fossil fuels, growth of the renewable energy business),\n- the countries' nationally determined emission reduction plans for the relevant industries represented (in particular energy, heavy industry, transport and waste).\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe level of ambition for the interim targets corresponds with the decarbonisation commitments of the states represented and is reinforced by the comprehensive decarbonisation agenda at UNIQA Corporate Business.\n\n#### ESG risk assessment\n\nIn May 2023, UNIQA Corporate Business introduced the ESG standard for the underwriting process, which integrates the corporate business' ESG risks into the process. The underwriting platform's special functions enable automated risk assessment of the submitted quotes with regard to their exposure to environmental, social and governance risks. The risk assessment is carried out by an external data provider and is based on the guidelines of the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) \"Management of Environmental, Social and Governance Risks in the Non-Life Business\". Of the 15,006 customers rated in the Austrian portfolio, 45 per cent were assigned at least one ESG risk. Of these, 45 per cent had at least one high environmental risk, 68 per cent at least one high social risk, and 42 per cent at least one high governance risk.\n\n| Results of the ESG risk assessment of the Austrian portfolio*            | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Number of customers assessed with respect to their exposure to ESG risks | 15,006 |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with ESG risks allocated to them        | 45%    |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with at least 1 high E risk             | 45%    |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with at least 1 high S risk             | 68%    |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with at least 1 high G risk             | 42%    |\n\n\\* The analysis included companies with standardised insurance products whose premiums make up 25 per cent of the entire SME portfolio. In 2024, we will also analyse Austrian portfolios of industrial insurers and portfolios of industrial insurers or EU markets.\n\nThe results are consistent with the assumption that many of the industries in our underwriting portfolio are potentially exposed to at least one of the high ESG risks. We will publish the progress made in analysing the company data in relation to ESG risks in the next sustainability report.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Decarbonisation of the underwriting portfolio\n\nWe are tracking the business volumes in all our markets with companies in sectors that use coal, oil and natural gas as part of our commitment to exit the fossil fuel business. We have defined a clear timetable for this exit and see clear progress in decarbonising the portfolio, as measured by the absolute premium in Corporate Business (business lines: property, technology and liability insurance). We plan to incorporate further business lines into the analysis in 2024.\n\n| Corporate business<br>Non-life premiums for<br>coal/gas/oil companies | 2022       | 2023       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Coal                                                                  | €6,503,758 | €4,102,667 |\n| Natural gas/oil                                                       | €5,578,239 | €5,399,079 |\n\nThe decline in the coal business in Corporate Business by almost half in 2023 is due to essentially meeting the exit commitments in our Polish portfolio. We monitored all remaining coal customers in the portfolio in 2023 based on available data with regard to their commitment to climate-related targets and relevant climate strategies. We also want to conduct this analysis in 2024 for all oil and gas companies in our portfolio. With respect to the analysis of coal customers, the results of our first step (monitoring publicly available data) provide us with a clear overview of those customers that may be subject to written commitment. In accordance with our decarbonisation declaration, we are committed to exiting all portfolio items in companies that generate more than 5 per cent of their revenue from activities in the coal sector by 2030. This does not include companies that have set science-based climate targets (time horizon: 2050, including five-year interim targets) and are decarbonising their core business in line with the Paris Agreement, or projects that are in line with the Paris targets. Our customers who have published such commitments already, make up 25 per cent according to our analysis of the open data. We will work with those customers who have not yet defined their own decarbonisation pathway to obtain confirmation of their climate plans by the end of 2026. We will gradually stop extending policies for those coal customers who do not commit to emission reduction plans in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\n#### Renewable energy business\n\nWe intend to expand our business activities with companies from the following sectors across the Group as part of our solutions for renewable energies: solar power, wind power, hydropower and biomass energy. In 2023, we increased our premium volume in renewables by 20 per cent. There are multiple UNIQA markets behind this growth, i.e. Austria, Romania and Bulgaria, where we are experiencing significant growth in the renewable energy business and technical consulting for photovoltaics.\n\n|                                                                          | 2022        | 2023        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net annual premium from insured companies in the renewable energy sector | €12,648,649 | €16,434,075 |\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Topic                                       | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decarbonisation<br>and ESG risk<br>analysis | Calculation of carbon emissions and ESG risk analysis of<br>the underwriting portfolio by integrating external data<br>into the front-end system for automatic ESG-related<br>calculations with each quote<br>Expansion of the underwriting process to include the<br>ESG risk assessment in the internal ESG Standard for<br>Underwriting process regulation document and the ESG<br>consultant role implemented in each business unit to<br>analyse the quotes escalated based on the ESG criteria | We plan to continue our portfolio analysis for greenhouse<br>gas emissions and ESG risks in all UNIQA International<br>markets in 2024.

As UNIQA, we can contribute to this by promoting sustainability and reducing negative impacts both through our business activities and in our own company. Failure to comply with environmental criteria in operational management may have negative impacts on the environment (e.g. increased carbon emissions), which may harm UNIQA's reputation. Negative impacts on the environment and society (such as breaches of social standards) and reputational risks for UNIQA may also occur in procurement. Environmental management in our own operations is therefore a key aspect of our sustainability strategy and the introduction of a certified environmental management system in Austria is one of our most important strategic ambitions.\n\nThe steps we are taking to reduce our carbon emissions are based on the application of international certifications and standards in our dealings with suppliers and on the optimisation of our internal environmental management systems. We are increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions by systematically conserving resources and encouraging the use of low-emission mobility options.\n\nAt group level, we successfully completed the process for calculating and validating science-based climate targets in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2023. These targets not only include aligning our investments with the trajectory for the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement, but also reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our own operational management (direct Scope 1 emissions and indirect Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity and heat). We are specifically committed to reducing our direct Scope 1 and indirect Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42 per cent by 2030 as against the baseline year 2021.\n\nIn 2024, we will conduct a comprehensive detailed survey of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for our Group's own buildings. In the course of 2025, the data quality will be improved so that we can draw up a strategy to achieve our SBTi targets with action plans from 2026 onwards. By implementing this strategy, we aim to achieve net-zero emissions in Austria by 2040 and in CEE by 2050.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nOur internal environmental management strategy is underpinned by our commitment to the Paris climate targets, which we have implemented with an initial programme of operational milestones and measures in 2022 for all sales offices in Austria. This plan includes the following key pillars:\n\n- Use exclusively ecolabel 46 certified green energy from 2024 onwards\n- Increase energy efficiency in our buildings by at least 33 per cent by 2040 compared with 2019\n- Expand photovoltaic capacity to at least 600 kWp by 2035\n- Phase out all oil and gas heating by 2035 at the latest\n- Change over to 100 per cent electric vehicles in the company fleet by 2030 at the latest\n\n#### Introduction of an EMAS-compliant environmental management system\n\nUNIQA actively promotes environmental protection as part of the Group's sustainability strategy and as a member of the Green Finance Alliance. To implement this commitment, an environmental management system according to EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) will be introduced at the Austrian location by the end of 2024. EMAS improves operational environmental performance by assessing key areas such as energy efficiency, emissions and waste management. We have already collected relevant data, evaluated and implemented processes and published our environmental policy. Recycling islands were introduced to improve waste separation and recycling rates in the company. Regular audits will ensure the effectiveness of the environmental management system. We will continue our efforts to reduce our ecological footprint.\n\n#### Sustainability in procurement\n\nUNIQA's Group Procurement Policy lays out our procurement model and our clear commitment to high social and environmental values, including the integrity of our suppliers and the strict prohibition of corruption and bribery. UNIQA is committed to high social and environmental standards, including the selection of suppliers who follow our value system and demonstrate a high level of integrity. Supplier registration verifies the company's master data, cost-effectiveness, certificates (e.g. ISO) and compliance with laws and conventions. Since July 2023, the UNIQA Code of Conduct has been integrated into the supplier registration process, which includes human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. The largest suppliers are assessed annually, also taking into account advanced security, data protection and ESG factors.\n\n#### Corporate carbon footprint\n\nUsing the energy consumption figures and environmental data available for the 2023 financial year, we have once again calculated UNIQA's corporate carbon footprint (CCF). This quantifies the greenhouse gas emissions in our head offices and Austrian regional offices and includes companyspecific and other relevant emissions, measured in CO2 equivalents. The figures cover the main offices in 18 UNIQA countries (including Russia) as well as 9 regional offices in Austria and, for the first time, the 2023 report also includes roughly 55 service centres in Austria. The CCF reflects all emissions directly produced within the company (Scope 1) as well as indirect emissions resulting from bought-in electricity and heating (Scope 2). Additional indirect emissions caused by business travel (by plane and train) are also included (Scope 3.6). In 2023, we introduced changes to the process for calculating the CCF. For example, environmental data collection was switched to a professional web-based tool. This has significantly improved the process, both in terms of collecting data and monitoring the results. The transition also led to a change in the calculation, since other emission databases are used in some aspects. In order to compare 2023 with the previous year on the same basis, the 2022 CCF was recalculated using the new tool. The total carbon emissions \n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nfor the 2022 financial year increased by around 3 per cent as a result of the changeover. This increase is partly due to using different emission factors: in the previous year, we used emission factors from Ecoinvent, the Federal Environment Agency, VDA and the IEA, but in the new calculation, Ecoinvent emission factors were used across the board for consistency. Due to system constraints in the choice of emission factors, a higher emission factor was used for flights. The new calculation used a technology-based factor for district heating consumption (compared to a country-specific factor with the old calculation). Fuel consumption for hybrid vehicles was also included. The table below shows the original and recalculated values for 2022. The targets validated by the SBTi will be recalculated for the 2024 financial year following the future availability of data from all owner-occupied buildings, re-submitted for validation and then disclosed accordingly.\n\nIn 2023, absolute market-based greenhouse gas emissions increased by 19 per cent to 9,909 metric tons of CO2 compared with the previous year, while greenhouse gas emissions per employee fell by around 3 per cent. The increase in absolute emissions is explained by the expansion of the accounting group by a further 55 offices in Austria, which has mainly increased Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in heating, and by the first inclusion of the general electricity at the Warsaw office. Similarly, Scope 3 emissions in mobility increased dramatically across countries as business travel resumed after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, refrigerant consumption was included in the CCF calculation for the first time in 2023, which increased emissions by almost 200 metric tons alone. The ongoing transition to green electricity tariffs cushioned the impact. This and the high level of greening for the new sites added to the accounting group in 2023 led to a slight reduction in carbon emissions per employee.\n\n| Corporate carbon footprint5)                          |                        |                     | 20216)   | 20227)<br>(Old calculation) | 20228)<br>(New calculation) | 20239) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Heating             | 323      | 302                         | 282                         | 44     |\n| Scope 1 – Direct emissions                            | t CO2e                 | Vehicles            | 4,208    | 3,599                       | 4,387                       | 4,410  |\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Refrigerant         | n/a10)   | n/a10)                      | n/a10)                      | 197    |\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Electricity         | 2,958    | 2,125                       | 2,324                       | 2,474  |\n| Scope 2 – Indirect emissions<br>(market-based)        | t CO2e                 | District<br>heating | 2,01611) | 1,813                       | 976                         | 1,682  |\n| Scope 3 – Other indirect<br>emissions                 | t CO2e                 | Flights             | 52       | 253                         | 344                         | 64     |\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Train trips         | 28       | 32                          | 32                          | 64     |\n| Total CO2 emissions<br>(market-based)                 | t CO2e                 |                     | 9,585    | 8,124                       | 8,345                       | 9,909  |\n| Total CO2 emissions<br>(market-based) per employee12) | t CO2e per<br>employee |                     | 1.39     | 1.00                        | 1.01                        | 0.99   |\n\n5) Details of the calculations and corresponding definitions of primary energy consumption can be found in the explanatory notes before the table.

In particular, we will explain our approaches to social activities and sponsorships, customer focus and innovative services and products as well as data protection.\n\nNegative macroeconomic trends pose a risk to UNIQA's business model. We are committed to pursuing the UNIQA 3.0 corporate strategy to improve and develop our business so that we can mitigate these risks and contribute to achieving social prosperity.\n\n#### **Social activities and sponsorships**\n\nWe believe that every successful company has an obligation to give back to society.\n\nAs Austria's largest health insurance company, we focus on health and education, supporting physical activity, healthy nutrition and mental resilience for young and disadvantaged people. We also promote non-profit initiatives, especially in art and sport, through targeted sponsorships. UNIQA also places all kinds of emphasis on supporting general interest initiatives. Promoting the arts and sports are important focal points here in all of our markets. In the case of social activities and sponsorship, initiatives must be aligned with corporate values and ethical or sustainability-related standards in order to avoid reputational damage for UNIQA and negative impacts on society. Under the Code for Transparent Cooperation between NGOs and companies, we have been publishing our collaborative partnerships with NGOs and the associated sponsorships and donations on our website since 2020.\n\n#### UNIQA Austria's sponsorship projects in 2023\n\nKURIER Aid Austria educational facilities: supporting deprived children and young people from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds in order to help them enjoy independent learning under their own initiative.\n\nMobile Caritas hospice: the Day Hospice and Mobile Caritas Hospice offer companionship, care and welfare in familiar surroundings for people in the final days of their lives.\n\nMountain Rescue Service (Österr. Bergrettungsdienst): supporting the 13,000 volunteer rescuers who look after and assist people when they encounter difficulties in the mountains.\n\nOne particular highlight last year was supporting the collaboration between UNIQA Stiftung and the Special Olympics Austria (SOÖ) to organise the Inclusion Days. UNIQA Austria is represented at the Special Olympics National Winter Games 2024 in Austria from 14 to 19 March 2024, this time with more than 100 employees from all over Austria. They use their volunteer days for this event to actively contribute and experience inclusion first hand.\n\n| Topic                                   | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate<br>volunteering<br>activities | During the 2023 financial year, the UNIQA Group continued<br>to support social causes through donations, corporate<br>volunteering (UNIQA Sozialtag (volunteer day), and<br>collaboration and initiatives with UNIQA Privatstiftung. | In keeping with our strategy and implementing guidelines,<br>we will continue to put in place suitable measures and<br>initiatives and play our part in general social matters in<br>2024. |\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Customer focus and innovative services and products**\n\nAn insurance company must provide security: our customers expect a level of risk cover that is tailored to their individual circumstances, and we support them in preventing damage and loss with easy customer-friendly communication and rapid processing when there is a claim. As a companion who is there to support our customers, we always think and act from their perspective. Because clarity and transparency play a key role in customer satisfaction, they are given high priority in our internal sales guideline.\n\nThe growing demand for sustainable insurance solutions is strongly shaping our advisory services. Through targeted automation in the advisory process, the UNIQA Group creates a smooth connection between the digital and physical world in order to document the concerns of our customers transparently and efficiently while also making sufficient time for personal consultations. We invest specifically in sustainability training for our sales team, using a variety of training formats such as asynchronous e-learning modules and faceto-face events. We have also been able to obtain support for these measures from experts in academia and NGOs as well as from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action.\n\nWe aim to reduce our ecological footprint by expanding our customer portal myUNIQA. In 2023, around 565,000 registered customers used this innovative service. In addition, more than 21 per cent of our private customers already receive their insurance documents purely digitally by email. This allows us to make relevant savings in carbon emissions.\n\nWe also use customer complaints as an important feedback tool. We deal with requests, problems and complaints quickly using a solution-based approach in order to learn from them and improve our processes. To further simplify the handling of complaints, we are creating a common platform for the Customer Touchpoint & Case Management department and our Ombudsperson's Office, which will be finalised by the end of 2024. In the 2023 reporting year, 1,135 complaints were registered in Austria, a decrease of 11 per cent compared with the previous year (2022: 1,280).\n\n| Topic    | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                         | Outlook for 2024                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Training | Wide range of training formats to integrate sustainability<br>into the advisory approach; testing and implementation of<br>training formats with the support of experts from academia<br>and NGOs. | LIMAK university course for managers in Austria to increase<br>awareness and understanding of sustainability (tailored to<br>UNIQA as a company) |\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Data protection**\n\nSince UNIQA processes a large volume of data as an insurer and trust is one of our company's key success factors, data protection is our top priority throughout the Group. In specific terms, it involves protecting personal data and the individuals these data relate to from misuse during data collection, processing and use. We minimise data protection risks and continuously improve by using structured processes and setting clear priorities. A comprehensive approach to data protection creates trust in UNIQA as a business partner and serves as a positive selling point. Not only are we required to fulfil a range of data protection requirements, but we also have to be able to provide our customers with information about how their data are used at all times.\n\nTo optimise the integration of the new data protection regulations into our day-to-day business operations, we are actively involved in the implementation of the Austrian industry standard for data protection (ÖBS) for the Austrian Insurance Association (VVO), which was approved by the Data Protection Authority in 2022. Our strategy is to establish data protection internally as an interdisciplinary issue. In addition to implementing interfaces and joint processes for information security and risk management, we have also harmonised our policies. We divide data protection risks into four categories: \"operational\", \"financial\", \"reputational\" and \"regulatory\". Implementing and enhancing our data protection management system allows us to deal with these risks in a structured manner and set targeted priorities. This cross-functional collaboration allows the key elements of risk management and information security to be managed more efficiently and considered when handling projects.\n\nWhen introducing new data processing procedures, we conduct consultations and, if necessary, data protection impact assessments that take technical, legal and process factors into account. Based on this analysis, we make decisions on how to implement new processing activities and focus on operational aspects of data protection, process improvements and the introduction of new data protection governance procedures by cross-functional teams. The continuous further development of the data protection management system remains a basic prerequisite in ensuring data protection compliance. There were 24 enquiries from customers regarding the exercising of data subject rights in 2023 in accordance with Article 15 GDPR (confirmation as to whether personal data are being processed and right to information about processing details) and three complaints from customers and third parties to the data protection authority.\n\n| Topic                                              | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                         | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Implementation<br>of data protection<br>governance | Participation in the development and implementation of<br>process management for group projects to ensure data<br>protection in UNIQA International group projects | Further development of the UNIQA Governance Framework<br>for Data Governance to guarantee data protection in<br>an interdisciplinary and cross-functional manner in<br>compliance with future regulations |\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Cybersecurity**\n\nAs one of the largest insurance companies in Europe, the UNIQA Group has already digitalised its business processes to a large extent. This high level of digitalisation requires comprehensive measures to minimise cyber risks and ensure cybersecurity. Effective cybersecurity makes it possible to organise digital business processes and drive innovation, but at the same time harbours the risk of cyberattacks that can potentially cause considerable financial and reputational damage.\n\nThe UNIQA Group's cybersecurity strategy is agile in responding to evolving threats. Every year, the security requirements are aligned with the threat map to test their effectiveness against attack methods. Statutory provisions, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act, are considered in order to meet regulatory requirements. Internal standards and processes are improved to ensure resilience to cyberattacks while at the same time guaranteeing the integrity and confidentiality of customer data.\n\nAction plans and projects to identify critical assets and strengthen security measures were expedited further in 2023. The business continuity method (BCM) for identifying critical assets was refined and implemented across the Group. Critical assets such as IT applications and other important features have been thoroughly investigated for potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and non-conformities. This allows for targeted security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of these assets.\n\n| Topic           | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk assessment | Group-wide implementation of the business continuity<br>method (BCM) for identifying critical assets and carrying<br>out risk assessments | Management of security issues: targeted minimisation of<br>the security risks identified by risk assessments in order<br>to eliminate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities identified<br>based on the risk |\n\n#### **Employee matters**\n\nOur 15,494 employees13) (2022: 15,296) are at the heart of our sustainability journey. Investing in their development, promoting diversity and introducing new working models allows us to improve our organisational capabilities and contribute towards a more sustainable and equitable future. The focus of this section is on our People strategy as well as the associated concepts and measures. Strong engagement in areas such as diversity, inclusion, education and training is essential to prevent brain drain and the loss of talent. The resulting financial and operational barriers have a negative impact not only on the UNIQA Group but also on the labour market.\n\nIn 2023, we created a strategic Group People function that is aligned with our Corporate Strategy 3.0 and our People strategy and addresses the current needs of employees as well as future challenges and opportunities. By introducing the new Group People operating model in all our core countries, we are strengthening international cooperation and developing a clear matrix organisation. Management dashboards with key performance indicators were introduced in all countries as part of strategic HR development. This enables us to monitor relevant data on employee structure and development in an efficient manner, respond flexibly to personnel changes and implement targeted measures for employee retention.\n\n<sup>13)</sup> The employee key figures include data from the fully consolidated insurance companies in the following countries: Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and Ukraine as well as PremiQaMed. Figures as of 31 December.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want to be one of the most attractive employers in the financial sector, true to our motto, \"Living better together\". This year, the first Group-wide Employee Experience survey was therefore conducted with the involvement of all local People teams. The results were made available to all line managers via online dashboards and formed the basis for developing action plans at Group and local level.\n\nAnnual personal targets are set for all employees to help them achieve the company's overarching goals. A feedback meeting between the employee and manager takes place at least once a year, followed by a meeting at the end of the year. There is currently no standardised Group-wide system, so each country applies its own process. We are planning to develop a Group-wide approach and corresponding reporting in 2024.\n\nWith respect to professional development, we attach great importance to our employees continuously learning and growing in order to provide them with access to the latest knowledge and skills. Our UNIQA academies use a mixture of experience-based learning (70 per cent), mentoring from managers and colleagues (20 per cent), and formal training and further education (10 per cent). On average, our employees invested 16.5 hours in training and education during the 2023 reporting year (2022: 14.8 hours). We have also been offering a new management development programme across the entire UNIQA Group since autumn 2022. This specifically addresses the requirements for our forward-looking UNIQA 3.0 programme and aims to transform our management into inspiring coach leaders.\n\nWe prioritize the work-life balance, personal development and health of our employees in our benefits strategy. Flexible working hours and options for working from home support a balanced lifestyle and allow employees to choose the model that suits them best. For this reason, no distinction is made between part-time and full-time employees when granting benefits. We invest in comprehensive training programmes and encourage professional development. We supplement the state's social systems and organise social events on a regular basis. This strategy reflects our commitment to sustainability and employee well-being and is continuously adapted to the needs of our workforce.\n\nAt both PremiQaMed and UNIQA Austria, risks to health and safety in the workplace are identified, assessed and addressed in accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Employee Protection Act (ASchG) and the measures recommended or specified by the responsible safety experts. Furthermore, any incidents that affect employee safety are investigated in accordance with the Employee Protection Act and appropriate steps are taken to prevent future incidents. In addition, safety officers take care of the well-being of employees.\n\n| Topic                    | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                       | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Attractive<br>employer   | The new People operating model introduced as of 1 July<br>2023 and rolled out in all countries to create a strategic<br>Group function in the area now renamed from HR to People | Development of a differentiated Employee Value<br>Proposition (EVP) with local and functional variants that<br>will position the UNIQA Group as a top employer and<br>help us to attract the right people for the right roles;<br>introduction of a modern, AI-supported and dynamic<br>Group-wide careers website |\n| Employee<br>satisfaction | First Group-wide employee experience survey with a<br>response rate of 75 per cent                                                                                               | Expansion of employee surveys at regular intervals<br>(quarterly) and implementation of action plans in the<br>countries                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Reporting                | Management dashboards with strategic People Analytics<br>rolled out in all countries                                                                                             | Overview of local benefits in each country and developing<br>minimum standards for the UNIQA Group                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Diversity and inclusion**\n\nA community the size of ours at the UNIQA Group lives and breathes through diversity. We believe diversity can only be fully effective within an inclusive environment. If inclusion – consisting of policies, practices, ways of behaving and attitudes – is actively embraced, a diverse organisation will be able to harness its full potential.\n\nOur \"Diversity & Inclusion\" (D&I) strategy published in 2022 is the basis for all our activities and is part of our UNIQA 3.0 programme for the future. It is clearly oriented towards our values, the Guiding Principles. In addition to a selection of initiatives, it also includes specific measurable targets focused on two areas, namely equal pay and women in management positions.\n\nEqual pay for work of equal value: A standardised annual process has been established in Austria for evaluating, analysing and developing measures concerning the pay gap. With the help of this process, we have achieved a sustained reduction in the adjusted pay gap at the Austrian location (office staff) from 1.4 per cent in 2021 to 0.6 per cent in 2022 and 202314). In our core markets of Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania, an equal pay analysis was carried out for the first time in 2023, the results of which are awaiting validation.\n\nMore women in management positions15): With the aim of increasing the proportion of women in management positions in Austria, the Women's Career Index was also evaluated in the 2023 financial year. Targeted and successfully implemented measures have boosted our score from 63 to 77 index points since the first evaluation in 2020/2021. Although this is still well below the external benchmark of 81 for financial services companies, it exceeded our 2023 internal target of 70 points. The measures taken include clear communication, the definition of measurable targets, guidelines for filling management positions and promotions, participation in relevant networks, flexible working models, an established mentoring programme and the implementation of models for job sharing and shared/part-time management. Despite an increase in the proportion of women in leading positions in Austria, the target of a 5 percentage point increase remained unachieved at just 2.3 percentage points, which has prompted us to continue focusing on this issue. No specific targets have been set for other locations.\n\n| Women in management positions*                                  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Women in the entire workforce**                                 | 57.8% | 57.9% |\n| Percentage of women among managers***                           | 43.0% | 43.6% |\n| Percentage of women on the Management Boards of local companies | 27.1% | 26.3% |\n| Percentage of women on the Management Board                     | 0.0%  | 11.1% |\n| Percentage of women on the Supervisory Board                    | 33.3% | 33.3% |\n\n\\* Key figures as of the reporting date 31 December.\n\n\\*\\* Total workforce is defined as all persons with a valid employment relationship (excluding holiday interns and temporary staff).\n\n\\*\\*\\* A manager is defined as a person who manages at least one employee.

The UNIQA Inclusion Index is used for this16). Our goal was to increase the baseline score of 3.6 (on a 5-point scale) measured in Austria in 2021 to at least 3.8 by 2023. In Austria, the score rose to 3.9 in 2023.\n\nAge diversity: Overall, the average age of our employees decreased slightly in 2023 compared to the previous year. Changes at management level were minimal, but the average age on the Management Boards in local companies dropped significantly.\n\n|                                            | Age diversity amongst employees |       | Age diversity in management* |       | Age diversity of Management Board<br>members in local companies |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------|------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| as of the<br>reporting date<br>31 December | 2022                            | 2023  | 2022                         | 2023  | 2022                                                            | 2023  |\n| < 30 years old                             | 14.9%                           | 15.4% | 2.2%                         | 1.4%  | 0.0%                                                            | 0.0%  |\n| 30 – 50 years old                          | 57.8%                           | 58.5% | 67.9%                        | 68.9% | 66.1%                                                           | 70.2% |\n| > 50 years old                             | 27.2%                           | 26.1% | 29.9%                        | 29.7% | 33.9%                                                           | 29.8% |\n\n\\* A manager is defined as a person who manages at least one employee.

Our human rights policy embodies our strong commitment to key issues of human rights and ensures that they can be protected and upheld. A violation of human rights through our business activities or through projects or customers insured by us would have a serious impact on the individuals in question and would result in reputational damage and legal consequences for the UNIQA Group.\n\nOur accession to the UN Global Compact in 2020 means we are committed to observing the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights throughout the UNIQA Group. The ten principles contained within this have been incorporated into our Group-wide UNIQA Code of Conduct.\n\nAs an insurer, we strive to protect and promote human rights among our employees, among our suppliers, in our investments (including principal adverse impacts) and in the way we deal with our customers. We implemented dedicated policies and standards in each of the abovementioned areas in order to minimise human rights risks and make the most of opportunities. Examples of this are: UNIQA Guidelines for Responsible Investments, UNIQA Corporate Business Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Standard and the corresponding assessment of ESG risks und UNIQA Diversity & Inclusion Policy.\n\n| Topic                          | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                       | 2024 targets                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Integration of<br>human rights | Embedding the UNIQA Code of Conduct (human rights,<br>labour standards, environmental protection, anti-<br>corruption) in the registration process for suppliers | Further integration of human rights policies into all relevant<br>business lines and core processes |\n\n#### **Combatting corruption and bribery**\n\nAt UNIQA we regard compliance with all relevant statutory regulations, internal Group policies and ethical principles to be an essential part of responsible business practice. A key factor underlying this principle is our awareness that the insurance industry is fundamentally based on trust. Compliance risks such as corruption and bribery have potential economic and legal consequences. The mere suspicion of corruption and bribery can lead to reputational damage and a loss of trust on the part of business partners and customers. Therefore, responsible behaviour is an important basis for our actions.\n\nIn addition to top-quality products and services, UNIQA also strives for the highest standards for employee conduct. That is why we set internal standards for ethical behaviour in our Code of Conduct that go beyond those of the applicable laws, and which are equally binding in all areas of the company. The Code of Conduct is communicated to all employees by the local compliance functions. Its content is also part of the mandatory annual compliance training. The Group Compliance Policy and the Group Compliance Standard describe how the compliance function is organised within the UNIQA Group and contain regulations on key compliance topics, such as preventing corruption, dealing with indications of non-compliance or tasks in connection with the topic of sustainability. The Group compliance team is responsible for creating all these regulations and implementing the compliance programme throughout the entire Group. This central unit is supported by a separate local compliance function within every insurance company of the UNIQA Group.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **UNIQA Group**\n\nWith a premium volume written (including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance) of €7,185.6 million, the UNIQA Group is among the leading insurance groups in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n#### **UNIQA in Europe**\n\nUNIQA offers its products and services via all distribution channels (hired sales force, general agencies, brokers, banks and direct sales) and covers virtually the entire range of insurance lines. UNIQA is the second-largest insurance group in Austria, with a presence in 14 countries of the CEE growth region: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine. In addition, insurance companies in Switzerland and Liechtenstein are also part of the UNIQA Group.\n\nThe listed holding company UNIQA Insurance Group AG manages the Group and also operates the indirect insurance business concluded as active reinsurance with another insurance company. Moreover, UNIQA Insurance Group AG carries out numerous service functions for UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG and its international Group companies, in order to take best advantage of synergy effects and to implement the Group's long-term corporate strategy consistently.\n\n#### **Property and casualty insurance**\n\nThe property and casualty insurance line includes property insurance for private individuals and companies, as well as private casualty insurance. The UNIQA Group received premiums written in property and casualty insurance in the amount of €4,214.3 million in 2023 (2022: €3,683.0 million) – which is 58.7 per cent (2022: 56.2 per cent) of total premium volume. The largest share by far in the volume of property and casualty insurance comes from private consumer business. Most property and casualty insurance policies are taken out for a limited term of up to three years. A broad spread across the different risks of a great many customers and the relatively short terms of these contracts lead to only moderate capital requirements and also make this business segment attractive as a result.\n\n#### **Health insurance**\n\nHealth insurance in Austria includes voluntary health insurance for private customers, commercial preventive healthcare and opt-out offers for certain independent professions such as lawyers, architects and chemists. Although health insurance is still at the early stages in CEE, increased levels of prosperity in the region make the long-term growth potential even greater. Group-wide, in 2023, premiums written totalled €1,388.1 million, (2022: €1,275.9 million) – which is 19.3 per cent (2022: 19.5 per cent) of total premium volume. UNIQA is the undisputed market leader in this strategically important business line in Austria, with around 44 per cent of market share. At around 91 per cent of premiums, the overwhelming majority comes from Austria, with the remaining 9 per cent from international business.\n\n#### **Life insurance**\n\nLife insurance covers economic risks that stem from the uncertainty as to how long a customer will live. It includes savings products such as classic and unit-linked life insurance. There are also biometric products which hedge against risks such as occupational disability, long-term care needs or death. The life insurance business model is oriented towards the long term: policy terms are around 25 years on average. In life insurance, UNIQA reached a premium volume (including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance) of €1,583.2 million Group-wide in 2023 (2022: €1,589.8 million) – which is 22.0 per cent (2022: 24.3 per cent) of total premium volume.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Companies included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements**\n\nIn addition to the annual financial statements of UNIQA Insurance Group AG, the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries in Austria and abroad as well as those of the investment funds under the Group's control. The basis of consolidation – including UNIQA Insurance Group AG – comprised 32 Austrian (2022: 31) and 61 international (2022: 59) subsidiaries as well as 4 Austrian (2022: 4) and 9 international (2022: 9) controlled pension and investment funds. The associates are 4 Austrian companies (2022: 4) that were included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.\n\nDetails on the consolidated companies and associates are contained in the corresponding overviews in the consolidated financial statements. The accounting and measurement methods are also described in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Risk reporting**\n\nUNIQA's comprehensive risk report is included in the notes to the 2023 consolidated financial statements..\n\n#### **Corporate Governance Report**\n\nSince 2004, UNIQA has pledged to comply with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. UNIQA publishes its consolidated Corporate Governance Report at www.uniqagroup.com in the Investor Relations section.\n\n## **Consolidated non-financial statement, consolidated non-financial report**\n\nIn accordance with Section 267a(6) of the Austrian Commercial Code, UNIQA Insurance Group AG prepares its consolidated non-financial statement as a separate summarised non-financial report. The separate condensed non-financial report is prepared and signed by all legal representatives. It is submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and published together with the Group Management Report pursuant to Section 280 of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\n#### **Discontinued operations**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of IFRS 5, all values attributable to the Russian business were recognised in the consolidated income statement (including the comparative period) in the profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (after tax).\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Group business development**\n\n- **•** Premiums written (including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance) rose by 9.7 per cent to €7,185.6 million\n- **•** Technical result at €562.2 million\n- **•** Combined ratio (gross) improved from 91.7 per cent to 89.4 per cent\n- **•** Financial result increased to €150.2 million\n- **•** Earnings before taxes in 2023 increased by 56.6 per cent to €426.4 million\n- **•** Proposed dividend of €0.57 per share for 2023\n\n| UNIQA Group key figures<br>In € million                                                                                                        | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Premiums written, including savings portions from<br>unit-linked and index-linked life insurance                                               | 7,185.6 | 6,548.7 |\n| Cost ratio                                                                                                                                     | 31.0%   | 30.9%   |\n| Combined ratio (gross before reinsurance)                                                                                                      | 89.4%   | 91.7%   |\n| Earnings before taxes                                                                                                                          | 426.4   | 272.3   |\n| Consolidated profit/(loss) (proportion of the profit/(loss)<br>for the period attributable to the shareholders of<br>UNIQA Insurance Group AG) | 302.7   | 256.0   |\n\n### **Changes in premiums**\n\nUNIQA's total volume of premiums written increased in 2023. Taking into account the savings portions from unitlinked and index-linked life insurance, the volume climbed 9.7 per cent to €7,185.6 million (2022: €6,548.7 million). The main driver for this was the solid growth in both property and casualty insurance and in health insurance.\n\n## **Premiums written, including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance**\n\nIn € million\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/13 description: This image is a bar chart comparing values from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the value is 5,373. In 2020, the value is 5,565. In 2021, the value is 6,358. In 2022, the value is 6,549. In 2023, the value is 7,186.\n\nPremiums written in property and casualty insurance grew by 14.4 per cent to €4,214.3 million in 2023 (2022: €3,683.0 million) due to index adjustments and a good sales performance. In health insurance, premiums written rose by 8.8 per cent to €1,388.1 million in the reporting period due to premium adjustments and good new business development (2022: €1,275.9 million). In life insurance, premiums written, including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance, decreased slightly by 0.4 per cent to €1,583.2 million (2022: €1,589.8 million).\n\nPremiums written, including savings portions from unitlinked and index-linked life insurance, at UNIQA Austria increased by 5.0 per cent to €4,290.0 million in 2023 (2022: €4,086.4 million). The UNIQA International segment saw an increase of 13.8 per cent to €2,787.9 million (2022: €2,450.0 million).\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Change in insurance revenue**\n\nThe insurance revenue of the UNIQA Group rose in 2023 by 12.1 per cent to €5,994.1 million (2022: €5,346.9 million). This development was primarily driven by very strong premium growth in property and casualty insurance and an interest rate-induced higher release of the contractual service margin (CSM release) in health insurance and life insurance.\n\nThe release of the contractual service margin amounted to a total of €318.9 million (2022: €314.5 million).\n\nInsurance revenue in property and casualty insurance grew by 12.9 per cent to €4,006.3 million in 2023 (2022: €3,547.8 million).\n\nIn health insurance, insurance revenue in the reporting period rose by 8.3 per cent to €1,234.7 million (2022: €1,139.7 million). The release of the contractual service margin increased by 10.0 per cent to €94.7 million (2022: €86.1 million).\n\nInsurance revenue in life insurance increased by 14.2 per cent to €753.1 million in 2023 (2022: €659.3 million). In contrast, the release of the contractual service margin decreased slightly by 1.9 per cent to €192.2 million (2022: €196.0 million).\n\n#### **Change in insurance service expenses**\n\nThe insurance service expenses of the UNIQA Group rose in 2023 by 11.5 per cent to €5,291.0 million (2022: €4,744.5 million). The main drivers for this were very high burdens from natural catastrophes and major claims – primarily from the Austrian portfolio.\n\nThe overall cost ratio – the ratio of direct and indirect costs to insurance revenue – nevertheless increased only slightly to 31.0 per cent (2022: 30.9 per cent).\n\nInsurance service expenses in property and casualty insurance increased by 10.0 per cent to €3,580.8 million (2022: €3,254.3 million). The cost ratio improved to 31.9 per cent (2022: 32.5 per cent). The combined ratio (gross before reinsurance) fell to 89.4 per cent (2022: 91.7 per cent) despite the significant impact from natural catastrophes and major claims due to the improved cost ratio and excellent technical performance in the international segment.\n\n#### **Combined ratio (gross before reinsurance)** In per cent\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/12 description: This bar chart compares values for 2022 and 2023. The value for 2022 is 91.7, and the value for 2023 is 89.4.

The cost ratio in this segment increased to 18.2 per cent (2022: 17.3 per cent).\n\nIn life insurance, insurance service expenses rose by 32.8 per cent to €600.0 million (2022: €451.7 million). The cost ratio in life insurance increased to 46.9 per cent (2022: 46.0 per cent).\n\n#### **Technical result from reinsurance**\n\nThe technical result from reinsurance in 2023 amounted to €–140.9 million (2022: €–38.4 million). The reason for this increase is the high burden from both natural catastrophes – especially the storms in the summer months – and major claims.\n\n## **Technical result**\n\nIn 2023, the technical result of the UNIQA Group (see Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements) nevertheless remained at nearly the level of the previous year at €562.2 million (2022: €564.0 million).\n\n## **Financial result**\n\nThe UNIQA Group's investment portfolio (including investment property, financial assets accounted for using the equity method and other investments) rose by €1,055.9 million to €20,431.9 million as at 31 December 2023 compared with the last reporting date (31 December 2022: €19,376.0 million).\n\nNet investment income increased in 2023 to €588.8 million due to the excellent current income (2022: €179.8 million). The financial result increased to €150.2 million as a result (2022: €–49.9 million). Due to the recognition of the 15.7 per cent equity-accounted holding in the construction firm STRABAG SE, there was a positive contribution in the amount of €76.0 million in 2023 (2022: €99.6 million).\n\nNet investment income from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance amounted to €306.0 million in 2023 (2022: €–492.5 million).\n\nA detailed description of the financial result can be found in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## **Non-technical result**\n\nThe non-technical result amounted to €–206.4 million in 2023 (2022: €–161.7 million). Other income rose by 22.2 per cent to €436.1 million (2022: €356.7 million), while other expenses increased by 23.9 per cent to €642.5 million (2022: €518.5 million).\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Earnings before taxes**\n\nOperating profit grew by 43.6 per cent to €506.1 million due to the increased financial result (2022: €352.4 million). The UNIQA Group's earnings before taxes increased accordingly by 56.6 per cent to €426.4 million (2022: €272.3 million).\n\n#### **Earnings before taxes**\n\nIn € million\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/5 description: This bar chart compares values for 2022 and 2023. The value for 2022 is 272, and the value for 2023 is 426.\n\nIn property and casualty insurance, earnings before taxes increased to €211.5 million (2022: €9.5 million), while in health insurance they declined by 20.9 per cent to €44.1 million (2022: €55.8 million). Lastly, in life insurance, earnings before taxes fell by 17.5 per cent to €170.8 million (2022: €207.0 million).\n\nIncome tax expense increased in 2023 to €103.2 million (2022: €16.9 million). This increase is due to the decision not to recognise loss carryforwards, which were higher in the financial year, as deferred tax assets. In consequence, the tax burden increased to 24.2 per cent in 2023 (2022: 6.2 per cent).\n\nThe profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations amounted to €323.1 million (2022: €255.4 million). Due to the planned sale of the Russian business, the company incurred a loss from discontinued operations (after tax) in the amount of € $-19.3$  million in 2023 (2022: €0.3 million). As a result, the profit/(loss) for the reporting period was €303.8 million (2022: €255.7 million).\n\nConsolidated profit/(loss) (proportion of the profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the shareholders of UNIQA Insurance Group AG) increased by 18.3 per cent to €302.7 million (2022: €256.0 million). The earnings per share rose to €0.99 (2022: €0.83). The earnings per share from continuing operations was €1.05 in 2023 (2022: €0.83).\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/10 description: The image is a bar graph comparing values for 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the value is 0.83, and in 2023, the value is 0.99. The y-axis ranges from 0.2 to 1.2.\n\n## **Earnings per share**\n\nIn €\n\nThe return on equity (profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations in relation to the average equity excluding non-controlling interests) increased in the reporting year to 14.1 per cent (2022: 11.6 per cent). This calculation does not take into account the effect of the planned sale of the Russian company (profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (after tax)).\n\nOn this basis, the Management Board will propose a dividend of €0.57 per share to the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting (2022: €0.55 per share).\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Dividend per share**\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/2 description: The image is a bar chart showing values from 2019 to 2023. The y axis is labeled \"In €\". In 2019 the value is 0.18, in 2020 the value is 0.18, in 2021 the value is 0.55, in 2022 the value is 0.55, and in 2023 the value is 0.57.\n\n#### **Own funds and total assets**\n\nTotal equity attributable to the shareholders of UNIQA Insurance Group AG increased by €826.9 million to €2,710.2 million in the past financial year (31 December 2022: €1,883.3 million). This was due to the increased measurement of financial instruments available for sale caused by the fall in the general interest rate level at the end of 2023. Non-controlling interests came to €19.9 million (31 December 2022: €17.7 million). Total assets amounted to €28,151.0 million at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €26,641.1 million).\n\n## **Change in contractual service margin**\n\nThe contractual service margin (CSM) declined to €5,266.3 million as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €5,411.0 million). The main reasons for this development were the ongoing release of the contractual service margin in line with the development of the insurance portfolio and the reclassification of the Russian life insurance business as a discontinued operation. In property and casualty insurance, the CSM increased slightly to €61.9 million (31 December 2022: €60.5 million) and in health insurance to €3,366.2 million (31 December 2022: €3,328.3 million). In life insurance, on the other hand, it fell to €1,838.2 million (31 December 2022: €2,022.2 million).\n\n## **Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows**\n\nUNIQA's net cash flow from operating activities amounted to €325.3 million in 2023 (2022: €–532.0 million). Cash flow from investment activities amounted to €41.0 million (2022: €798.3 million). Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to €–333.7 million (2022: €–188.7 million). Overall, cash and cash equivalents increased by €31.9 million to €699.5 million in the 2023 financial year (2022: €667.6 million).\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Employees**\n\nIn 2023, the average number of employees (full-time equivalents, or FTEs) at UNIQA rose slightly to 14,629 FTEs (2022: 14,515).

There is a bonus system in place for managers and selected key employees on the one hand and a profit-sharing scheme for eligible employees on the other. In 2023, around 14 per cent of employees participated in the bonus programme for managers and selected key employees, a variable remuneration system that is linked to both the success of the company and personal performance (2022: around 12 per cent). Around 77 per cent of employees will participate in the profit-sharing scheme for 2023 (2022: around 73 per cent). The amount of the profit-sharing budget depends on the achievement of a profit target, and distributions will only take place after the company's success has been determined in the following year.\n\nIn addition, UNIQA offers young people in training the opportunity to get to know foreign cultures and make international contacts.

As impairment losses were already recognised on the communicated insolvency ratio of 30 per cent as at the reporting date, no material impact on the 2024 financial year and subsequent years is expected.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\n#### **Economic outlook**\n\nWe do not expect to see a prolonged process of economic contraction. GDP in Europe should grow once again by around 1.2 per cent as early as 2024 and in the USA by as much as 1.6 per cent thanks to strong demand. Growth of about 1 per cent is expected in Austria.\n\nDue to the inflation trend, the market strongly expects the first interest rate cuts before mid-2024. Although second-round effects from the sharp wage increases could push prices up again, this effect should be largely offset by the weak economy in China. Significant price reductions on Chinese export goods are generally expected, which should create sufficient room for manoeuvre for interest rate cuts. This means that the end of high inflation is largely in sight: in 2024, the inflation rate in the USA and the eurozone should fall below 2 per cent at times, while the annual average in Austria should be around 3.5 per cent in 2024 according to the IMF. Prices in Eastern Europe are also expected to rise by a maximum of 5 to 6 per cent.\n\nElections in 2024 will be a particularly interesting topic. Although elections will be held in many states and regions this year, the race for the US presidency will clearly be the centre of attention. This election will set the course for global politics for a long time to come and could therefore also have an impact on economic policy.\n\n#### **Business outlook**\n\nFor the 2024 financial year, the last year of our \"UNIQA 3.0 – Seeding the Future\" strategic programme, we are concentrating on further improving our core insurance business in our two home markets of Austria and CEE.\n\nExpectations of strong growth in property and health insurance are based on both targeted sales activities and adjustments in connection with inflation and index developments.\n\nHowever, we again expect pressure on earnings in the 2024 financial year due to rising expenses for insurance benefits (particularly in the areas of property and health insurance) and in the area of costs (primarily due to inflation). It is therefore crucial to maintain strict cost discipline and continuously optimise cost management.\n\nBased on a solvency ratio of at least 170 per cent, we strive to allow our shareholders to participate progressively in the success of our company, i.e. with annually increasing dividend payments. The payout ratio will remain unchanged at up to 60 per cent.\n\nThese forecasts are subject to possible negative influences on our consolidated profit, which may result from geopolitical upheavals and the associated uncertainties for the global capital markets, from a volatile interest rate environment, from the general inflation trend and, above all, from increased claims payments as a result of natural catastrophes. In connection with this, we expect our target profitability to be at the level of 2023.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Information pursuant to Section 243a(1) of the Austrian Commercial Code**\n\n- 1.

The scope and orientation of these systems put in place were designed on the basis of company-specific requirements. Despite creating appropriate frameworks, there is always a certain residual risk because even appropriate and functional systems cannot guarantee absolute security with regard to the identification and management of risks.\n\n#### Objectives:\n\n- a) Identification and measurement of risks that could obstruct the goal of producing (consolidated) financial statements that comply with regulations\n- b) Limiting recognised risks, for example by consulting with external specialists\n- c) Review of external risks with regard to their influence on the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding reporting of these risks\n\nThe aim of the internal control system in the accounting process is to guarantee sufficient security by means of implementing controls so that, despite identified risks, proper financial statements are prepared. Along with the risks described in the Risk Report, the risk management system also analyses additional risks within internal business processes, compliance, internal reporting, etc.\n\n#### **Organisational structure and control environment**\n\nThe company's accounting process is incorporated into the UNIQA Group accounting process. In addition to the SAP S/4 HANA accounting system, a harmonised insurance-specific IT system is also used for the company's purposes. Compliance guidelines and manuals for company organisation, accounting and consolidation exist for the purpose of guaranteeing secure processes.\n\n#### **Identification and control of risks**\n\nAn inventory and appropriate control measures were conducted to identify existing risks. The type of controls was defined in the guidelines and instructions and coordinated with the existing authorisation concept.\n\nThe controls include both manual coordination and comparison routines, as well as the approval of system configurations for connected IT systems. New risks and control weaknesses in the accounting process are quickly reported to management so that it can undertake corrective measures. The procedure for the identification and control of risks is evaluated on a regular basis by an external independent auditor.\n\n#### **Information and communication**\n\nDeviations from expected results and evaluations are monitored by means of monthly reports and key figures, and they form the foundation of information provided to management on an ongoing basis. The management review that is based on this information and the approval of the processed data form the foundation of further treatment in the company's financial statements.\n\n#### **Measures to ensure effectiveness**\n\nRather than being made up of static systems, the internal control and risk management system is adjusted on an ongoing basis to changing requirements and general conditions. In order to identify necessary changes, the effectiveness of all systems must be constantly monitored. The foundations for this are:\n\n- a) Regular self-evaluations by the persons tasked with controls\n- b) Evaluations of key data to validate transaction results in relation to indications that suggest control deficiencies\n- c) Random tests of effectiveness by the Internal Audit department and comprehensive efficacy tests by the Internal Audit department and/or special teams\n\n#### **Reporting to the Supervisory Board/Audit Committee**\n\nIn the context of compliance and internal control and risk management systems, the Management Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee by means of Internal Audit department reports and the separate engagement of external auditors.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Proposed appropriation of profit**\n\nThe separate financial statements of UNIQA Insurance Group AG, prepared in accordance with the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) and the Insurance Supervision Act (VAG), show a net profit of €176,789,324.96 for the 2023 financial year (2022: €171,804,370.90). The Management Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 3 June 2024 that this profit be used for the distribution of a dividend of €0.57 for each of the 309,000,000 entitled no-par-value bearer shares issued as of the reporting date and to carry the remaining amount forward to new account.\n\nVienna, 15 March 2024\n\nQ.

Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recorded prospectively. Risks related to the consequences of climate change were taken into account in the measurement of assets and liabilities, such as in the context of the impairment test for assets as well as in the calculation of technical provisions.\n\nDiscretionary judgements and assumptions regarding the future which could have a significant impact on these Consolidated Financial Statements are described in the following notes:\n\nNote 1: Investment property (assumptions used in determining fair values)\n\nNote 2: Financial assets accounted for using the equity method (assumptions and models used in STRABAG SE's earnings estimates)\n\nNote 3: Other investments and unit-linked and indexlinked life insurance investments (determination of fair values and calculation of expected credit losses)\n\nNote 5: Insurance contracts (assumptions and models for the calculation of assets and liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts)\n\nNote 6: Intangible assets (assumptions used in determining goodwill)\n\nNote 11: Deferred taxes (assessment of the ability to realise deferred tax assets)\n\nNote 12: Defined benefit plans (calculation of the present value of the defined benefit obligations)\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the measurement standards for the individual asset and liability items:\n\n## Statement of financial position item Standard of measurement\n\n**Standard of measurement**\n\n| Assets                                                            |                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                                     | Amortised cost                                                                                                                       |\n| -

The aim of these regulations, which will come into force on 1 January 2024, is to ensure an effective minimum tax rate of 15 per cent for multinational groups.\n\nUNIQA is applying the exemption from recognising and disclosing deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in connection with Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nAt this time, UNIQA is carefully studying the implementation of the minimum tax rate. The current assessment is that it will not give rise to a significant additional tax burden for UNIQA.\n\n## Standards to be applied for the first time\n\n## IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 161\n\nOn 25 June 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published the final accounting standard for insurance contracts – IFRS 17. The date of the initial application of IFRS 17 was set for 1 January 2023. UNIQA is exercising the option for insurance companies to defer the initial application date for IFRS 9 to the initial application date for IFRS 17. IFRS 17 was transposed into EU law through the adoption of Regulation (EU) No. 2021/2036 of 19 November 2021 by the European Commission.\n\nDue to the first application of these two accounting standards, a retrospective restatement was made of the figures for the comparative period and as at the comparative date. The impacts on the assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 1 January 2022 are described and explained below.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Annual Financial Report 2023**\n\n162\n\n| Assets<br>In € thousand                                   | Published<br>31/12/2021

IAS 16.29A results in a reclassification of properties for own use at amortised cost to a fair value measurement. In the item \"Property, plant and equipment\", this leads to an appreciation in the amount of €38,714 thousand in the opening balance in accordance with IFRS 17. This only concerns those properties that are the underlying items in life and health insurance with participation features.\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force\n\nUnder IFRS 17, the item \"Deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force\" is no longer reported separately. Instead, deferred acquisition costs in connection with insurance contracts represent a portion of insurance liabilities. Non-insurance deferred acquisition cash flows as well as the value of business in force are now contained in the item \"Intangible assets\".\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe item \"Intangible assets\" contains the value of business in force (VBI) amounting to €175,028 thousand and non-insurance deferred acquisition cash flows arising in connection with contracts for the management of pension and investment funds amounting to €3,697 thousand. These were previously contained in the item \"Deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force\".\n\n#### Investment property\n\nAs for the property for own use, the investment property was also reclassified for a fair value measurement in accordance with IAS 40.32B. In the item \"Investment property\", this leads to an appreciation in the amount of €1,039,042 thousand.\n\n### Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\n\nInvestments under investment contracts, which were recognised in the \"Other investments\" item under IAS 39, are allocated to the \"Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\" category under IFRS 9. Within the framework of the transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, a reevaluation was also performed for those insurance contracts that do not generate significant insurance risk and do not have any discretionary participation features. The reclassifications between insurance contracts and investment contracts performed in this regard are also reflected in the area of investments for coverage purposes in the items \"Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\" and \"Investments under investment contracts\". In addition, corrections of errors in accordance with IAS 8 totalling €3,109 thousand were recognised in this regard, increasing unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments.\n\n### Receivables and other assets\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 163\n\nThe insurance receivables previously reported under \"Receivables and other assets\" amounting to €339,877 thousand include receivables from policyholders, insurance brokers and insurance companies. Under IFRS 17, these are no longer reported separately, but as part of the liabilities from insurance contracts. The reinsurance settlement receivables, which amount to €95,762 thousand at the transition date, are no longer reported separately under IFRS 17; rather, they are reported under assets from reinsurance contracts. Furthermore, this item now contains the previously separately reported income tax receivables, which amount to €84,900 thousand at the transition date. Other corrections of errors made in connection with financial assets in this item in accordance with IAS 8 increase receivables and other assets by €7,557 thousand.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nThe decline in the item \"Other provisions\" in the amount of €19,220 thousand can be largely attributed to the fact that other provisions in connection with the insurance business are no longer recognised separately.\n\n## Liabilities and other items classified as equity or liabilities\n\nThe re-evaluation of those insurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk and do not have discretionary participation features as part of the transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 led to a reclassification between insurance and investment contracts, which is reflected in an increase of €292,405 thousand in the \"Liabilities and other items classified as liabilities\" item. Further effects resulted from the reinsurance settlement liabilities now contained in the technical provisions in accordance with IFRS 17 as well as from the liabilities to policyholders, insurance brokers and insurance companies in the amount of €326,943 thousand. Furthermore, income tax liabilities in the amount of €115,393 thousand were reclassified to this item at the transition date. Miscellaneous corrections of errors made in connection with other liabilities in accordance with IAS 8 increased liabilities by €3,972 thousand.\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe restatements of items from the statement of financial position impacted deferred tax assets in the amount of\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n€24,438 thousand and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €268,004 thousand.\n\n## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – transitional provisions\n\nSince UNIQA's business is predominantly insurancerelated and UNIQA has not yet adopted IFRS 9 in any other version, it was permissible to defer initial application of IFRS 9 to 1 January 2023.\n\nFor the presentation of restated comparative information for the period prior to the initial application of IFRS 9, UNIQA has applied IFRS 9 using classification overlay. Accordingly, IFRS 9 was also applied to the financial assets disposed of in the course of 2022. Impairments for financial assets were determined on the basis of the IFRS 9 impairment model for expected credit losses.\n\nIn principle, IFRS 9 was applied retrospectively. The following evaluations took place based on the facts and\n\ncircumstances that existed at the date of the initial application:\n\n- the definition of the business model in which a financial asset is held;\n- the revocation of previous designations of specific financial assets that were measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and\n- the designation of specific strategic equity investments not held for trading purposes as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nApplication of the expected credit loss model for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and for financial assets measured at amortised cost led to the recognition of an impairment loss of €196,630 thousand under IFRS 9 on 1 January 2023.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following tables show the effects with respect to the classification and measurement in accordance with IAS 39 as at 31 December 2022 and IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2023.\n\n164\n\n€24,438 thousand and deferred tax liabilities in the\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments – transitional provisions Since UNIQA's business is predominantly insurancerelated and UNIQA has not yet adopted IFRS 9 in any other version, it was permissible to defer initial applicacircumstances that existed at the date of the initial appli-\n\nthe definition of the business model in which a financial\n\n the revocation of previous designations of specific financial assets that were measured at fair value through\n\n the designation of specific strategic equity investments not held for trading purposes as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nApplication of the expected credit loss model for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and for financial assets measured at amortised\n\ncost led to the recognition of an impairment loss of €196,630 thousand under IFRS 9 on 1 January 2023.\n\ncation:\n\nasset is held;\n\nprofit or loss (FVTPL); and\n\nFor the presentation of restated comparative information for the period prior to the initial application of IFRS 9, UNIQA has applied IFRS 9 using classification overlay.

They are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which also includes transaction costs. After initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share in profit/(loss) for the period and in changes in other comprehensive income until the significant influence ends.\n\nAt each reporting date, UNIQA reviews whether there are any indications that the investments in associates are impaired. If this is the case, then the impairment loss is recorded as the difference between the participation carrying amount of the associate and the corresponding recoverable amount and recognised separately in profit/(loss) for the period.

Reclassifications are to be performed prospectively in these cases.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (mandatory):\n\nFinancial assets must be measured at fair value through profit or loss if they\n\n are held within the framework of an \"other\" business model in accordance with IFRS 9; or\n\n the contractual cash flows of the asset do not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (\"SPPI criterion\" is not met).\n\nAll unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments are assigned to an \"other\" business model and are therefore required to be classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAll value changes are recorded in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance<br>investments<br>At 31 December 2023<br>In € thousand | Fixed-income<br>securities | Variable<br>income<br>securities | Loans and<br>other<br>investments | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Investments<br>under<br>investment<br>contracts | Total     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                                              | 1,817,816                  | 2,020,661                        | 175,458                           | 0                                      | 282,439                                         | 4,296,374 |\n| Total                                                                                              | 1,817,816                  | 2,020,661                        | 175,458                           | 0                                      | 282,439                                         | 4,296,374 |\n| Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance<br>investments<br>At 31 December 2022<br>In € thousand | Fixed-income<br>securities | Variable<br>income<br>securities | Loans and<br>other<br>investments | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Investments<br>under<br>investment<br>contracts | Total     |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                                              | 1,785,930                  | 1,875,060                        | 129,686                           | 4                                      | 280,021                                         | 4,070,700 |\n| Total                                                                                              | 1,785,930                  | 1,875,060                        | 129,686                           | 4                                      | 280,021                                         | 4,070,700 |\n\n## Financial assets (required to be) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are required to be recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are\n\n- held as part of a \"hold-and-sell\" business model in accordance with IFRS 9, and\n- the contractual cash flows of the asset represent solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (\"SPPI criterion\" is met).\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.

Changes resulting from the effective interest method, currency translation differences and impairments are recorded in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\n## Business model criterion\n\nTo assess the relevant business models, UNIQA focuses in particular on the strategic management of the investments. As an insurance company, UNIQA holds financial assets mainly to finance liabilities from insurance contracts.\n\nUnder other investments, UNIQA divides the business models into \"hold-and-sell\" and \"hold\". Financial assets under other investments are mainly allocated to the \"holdand-sell\" business model. Only other investments without the intention to sell, such as time deposits and loans, are allocated to the \"hold\" business model.\n\n## SPPI criterion\n\nWhen the SPPI criterion is reviewed, the characteristics of the contractual cash flows are analysed. To analyse the cash flows, UNIQA uses both the specific contracts (such as securities prospectuses) and (semi-)automated IT support from external information systems. External information systems are usually relied upon for exchangetraded securities such as government bonds and corporate bonds because these exchanges record the characteristics of the contractual cash flows in standardised databases.\n\n## Determination of fair value – significant estimates\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 189\n\nA range of accounting policies and disclosures requires the determination of the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. UNIQA has defined a control framework with regard to the determination of fair value. This includes a measurement team, which bears general responsibility for monitoring all major measurements of fair value, including Level 3 fair values, and reports directly to the responsible member of the Management Board.\n\nA review of the major unobservable inputs and the measurement adjustments is carried out regularly. If information from third parties (e.g. price quotations from brokers or price information services) is used to determine fair values, the evidence obtained from third parties is examined in order to determine whether it meets the requirements of IFRSs. The level in the fair value hierarchy to which these measurements are attributable is also tested. Major items in the measurement are reported to the Investment Committee.\n\nAs far as possible, UNIQA uses data that are observable on the market when determining the fair value of an asset or a liability. Based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques, the fair values are assigned to different levels in the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets and liabilities. At UNIQA, these primarily involve quoted shares, quoted bonds and quoted investment funds.\n- Level 2: measurement parameters that are not quoted prices included in Level 1 but which can be observed for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices), or are based on prices from markets that have been classified as inactive. The parameters that can be observed here include, for example, exchange rates, yield curves and volatilities. At UNIQA, these include in particular quoted bonds that do not fulfil the conditions under Level 1, along with structured products.\n- Level 3: measurement parameters for assets or liabilities that are not based or are only partly based on observable market data. The measurement here primarily involves application of the discounted cash flow method, comparative procedures with instruments for which there are observable prices and other procedures. As there are no observable parameters here in many cases, the estimates used can have a significant impact on the result of the\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nmeasurement. At UNIQA, it is primarily other equity investments, private equity and hedge funds as well as structured products that do not fulfil the conditions under Level 2 that are assigned to Level 3.\n\nIf the inputs used to determine the fair value of an asset or a liability can be assigned to different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the entire fair value measurement is assigned to the respective level of the fair value hierarchy that corresponds to the lowest input significant for the measurement overall.\n\nUNIQA recognises reclassifications between different levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the change occurred.\n\nThe measurement processes and methods are as follows:\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nFor the measurement of investments, the procedures best suited for the establishment of the corresponding value are applied. The following standard valuation techniques are applied for financial instruments which come under Levels 2 and 3:\n\n- Market approach\n- The measurement method in the market approach is based on prices or other applicable information from market transactions which involve identical or comparable assets and liabilities.\n- Income approach\n- The income approach corresponds to the method whereby the future (expected) payment flows or earnings are inferred on a current amount.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 191\n\n## Valuation techniques and inputs in the determination of fair values\n\n190\n\nmeasurement.

fixed-income securities is the specific credit spread. In order to be able to measure these securities in a discounted cash flow model, the spreads are determined using a selection of reference securities with comparable characteristics. For the fixed-income securities in Level 3, an increase in the discount rate by 100 basis points results in a 4.6 per cent reduction in value (2022: 9.7 per cent). A reduction in the discount rate by 100 basis points results in a 3.6 per cent increase in value (2022: 8.5 per cent).\n\n#### Other\n\nOther securities under Level 3 mainly comprise private equity funds and other equity investments. Private equity funds are measured based on the net asset values which are determined by the fund manager using specific unobservable inputs for all underlying portfolio positions. This is done in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines.\n\n#### Securities lending transactions\n\nSecurities loaned within the framework of securities lending continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position, as the significant opportunities and risks are not transferred through the lending. In return, UNIQA receives collateral in the form of securities, which are accordingly not recognised in the statement of financial position. As at the reporting date, the carrying amount of the financial assets lent in the category \"Fixed-income\n\nsecurities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\" from securities lending transactions amounted to €526,158 thousand (2022: €530,299 thousand). The equivalent value of the collateral received is €571,583 thousand (2022: €591,932 thousand).

Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss and equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (\"FVOCI option\") are not subject to the impairment model.\n\nTo determine the expected credit losses, UNIQA uses a credit deterioration model in which the amount of the risk provision to be recognised is based on the change in the default risk of a financial instrument following its addition. The risk provision is also recognised for expected losses and therefore represents a prospective impairment in the amount of the present value of the expected credit losses. The expected credit losses are determined as at the measure-ment date as the difference between the discounted contractual cash flows and the risk-weighted cash flows. The scenario-based risk weighting of the cash flows is carried out using the probability of default and the loss given default. The model that UNIQA uses to determine expected credit losses aims to come up with an undistorted, scenario-weighted amount. It does this by taking into account the time value of money as well as data on current economic conditions and their future forecasts that are available at the measurement date without unreasonable time and cost. The probabilities of default also include forward-looking information and take the macroeconomic development of the unemployment rate into account as well as the high-yield spreads.\n\nThe probability of default is the probability that debtors will be unable to meet their payment obligations, either within the next twelve months or over the entire remaining term. The loss given default corresponds to the expectation of how much the loss of a financial asset will be in the event of default.\n\nUNIQA obtains most of the data used to calculate the probability of default and the loss given default from external data sources. The probability of default is determined at issuer level, and the loss given default is allocated on the basis of long-term averages of individual classes of financial instruments. In cases where specific input data is not completely available from external data sources (e.g. financial assets that are not externally rated), the risk parameters were allocated on the basis of benchmarks of comparable instruments and expert assessments.\n\nThe time value of money (which is needed to determine the expected credit losses) is the effective interest rate of the respective financial asset, determined at the time when the financial asset was acquired.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 197\n\nThe expected credit loss of a financial instrument is determined based on the assigned impairment level on the measurement date either as the present value of the expected defaults over the next twelve months or as the present value of the expected defaults over the entire remaining term.\n\nAt each measurement date, all financial assets within the scope of the impairment model are assigned to an impairment level.\n\nThe expected credit loss of a financial instrument is determined based on the assigned impairment level on the measurement date.\n\nFor Level 1 financial instruments, an impairment is recognised in the amount of the 12-month expected credit loss (12-month ECL). The 12-month ECL represents a portion of the total expected credit losses (lifetime ECLs) that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within twelve months after the reporting period. Financial instruments for which no significant increase in the credit risk was determined on the measurement date as well as financial instruments first recognised on the measurement date are assigned to Level 1. Furthermore, instruments with a low default risk (investment grade) are regularly assigned to Level 1 of the impairment model. UNIQA makes use of the option of not analysing a significant increase in credit risk for instruments with a low default risk (investment grade – in UNIQA's model up to the equivalent of a rating level of BBB-) on the measurement date.\n\nFor Level 2 financial instruments, an impairment is recognised in the amount of the present value of the expected credit losses over the entire remaining term. Financial instruments for which a significant increase in the credit risk was identified on the measurement date are assigned to Level 2.\n\nFor Level 3 financial instruments, an impairment is recognised in the amount of the present value of the expected credit losses over the entire maturity. Financial instruments viewed as having diminished creditworthiness on the measurement date are assigned to Level 3.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nUNIQA assesses a significant increase in credit risk overall on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria. To make this quantitative assessment, the probability-ofdefault curve over the lifetime at the measurement date is compared with the forward-looking probability-of-default curve over the lifetime at the time of initial recognition. A significant increase in credit risk is normally assumed whenever there is a relative doubling of the probability of default since the date of purchase. If a significant increase in credit risk is determined on the measurement date, an allocation to “Level 2” is made. As a backstop for the identification of a significant increase in the credit risk of a financial instrument, contractual cash flows are assumed to be overdue at more than 30 days.\n\nIn the overall assessment, a qualitative evaluation of the level allocation for Level 1 or Level 2 is also carried out based on external market indicators and by subject matter experts. In the qualitative assessment, particular consideration is given to factors such as a significant change in contractual terms, a borrower's ability to repay their other exposures, as well as external factors with a potentially significant influence on the borrower's ability to repay.\n\nAn allocation to \"Level 3\" (credit-impaired financial assets) of the impairment model is made if one or more events with an adverse effect on the expected future cash flows of the financial asset occur. Among others, UNIQA considers the following events to be indicators:\n\n- significant financial difficulties on the part of the issuer or borrower;\n- default of or overdue contractual cash flows;\n- financial concessions by lenders;\n- increased likelihood of insolvency or restructuring proceedings;\n- disappearance of an active market due to the financial difficulties of the financial asset; and\n- financial assets with a large discount that already reflects the credit losses incurred.\n\nIn addition, a financial instrument is assigned to Level 3 if contractual cash flows are more than 90 days in default. To assess whether a financial asset is credit-impaired, the indicators are considered both individually and collectively.\n\n## Expected credit losses on fixed-income securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nChanges in value recognised on the basis of the impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 for expected credit losses in the category \"Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\" amount to €–30,642 thousand (2022: €–162,866 thousand).\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Change in impairment                                        |         | Stage 1 |        | Stage 2 |         | Stage 3 |         | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| In € thousand                                               | 2023    | 2022    | 2023   | 2022    | 2023    | 2022    | 2023    | 2022    |\n| At 1 January                                                | 21,514  | 4,096   | 14,726 | 2,930   | 160,390 | 0       | 196,630 | 7,026   |\n| Reclassification as assets in disposal groups held for sale | -15,728 |         | -8,970 |         | -4,808  |         | -29,506 |         |\n| Increase due to acquisition or founding                     | 3,665   | 3,923   | 0      | 0       | 0       | 0       | 3,665   | 3,923   |\n| Changes due to transfer between stages                      | 880     | 352     | -857   | 105     | -23     | -457    | 0       | 0       |\n| Transfers from Stage 1                                      | -122    | 177     | 122    | 280     | 0       | -457    | 0       | 0       |\n| Transfers from Stage 2                                      | 980     | 176     | -980   | -176    | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0       |\n| Transfers from Stage 3                                      | 23      | 0       | 0      | 0       | -23     | 0       | 0       | 0       |\n| Decrease due to derecognition                               | -1,862  | -432    | -1,878 | -344    | -6,813  | 0       | -10,553 | -776    |\n| Changes due to risk parameters                              | -2,345  | 16,977  | 459    | 15,186  | 39,415  | 157,921 | 37,530  | 190,084 |\n| Changes from currency translation                           | -612    | -3,404  | -182   | -3,150  | -452    | 2,926   | -1,246  | -3,628  |\n| At 31 December                                              | 5,512   | 21,514  | 3,299  | 14,726  | 187,710 | 160,390 | 196,521 | 196,630 |\n\n1) The shares of profit/(loss) attributable to the discontinued operations are included in this presentation to enable a reconciliation with the level as at 31 December 2022.

Transitional provisions, judgements and estimates as well as significant accounting policies in connection with this accounting standard, which came into force on 1 January 2023, are explained below.\n\n## Transitional provisions\n\nAs at the transition date to IFRS 17, a large part of UNIQA's insurance portfolio consists of contracts where the conclusion of the contract sometimes dates back decades. IFRS 17 basically stipulates that the standard must be applied fully retrospectively. This means that the items in the statement of financial position should be determined as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. Full retrospective application requires at least an annual roll-up of the contractual service margin over the entire term of the contract, since its inception.\n\nFull retrospective application of IFRS 17 is not practicable for UNIQA for the following reasons:\n\n- The required contract master data and data on transactions concerning the contracts are not available retrospectively with the necessary granularity.\n- The determination of expected future cash flows and their adjustment in the event of non-economic changes in assumptions (e.g. mortality assumptions) is not possible retrospectively, as even in that case no better knowledge would be available (\"without hindsight\").\n- The same applies to the determination of the required allocation of costs attributable to the insurance portfolio.\n- For contracts with participation features, economic assumptions and historical IFRS 17 specifics such as the financing component are not available for stochastic modelling prior to initial application.\n- In the long-term property and casualty insurance business, the historical parameters for determining the technical provisions can only be determined with disproportionate effort and a subdivision into cohorts is not possible due to the lack of historical information for tacit renewals.\n\nIf the full retrospective application of IFRS 17 is not practicable, which is the case for UNIQA, there are two alternatives available:\n\nmodified retrospective approach; and\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 201\n\nfair value approach.\n\nThe aim of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the best possible approximation to a full retrospective application. Under the fair value approach, the contractual service margin of a group of insurance contracts at the transition date is determined as the difference between the fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 and the corresponding fulfilment cash flows determined under IFRS 17. UNIQA uses both approaches.\n\nThe choice of the appropriate approach for determining the IFRS 17 opening balance is made at the level of portfolios of insurance contracts. To make this choice, it must be determined for all groups in the portfolio whether the contracts are onerous at initial recognition or whether there is no significant probability that they could become onerous.\n\nIn connection with the modified retrospective approach, IFRS 17 allows several modifications to the full retrospective application, of which the following are applied at UNIQA. These modifications can be applied if the required detailed information from prior periods is not available. Due to the lack of availability of contract information in the required granularity, UNIQA is applying the modification IFRS 17.C10, which allows the omission of a subdivision of contract groups by underwriting years.\n\nApplication of the modified retrospective approach for contracts without discretionary participation features:\n\n- UNIQA applies the modifications IFRS 17.C12– C14 for contracts without discretionary participation features. Those deal with the determination of the expected future cash flows, their interest, the risk adjustment and the insurance acquisition cash flows for the initial recognition of groups of insurance contracts. Based on these modifications, a contractual service margin or loss component is determined at the date of initial recognition of groups of insurance contracts.\n- The modifications IFRS 17.C15 and IFRS 17.C16 are applied to adjust the carrying amount of the contractual service margin or loss component from the date of initial recognition to the date of transition to IFRS 17.\n- For portfolios containing contracts with different underwriting years, UNIQA applies the modification IFRS 17.C18(b). This results in the cumulative revaluation reserve being determined as nil at the transition date, provided the OCI option in accordance with IFRS 17.88(b) applies.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor contracts with discretionary participation features, the provisions of IFRS 17.C17 can be applied, which require the contractual service margin to be determined from the following portfolio information:\n\n- the differences between the fair value of the underlying items and the fulfilment cash flows at the date of the transition to IFRS 17;\n- an adjustment for amounts charged by the company to the policyholders before that date;\n- adjustments for the changes in the risk adjustment before that date;\n- adjustment of the carrying amount of the contractual service margin from the date of initial recognition to the date of transition to IFRS 17.\n\nIf this results in a loss component, this must be determined as nil in accordance with IFRS 17.C17(e).\n\nFor insurance contracts with direct participation features, the cumulative amount from the underlying items recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income was recognised in other comprehensive income at the transition date in accordance with IFRS 17 C24(c) and C18(b)ii.\n\nCentral parameters in connection with the fair value approach are, on the one hand, the solvency capital requirement and, on the other hand, the selection of a suitable capitalisation rate. The solvency capital requirements correspond to those under Solvency II (for companies in EU countries) as well as the corresponding local regulations. When determining the contractual service margin using the fair value approach, the appropriate profit margin to be realised is decisive. To determine this, the present value of the expected costs of holding sufficient capital to cover the own funds that the buyer must manage during the remaining term of the portfolio is calculated. For this purpose, the target own funds is defined for each future year.\n\nThe profit margin that the buyer requires is then defined as the present value of the future costs of holding the additional capital for the remaining life of the portfolio. To determine the present value, the capitalisation rates corresponding to those used in the impairment test for goodwill as at 31 December 2021 are applied. Acquisition cash flows incurred before the transition date are not taken into account in the fair value approach and are therefore not recognised in subsequent periods under insurance revenue or insurance service expenses.\n\n## Judgements and estimates\n\n## Judgements\n\nInformation on judgements that have a material effect on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements is provided below:\n\n- Identification of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features: assessment of whether a significant insurance risk is transferred and the contracts thus fall within the scope of IFRS 17, or whether there are any contracts with direct participation features.\n- Determination of the level of aggregation: identification of portfolios of insurance contracts as well as determination of groups of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition and groups of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently.\n- Variable fee approach: assessment of the applicability of the variable fee approach for contracts with direct participation features.\n- Premium allocation approach: applicability of the premium allocation approach for long-term contracts.\n- Estimates of future cash flows: estimates of expected cash flows in connection with the fulfilment of the contract.\n- Insurance acquisition cash flows: determination of whether the insurance acquisition cash flows can be directly allocated.\n- Interest rate assumptions: determination of the yield curves to be used for discounting.\n- Measurement: determination of the method for calculating the risk adjustment for non-financial risk and the coverage units provided.\n- Transitional provisions: determination whether sufficient reasonable and supportable information is available to perform a full or modified retrospective application.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Assumptions and estimates\n\n202\n\nFor contracts with discretionary participation features, the provisions of IFRS 17.C17 can be applied, which require the contractual service margin to be determined\n\nJudgements and estimates\n\nments is provided below:\n\nous subsequently.\n\nipation features.\n\nrectly allocated.\n\ncurves to be used for discounting.\n\ncoverage units provided.\n\ntract.\n\ntion.\n\nInformation on judgements that have a material effect on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial State-\n\n Identification of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features: assessment of whether a significant insurance risk is transferred and the contracts thus fall within the scope of IFRS 17, or whether there are any\n\n Determination of the level of aggregation: identification of portfolios of insurance contracts as well as determination of groups of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition and groups of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming oner-\n\n Variable fee approach: assessment of the applicability of the variable fee approach for contracts with direct partic-\n\n Premium allocation approach: applicability of the premium allocation approach for long-term contracts.

However, these changes would lead to an adjustment of the contractual service margin and would not affect the carrying amount of the insurance contracts, unless the changes result from onerous contracts or do not relate to future benefits:\n\n- Property and casualty insurance contracts: assumptions related to claims development and claims frequency.\n- Health and life insurance contracts: assumptions for estimates of future cash flows related to mortality, longevity, disability or morbidity, customer behaviour (lapse) and profit participation rate.\n\nThe assumptions regarding discount rates and the development of costs have an influence on all the lines of insurance business.\n\nSignificant assumptions and estimates in connection with calculating the fulfilment cash flows, the contractual service margin and the investment component are explained below.\n\n## Fulfilment cash flows\n\nFulfilment cash flows comprise:\n\n- estimates of future cash flows;\n- discounting to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks related to the future cash flows;\n- a risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe objective of an estimate of future cash flows is to determine the expected value of a range of scenarios that reflects the full range of possible outcomes. The cash flows from each scenario are discounted and weighted by the estimated probability of that outcome to derive an expected present value. UNIQA applies stochastic modelling if the cash flows are influenced by complex underlying factors and they therefore do not react linearly to changes in the economic environment. This is the case, for example, with contracts with participation features. If this is not the case, a deterministic calculation is used.\n\nThe estimates of future cash flows incorporate, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows. The information is based on company-specific data provided that the estimates are consistent with observable market data\n\nand the assumptions adequately consider future scenarios. When estimating the cash flows, UNIQA takes into account current expectations of future events that might affect those cash flows. Expectations of future changes in legislation that would change or discharge the present obligation or create new obligations under the existing insurance contract are not taken into account until the change in legislation is substantively enacted.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 203\n\nCash flows within the boundary of an existing insurance contract relate directly to the fulfilment of the contract, including those cash flows for which UNIQA can decide the amount or maturity at its own discretion. These cash flows include premiums, insurance benefits, insurance acquisition cash flows and other costs incurred to fulfil the contract.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows result from the sale of insurance contracts and are directly attributable to the portfolio to which the contract belongs. Other costs recognised in the cash flows are:\n\n- claims handling costs;\n- policy administration and maintenance costs, including recurring commissions; and\n- asset management costs.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows and other costs also include fixed and variable overheads directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts. Such overheads are allocated to groups of contracts using methods that are systematic and rational, and are consistently applied to all costs that have similar characteristics.\n\nAcquisition cash flows and administrative costs are distributed using the premiums written to the respective group of insurance contracts. Claims handling costs are distributed using the actual claims for the respective group of insurance contracts.\n\nInsurance contracts in one group can affect or be affected by the cash flows to policyholders of contracts in a different group (mutualisation). This is the case, for example, when the policyholders share the returns on the same specified pool of underlying items with policyholders of other contracts and the guarantee agreement of one group leads to a reduction in the share of the returns of another group.\n\nMutualisation affects the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows for the groups concerned. The fulfilment cash flows for a group include all payments arising from the\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nterms of existing contracts to policyholders of contracts in other groups and exclude payments to policyholders in the group that have been included in the fulfilment cash flows of another group.\n\nThe contract boundaries determine which future cash flows are to be included in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts. Cash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they result from substantive rights and obligations that exist during a specific period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay the premium or in which UNIQA has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholders with insurance contract services.\n\n## Significant assumptions incorporated into calculating future cash flows\n\n## Property and casualty insurance\n\nFuture cash flows from premiums are estimated using contract data taking future lapses by policyholders into account. The lapse rate is derived from experience in previous years at product group level.\n\nLoss or cost ratios and associated payment patterns are derived from past experience to estimate future cash flows from future service and costs. Where necessary, judgements are also made as to the extent to which past trends can also be expected in the future, as well as whether new trends should be taken into account.\n\nReserves for incurred claims that have not yet been settled, including incurred claims that have not yet been reported, are usually estimated using generally accepted statistical triangular methods (such as chain ladder or Bornhuetter-Ferguson) on the basis of the years in which they occurred. These methods assume that past experience provides a sufficiently good indication of claims payments in the future. Other best practice methods (such as methods based on loss frequency and loss amount) are only used in exceptional cases. The selection of the appropriate method for the respective sub-portfolio is a significant judgement. From the claims payments determined in this way, the future cash flows are finally estimated using settlement patterns also derived from past experience.\n\n#### Health insurance and life insurance\n\nThe best estimate assumptions described below are determined based on past, present and expected developments. These are reviewed and updated at least once a year.\n\n## *Profit participation assumptions*\n\nThe policyholder's assumed profit participation for the corresponding life insurance business is derived for each economic scenario using the management rules. The profit participation is calculated in accordance with the profit participation regulations applicable by law.\n\n#### *Cost assumptions*\n\nCost assumptions are based on the directly attributable actual costs incurred in the years prior to the measurement date. Future additional costs are taken into account in the cost allocation, whereas extraordinary costs are eliminated. The expected cost trend during the projection period is based on the portfolio development, taking into account differences in administrative expenses depending on relevant contract features, such as higher administrative expenses for contracts subject to premiums compared to premium-free contracts.\n\n#### *Lapse assumptions*\n\nThe lapse rate is based on an analysis of previous lapse rates and the average of comparable financial years. The lapse rate for new products is based on similar products from the past.\n\n#### *Commission assumptions*\n\nThe commission estimates are based on the applicable commission agreements.\n\n#### *Mortality and disability assumptions*\n\nMortality and disability assumptions are based on the best estimate of future events.

Where necessary, judgements are also made as to the extent to which past trends can also be expected in the future, as well as whether new\n\nReserves for incurred claims that have not yet been settled, including incurred claims that have not yet been reported, are usually estimated using generally accepted statistical triangular methods (such as chain ladder or Bornhuetter-Ferguson) on the basis of the years in which they occurred. These methods assume that past experience provides a sufficiently good indication of claims payments in the future. Other best practice methods (such as methods based on loss frequency and loss amount) are only used in exceptional cases. The selection of the appropriate method for the respective sub-portfolio is a significant judgement. From the claims payments determined in this way, the future cash flows are finally estimated using settlement patterns also derived from past experience.\n\nAll cash flows are discounted using the adjusted risk-free yield curve, which reflects the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. The risk-free base rates for all relevant currencies are calculated using swap and government bond market data. The underlying market data sources and the parameters required for the interpolation and extrapolation of the risk-free base curves are harmonised with those of EIOPA. The risk-free curve, including adjustments, is extrapolated to a final forward interest rate after the last liquid market data point. The ultimate forward rate reflects long-term real interest rate and inflation expectations and is updated in accordance with the EIOPA parameters.\n\nThe risk-free yield curve is adjusted by an illiquidity premium to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. Illiquidity adjustments are determined by calculating risk-adjusted spreads on government and corporate bonds within the portfolio of the respective entity. Cash flows that fluctuate based on the yields of the underlying items are adjusted to account for the effects of this volatility using risk-neutral modelling techniques and discounted using the risk-free interest rates including the illiquidity adjustment.\n\n## *Assumptions regarding cash flows to be paid to policyholders*\n\nInsurance contracts without direct participation features often give rise to cash flows to policyholders over which the entity has some discretion. To determine how to identify a change in discretionary cash flows, the basis on which commitments under the contract are to be determined shall be specified at inception of the contract. A change in the discretionary cash flows is regarded as relating to future service, and the carrying amount of the contractual service margin is adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 205\n\nRisk adjustment is the amount that would be required as consideration for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from nonfinancial risk. This reflects the risk compensation effect of insurance contracts issued, which is in line with the consideration required and reflects the degree of risk aversion.\n\nIn property and casualty insurance, the risk adjustment is determined using the confidence level method. In health insurance and life insurance, the cost of capital method is applied.\n\nFor proportional reinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is derived from that of the primary insurance. The basis for this is the ratio between gross and net liability for incurred claims.\n\n## Confidence level technique\n\nThe probability distribution of all expected future cash flows is estimated and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is calculated as the difference between the median of the future cash flows and the value-at-risk, measured with a percentile of 75 per cent.\n\n## Cost of capital approach\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk is determined using a cost of capital rate applied to the required principal for all future years. The resulting capital requirements are discounted using a risk-free yield curve adjusted to include a premium for the illiquidity. The required principal is determined by estimating the probability distribution of all future present values of the cash flows and determining the capital required to meet the contractual obligations with a confidence level of 99.5 per cent over the term of the contracts. The cost of capital rate is the additional consideration that investors would demand for exposure to nonfinancial risk. The cost of capital rate is 6 per cent (2022: 6 per cent)\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Contractual service margin\n\nThe contractual service margin is a component of the carrying amount of the asset or liability for a group of insurance contracts representing the unearned profit from a group of insurance contracts that UNIQA will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future.\n\nAn amount of the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts is recognised in profit or loss in each period to reflect the insurance contract services provided under the group of insurance contracts in that period.\n\n## Identifying the coverage units\n\nThe number of coverage units in a group of insurance contracts is the quantity of insurance contract services provided by the contracts in the group.\n\nThese services include:\n\n- insurance coverage (coverage for an insured event);\n- investment-related services (for insurance contracts with direct participation features): concerns the management of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder; and\n- investment-return services (for insurance contracts without direct participation features).\n\nThe amount recognised in profit or loss is based on the number of coverage units in a group. This number is determined by considering for each contract the quantity of the benefits provided under the contract and its expected coverage period. The coverage units are reviewed once a year and adjusted if necessary.\n\n#### Basis for determining the coverage units\n\n| Life insurance products                                 |                                                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Endowment assurance                                     | Sum insure                                                                                           |\n| Risk insurance                                          | Sum insure                                                                                           |\n| Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance             | Sum insure                                                                                           |\n| Pension insurance                                       | Liability for remaining coverage for investment services and<br>pension for insurance benefits       |\n| Insurance contracts with participation features         | Liability for remaining coverage except for pension                                                  |\n| Reinsurance                                             | Reinsurance premium                                                                                  |\n| Property and casualty insurance products (all products) | Premiums written adjusted for inflation                                                              |\n| Health insurance products                               | Number of existing insurance contracts<br>adjusted for inflation and weighted by annual net premiums |\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor unit-linked and index-linked life insurance, the sum insured represents both insurance benefits and investment benefits – the risk portion is allocated to insurance benefits, while the liability for remaining coverage is allocated to investment benefits.\n\nIn life insurance, the time value of money is taken into account when identifying the coverage units.\n\nUNIQA does not make use of the risk mitigation option provided for in IFRS 17.B115.\n\n## Investment component\n\n206\n\nContractual service margin\n\nThe contractual service margin is a component of the carrying amount of the asset or liability for a group of insurance contracts representing the unearned profit from a group of insurance contracts that UNIQA will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future.\n\nIdentifying the coverage units\n\nThese services include:\n\nand adjusted if necessary.\n\nand\n\nEndowment assurance Sum insured Risk insurance Sum insured Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance Sum insured Pension insurance Liability for remaining coverage for investment services and\n\nInsurance contracts with participation features Liability for remaining coverage except for pensions Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums\n\nProperty and casualty insurance products (all products) Premiums written adjusted for inflation\n\nHealth insurance products Number of existing insurance contracts\n\nvided by the contracts in the group.\n\nThe number of coverage units in a group of insurance contracts is the quantity of insurance contract services pro-\n\n insurance coverage (coverage for an insured event); investment-related services (for insurance contracts with direct participation features): concerns the management of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder;\n\ninvestment-return services (for insurance contracts\n\nThe amount recognised in profit or loss is based on the number of coverage units in a group.

Investment components may not be recognised in insurance revenue or insurance service expenses.\n\nIn life insurance, the investment component during the coverage period results from the lower of the surrender value and the contractually determined amount of the insurance benefit. At the end of the coverage period, the investment component is calculated with the maturity benefit.\n\n## Applicable accounting policies\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts through which a significant insurance risk is assumed. Investment contracts are contracts that do not transfer a significant insurance risk and that do not include discretionary participation features. They fall under the scope of IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments).\n\nUNIQA holds both inward and outward reinsurance contracts. The carrying amount of the portfolios from inward reinsurance contracts (assumed reinsurance) is shown together with the carrying amount of the primary insurance contract portfolios.\n\nInsurance contracts can be divided into contracts with direct participation features and contracts without participation features. Insurance contracts with direct participation features are those for which, at inception:\n\n the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n\n the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 207\n\n the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the changes in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nFor insurance contracts that meet the aforementioned criteria, the variable fee approach must be applied. Whether the aforementioned criteria are met is assessed at inception of the contract and may not be reassessed at a later date unless the contract is modified. In addition, the variable fee approach is applied in health insurance long-term business as well as in unit-linked and index-linked life insurance.\n\nAll other insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts held are classified as insurance contracts without direct participation features and are measured accordingly using the general measurement model or, if the conditions are met, the premium allocation approach.\n\n## Level of aggregation and approach\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nFor measurement purposes, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups. A group of insurance contracts is determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts subject to similar risks and managed together. The defined portfolios are subdivided as follows:\n\n- a group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition;\n- a group of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently; and\n- a group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio.\n\nThe aforementioned groups are further subdivided by underwriting years, as only contracts sold within one year may be included in the same group.\n\nIn respect of the obligation to form annual cohorts, which prevents contracts issued more than one year apart from each other from being included together in a group of insurance contracts, an option was established as part of the transposition of IFRS 17 into EU law. According to this option, the European Commission allows users in the EU to not apply the requirement under IFRS 17.22 for certain contracts. UNIQA makes use of this option and applies it in connection with participating contracts. For these\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\ncontracts, new business is presented in the cohort of the transition date.\n\nPrimary insurance contracts and inward reinsurance contracts are recognised at the earliest of the following dates:\n\n- the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts;\n- the date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due; and\n- for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous.\n\nThe group of insurance contracts is established at initial recognition and no subsequent reassessment of the composition of the groups is permitted. If the recognition criteria are met, the contract is allocated to an existing group of insurance contracts or, if the contract may not be allocated to the existing groups, a new group is formed.\n\n#### Reinsurance contracts held\n\nThe grouping of reinsurance contracts held (outward reinsurance) is based on the same principles as for primary insurance, with the exception that reinsurance contracts cannot be onerous. \n\nA group of reinsurance contracts is recognised at the following dates:\n\n- proportional reinsurance contracts: at initial recognition of any underlying insurance contract;\n- non-proportional reinsurance contracts: at the beginning of the coverage period of the group. However, if a group of onerous underlying insurance contracts is recognised, recognition is at that date, provided the related reinsurance contract was in force at or before that date.\n\nReinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance are mostly non-proportional contracts.\n\nThe separation between assets and liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts is carried out in accordance with IFRS 17.78, which stipulates that portfolios of insurance and reinsurance contracts that are assets must be presented separately from those that are liabilities.\n\n## Insurance acquisition cash flows\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows are allocated to the groups of insurance contracts using a systematic method, if direct allocation to the group is possible, otherwise at portfolio level. To take changes in assumptions into account, the inputs are reviewed for the allocation method applied at the end of each reporting period.\n\nWhen applying the premium allocation approach, UNIQA does not make use of the option to recognise insurance acquisition cash flows as expenses for insurance contracts with a duration of up to one year.\n\n## Contract boundaries\n\nAll the future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group are included in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts. Whether the cash flows are within the contract boundary is determined as follows:\n\n#### Insurance contracts (including assumed reinsurance)\n\nCash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the policyholder is compelled to pay the premiums or in which UNIQA has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance contract services.\n\nA substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when:\n\n- UNIQA has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those risks; or\n- if these criteria are not met for an individual contract but are met for a portfolio and the pricing of the premiums for the coverage period to date does not take into account the risks that relate to future periods.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Reinsurance contracts\n\n208\n\ntransition date.\n\ntracts;\n\ncomes onerous.\n\nthe group becomes due; and\n\nReinsurance contracts held\n\nof any underlying insurance contract;\n\nare mostly non-proportional contracts.\n\ncannot be onerous.\n\nlowing dates:\n\ncontracts, new business is presented in the cohort of the\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows\n\nwith a duration of up to one year.\n\nContract boundaries\n\nvices ends when:\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows are allocated to the groups of insurance contracts using a systematic method, if direct allocation to the group is possible, otherwise at portfolio level.

The fulfilment cash flows include estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment reflecting the time value of money and financial risks, and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk is derived separately from the other estimates and represents the compensation for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk.\n\nThe contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts depicts the unearned profit that UNIQA will generate with the future provision of services. If there is a net cash inflow on initial recognition, a contractual service margin is recognised to avoid profit recognition. The fulfilment cash flows are compensated by the recognition of the contractual service margin and thus lead to a liability for remaining coverage of zero at initial recognition.\n\nIf there is a net outflow of funds, the contracts are onerous. This amount is recognised in profit or loss and shown as a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage. The reversal of the loss component is shown as an expense reduction in the \"insurance service expenses\" item.\n\nThe provisions relating to initial recognition also apply to the variable fee approach. The differences between the general measurement model and the variable fee approach only arise in subsequent measurement and concern the adjustment of the contractual service margin and determination of insurance finance income or expenses.\n\n#### *Insurance contracts – subsequent measurement*\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 209\n\nSince UNIQA also prepares interim financial statements applying IAS 34, the accounting option regarding the treatment of accounting estimates made in interim financial statements must be observed. An entity has an accounting option to change the treatment of accounting estimates made in previous interim financial statements when applying IFRS 17 in subsequent interim financial statements and in the annual reporting period. UNIQA applies the year-to-date approach, i.e. the treatment of accounting estimates in previous interim financial statements is changed and thus the annual result is not affected by estimates in interim financial statements.\n\nThe measurement of the fulfilment cash flows is based on current estimates of future cash flows, current discount rates and current estimates of the risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk at each reporting date. The change in the fulfilment cash flows is recognised as follows:\n\n- In the event of changes relating to future service, the contractual service margin is adjusted. If the fulfilment cash flows increase, the contractual service margin is reduced; if they decrease, the contractual service margin is increased. If an increase in the fulfilment cash flows exceeds the amount of the contractual service margin, this is reversed in full and the excess amount is recognised as a loss in the insurance service expenses. If, over time, there is a reduction in the fulfilment cash flows, this is recognised as income in the insurance service result until the accumulated losses have been made up. A contractual service margin is again created for the excess.\n- In the event of a change relating to current and past service, the change is recognised in profit or loss under insurance service expenses.\n- Effects of changes in connection with financial assumptions are recognised through profit or loss under insurance finance income or, in cases where the OCI option is applied, divided between insurance finance income and other comprehensive income.\n\nThe contractual service margin of a group of contracts measured using the general measurement model is\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\ncalculated at the end of the financial year from the opening balance adjusted for:\n\n- the contractual service margin of any new contracts;\n- the interest accreted on the carrying amount of the contractual service margin during the reporting period (applying the discount rate determined at the date of initial recognition);\n- the changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service;\n- the effect of any currency exchange differences; and\n- the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of insurance contract services.\n\nThe aforementioned changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service include:\n\n- experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the period that relate to future service, and related cash flows (such as insurance acquisition cash flows);\n- changes in estimates of the present value of the future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, except for the effect of the time value of money and the effect of financial risk;\n- differences between any investment component in life insurance expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that becomes payable in the period; and\n- changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future service.\n\nBecause a change in discretionary cash flows is considered as a future service, the carrying amount of the contractual service margin is changed.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the variable fee approach, there are differences in the adjustment of the contractual service margin with regard to subsequent measurement compared to the general measurement model.\n\nA contract with direct participation features exists if UNIQA has the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items as well as a variable fee that is retained in exchange for the future service provided by the insurance contract. The variable fee comprises the share to which UNIQA is entitled depending on the varying underlying items.\n\nThe contractual service margin of a group of contracts measured using the variable fee approach is calculated at the end of the financial year from the opening balance adjusted for:\n\n- the contractual service margin of any new contracts;\n- the change in the amount of UNIQA's share of the fair value of the underlying items unless the decrease in the amount of the company's share exceeds the carrying amount of the contractual service margin and a loss component would therefore have to be recognised or adjusted;\n- the changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to future service unless the increase in the fulfilment cash flows would exceed the carrying amount of the contractual service margin and therefore a loss component would have to be recognised or adjusted;\n- the effect of any currency exchange differences; and\n- the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of insurance contract services.\n\nThe components to be considered in determining the changes in the fulfilment cash flows related to future service are the same as in the general measurement model, but are measured using current discount rates, and also include the change in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks not arising from the underlying items.\n\n#### *Loss component*\n\nAfter a loss has been recognised on onerous insurance contracts and a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage has been established, subsequent changes in fulfilment cash flows must be allocated on a systematic basis between the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for remaining coverage, excluding the loss component.\n\nChanges in the fulfilment cash flows to be taken into account in the systematic allocation include:\n\n- estimates of the present value of future cash flows for claims and expenses released from the liability for remaining coverage because of incurred insurance service expenses;\n- changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk recognised in profit or loss because of the release from risk; and\n- insurance finance income or expenses.\n\nThe systematic allocation is calculated as the share of the loss component divided by the present value of future cash outflows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. In addition, the variable fee approach takes into account\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe company's share of the change in the fair values of the underlying items divided by the expected claims and expenses.\n\nThe systematic allocation shall result in the total amounts allocated to the loss component being equal to zero by the end of the coverage period of a group of contracts.\n\nAny subsequent decreases in the fulfilment cash flows due to changes in the estimated future cash flows relating to future service as well as any subsequent increases in the company's share of the fair value of the underlying items do not result in a split between the liability for remaining coverage with a loss component and the liability for remaining coverage without a loss component. An allocation to the loss component shall only be made until that component has been reduced to zero.\n\n## *Reinsurance contracts held*\n\nFor the measurement of the reinsurance cession, the general measurement model is applied, but with some modifications.\n\n#### *Initial measurement*\n\n210\n\ning balance adjusted for:\n\nrecognition);\n\nfinancial risk;\n\nin the period; and\n\nrelate to future service.\n\nservice margin is changed.\n\nmodel.\n\nservice;\n\ncalculated at the end of the financial year from the open-\n\nthe end of the financial year from the opening balance ad-\n\n the changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to future service unless the increase in the fulfilment cash flows would exceed the carrying amount of the contractual service margin and therefore a loss component would have\n\n the effect of any currency exchange differences; and the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of\n\nThe components to be considered in determining the changes in the fulfilment cash flows related to future service are the same as in the general measurement model, but are measured using current discount rates, and also include the change in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks not arising from the underlying items.\n\nAfter a loss has been recognised on onerous insurance contracts and a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage has been established, subsequent changes in fulfilment cash flows must be allocated on a systematic basis between the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for remaining coverage, ex-\n\nChanges in the fulfilment cash flows to be taken into ac-\n\n estimates of the present value of future cash flows for claims and expenses released from the liability for remaining coverage because of incurred insurance service\n\n changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk recognised in profit or loss because of the release from risk;\n\nThe systematic allocation is calculated as the share of the loss component divided by the present value of future cash outflows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.

The default risk is measured at every reporting date and any changes are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAn amount corresponding to the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer is recognised as the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe requirements related to determining the contractual service margin on initial recognition are modified to reflect the fact that for a group of reinsurance contracts held there is no unearned profit but instead a net cost or net gain on purchasing the reinsurance.\n\nOn initial recognition, the contractual service margin therefore represents any net cost or net gain, measured as follows:\n\n- the fulfilment cash flows;\n- the amount derecognised at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised;\n\n any cash flows arising at the date of initial recognition; and\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 211\n\n- any income from the recognition of a loss-recovery component.\n- However, if the net cost relates to events that occurred before the purchase of the group of reinsurance contracts held, this cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss as an expense.\n\n## *Subsequent measurement*\n\nThe carrying amount of the contractual service margin at the end of the reporting period is measured as the carrying amount determined at the start of the reporting period, adjusted for:\n\n- the effect of any new contracts added to the group;\n- interest accreted on the carrying amount of the contractual service margin, measured at historical interest rates;\n- recognition of revenue from the coverage of onerous primary insurance contracts (loss-recovery component);\n- reversals of a loss-recovery component to the extent those reversals are not changes in the fulfilment cash flows of the group of reinsurance contracts held;\n- changes in the fulfilment cash flows, measured at the discount rates applicable at initial recognition, to the extent that the change relates to future service unless the change results from a change in the fulfilment cash flows from onerous primary insurance contracts;\n- the effect of any currency exchange differences arising on the contractual service margin; and\n- reversal through profit or loss of the contractual service margin because of services received in the period.\n\nA loss-recovery component can only be recognised if the reinsurance contract held is concluded at the same time as or before the recognition of the underlying onerous insurance contracts. The amount for the loss-recovery component, which adjusts the contractual service margin and is recognised in profit or loss, is determined as follows:\n\nMultiplying the reported profit or loss from the underlying insurance contracts by the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts that are expected to be reimbursed by the reinsurer.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Contracts measured using the premium allocation approach\n\nThe measurement is carried out using the premium allocation approach if the following criteria are met:\n\n- if the coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less (taking the specific contract boundaries into account); or\n- if it can be expected that the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage would not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying the general measurement model. This criterion is not met if at the inception of the group significant variability in the fulfilment cash flows is expected that would affect the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage during the period before a claim is incurred.\n\nThese criteria are predominantly applicable in the area of property and casualty insurance. If the criteria are not met, the general measurement model is used.\n\nFor contracts with an average term of one to three years, the premium allocation approach is applied. This approach was developed through sensitivity analyses by comparing the amount of the liability for remaining coverage calculated using the general measurement model and the premium allocation approach.\n\nFor contracts with an average term of more than three years, an estimate must be made regarding the stability of the liability for remaining coverage. This estimate is made using a calculation model in which non-financial assumptions (risk adjustment for non-financial risk, cost, loss ratio and lapse rate) and financial assumptions (interest rate) are stressed after one year. The difference of the liability for remaining coverage in each stressed scenario as well as the basic scenario is compared to a defined threshold.\n\nAll reinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance are measured using the premium allocation approach, for the following reasons:\n\n- The majority of reinsurance contracts are based on claim years with a duration of one year; and\n- for contracts based on the underwriting year, a concept was created that addresses the contract term and the variability of the fulfilment cash flows. All contracts have an average term of up to three years.\n\nIn health insurance, there are only one-year reinsurance contracts, which is why measurement using the premium allocation approach is permissible.\n\nThe reinsurance contracts in life insurance are measured using the premium allocation approach if the contracts have a contract boundary of up to one year and the coverage period is also a maximum of one year.\n\nFor the initial recognition of insurance and reinsurance contracts measured using the premium allocation approach, the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage corresponds to the premiums received minus the insurance acquisition cash flows.\n\nIn subsequent measurement of insurance and reinsurance contracts measured using the premium allocation approach, the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage is increased by the premiums received in the period plus any amounts relating to the amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows. The carrying amount is reduced by the amount recognised as insurance revenue for services provided in the reporting period and for insurance acquisition cash flows in the reporting period. Discounting of the liability for remaining coverage is not carried out, as the contracts do not have a significant financing component.\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage is increased through profit or loss if it is determined during the coverage period that a group of contracts is onerous. The loss to be recognised is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage determined using the premium allocation approach and the (discounted) fulfilment cash flows that relate to remaining coverage determined using the general measurement approach.\n\nThe liability for incurred claims is measured using the fulfilment cash flows relating to claims incurred.

Derecognition also occurs in the event of modifications to the contract in the following cases:\n\n- The modified contract terms would have meant that at initial recognition\n\t- the modified contract would not have fallen within the scope of IFRS 17;\n\t- various components would have had to be separated from the host insurance contract, resulting in a different insurance contract;\n\t- the modified contract would have had a substantially different contract boundary; or\n\t- the modified contract would have been included in a different group of contracts.\n- There is a change in the contract category with or without direct participation features.\n- Due to the contract modifications, the criteria for applying the premium allocation approach are no longer met.\n\nFor contract modifications that do not result in derecognition, the changes in cash flows are treated as changes in estimated fulfilment cash flows. Exercising a right included in the terms of a contract is not a modification.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 213\n\nDisclosures in the consolidated balance sheet are made at portfolio level. The carrying amounts of the portfolios, depending on whether they represent an asset or a liability, are added up and accordingly disclosed separately. These disclosure criteria must also be applied to the reinsurance contracts held, which must also be reported separately from primary insurance. The respective carrying amounts of inward reinsurance are included in the primary insurance.\n\nThe amounts presented in consolidated profit or loss and in other comprehensive income are to be disaggregated into an insurance service result, comprising insurance revenue and insurance service expenses, and insurance finance income or expenses. Investment components may not be presented in insurance revenue or insurance service expenses.\n\nThe balances of reinsurance held are also recognised in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income separately from the primary insurance amounts. In contrast to primary insurance, there is an option to report the insurance service result for the reinsurance as a single amount. UNIQA makes use of this option.\n\nAll the changes in the risk adjustment of non-financial risk can be shown in the insurance service result. Disaggregation of the changes into an insurance service result and insurance finance income or expenses is not required. UNIQA makes use of this option.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Insurance revenue: contracts that are not measured using the premium allocation approach\n\nInsurance revenue represents the amount of consideration for the provision of services under insurance contracts and constitutes the change in the liability for remaining coverage. The expected consideration must cover the following items:\n\n- The claims expected for the reporting period at the beginning of the year and expenses allocated to the contracts. Amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage, repayments of investment components, insurance acquisition cash flows and transaction-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties (e.g. insurance tax) are excluded from this.\n- Change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. This does not include changes that relate to future service (adjustments to the carrying amount of the contractual service margin) or amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage.\n- Amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss for the services provided in the period.\n- Experience adjustments for premium receipts that relate to current and past service.\n- The portion of the premium that relates to recovering insurance acquisition cash flows. The allocation is carried out pro rata temporis to the reporting period to be allocated. Assuming that insurance contracts are priced in such a way that the insurance acquisition cash flows are earned back, the same amount is also recognised as an insurance service expense.\n\n## Insurance revenue: contracts measured using the premium allocation approach\n\nWith the premium allocation approach, the insurance revenue of a period corresponds to the amount of the expected premium receipts in that period. To allocate the service provided under the insurance contract to the current period, the expected premium receipts are allocated on the basis of the passage of time.\n\n#### Insurance service expenses\n\nInsurance service expenses are recognised in profit or loss as soon as they are incurred and include:\n\n- incurred claims and other incurred insurance service expenses\n- amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows\n- loss components as well as reversals of these loss components\n- adjustments to the liability for incurred claims (except those adjustments arising from discounting)\n- Insurance service expenses shall not include any investment components.\n\n#### Insurance service result from reinsurance held\n\nThe insurance service result includes the amounts reimbursed by the reinsurer, the premiums allocated to the period, and any gains or losses from the change in the lossrecovery component.\n\n#### Insurance finance income or expenses\n\nChanges in the carrying amount resulting from the effect of changes in the time value of money and financial risk must be reported under insurance finance income or expenses.\n\nInsurance finance income or expenses also includes changes in the underlying items.\n\nFor both the general measurement model and the variable fee approach, the OCI option in accordance with IFRS 17.88(b) is applied where the respective allocated financial instruments on the asset side are also measured through other comprehensive income. This option is exercised at the level of the portfolio of insurance contracts. The amounts not recognised in other comprehensive income are determined by a systematic allocation over the duration of the group of insurance contracts and recognised in profit or loss.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor contracts measured using the general measurement model as well as the premium allocation approach, the discount rate determined at initial recognition (\"locked-in yield curve\") is applied.\n\n214\n\nInsurance revenue: contracts that are not measured us-\n\nInsurance service expenses\n\npenses\n\nnents\n\npenses.\n\nment components.\n\nrecovery component.\n\nas soon as they are incurred and include:\n\nInsurance service expenses are recognised in profit or loss\n\nincurred claims and other incurred insurance service ex-\n\nloss components as well as reversals of these loss compo-\n\nadjustments to the liability for incurred claims (except\n\nInsurance service expenses shall not include any invest-\n\nChanges in the carrying amount resulting from the effect of changes in the time value of money and financial risk must be reported under insurance finance income or ex-\n\nInsurance finance income or expenses also includes\n\nfee approach, the OCI option in accordance with\n\nFor both the general measurement model and the variable\n\nIFRS 17.88(b) is applied where the respective allocated financial instruments on the asset side are also measured through other comprehensive income.

Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are generally accounted for using the cost model.\n\nGains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded under the item \"Other non-technical income\", while losses are recorded under \"Other non-technical expenses\".\n\nIf the use of a property changes and an owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the property is reclassified as investment land and buildings with the carrying amount at the date of the change.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over a useful life for buildings of 15 to 80 years and for technical systems and operating and office equipment of 2 to 20 years. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed on every reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit/(loss) for the period after cost sharing in the technical result and other non-insurance service expenses.\n\nThe exercise of the measurement option in accordance with IAS 16.29A in connection with initial application of IFRS 17 resulted in a transition from the cost model to fair value measurement for those properties that constitute underlying items in life and health insurance with participation features. Investment property is measured using the same model.\n\n## Leases\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 239\n\nThere are around 1,700 contracts throughout the entire Group which fall within the scope of the standard and for which UNIQA is lessee. Nearly all contracts are simple standard contracts. They mainly relate to real estate and in part to operating and office equipment. A significant portion of the capitalised rights of use consists of a small number of contracts concluded for an indefinite period. For these contracts, estimates were made on the basis of the most probable assumptions regarding the term and the exercise of termination options. The terms on which the calculation of these contracts is based are up to 50 years. The average term of the remaining contracts is between three and five years.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the liability consists of the risk-free interest rate adjusted for country risk, creditworthiness and a repayment factor.\n\nLeases with a contractual term of less than twelve months and low value assets were not recognised. Leases where the underlying asset value does not exceed a new value of €5 thousand and those with a contract term of less than twelve months were not recognised.\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Historical cost<br>In € thousand                                               | Land and<br>buildings for<br>own

In order to test the impairment for goodwill, the recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined. Impairment is recognised when the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its value to be covered, consisting of goodwill and the proportional net assets. The impairment of goodwill is recognised in profit/(loss) for the period under the item \"Amortisation of VBI and impairment of goodwill\".\n\n## Determination of the recoverable amount – significant estimates\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGUs with goodwill allocated is calculated on the basis of value in use by applying generally accepted measurement principles by means of the dividend discount method. The budget projections (detailed planning phase) of the CGUs, the estimate of the long-term net profits achievable by the CGUs and longterm growth rates (perpetuity) are used as the starting point for determination of the capitalised value.\n\nThe capitalised value is determined by discounting the future profits with a suitable capitalisation rate after assumed retention to strengthen the capital base. In the process, the capitalised values are separated by the three business lines, which are then totalled to yield the value for the CGU.\n\n#### Cash flow forecast (multi-phase model)\n\nPhase 1: five-year company planning\n\nThe detailed company planning generally encompasses a period of five years. The company plans used for the calculation are the result of a structured and standardised management dialogue. This includes an integrated reporting and documentation process and takes into account empirical values from previous planning periods as well as UNIQA's sustainability strategy and associated climaterelated aspects. The plans are formally approved by the Group Management Board and also include material assumptions regarding the combined ratio, capital earnings, market shares and the like.\n\n#### Phase 2: perpetuity growth rate\n\nThe last year of the detailed planning phase is used as the basis for determining cash flows in phase 2. The perpetuity growth rate is based on medium-term growth forecasts of the respective national economy. The underlying growth assumptions depend on the geographical location and range from 1 to 4 per cent. Various studies and statistical analyses were used as sources to provide a basis for determining the growth rates in order to consistently and realistically reflect the market situation and macroeconomic development. The reference sources include our own research, as well as country risks, growth rate estimations and multiples published by Damodaran (NYU Stern).\n\n#### Determining the capitalisation rate\n\nThe assumptions with regard to risk-free interest rate, market risk premium and business line betas made for determining the capitalisation rate are consistent with the\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nparameters used in the UNIQA planning and controlling process.

The betas for the non-life, life and health insurance business lines were determined using the revenues in the relevant business lines of the individual peer group companies. The health insurance business line, which is strongly focused on the Austrian market, is operated in a manner similar to life insurance. A uniform beta factor for personal insurance is therefore used in relation to the health and life insurance lines.\n\nIn Austrian measurement practice, the market risk premium is derived at the reporting date from the implied market return based on capital market data. The growth factor is derived in the same manner as the growth in the profit from ordinary activities in the impairment test.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 243\n\nAn additional country risk premium was defined in accordance with Professor Damodaran's models. The basic principles for calculation of the country risk premium in accordance with the Damodaran method are as follows: the spread of credit default swap spreads in a rating class of \"risk-free\" US government bonds is determined starting from the rating of the country concerned (Moody's). Then the spread is adjusted by the amount of the volatility difference between equity and bond markets.\n\nThe calculation also factored in the inflation differential for countries outside the eurozone. In general, the inflation differential represents inflation trends in different countries and is used as a key indicator in assessing competitiveness. In order to calculate the inflation differential, the deviation of the inflation forecast for the country of the CGU in question in relation to the inflation forecast for a risk-free environment (Germany, in this case) was used. This is adjusted annually in the detailed planning by the expected inflation, and is subsequently applied for perpetuity with the value of the last year of the detailed planning phase.\n\n| Capitalisation rate 2023                                        |  | Discount factor       |                  | Discount factor perpetuity |                  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| In per cent                                                     |  | Property/<br>casualty | Life &<br>health | Property/<br>casualty      | Life &<br>health |\n| Albania/Kosovo/North Macedonia as subgroup of the SIGAL Group1) |  | 14.2 – 15.2           | 14.5 – 15.5      | 13.4 – 15.7                | 13.7 – 16.7      |\n| Bulgaria                                                        |  | 10.0                  | 10.3             | 10.5                       | 10.7             |\n| Austria                                                         |  | 8.7                   | 8.7              | 8.7                        | 8.7              |\n| Poland                                                          |  | 12.3                  | 12.6             | 9.9                        | 10.2             |\n| Czechia                                                         |  | 10.1                  | 10.4             | 9.0                        | 9.3              |\n| Hungary                                                         |  | 14.0                  | 14.3             | 12.0                       | 12.3             |\n\n1) The discount rate ranges listed for the SIGAL Group relate to the spread over the respective countries grouped under these headings.\n\n| Capitalisation rate 2022                                        | Discount factor   |               | Discount factor perpetuity |               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| In per cent                                                     | Property/casualty | Life & health | Property/casualty          | Life & health |\n| Albania/Kosovo/North Macedonia as subgroup of the SIGAL Group1) | 11.8 – 13.9       | 12.1 – 14.1   | 14.5 – 17.1                | 14.8 – 17.1   |\n| Bulgaria                                                        | 9.1               | 9.3           | 11.1                       | 11.1          |\n| Austria                                                         | 9.0               | 9.3           | 9.0                        | 9.3           |\n| Poland                                                          | 16.9              | 17.1          | 10.3                       | 10.3          |\n| Czechia                                                         | 10.7              | 11.0          | 9.3                        | 9.6           |\n| Hungary                                                         | 17.7              | 17.9          | 12.8                       | 13.0          |\n\n1) The discount rate ranges listed for the SIGAL Group relate to the spread over the respective countries grouped under these headings.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Sensitivity analyses\n\nIn order to substantiate the results of the calculation and estimation of the value in use, sensitivity analyses with regard to the capitalisation rate and the main value drivers are performed.\n\nThese analyses show that sustained surpluses on the part of the individual CGUs are highly dependent on the actual development of these assumptions within the individual national or regional economies (GDP, insurance density, purchasing power parities particularly in the CEE markets) as well as the associated implementation of the individual profit goals. The biggest factor of uncertainty for the forecasts and the associated assessment of the future market situation is the further impact of the war in Ukraine and the consequences of the current phase of high interest rates.\n\nIn the event that the insurance markets develop very differently from the assumptions made in those business plans and forecasts, impairment losses may have to be recognised on the goodwill carried.\n\nA sensitivity analysis shows that only a combination of an interest rate increase of 100 bp and a simultaneous change in cash flows of –10 per cent would result in a shortfall in the value in use of €28.5 million for the CGU Poland and €3.2 million for the CGU Czechia. However, a change in only one of these two parameters does not result in a shortfall in the value in use.\n\n#### Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include both purchased and internally developed software, which is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life of 2 to 20 years.\n\nCosts that are incurred at the research stage for internally developed software are recognised through profit or loss for the period in which they were incurred. Costs that are incurred in the development phase are deferred provided that it is foreseeable that the software will be completed, there is the intention and ability for future internal use, and this will result in a future economic benefit.\n\nThe amortisation of other intangible assets is reported in the profit/(loss) for the period after cost sharing in the technical result and other non-insurance service expenses.\n\n#### Measurement of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of UNIQA's non-financial assets – excluding deferred tax assets – are reviewed at every reporting date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If this is the case, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The goodwill and intangible assets under development are tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs. If there is none, an annual test is done.\n\nImpairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. In the case of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that it does not increase the carrying amount of the asset above the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## Value of business in force and non-insurance deferred acquisition costs\n\nThe values of life, property and casualty insurance policies in accordance with IFRS 17 as well as pension fund contracts relate to expected future margins from purchased operations. They are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The redemption of the current value of business in force follows the progression of the estimated gross margins. The amortisation of the value of business in force is recognised in the profit/(loss) for the period under \"Amortisation of VBI and impairment of goodwill\".\n\nDeferred acquisition costs not related to contracts are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15. These are essentially contracts for the management of pension and investment funds. They recognise costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been concluded. The amortisation is carried out pro rata temporis over the term of the underlying contracts.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 245\n\n|

In January 2022, a decision was taken in Austria to reduce the corporate tax rate to 24 per cent in 2023 and to 23 per cent from 2024. Consequently, the reduced tax rates were taken into account for the calculation of deferred taxes – depending on the maturity. National tax regulations in conjunction with life insurance profit participation may lead to a different calculated income tax rate.\n\n| Reconciliation statement<br>In € thousand  | 1 – 12/2023 1 – 12/2022<br>restated |         |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Earnings before taxes                      | 426,373                             | 272,328 |\n| Expected tax expenses1)                    | 102,329                             | 68,082  |\n| Adjusted by tax effects from               |                                     |         |\n| Tax-free investment income                 | -21,901                             | -31,263 |\n| Amortisation of goodwill                   | 0                                   | 18      |\n| Tax-neutral consolidation effect           | -908                                | 3,270   |\n| Other non-deductible expenses/             |                                     |         |\n| other tax-exempt income                    | 2,431                               | -11,312 |\n| Changes in tax rates                       | 5,041                               | -15,442 |\n| Deviations in tax rates                    | -29,703                             | -4,435  |\n| Tax deducted at source                     | 1,255                               | 3,792   |\n| Taxes for previous years                   | 8,713                               | -1,318  |\n| Lapse/impairment of loss carryforwards and |                                     |         |\n| other                                      | 35,980                              | 5,550   |\n| Income tax expenses                        | 103,236                             | 16,941  |\n| Average effective tax burden               |                                     |         |\n| (in per cent)                              | 24.2                                | 6.2     |\n\n1) Earnings before taxes multiplied by the corporate income tax rate\n\n#### Group taxation\n\nIn Austria, UNIQA exercises the option of forming a group of companies for tax purposes. There are three taxable groups of companies with the parent groups UNIQA Insurance Group AG, PremiQaMed Holding GmbH and R-FMZ Immobilienholding GmbH.\n\nThe group members are generally charged, or relieved by, the corporation tax amounts attributable to them by the\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nparent groups through the distribution of their tax burden in the tax group. Losses from foreign group members are also included within the scope of taxable profits. The tax realisation for these losses is accompanied by a future tax obligation to pay income taxes at an unspecified point in time. A corresponding provision is therefore formed for future subsequent taxation of foreign losses.\n\n#### 12. Deferred taxes\n\nThe calculation of deferred taxes is based on the specific tax rates of each country, which were between 9 and 24 per cent in the financial year (2022: between 9 and 25 per cent).\n\nThe deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities stated in the consolidated statement of financial position performed as follows:\n\n## Net deferred tax In € thousand\n\n| In € thousand |\n|---------------|\n|               |\n\n| At 1 January 2022 restated                       | –53,673  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Changes recognised in profit/(loss)              | 52,224   |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income | 201,097  |\n| Foreign exchange differences                     | 1,014    |\n| At 31 December 2022 restated                     | 200,662  |\n| At 1 January 2023                                | 200,662  |\n| Changes recognised in profit/(loss)              | –65,543  |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income | –202,546 |\n| Changes due to changes in basis of consolidation | –3,135   |\n| Reclassifications held for sale                  | –1,422   |\n| Foreign exchange differences                     | 65       |\n| At 31 December 2023                              | –71,918  |\n\nChanges recorded in other comprehensive income essentially relate to measurements of financial instruments and insurance and reinsurance contracts as well as remeasurements of defined benefit obligations.\n\nThe differences between the tax carrying amounts and the carrying amounts in the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position have the following effect:\n\n| In € thousand                                                |  | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022<br>restated |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--|------------|------------------------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                          |  |            |                        |\n| Technical items                                              |  | 89,939     | 180,791                |\n| Investments                                                  |  | 333,565    | 980,930                |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit<br>obligations |  | 42,590     | 33,832                 |\n| Loss carried forward                                         |  | 2,816      | 1,629                  |\n| Other items                                                  |  | 64,188     | 146,655                |\n| Total                                                        |  | 533,098    | 1,343,836              |\n| Netting effect                                               |  | -453,882   | -1,110,053             |\n| Total after netting                                          |  | 79,216     | 233,782                |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                     |  |            |                        |\n| Technical items                                              |  | 218,995    | 302,957                |\n| Investments                                                  |  | 96,070     | 716,927                |\n| Other items                                                  |  | 289,951    | 123,290                |\n| Total                                                        |  | 605,016    | 1,143,174              |\n| Netting effect                                               |  | -453,882   | -1,110,053             |\n| Total after netting                                          |  | 151,134    | 33,121                 |\n| Net deferred tax                                             |  | -71,918    | 200,662                |\n\nThe temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries and associates for which no deferred tax liabilities were recognised amounted to €1,741,860 thousand (2022: €1,604,193 thousand).\n\nAn assessment of the ability to realise deferred tax assets for tax losses not yet used, tax credits not yet used and deductible temporary differences requires an estimate of the amount of future taxable profits.

Defined benefit plans\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 249\n\nThere are individual contractual pension obligations, individual contractual bridge payments, and pension allowances in accordance with association recommendations.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit obligations is carried out annually using the projected unit credit (PUC) method. If the calculation results in a potential asset, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any economic benefit available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Any valid minimum funding requirements are included in the calculation of the present value of the economic benefit.\n\nRemeasurement of net liabilities from defined benefit plans are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The remeasurement includes the actuarial gains and losses, the income from plan assets (not including projected interest income) and the effect of any asset ceiling. Net interest expenses (income) on net liabilities (assets) from defined benefit plans are calculated for the reporting period by applying the discount rate. The discount rate was used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the start of the annual reporting period. This discount rate is applied to net liabilities (assets) from defined benefit plans on this date. Any changes in net liabilities (assets) from defined benefit plans resulting from contribution and benefit payments over the course of the reporting period are taken into account. Net interest expenses and other expenses for defined benefit plans are recognised through profit or loss in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\nIf a plan's defined benefits are changed or a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in the benefit relating to past service costs or the gain or loss on the curtailment is recognised directly in profit/(loss) for the period. Gains and losses from the settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of the settlement. The defined benefit obligations are presented under \"Other provisions\" in the statement of financial position.\n\n#### Pension entitlements\n\nIndividuals who hold an individual contractual agreement are generally entitled to a pension when they reach the age of 60 or 65, subject to certain conditions. The amount of the pension generally depends on the number of their years of service and their last salary before leaving their active employment. In the event of death, the spouse of\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe individual entitled to the claim receives a pension at 60 per cent, 50 per cent or 40 per cent depending on the policy. The pensions are suspended for any period in which a termination benefit is paid, and their value is generally guaranteed. The pensions that are based on individual policies or on association recommendations are financed through provisions. The final pension contribution which guarantees a fixed cash value for when the beneficiary begins their retirement is set aside during the contribution phase and transferred to the pension fund at the time of retirement. The financing is specified in the pension fund's business plan, in the works council agreement and in the pension fund contract.\n\n#### Termination benefit entitlements\n\nIn the case of employees of Austrian companies whose employment began prior to 31 December 2002 and lasted three years without interruption, the employee is entitled to termination benefits when the employment is terminated, unless the employee resigns, leaves without an important reason or is dismissed.\n\n| Defined benefit obligations<br>In € thousand                                     | Defined benefit<br>obligations

The beneficiaries are also entitled to a final pension fund contribution which guarantees them a fixed cash value when they begin their retirement. Since the first pension to be paid out to the beneficiaries has a fixed benefit amount, this commitment is to be classified as a defined benefit in the contribution phase. The works council agreement states the extent to which a final pension fund contribution is provided to the beneficiary's individual assurance cover account in the event of a transfer to the old-age pension or of an incapacity to work or the death of a participant.

The proportion of the share capital represented by newly acquired shares, together with the proportion of other treasury shares that the company has already acquired and still holds, may not exceed 10 per cent of the share capital. The authorisation to acquire treasury shares also includes the acquisition of shares in the company by subsidiaries of the company.\n\nThe treasury shares held via UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG stem from the merger of BL Syndikat Beteiligungs Gesellschaft m.b.H., the transferor, with UNIQA Insurance Group AG, the transferee, in 2016. These shares held are not to be counted towards the 10 per cent limit.\n\n## 18. Capital management\n\nCapital management takes place with due regard to the regulatory and statutory requirements. After Solvency II came into force on 1 January 2016, the definitions and methods used to calculate available own funds, as well as risk capital requirements and management standards, were replaced by Solvency II standards.\n\nThe eligible own funds comprise the consolidated Tier 1 capital, which essentially consisted of the subscribed share capital including the allocated share premium account and the reconciliation reserve. The Tier 2 capital consists entirely of subordinated liabilities. Tier 3 own fund items are mainly net deferred tax assets.\n\nIn the context of Group management, the appropriate coverage of the solvency capital requirement in accordance with Solvency II on a consolidated basis is constantly monitored. Active capital management is implemented in order to ensure that the individual Group companies and the Group as a whole have a reasonable capital base at all times. Aside from the five-year planning, another objective of active capital management is also to actively guarantee UNIQA's financial capacity, including under difficult economic conditions, in order to safeguard the continued existence of the insurance business.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements to meet solvency capital/minimum capital requirements, UNIQA has also set itself a target capitalisation for the Group in the form of a solvency capital ratio – i.e. the eligible own funds in relation to the solvency capital requirement – of at least 170 per cent. The solvency capital ratio is managed using strategic measures which result in a reduction in the capital requirements and/or increase the amount of existing capital.\n\nUNIQA also takes the potential impact on the rating by recognised rating agencies into account in the capital management process. Standard & Poor's (S&P) currently applies a credit rating of “A–” to UNIQA Insurance Group AG. UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG and UNIQA Re AG each have a rating of \"A\". The supplementary capital bond issued in 2015 (initially: €500.0 million, open amount remaining: €326.3 million, Tier 2, first call\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\ndate: 27 July 2026), the bond issued in 2020 (€200.0 million, Tier 2, first call date: 9 July 2025) and the bond issued in 2021 (€375.0 million, Tier 2, first call date: 9 June 2031) are rated \"BBB\" by S&P.\n\n## 19.

Subordinated liabilities\n\nIn July 2013, UNIQA Insurance Group AG successfully placed a supplementary capital bond to the value of €350 million with institutional investors in Europe. The bond had a maturity period of 30 years and could only be terminated after ten years. The supplementary capital bond met the requirements for equity netting as Tier 2 capital under the Solvency II regime. Part of the bond – a nominal amount of €201.3 million – was refinanced on the capital market in December 2021 via a buy-back and new issue. The remaining portion of €148.7 million was repaid on the first termination date in July 2023.\n\nIn July 2015, UNIQA Insurance Group AG successfully placed a subordinated capital bond (Tier 2) to the value of €500 million with institutional investors in Europe. The bond is eligible for netting as Tier 2 capital under Solvency II. The bond is scheduled for repayment after a period of 31 years and subject to certain conditions, and can only be cancelled by UNIQA after eleven years have elapsed and under certain conditions. The coupon equals 6.00 per cent per annum during the first eleven years. After that a variable interest rate applies. The bond has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since July 2015. The issue price was set at 100 per cent.\n\nIn July 2020 a subordinated bond was also issued in the amount of €200 million at an issue price of 99.507 per cent of the nominal amount. With a term of 15.25 years, it can be terminated for the first time at any time between 9 July 2025 and 9 October 2025, subject to certain conditions. The annual interest rate is fixed at 3.25 per cent for the first 5.25 years. After that a variable interest rate applies. The bond is eligible for netting as Tier 2 capital under Solvency II. By issuing a green bond, UNIQA has committed to finance or refinance suitable assets in accordance with the Green Bond Framework at the same level as the issue proceeds. The bond issue has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since July 2020.\n\nUNIQA repurchased subordinated bonds with a total nominal value of €375 million in December 2021. The buyback relates to €201.3 million subordinated bonds placed in 2013 and €173.7 million subordinated bonds placed in 2015. At the same time, a new subordinated bond with a nominal amount of €375 million was placed. This bond is scheduled for repayment after a period of 20 years subject to certain conditions and can be cancelled by UNIQA for the first time at any time between 9 June 2031 and 9 December 2031, under certain conditions. The interest rate is fixed at 2.375 per cent per annum over the first ten years. A variable interest rate applies after this period. The issue price was set at 99.316 per cent of the nominal amount. The subordinated bond is eligible as Tier 2 basic own funds in accordance with the regulatory requirements. By issuing a green bond, UNIQA has committed to making investments in accordance with the Green Bond Framework at the same level as the issue proceeds.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 257\n\n## 21.

Remuneration for the Management Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe members of the Management Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG assume a dual operational role in their function, as they also hold the Management Board function at UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG. This identical composition of the Management Board in both companies enables efficient control of the UNIQA Group. Since 1 July 2020 all employment contracts of the members of the Management Board have been with UNIQA Insurance Group AG, which has paid out all remuneration since this\n\n# date.

For the 2021 financial year, payments of €1,102 thousand are expected in 2025. For the 2022 financial year, payments of €1,102 thousand are expected in 2026. For the 2023 financial year, payments of €4,258 thousand are expected to be made in the subsequent years 2024 and 2027.\n\nAs part of the multi-year share-based remuneration (longterm incentive plan (LTI), payments amounting to €1,327 thousand were made to the members of the Management Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG in 2023 from the 2019 LTI allocation. For the subsequent years 2024 to 2027, a payment of €5,590 thousand is expected for the virtual shares allocated up to 31 December 2023.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 259\n\nFor pension commitments and pension liability insurance to cover these commitments for the members of the Management Board, a total of €896 thousand was paid in the reporting year (2022: €1,059 thousand). The pension liability insurance premium amounts to €332 thousand (2022: €279 thousand). The amount expended on pensions in the reporting year for former members of the Management Board and their surviving dependents was €2,147 thousand (2022: €1,964 thousand).\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board for their work in the 2022 financial year was €1,152 thousand. Provisions of €1,180 thousand have been recognised for the remuneration to be paid for their work in the 2023 financial year. Daily allowances and cash expenses that were paid out in the financial year totalled €148 thousand (2022: €72 thousand). Since 14 April 2020, the members of the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG who are also members of the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG have received their daily allowances and remuneration exclusively from UNIQA Insurance Group AG despite their dual function. These daily allowances and remunerations therefore also cover the Supervisory Board activities at UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 27. Share-based payment agreement with cash settlement\n\nA share-based remuneration programme has been in place for the members of the Management Boards of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG since the 2013 financial year. As part of this programme, UNIQA virtual shares are granted conditionally for each financial year on the basis of allocation values defined in the service contract, based on the average price of UNIQA ordinary shares in the period of six months prior to the start of the performance period. Cash payments subject to agreed limits are provided for at the end of a performance period of four years for the individual annual tranches or depending on certain performance targets.\n\nThe selected key performance targets aim to ensure a relative market-based performance measurement and an absolute performance measurement depending on UNIQA's company-specific targets. The performance targets, including performance periods up to 2022, comprised the total shareholder return (TSR) of UNIQA ordinary shares compared to the TSR of the shares in the companies on the DJ EURO STOXX TMI Insurance, the net combined ratio (CoR) in UNIQA's property and casualty insurance segment and the return on risk capital (RoRC: the return on economically required capital), with these targets each weighted equally by one-third to determine overall target achievement.\n\nUnder IFRS 9/17, which will apply from the 2023 financial year, the CoR target will no longer be shown. For performance periods from 2023 onwards, two ESG targets were therefore included in the LTI programmes instead of the CoR target. These are the \"Weighted Average Carbon Intensity\" (WACI), which aims to reduce the average emissions intensity of the companies in UNIQA's asset portfolio, and the \"Science Based Target Initiative\" (SBTi), which aims to increase the proportion of companies in UNIQA's asset portfolio that have undertaken commitments to reduce emissions. Only direct investments by UNIQA in the relevant companies in the asset portfolio are involved here. The two ESG targets are each weighted at 20per cent to determine overall target achievement. The TSR and RoRC targets will be reduced from one-third each to 30per cent each.\n\nA transitional regulation applies to the LTI programme for 2020, 2021 and 2022. The annual target achievement(s) of the CoR target (until 2022) and the annual target achievement(s) of the two ESG targets from 2023 (within the four-year overall performance period) are determined and\n\nan average of these three key figures is calculated, which is weighted by one-third to determine the overall target achievement. The TSR and RoRC targets each have an unchanged weighting of one-third.\n\nThe programme stipulates annual investments in UNIQA shares with a holding period also of four years in each case.\n\nThe cash settlement is calculated as follows for each tranche of shares: payment =  $A \\times B \\times C$ \n\nA = number of virtual shares awarded for the performance period.\n\nB = average price of the UNIQA ordinary share in the period of six months before the end of the performance period.\n\nC = degree of target achievement at the end of the performance period for the targets mentioned above. The maximum target achievement is 200 per cent.\n\nThe fair value on the date that share-based payment awards are granted is recognised as expense over the period in which the unconditional entitlement to the award is obtained. The fair value is based on expectations with respect to achievement of the defined key performance targets. Changes in measurement assumptions result in an adjustment of the recognised provision amounts affecting income. Obligations from share-based remuneration are stated under \"Other provisions\".\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 a total of 1,215,805 virtual shares (2022: 1,167,795 shares) were relevant for the measurement. The fair value of share-based remuneration (excluding non-wage labour costs) at the reporting date amounts to €5,590 thousand (2022: 4,420 thousand).\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 28.

Expenses for the auditor of the financial statements\n\nThe statutory auditor fees in the financial year were €2,159 thousand (2022: €2,752 thousand); of which €538 thousand (2022: €712 thousand) is attributable to the annual audit, €1,564 thousand (2022: €2,030 thousand) to other auditing services and €57 thousand (2022: €10 thousand) to other general services.\n\n## 31. Consolidation principles\n\n#### Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by UNIQA. A company is considered to be controlled if:\n\n- UNIQA is able to exercise power over the relevant entity,\n- UNIQA is exposed to fluctuating returns from the participation and\n- the level of returns can be influenced due to the power exercised.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control begins until the date control ends.\n\n## Loss of control\n\nIf UNIQA loses control over a subsidiary, the subsidiary's assets and liabilities and all associated non-controlling interests and other equity components are deleted from the accounts. Any resulting profit or loss is recognised in profit/(loss) for the period. Any retained interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date of the loss of control.\n\n## Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are all the entities over which UNIQA has significant influence but does not exercise control or joint control over their financial and operating policies. This is generally the case as soon as there is a voting share of between 20 and 50 per cent or a comparable significant influence is guaranteed legally or in practice via other contractual regulations. Inclusion in the basis of consolidation is based on the proportionate equity (equity method).\n\n## Pension and investment funds\n\nControlled pension and investment funds are included in the consolidation unless the relevant fund volumes were considered to be immaterial when viewed separately and as a whole. A fund is regarded as controlled if:\n\n- UNIQA determines the relevant activities of the fund, such as the definition of the investment strategy and short- and medium-term investment decisions,\n- UNIQA has the risk of and the rights to variable successes of the fund in the form of distributions and participates in the performance of the fund assets and\n- the determining power over the relevant activities is exercised in the interest of UNIQA by determining the investment objectives and the individual investment decisions.\n- \n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Basis of consolidation 31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n262\n\nsory Board.\n\nties\n\nTransactions with related persons In € thousand\n\nCompensation on termination of employment\n\nOptions to purchase granted\n\nthe current shareholders' agreement.\n\n€10 thousand) to other general services.\n\n31.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition and the identifiable net assets acquired are measured at fair value. Any profit from an acquisition at a price below the fair value of the net assets is recognised directly in profit/(loss) for the period. Transaction costs are recognised as expenses immediately.\n\nThe consideration transferred does not include any amounts associated with the fulfilment of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\nAny contingent obligation to pay consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not revalued, and a settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, later changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the profit/(loss) for the period.\n\n## 32. Basis of consolidation\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 263\n\n## Initial consolidation\n\nUNIQA Real Estate Beteiligungsverwaltung International GmbH (Vienna) was included in the consolidated financial statements for the first time in the second quarter of 2023 and DOROS Immobilien GmbH (Vienna) in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Restructuring processes\n\nIn the third quarter, PremiaFIT GmbH (Vienna) was split and incorporated into PremiQaMed Holding GmbH (Vienna) and PremiQaMed Immobilien GmbH (Vienna).\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn 30 November 2023, UNIQA acquired 65.4 per cent of the shares in Telemedi Sp. z o.o. (Poland, Warsaw) and 100 per cent of the capital shares in each of its subsidiaries Telemedicin Sp. z o.o. (Poland, Warsaw), Przychodnia24 sp. z o.o. (Poland, Warsaw) and Telemedico Spain SL (Spain, Madrid) (referred to jointly as the \"Telemedi Group\" below). Together with the 10.4 per cent already held, UNIQA now holds 75.8 per cent of the capital shares. An \"option agreement\" was concluded with the minority shareholder for the acquisition of the remaining 24.2 per cent with an exercise period of two or three years, according to which the capital shares can be acquired in accordance with an agreed purchase price formula. However, the structure of this means that for the purposes of consolidated accounting in accordance with IAS/IFRS provisions, the Group is already included 100 per cent and no minority interests need to be reported. Future payments resulting from the option agreement are recognised as current expenses in the exercise period in accordance with IAS/IFRS provisions – as 100% have already been recognised in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Telemedi Group constitutes a business operation within the meaning of IFRS 3. The companies were acquired in order to expand the portfolio in the healthcare sector.\n\nThe companies are recognised in the \"Group functions\" segment and in the health insurance business line.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Assets and liabilities from business\n\n## combinations at acquisition date In € thousand\n\n264\n\n| Property, plant and equipment                         | 2      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Intangible assets                                     | 16,972 |\n| Investments                                           | 3      |\n| Receivables and other assets                          | 1,890  |\n| Cash                                                  | 2,794  |\n| Total assets                                          | 21,661 |\n| Liabilities and other items classified as liabilities | 1,249  |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                              | 3,143  |\n| Total liabilities                                     | 4,392  |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired                      | 17,268 |\n\n## Preliminary differential amount In € thousand\n\n| Transferred of consideration                   | 27,376 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Net identifiable assets acquired at fair value | 17,268 |\n| Preliminary differential amount                | 10,108 |\n\n## Consideration transferred In € thousand\n\n| Contractually agreed purchase price                   | 27,376 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Price paid1)                                          | 27,376 |\n| Acquired bank balances                                | -2,794 |\n| Consideration transferred less acquired bank balances | 24,583 |\n\n1) The acquisition price was settled in full through the transfer of cash.\n\nNo revenue or earnings were contributed to UNIQA's profit/(loss) for the period in the 2023 financial year. If the acquisition had already taken place on 1 January 2023, profit/(loss) for the period (the share attributable to the shareholders of UNIQA Insurance Group AG) would amount to around €304,252 thousand and earnings per share would remain unchanged due to the low earnings contribution. Other non-technical income would amount to €447,591 thousand if the acquisition had already taken place on 1 January 2023 due to the revenue contribution of the Telemedi Group.\n\n####

Risk strategy\n\n## Principles\n\nUNIQA's strategic objectives are directly linked to the company's risk strategy. The cornerstones of the risk strategy are based on the business strategy and the risks it entails. A clear definition of the risk preference creates the foundation for all business policy decisions.\n\n## Organisation\n\nUNIQA's core business is to relieve customers of risk, pool the risk to reduce it and thereby generate profit for the company. The focus is on understanding risks and their particular features. To ensure a strong focus on risk, UNIQA has created a separate risk function on the Group's Management Board with a Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who is also acting concurrently as Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In the Group companies, the Chief Risk Officer is also a part of the Management Board. This ensures that decision-making is risk-based in all relevant bodies. UNIQA has established processes that make it possible to identify, analyse and manage risks.\n\nThe risk profile is regularly validated at all levels of the hierarchy and discussions are held in specially instituted committees with the members of the Management Board. Internal and external sources are consulted to obtain a complete picture of the risk situation. UNIQA regularly checks for new threats both in the Group and in the subsidiaries.\n\n## Risk-bearing capacity and risk appetite\n\nUNIQA assumes risk in full awareness of its risk-bearing capacity. This is defined as the capacity to absorb potential losses from extreme events so that medium- and longterm objectives are not jeopardised.\n\nThe Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is at the centre of risk-related decisions. The SCR corresponds to a company-specific risk assessment based on a partial internal model for market risks and non-life risks, as well as on the standard model according to Solvency II for the other risk categories. As such, it corresponds to the regulatory risk calculations under the Solvency II framework. Based on this approach, we aim to achieve a solvency capital ratio above 170 per cent. Immediate steps will be taken to improve the capital position if the marginal value falls below 135 per cent.\n\nNon-quantifiable risks, in particular operational risk, litigation risk and strategic risk are identified and assessed as part of the risk assessment process. This assessment is then used as the basis for implementing any necessary risk mitigation measures.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 269\n\nUNIQA's risk strategy specifies the risks the company intends to assume and those it plans to avoid. Within the scope of the strategy process, risk appetite is defined based on UNIQA's risk-bearing capacity. This risk appetite is then used to determine tolerances and limits, which provide a sufficient early warning system for the company to initiate prompt corrective action in the event of any deviation from targets. UNIQA counters risks that fall outside the defined risk appetite, such as reputational risk, with proactive measures, transparency and careful assessment.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nRisk also means opportunity. UNIQA regularly analyses trends and risks that influence society and thus the customers and UNIQA itself. Employees throughout the company are involved in order to recognise and analyse trends at an early stage, produce suitable action plans and develop innovative approaches.\n\n## 35. Risk management system\n\nThe focus of risk management with management structures and defined processes is the attainment of UNIQA's and its Group companies' strategic goals.\n\nUNIQA's Risk Management Guidelines form the basis for a uniform standard at various company levels. The guidelines are approved by the CFO/CRO and the Group Executive Board and describe the minimum requirements in terms of organisational structure and process structure.\n\nIn addition to the Group Risk Management Guidelines, similar guidelines have also been prepared and approved for the Group companies. The Risk Management Guidelines at company level were approved by the Management Board of the UNIQA Group companies and are consistent with UNIQA's Risk Management Guidelines.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Organisational structure (governance)\n\nThe detailed setup of the process and organisational structure of risk management is set out in UNIQA's Risk Management Guidelines. They reflect the principles embodied in the concept of \"three lines\" and the clear differences between the individual \"lines\".\n\n## First line: risk management within the business activity\n\nThose responsible for business activities must develop and put into practice an appropriate risk control environment to identify and monitor the risks that arise in connection with the business and processes.\n\n## Second line: supervisory functions including risk management functions\n\nThe risk management function and the supervisory functions, such as controlling, must monitor business activities without encroaching on operational activities.\n\n#### Third line: internal audit\n\nThis enables an independent review of the formation and effectiveness of the entire internal control system, which comprises risk management and compliance (e.g. internal auditing).\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 271\n\nImage /page/206/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of the UNIQA risk management structure. The diagram is organized vertically, with the UNIQA Holding Management Board at the top, followed by UNIQA Holding CFO/CRO, Group Risk Committee, Group Risk Management, UNIQA Insurance Business Unit (CRO, RM), and Local Risk Committees at the bottom. Arrows connect the boxes, indicating the flow of information and authority. Each box contains a list of responsibilities or functions. The UNIQA Holding Management Board is responsible for active risk management, approving the UNIQA risk management strategy, approving risk limits, and making decisions regarding risk transfer and mitigation. The UNIQA Holding CFO/CRO is responsible for functional management of the UNIQA risk management unit, chairing the UNIQA Risk Management Committee, shaping the risk management strategy, monitoring the overall risk situation, and providing appropriate structures for risk management and reporting. The Group Risk Committee is responsible for defining the risk management strategy, preparing and monitoring risk-bearing capacity and risk limits, defining capital allocation, and approving model changes. The Group Risk Management is responsible for defining the UNIQA risk management process, conducting the uniform risk management process, coordinating the calculation of solvency capital requirements, defining minimum standards for risk management processes, ensuring effective reporting of risk management information, and preparing and monitoring risk limits. The UNIQA Insurance Business Unit (CRO, RM) is responsible for conducting the uniform UNIQA risk management process, preparing and maintaining minimum standards for risk management processes, preparing and monitoring risk limits, and monitoring overall risk management performance. The Local Risk Committees are not described in detail.\n\ntimely reporting\n\nThe relevant responsibilities are shown accordingly in the overview above.

They are not considered as a separate risk category, but are taken into account as part of the existing ten risk categories. Climate change represents the central sustainability risk with respect to the environmental sustainability factor. Climate-related risks arise in the form of physical risks and transition risks.\n\nPhysical risks arise from the increase in extreme weather events such as floods, earthquakes, storms and heat waves, as well as the rise in average temperature. Transition risks on the other hand are adjustment risks that arise from the transition to a low-carbon economy. These include e.g. risks associated with the change in climate policy, the renewal of technologies and the change in market preferences. In addition to the effect of physical risks on the frequency and amount of claims, there may be further effects from transition risks on UNIQA's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss, particularly in connection with the capital investment strategy pursued.\n\nRisk identification is the starting point for the risk management process, systematically recording all major risks and describing them in as much detail as possible. In order to conduct as complete a risk identification as possible, different approaches are used in parallel, and all risk categories, subsidiaries, processes and systems are included.\n\nThe risk categories of market risk, underwriting risks and default risk are evaluated at UNIQA by means of quantitative methods either based on the Solvency II standard approach or the partial internal model (for non-life or market risks). Furthermore, risk drivers are identified for the results from the standard approach and analysed to assess whether the risk situation is adequately represented (in accordance with the Company's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)). All other risk categories are evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively with their own risk scenarios.\n\n### 36. Activities and objectives in 2023\n\nBased on external and internal developments, activities in 2023 focused on the following:\n\nrising inflation\n\nsustainability (ESG)\n\nsecurity & resilience management\n\n#### Rising inflation\n\nThe global macroeconomy experienced turbulence in 2023 due to a variety of factors such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and rising inflation. Central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB) responded to this situation by raising interest rates. The financial markets reacted sensitively to these interest rate adjustments, and the value of both bonds and equities fell. With regard to UNIQA, inflation had a negative impact on the best estimate reserves in long-term business lines. Rising costs due to inflation and the more attractive alternative investment opportunities increased the lapse risk. Various inflation scenarios were analysed, highlighting potentially significant effects. Effective loss minimisation techniques were developed and implemented. UNIQA adjusted the reserves on a quarterly basis and created special inflation reserves in some regions.\n\n#### Sustainability (ESG)\n\nIn the area of sustainability, UNIQA focused its main objectives on complying with regulatory requirements and further developing risk management activities. For one thing, work was carried out on the development of longterm climate scenarios. Physical and transitory climate risks in the UNIQA Group were analysed. Early identification of sustainability risks and raising awareness of ESG risks in the organisation were other focal points. UNIQA also worked on integrating ESG data into its IT risk analysis software to enable daily monitoring of ESG-related key figures.\n\n#### Security & resilience management\n\nCompanies are increasingly facing a range of security risks, including data theft, ransomware attacks and potential power outages. In 2023, in addition to preventive measures in the areas of information security and physical security, UNIQA placed particular emphasis on preparing for the possible effects of an energy crisis. Action plans have already been developed as part of this focal area and employees have been trained accordingly. In 2023, these action plans were prepared for all of UNIQA's other operationally important sites internationally. The plans include both preventive and reactive measures to prepare UNIQA in the best possible way for large-scale power outages, announced power outages or brownouts.\n\n## 37. Challenges and priorities in risk management for 2024\n\nSustainability (ESG)\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn recent years, UNIQA has created a solid foundation for managing sustainability risks. There are several areas of emphasis for 2024. Early identification of sustainability risks will continue to be a key approach. The aim is to recognise and address potential causes in operational risk management at an early stage and to continuously monitor industry regulations and best practices. UNIQA will adapt its risk management strategies with the latest information on new sustainability guidelines and regulations. The development of climate scenarios will be expanded. This will also include quantitative estimates for areas that have not yet been fully analysed. A comprehensive understanding of the effects of different climate scenarios will enable UNIQA to be better prepared for long-term climate-related risks. Implementation of changes in legislation is essential for sustainability risk management. UNIQA will disclose new key indicators for physical and transitory risks and perform a materiality analysis to review regulatory requirements and their financial implications. The goal here is to further develop limit monitoring through additional automation of data analysis. This will enable a more comprehensive assessment of sustainability risks and promote responsible investment practices.\n\n#### Full internal model\n\n272\n\nnarios.\n\nA Group-wide, standardised risk management process regularly identifies, evaluates and reports on risks to UNIQA and its Group companies within these risk categories.\n\nsecurity & resilience management\n\ninflation reserves in some regions.\n\nSecurity & resilience management\n\nnounced power outages or brownouts.\n\n37.

In 2024, the project will focus on implementing the full internal model in the defined lines of business, as originally planned. However, there will be no regulatory review or approval activities. An alternative date for the application of the full internal model is currently unknown. For the time being, UNIQA will only use the model for internal purposes.\n\n#### Cyber risk\n\nThe increasing dependence on digital technologies and the associated cyber threats is proving to be a constantly growing risk for UNIQA. As a result, UNIQA has developed a holistic cyber security strategy that includes various measures.\n\nThese include regular reviews of the IT infrastructure, implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA), introduction of a security information and event management system (SIEM) and training for employees. Despite these measures, UNIQA is aware that cyber risks are extremely dynamic and require continuous monitoring and adjustments.\n\n### Capital market environment and inflation\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 273\n\nInflation and its impact on insurance companies in 2024 is a topic of particular importance. In view of the developments in interest rates, credit spreads and similar factors, UNIQA and its products will continue to be significantly affected by this. The topic of inflation will also be very important for as long as the observed inflation rates remain high. It is therefore necessary to identify the potential impact of all these risks on the various business lines at an early stage and take appropriate steps. Overall, inflation in 2024 will require UNIQA to plan carefully, adapt and be flexible in order to meet customer needs and still remain profitable.\n\n## 38. Risk profile\n\nUNIQA's risk profile is very heavily influenced by the life and health insurance portfolios of UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG. This situation means that market risk plays a central role in UNIQA's risk profile.\n\nThe Group companies in Central Europe operate in the property and casualty business lines as well as in the life and health insurance business lines. In the CEE region, the property and casualty sectors are the most dominant.\n\nThis structure is important to UNIQA because it offers a high level of diversification from the life and health insurance lines that dominate in the Austrian companies.\n\nThe distinctive risk features of the regions are also reflected in the risk profiles determined by using the internal measurement approach.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Market and credit risk\n\nThe strength of the market and credit risks depends on the structure of the capital investment and its allocation to the different asset categories. The table below shows investments classified by asset category.\n\n| Asset allocation<br>In € thousand   | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Fixed-income securities             | 13,296,476 | 12,442,409 |\n| Real estate assets                  | 2,411,947  | 2,372,793  |\n| Pension fund                        | 1,808,177  | 1,928,801  |\n| Equity investments and other stocks | 1,022,366  | 882,288    |\n| Shares and equity funds             | 1,276,852  | 1,156,693  |\n| Time deposits                       | 520,399    | 461,531    |\n| Other investments                   | 95,660     | 131,479    |\n| Total                               | 20,431,878 | 19,375,995 |\n\nHowever, the market and credit risks not only have an impact on the value of investments, but also influence the level of technical liabilities. Thus, there is – particularly in life insurance – a dependence between the (price) growth of assets and liabilities from insurance contracts. UNIQA manages the income expectations and risks of assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts as part of the asset liability management (ALM) process. The objective is to ensure sufficient liquidity while retaining the greatest possible security and balanced risk in order to achieve a return on capital that is sustainably higher than the guaranteed performance of the technical liabilities. To do this, assets and liabilities are allocated to different accounting groups.\n\nThe following two tables show the main accounting groups generated by the various product categories.\n\n| Assets<br>In € thousand                                                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Long-term life insurance contracts with<br>guaranteed interest and profit participation | 10,515,489 | 10,248,697 |\n| Long-term unit-linked and index-linked life<br>insurance contracts                      | 4,291,320  | 4,067,603  |\n| Long-term health insurance contracts                                                    | 5,046,235  | 4,568,680  |\n| Short-term property and casualty insurance<br>contracts                                 | 5,884,178  | 5,552,889  |\n| Total                                                                                   | 25,737,221 | 24,437,868 |\n| In   € thousand                                                                         |            |            |\n| Long-term life insurance contracts with<br>guaranteed interest and profit participation | 9,865,889  | 10,507,775 |\n| Long-term unit-linked and index-linked life<br>insurance contracts                      | 3,919,669  | 3,659,386  |\n| Long-term health insurance contracts                                                    | 3,644,153  | 3,317,023  |\n| Short-term property and casualty insurance<br>contracts                                 | 3,915,834  | 3,437,208  |\n| Total                                                                                   | 21,345,545 | 20,921,392 |\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\n- Land and buildings for own use\n- Investment property\n- Financial assets accounted for using the equity method\n- Other investments\n- Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments Cash\n\n#### Net liabilities of insurance and reinsurance contracts In € thousand 31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\n- Liabilities arising from insurance contracts\n- Assets arising from insurance contracts\n- Liabilities arising from reinsurance contracts\n- Assets arising from reinsurance contracts\n\nFurthermore, the net liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts are shown in the following two tables, broken down by region and, for property and casualty insurance, by business line.\n\n#### Net liabilities of insurance and reinsurance contracts (by region) In € thousand 31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n| Austria (AT)                                     | 17,993,912 | 17,692,028 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Central Europe (CE)                              | 2,691,031  | 2,349,497  |\n| Eastern Europe (EE)                              | 133,674    | 133,862    |\n| Russia (RU)                                      | 0          | 259,455    |\n| Southeastern Europe (SEE)                        | 725,709    | 695,670    |\n| Western Europe (WE)                              | -198,782   | -209,121   |\n| Net liabilities in disposal groups held for sale | 0          | 0          |\n| Total                                            | 21,345,545 | 20,921,392 |\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Net liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance (by business line) In € thousand\n\n274\n\nMarket and credit risk\n\nAsset allocation In € thousand \n\ngroups.\n\nAssets In € thousand \n\nments classified by asset category.\n\nThe strength of the market and credit risks depends on the structure of the capital investment and its allocation to the different asset categories.

To do this, assets and liabilities are allocated to different accounting\n\nThe following two tables show the main accounting groups\n\nguaranteed interest and profit participation 10,515,489 10,248,697\n\ninsurance contracts 4,291,320 4,067,603 Long-term health insurance contracts 5,046,235 4,568,680\n\ncontracts 5,884,178 5,552,889 Total 25,737,221 24,437,868\n\ngenerated by the various product categories.\n\nLong-term life insurance contracts with\n\nLong-term unit-linked and index-linked life\n\nShort-term property and casualty insurance\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\nFinancial assets accounted for using the equity method\n\nUnit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\n\nguaranteed interest and profit participation 9,865,889 10,507,775\n\ninsurance contracts 3,919,669 3,659,386 Long-term health insurance contracts 3,644,153 3,317,023\n\ncontracts 3,915,834 3,437,208 Total 21,345,545 20,921,392\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nLand and buildings for own use\n\nNet liabilities of insurance and\n\nLong-term life insurance contracts with\n\nLong-term unit-linked and index-linked life\n\nShort-term property and casualty insurance\n\nsurance, by business line.\n\nNet liabilities of insurance and reinsurance contracts (by region) In € thousand\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\n Liabilities arising from insurance contracts Assets arising from insurance contracts Liabilities arising from reinsurance contracts Assets arising from reinsurance contracts\n\nFurthermore, the net liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts are shown in the following two tables, broken down by region and, for property and casualty in-\n\nAustria (AT) 17,993,912 17,692,028 Central Europe (CE) 2,691,031 2,349,497 Eastern Europe (EE) 133,674 133,862 Russia (RU) 0 259,455 Southeastern Europe (SEE) 725,709 695,670 Western Europe (WE) – 198,782 – 209,121 Net liabilities in disposal groups held for sale 0 0 Total 21,345,545 20,921,392\n\nInvestment property\n\nOther investments\n\nreinsurance contracts In € thousand \n\nCash\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n| Property insurance<br>(fire and household insurance) | 604,160   | 882,889   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Liability insurance                                  | 910,313   | 554,304   |\n| Motor TPL insurance                                  | 1,363,982 | 1,149,232 |\n| Other motor insurance                                | 305,368   | 476,401   |\n| Credit insurance                                     | 26,813    | -12,314   |\n| Legal expense insurance                              | 145,994   | 150,275   |\n| Technology insurance                                 | 87,971    | -50,130   |\n| Transport insurance                                  | 61,073    | -51,697   |\n| Casualty insurance                                   | 346,721   | 303,343   |\n| Other forms of insurance                             | 63,438    | 34,905    |\n| Total                                                | 3,915,834 | 3,437,208 |\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nThe market and credit risk is broken down into interest rate, credit spread, equity, currency and market concentration risk.\n\nThe interest rate risk arises on all asset and liability items of the statement of financial position whose value fluctuates as a result of changes in risk-free yield curves or associated volatility. Given the high proportion of interestbearing securities in the assets, interest rate risk forms an important part of market risk. The interest rate risk is actively managed as part of the ALM-based investment strategy.\n\nThe following table shows the maturity structure of fixedincome securities.\n\n| Exposure by term<br>In € thousand | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Up to 1 year                      | 598,058    | 546,464    |\n| More than 1 year up to 3 years    | 1,612,605  | 1,678,491  |\n| More than 3 years up to 5 years   | 1,906,495  | 1,894,720  |\n| More than 5 years up to 7 years   | 1,750,013  | 1,858,520  |\n| More than 7 years up to 10 years  | 2,219,369  | 1,809,533  |\n| More than 10 years up to 15 years | 1,645,037  | 1,886,347  |\n| More than 15 years                | 3,564,899  | 2,768,334  |\n| Total                             | 13,296,476 | 12,442,409 |\n\nSince the interest rate risk is particularly relevant in life insurance as a result of the long-term liabilities, the focus below is placed on this business line.\n\nThe difference between the change in assets and the change in technical provisions resulting from a change in interest rates is used as the basis for managing the interest rate risk and/or the duration gap. During the annual ALM process, it is determined from a strategic point of view which budgets for interest rate risk can be accepted at the operating company level.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 275\n\nThe discount rate that may be used in the costing when\n\n#### Average technical discount rates, core business by region and currency In per cent EUR USD Local currency\n\n| In per cent               |     |     |     |\n|---------------------------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Austria (AT)              | 2.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Central Europe (CE)       | 2.6 | 0.0 | 3.4 |\n| Eastern Europe (EE)       | 3.2 | 3.3 | 2.8 |\n| Southeastern Europe (SEE) | 2.7 | 3.2 | 2.1 |\n| Russia (RU)               | 2.4 | 2.4 | 3.8 |\n\nAs these interest rates are guaranteed by the insurance company, the financial risk lies in not being able to generate these returns. Since conventional life insurance business predominantly invests in interest-bearing securities, the unpredictability of long-term interest rate trends is the most significant financial risk for a life insurance company. Investment and reinvestment risk arises from the fact that premiums received in the future must be invested to achieve the rate of return guaranteed when a policy is written. However, it is entirely possible that no appropriate securities will be available at the time the premium is received. Likewise, future income must be reinvested to achieve a return equivalent to at least the original discount rate. For this reason, UNIQA has already decided to only offer products in its key markets that are based on a low or zero discount rate. One example of this in Austria is the sale of deferred pension products with a discount rate of 0 per cent.\n\nThe credit spread risk refers to the risk of changes in the price of asset or liability items in the statement of\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nfinancial position, as a consequence of changes in credit risk premiums or associated volatility, and is ascertained for individual securities in accordance with their rating and duration. When investing in securities, UNIQA chooses securities with a wide variety of ratings, taking into consideration the potential risks and returns.\n\nThe following table shows the credit quality of those fixedincome securities that are neither overdue nor written down, based on their ratings.\n\n## Exposure by rating In € thousand\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n| In € thousand |            |            |\n|---------------|------------|------------|\n|               |            |            |\n| AAA           | 2,877,848  | 2,534,616  |\n| AA            | 3,050,482  | 3,070,791  |\n| A             | 3,950,222  | 3,376,771  |\n| BBB           | 2,080,646  | 2,038,529  |\n| BB            | 326,587    | 341,657    |\n| B             | 146,374    | 135,688    |\n| ≤ CCC         | 97,577     | 84,315     |\n| Not rated     | 766,739    | 860,041    |\n| Total         | 13,296,476 | 12,442,409 |\n\nEquity risk arises from movements in the value of equities and similar investments as a result of fluctuations in international stock markets, and therefore stems in particular from the asset categories \"Equity investments and other stocks\" and \"Equities\". The effective equity weighting is controlled by hedging with the selective use of derivative financial instruments.\n\nForeign currency risk is caused by fluctuations in exchange rates and associated volatility. Given the international nature of the insurance business, UNIQA invests in securities denominated in different currencies, thus following the principle of ensuring matching liabilities with assets in the same currency to cover liabilities at the coverage fund or company level. Despite the selective use of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes, it is not always possible on cost grounds or from an investment point of view to achieve complete and targeted currency matching between the assets and liabilities.

liability adequacy test and deferred acquisition costs. The impact of the implied new funds assumption (including reinvestment) is therefore stated below.\n\nIn non-life insurance, the provision for unsettled claims is formed based on reported claims and applying accepted statistical methods. One crucial assumption here is that the pattern of claims observed from the past can be sensibly extrapolated for the future. Additional adjustments need to be made in cases where this assumption is not possible.\n\nThe calculation of claim provisions is associated with uncertainty based on the time required to process claims. In addition to the normal chance risk, there are also other factors that may influence the future processing of the claims that have already occurred. In particular, the reserving process for court damages in property and casualty insurance should be mentioned here. A reserve estimate is prepared here for these damages based on expert assessment, although this estimate can be exposed to high levels of volatility specifically with major damage at the start of the process for collecting court costs.\n\nThe partial internal model in property and casualty insurance is a suitable instrument for quantifying the volatility involved in processing. Pursuant to analysis of these model results, it was determined that a deviation of 5 per cent from the basic provision calculated may represent a realistic scenario. Based on the current provision for unsettled claims of €3,865.7 million (excluding additional provisions such as provisions for claim settlement) in the Group on a gross basis, this would mean an increase in claims incurred by €193.3 million.\n\nIn health insurance (similar to life technique), since 1 July 2021 only tariffs with a discount rate of 0.5 per cent are being sold. Together with measures to reduce the assumed interest rate in the portfolio, an average discount rate of approx. 2.5 per cent was achieved as at 31 December 2023. A reduction in the capital earnings by 100 bp (based on 2022 investment results) would reduce the earnings before taxes by €48.8 million.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nOngoing liquidity planning takes place in order to ensure that UNIQA is able to meet its payment obligations over the next twelve months.\n\nObligations with a term of more than twelve months are covered by investments with matching maturities as far as possible within the framework of the ALM process and the strategic guidelines. In addition, a majority of the securities portfolio is listed in liquid markets and can be sold quickly and without significant markdowns if cash is required.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\nNotional amount1) Coupon payments Total\n\nNotional amount1) Coupon payments Total\n\n| Financial liabilities<br>at 31 December 2023 |  | Bond liabilities   |                    |         | Loan liabilities | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Lease liabilities | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--|--------------------|--------------------|---------|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| In € thousand                                |  | Notional<br>amount | Coupon<br>payments | Total   |                  | Contractual maturities                 |                   |         |\n| 2024                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 124                                    | 13,350            | 21,724  |\n| 2025                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 11,991            | 20,241  |\n| 2026                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 9,816             | 18,066  |\n| 2027                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 8,400             | 16,650  |\n| 2028                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 7,606             | 15,856  |\n| > 2029                                       |  | 600,000            | 16,500             | 616,500 | 0                | 6,549                                  | 33,822            | 656,871 |\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 279\n\n| Financial liabilities<br>at 31 December 2022 |                    | Bond liabilities   |         |   | Loan liabilities       | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Lease liabilities | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|---|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| In € thousand                                | Notional<br>amount | Coupon<br>payments | Total   |   | Contractual maturities |                                        |                   |         |\n| 2023                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 12,897            | 21,147  |\n| 2024                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 11,745            | 19,995  |\n| 2025                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 10,724            | 18,974  |\n| 2026                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 8,153             | 16,403  |\n| 2027                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 7,081             | 15,331  |\n| > 2028                                       | 600,000            | 24,750             | 624,750 | 0 | 11,645                 | 0                                      | 42,354            | 678,749 |\n\n## Subordinated liabilitiesContractual maturities at 31 December 2023In € thousand\n\n| 2024   | 0       | 34,984 | 34,984  |\n|--------|---------|--------|---------|\n| 2025   | 200,000 | 34,984 | 234,984 |\n| 2026   | 326,300 | 28,484 | 354,784 |\n| 2027   | 0       | 8,906  | 8,906   |\n| 2028   | 0       | 8,906  | 8,906   |\n| > 2029 | 375,000 | 26,719 | 401,719 |\n\n1) Contractual maturities based on the first possible termination date\n\n## Subordinated liabilities\n\n278\n\nIn index points\n\nfore stated below.\n\nsible.\n\nEquities index EUR (EURO STOXX 50) CZK (PX)\n\nIn life insurance the interest rate assumptions are the crucial influencing factor on the liability adequacy test and deferred acquisition costs.

This can have a material influence on UNIQA's result in case of late payment (or non-payment) by an individual reinsurer. UNIQA controls such risks with an internal reinsurance company that is responsible for selecting external reinsurance parties, taking into account strict guidelines for avoiding material concentration risks.\n\nHowever, concentration risk can also arise among other things from the composition of balance sheet items reported in the assets. Throughout the investment period, the company continuously checks to ensure that the investment volumes in securities of individual issuers do not exceed certain limits in relation to the total investment volume, defined according to the respective credit rating.\n\n#### Underwriting risks\n\nThe underwriting risks are subdivided into non-life insurance, health insurance and life insurance.\n\nThe underwriting risk in non-life insurance is broken down into the three risk categories of premium, reserve and catastrophe risk.\n\nPremium risk is defined as the risk that future benefits and expenses in connection with insurance operations will exceed the premiums collected for the insurance concerned. Such a loss may also be caused in insurance operations by exceptionally significant, but rare loss events, known as major claims or shock losses. Natural catastrophes represent a further threat from events that are infrequent but that nevertheless cause substantial losses. This risk includes financial losses caused by natural hazards, such as floods, storms, hail or earthquakes. In contrast to major individual claims, insurance companies in this case refer to cumulative losses.\n\nReserve risk refers to the risk that technical provisions recognised for claims that have already occurred will turn out to be inadequate. The loss in this case is referred to as settlement loss. The claim reserve is calculated using actuarial methods. External factors, such as changes in the amount or frequency of claims, legal decisions, repair and/or handling costs, can lead to differences compared with the estimate.\n\nTo counter and actively manage these risks, UNIQA runs a number of processes integrated into its insurance operations. For example, a Group Policy specifies that new products may only be launched if they satisfy certain profitability criteria. Major claims and losses from natural catastrophes are appropriately managed by means of special risk management in the underwriting process (primarily in corporate activities) and by the provision of suitable reinsurance capacity.\n\nIn connection with claim reserves, guidelines also specify the procedures to be followed by local units when recognising such reserves in accordance with IFRSs. A quarterly monitoring system and an internal review process safeguard the quality of the reserves recognised in the whole of the Group.\n\nAn essential element in risk assessment and further risk management is the use of the non-life partial model. This risk model uses stochastic simulations to quantify the risk capital requirement for each risk category at both company and Group levels.\n\nThe health insurance business is operated primarily in Austria. As a result, risk management in this line focuses mainly on Austria.\n\nHealth insurance is a loss insurance which is calculated under consideration of biometric risks and is operated in Austria mainly according to the similar to life technique.\n\nThe main techniques for risk mitigation in health insurance are the adjustment of future profit participations and the premium adjustment, which is carried out in compliance with legal and contractual framework conditions. These measures are crucial for the underlying risk models and contain detailed information and regulations, particularly with regard to profit participation. In practice, conventional risk-mitigation techniques are also relevant here.\n\nFor health insurance they include:\n\n- prudent setting of the discount rate at a level that is expected to be earned in the long term;\n- risk selection, i.e. a targeted pre-selection of prospective customers for insurance products, for example through health checks;\n- careful selection of the termination rate probabilities (death and lapse) in order to calculate adequate premiums for the benefits to be expected;\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n- the consideration of premium adjustment clauses in various health insurance products in order to be able to adjust premiums in line with changes in the calculation principles in case of changes in the expected values; and\n- where necessary, reinsurance solutions are applied to partial portfolios.\n\nble.\n\ntion risks.\n\nUnderwriting risks\n\nand catastrophe risk.\n\nrefer to cumulative losses.\n\nwith the estimate.\n\nConcentration risks\n\nUNIQA strives to keep concentration risks as low as possi-\n\nTo counter and actively manage these risks, UNIQA runs a number of processes integrated into its insurance operations.

In contrast to major individual claims, insurance companies in this case\n\nReserve risk refers to the risk that technical provisions recognised for claims that have already occurred will turn out to be inadequate. The loss in this case is referred to as settlement loss. The claim reserve is calculated using actuarial methods. External factors, such as changes in the amount or frequency of claims, legal decisions, repair and/or handling costs, can lead to differences compared\n\nance, health insurance and life insurance.\n\nIn addition to these conventional risk mitigation techniques, an ongoing process for managing portfolios has been established. This process is carried out annually by determining and evaluating the need for rate adjustments. The effectiveness of the risk mitigation techniques described for the health business is assessed by comparing invoiced and actual benefits as well as by calculating contribution margin calculations.\n\nIn life insurance, the underwriting risk is generally defined as the risk of loss or adverse developments affecting the value of insurance liabilities. It is divided into the categories of mortality, longevity, disability-morbidity, lapse, expense, revision and catastrophe risk.\n\nThe mortality risk depends on possible fluctuations in mortality rates due to an increase in deaths which would have an adverse effect on the expected benefits to pay on risk insurance policies.\n\nLongevity risk refers to the adverse effects of random fluctuations in mortality rates due to a decline in the mortality rate. The insurer is thereby exposed to the risk that the anticipated life expectancy in the calculation of the premium will be exceeded in reality and that the expenditure for pension payments will be higher than planned.\n\nThe disability-morbidity risk is caused by possible adverse fluctuations in disability, sickness and morbidity rates compared to what they were at the time the premium was calculated.\n\nThe lapse risk arises from the fluctuations in policy cancellation, termination, renewal, capital selection and surrender rates of insurance policies. Overall, it represents the uncertainty regarding customer behaviour.\n\nThe expense risk refers to adverse effects due to fluctuations in the administrative costs of insurance and reinsurance contracts.\n\nThe revision risk results from fluctuations in the revision rates for annuities due to changes in the legal environment.\n\nThe catastrophe risk results from significant uncertainty in relation to pricing and the assumptions made in the creation of provisions for extreme/exceptional events. The most relevant risk in this context is an immediate dramatic increase in mortality rates: in this case, death benefits in the risk portfolio could not be fully financed by the risk premium collected.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 281\n\nIn the context of life insurance, the main techniques for risk mitigation are the adjustment of future profit participations or a corresponding premium adjustment as well as additional reinsurance policies, which are carried out in compliance with legal and contractual framework conditions. These measures are crucial for the underlying risk models and contain detailed information and regulations, particularly with regard to profit participation. In practice, profitable new business supports the risk-bearing capacity of the existing portfolio, whereby careful risk selection (e.g. health checks) and cautiously chosen calculation principles for premiums are essential cornerstones when designing products. By including premium adjustment clauses, the potential to reduce risk can be improved, especially in the risk and occupational disability portfolio.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk includes losses that are caused by insufficient or failed internal processes, as well as losses caused by systems, human resources or external events.\n\nThe operational risk includes legal risk, but not reputation or strategic risk. Legal risk is the risk of uncertainty due to lawsuits or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or other legal requirements. At UNIQA, legal risks are monitored on an ongoing basis, and reports are made to the Group Management Board. UNIQA's risk management process also defined the risk process for operational risks in terms of methodology, workflow and responsibilities. The risk manager is responsible for compliance throughout all Group companies.\n\nA distinctive feature of operational risk is that it can surface in all processes and departments. This is why operational risk is identified and evaluated in every operational company at a very broad level within UNIQA. Risks are identified with the help of a standardised risk catalogue that is regularly checked for completeness.\n\nAccording to international standards, UNIQA – as a financial service provider – forms part of the critical infrastructure of key importance to the national community. If this infrastructure were to fail or become impaired, it would\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\ncause considerable disruption to public safety and security or lead to other drastic consequences.\n\nAs a rule, emergencies, crises and disasters are unexpected events for which it is impossible to plan, although systems and processes can be put in place to deal with such events. The systems and processes must then be treated as a special responsibility of management and must be dealt with professionally, efficiently and as quickly as possible.\n\nUNIQA has implemented a business continuity management system covering the issues of crisis prevention, crisis management and business recovery (including business emergency plans). The UNIQA BCM model is based on international rules and standards and is developed on a continuous basis.\n\n#### Emerging risk\n\nEmerging risk refers to newly arising or changing risks that are difficult to quantify and can have a significant impact on an organisation. Among the main drivers of the changing risk landscape are new economic, technological, socio-political and ecological developments and the increasing interdependencies between them, which may lead to a growing concentration of risk. In addition, a changing business environment – the further development of regulatory rules, the increased expectations of stakeholders and the shift in risk perception – must be taken into account.\n\n#### Reputational risk\n\nReputational risk describes the risk of loss that arises because of possible damage to the company's reputation, because of a deterioration in prestige, or because of a negative overall impression caused by negative perception by customers, business partners, shareholders or supervisory agencies. Reputational risks that occur in the course of core processes such as claim processing or advising and service quality are identified, evaluated and managed as operational risks in the Group companies.\n\n#### Contagion risk\n\nGroup risk management analyses whether the reputation risk observed in the Group or in another unit may occur, and whether the danger of \"contagion\" within the Group is possible. The analyses performed guard against contagion risk.\n\n#### Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk refers to the risk that results from management decisions or insufficient implementation of management decisions that may influence current or future income or solvency. This includes the risk that arises from management decisions that are inadequate because they ignore a changed business environment. Like operational and reputational risks, strategic risks are evaluated on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe following table shows a sensitivity analysis of changes in the most significant underwriting risks and market risks with their impact on assets and technical provisions in accordance with Solvency II. The sensitivities stated are based on calculations for the purposes of the company's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment. The technical provisions in accordance with Solvency II amount to €3,890 thousand in property and casualty insurance and to €14,524 thousand in life insurance.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Sensitivity analysis                        |                  | 31/12/2023            |                  | 31/12/2023            |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| In € thousand                               | Impact on assets | Impact on liabilities | Impact on assets | Impact on liabilities |\n| Underwriting risks                          |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Property and casualty insurance             |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Ultimate losses (+1%)                       |                  | 28,613                |                  | 22,467                |\n| Ultimate losses (-1%)                       |                  | -48,866               |                  | -31,399               |\n| Life insurance                              |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Mortality (-5%)                             |                  | -74,410               |                  | -23,540               |\n| Costs (+10%)                                |                  | 128,829               |                  | 114,502               |\n| Lapse rates (+10%)                          |                  | 121,944               |                  | 145,859               |\n| Lapse rates (-10%)                          |                  | -102,951              |                  | -78,987               |\n| Market risks                                |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Interest rate change (+50 bp)               | -569,508         | -652,077              | -452,718         | -508,805              |\n| Interest rate change (-50 bp)               | 598,120          | 768,084               | 564,702          | 670,922               |\n| Share price change (-25%)                   | -1,205,798       | -712,628              | -639,003         | -485,622              |\n| Exchange rate change (€-10%)                | -411,845         | -174,352              | -416,803         | -96,233               |\n| Credit spread risk corporate bonds (+50 bp) | -187,450         | 7,172                 | -151,613         | -20,137               |\n\n## 39.

The structure of the purchasing of external reinsurance is linked to the risk management process, thus enabling the risk capital to be relieved.\n\nReinsurance structures support the continuous optimisation of the required risk capital and the management of the use of this risk capital. Great importance is attached to the maximum use of diversification effects. Continuous analysis of reinsurance purchasing for efficiency characteristics is an essential component of internal risk management processes.\n\nUNIQA Re AG in Zurich, Switzerland, is responsible for the operational implementation of these tasks. It is responsible for and guarantees the implementation of the reinsurance policy issued by the Group Management Board. UNIQA Re AG is available to all Group companies as the risk carrier for their reinsurance needs. The assessment of the exposure of the portfolios assumed by the Group companies is of central importance. Periodic risk assessments have been performed for years in the interest of a value-based management of the capital commitment.\n\nExtensive data are used to assess risk capital requirements for the units in question and their reinsurance programmes are structured in a targeted manner.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 283\n\nFor the property and casualty insurer, promises of performance for protection against losses resulting from natural hazards frequently represent by far the greatest stress on risk capital due to the volatile nature of such claims and the conceivable amount of catastrophic damages. UNIQA has set up a specialised unit in order to deal with this problem. Exposure is constantly monitored and evaluated at the country and Group levels in cooperation with internal and external authorities. UNIQA substantially eases the pressure on its risk capital through the targeted utilisation of all applicable diversification effects and the launch of an efficient retrocession programme.\n\nUNIQA Re AG has assumed almost all of the UNIQA Group's required reinsurance business ceded in the reporting period. Only in exceptional cases, such as the purchase of facultative reinsurance, is a portion of the necessary cessions given directly to external reinsurance companies. The Group assumes reasonable deductibles in the retrocession programmes based on risk- and value-based approaches.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Approval for publication\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared by the Management Board as at the date of signing and approved for publication.\n\nVienna, 15 March 2024\n\nQ.

Intangible assets\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 2. Measurement of the contractual service margin at the transition date to IFRS 17 Description\n\nThe International Financial Reporting Standard on Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 (date of initial application). In principle, IFRS 17 is applicable retrospectively as of the transition dated 1 January 2022.\n\nUNIQA has measured its insurance portfolio at the transition date mainly applying the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach. Insurance contracts, assets and deferred acquisition costs are identified and measured as if IFRS 17 had always been applied, with differences to existing amounts recognised in equity.\n\nThe reduction of consolidated equity at the transition date amounting to EUR 771,265k mainly results from the firsttime recognition of the contractual service margin due to initial application of IFRS 17.\n\nAudit approach and key observations\n\nWe:\n\n- compared the accounting and measurement methods with the accounting provisions of IFRS 17,\n- evaluated the appropriateness of the calculation methods at the transition date and examined the significant discretionary decisions and assumptions especially regarding the availability of historical data and the appropriateness of permissible simplifications,\n- verified the completeness and appropriateness of the data for calculating the contractual service margin at the transition date.\n\nThe accounting and measurement methods applied are in accordance with IFRSs. We consider the underlying\n\nassumptions and measurement parameters to be plausible and reasonable.\n\nKONZERNABSCHLUSS 287\n\nReference to related disclosures\n\nRefer to chapter \"Insurance contracts – transition options\" under General information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and to the \"Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\".\n\n## 3. Measurement of liabilities from insurance contracts in life insurance and health insurance pursuant to the variable fee approach (VFA) Description\n\nUNIQA mainly applies the variable fee approach for measuring insurance contracts in life insurance and health insurance. This approach is applied to insurance contracts if defined criteria are met. Differences to the general measurement model only arise in subsequent measuring.\n\nContracts that involve profit participation in life insurance and health insurance are not divided into annual cohorts, using the option provided by EU law.\n\nInsurance contracts in life insurance and health insurance are initially measured by an estimation of future cash flows connected to the fulfilment of the contract. In doing so, significant discretionary decisions especially regarding non-financial assumptions such as mortality, longevity, invalidity or morbidity, customer behaviour (cancellation) or development of medical costs are to be considered.\n\nAs a second step, cash flows are discounted in order to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks. In a third step a risk adjustment is calculated to take into account non-financial risks. The contractual service margin is calculated at the time of initial recognition and represents the as of yet unrealised profit for a group of insurance contracts. The contractual service margin for the life insurance and health insurance business amounts to EUR 5,204,409k as at 31 December 2023.\n\nBased on defined coverage units, an amount of the contractual service margin is recognised in each period in profit or loss for a group of insurance contracts.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

Group AG have appointed the law firm andréewitch & partner rechtsanwälte GmbH to provide consulting services on matters involving IT law. Supervisory Board member Markus Andréewitch holds a 60 per cent stake in this company. A new partner of andréewitch & partner rechtsanwälte GmbH will assume responsibility for the existing mandate from UNIQA to provide legal advice. Markus Andréewitch does not personally contribute to the advisory services. The advisory services are remunerated at arm's length. The Supervisory Board has provided its consent for the mandate to provide legal advice to continue.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **The work and activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees**\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises the Management Board in its strategic planning and projects. It decides on the matters assigned to it by law, the Articles of Association and its rules of procedure. The Supervisory Board is responsible for supervising the management of the company by the Management Board. It is comprised of ten shareholder representatives and five employee representatives, and it convened for nine meetings in 2023. Two decisions were made by way of circular resolution. All members of the Supervisory Board attended more than half of the meetings of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year either in person or virtually via telephone or video conference.\n\nA **Committee for Board Affairs** has been appointed to handle the relationship between the company and the members of its Management Board relating to employment and salary; this committee also acts as the **Nominating and Remuneration Committee** (for the Management Board) and is composed of the members of the Executive Committee of the Supervisory Board. In 2023, the Committee discussed the remuneration of the Management Board, dealt with the preparation of the Remuneration Reports for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in alignment with the remuneration policy established for each as well as with the succession planning of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board over several meetings.\n\nThe **Working Committee** of the Supervisory Board is only called upon to make decisions if the urgency of the matter means that the decision cannot wait until the next meeting of the Supervisory Board. It is the Chairman's responsibility to assess the urgency of the matter. The resolutions passed must be reported in the next meeting of the Supervisory Board. Generally, the Working Committee can make decisions on any issue that is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board, but this does not include issues of particular importance or matters that must be decided upon by the full Supervisory Board by law. The Working Committee did not convene for any meetings in 2023.\n\nThe **Audit Committee** of the Supervisory Board performs the duties assigned to it by law. The Audit Committee convened for three meetings, which were also attended by the statutory auditor of the (consolidated) financial statements, and there were also discussions with the auditor without the presence of the Management Board. The meetings dealt with all the documents relating to the financial statements, the Corporate Governance Report, the appropriation of profit proposed by the Management Board and the report on the audit of the risk management (all for the 2022 financial year); in addition, PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH was again proposed for selection as statutory auditor for the 2024 financial year. The planning of the 2023 audits of the companies of the consolidated group was discussed with the auditor, and the statutory auditor reported on the results of preliminary audits. In particular, the Audit Committee received quarterly reports from Internal Audit concerning audit areas and material findings based on the audits conducted and the compliance officer reported on her activities on an ongoing basis. The accounting process was monitored on the basis of specific circumstances.\n\nThe **Investment Committee** advises the Management Board with regard to its investment policy; it has no decision-making authority. The Investment Committee held four meetings during which the members discussed the capital investment strategy, questions concerning capital structure and the focus of risk management and asset liability management.\n\nThe **IT Committee** dealt with the ongoing monitoring of project progress in the implementation of the UNIQA Insurance Platform and other IT projects over the course of four meetings.\n\nThe **Digital Transformation Committee** held four meetings in 2023 in which it dealt with the digitalisation of core processes, the reduction in complexities in the product portfolio and the consolidation of digital work processes related to customers and employees.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **Supervisory Board's Human Resources and General Remuneration Committee (\"HR Committee\")** held four meetings on diversity and inclusion matters, employee development and talent management issues, as well as executive remuneration schemes and employee participation programmes. The Committee also dealt intensively with the progress of the implementation of the HR strategy within the framework of UNIQA 3.0. The HR Committee's activities are closely coordinated with the Personnel Committee.\n\nThe chairs of the respective committees informed the full Supervisory Board about the meetings and their committees' work.\n\nFor information concerning the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees, please also refer to the details in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs the shareholder representatives are composed of the same individuals, the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG meets in a joint session with the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG.\n\n#### **Independence of the Supervisory Board**\n\nAll members of the Supervisory Board elected during the Annual General Meeting have declared their independence under Rule 53 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. Both Anna Maria D'Hulster and Jutta Kath also fulfil the criteria of Rule 54 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, as they are neither shareholders with a stake of more than 10 per cent nor do they represent the interests of such shareholders.\n\nA Supervisory Board member is considered independent if he or she is not in any business or personal relationship with the company or its Management Board that represents a material conflict of interest and is therefore capable of influencing the behaviour of the member concerned.\n\nUNIQA has established the following additional criteria for determining the independence of a Supervisory Board member:\n\n- The Supervisory Board member should not have been a member of the Management Board or a senior executive of the company or a subsidiary of the company in the past five years.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not maintain or have maintained within the last year any business relationship with the company or a subsidiary of the company that is material for the Supervisory Board member concerned. This also applies to business relationships with companies in which the Supervisory Board member has a significant economic interest, but does not apply to functions performed on decision-making bodies in the Group.\n- The Supervisory Board member must not have been a statutory auditor of the company or a shareholder or salaried employee of the auditing company within the last three years.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not be a member of the Management Board of another company in which a Management Board member of the company is a member of the other company's Supervisory Board unless one of the companies is a member of the other company's group or holds an investment in the other company.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not be a member of the Supervisory Board for longer than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a business investment or who are representing the interests of such a shareholder.\n- The Supervisory Board member should not be a close family relative (direct descendant, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, niece or nephew) of a Management Board member or of persons who are in one of the positions described in the above points.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Measures to promote women on the Management Board, the Supervisory Board and in executive positions**\n\nA community the size of ours at UNIQA lives and breathes through diversity. We value and respect each other, regardless of gender, age, origin, physical ability, religion or ideology. Our employees are just as diverse as our customers. A diverse workforce helps us to better understand our customers and better serve their different needs. For us, the guiding principle \"Living better together\" is only fulfilled when equal rights and equal opportunities are given in their entirety.\n\nUNIQA is convinced that diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion promote employee loyalty to the company as well as their innovative potential and productivity. Since they lead to higher customer satisfaction and better financial results, diversity and inclusion are also a decisive factor for economic success and growth.\n\nWith Marie-Valerie Brunner, Anna Maria D'Hulster and Jutta Kath, three women are now on the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG. This means that the proportion of female Supervisory Board members among the elected members (shareholder representatives) reaches the legally required 30 per cent. With Sabine Andre and Irene Berger, two women have also been delegated to the group of employee representatives on the Supervisory Board, which means that this board even has a ratio of 40 per cent female members now. In relation to the full Supervisory Board, the legal quota of women is also exceeded with a share of 33 per cent.\n\nSince 1 April 2023, the nine members of the identical Management Boards of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG have also included a woman, Sabine Pfeffer. This was an important step on the way towards \"more women in management positions\". The UNIQA Group does of course also continue to implement various accompanying measures in addition to its clear commitment to this goal. The objective is to change the framework conditions and prerequisites in such a way that the organisation becomes more permeable overall for women's careers. At 57.9 per cent (2022: 57.8 per cent), the share of women in the total workforce in the UNIQA Group remained stable at the end of 2023. This high proportion is driven primarily by the international insurance companies (62.8 per cent).\n\nThe proportion of women on the Management Boards in the Group is 26.3 per cent and therefore once again fell slightly compared to 2022 (2022: 27.1 per cent). Of a total of 523 managers in Austria, 174 are women, which corresponds to a steady share of over 33 per cent. In the UNIQA Group's international companies, 48.6 per cent of the managers are currently women. This corresponds to an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to the previous year (47.4 per cent). As a result, the proportion of female managers in the entire UNIQA Group rose slightly in 2023 to 43.6 per cent (699 of a total of 1,604 persons) compared to the previous year (43.0 per cent).\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **The concept of diversity**\n\nIn 2022, UNIQA published its own diversity and inclusion strategy for the first time. It serves as the basis and framework for all our activities in this area. As an integral part of our UNIQA 3.0 programme, this strategy is clearly aligned with our Guiding Principles. In addition to specific measurable goals, it also contains a bundle of initiatives that focus primarily on three key areas: equal pay for work of equal value, more women in management positions and employee inclusion.\n\nOur overarching goal is to promote diversity and inclusion at UNIQA. We will continue to pursue the following specific priorities:\n\n- 1. Equal pay for work of equal value\n- 2. Promoting equal opportunities with the clear aim of bringing more women into management positions in the future\n- 3. Generation management old and young together contribute to the success of the company\n- 4. Achieving a work/life balance\n- 5. Utilising internationality and cultural diversity as a strength\n- 6. People with disabilities better inclusion and support\n- 7. Clear commitment to non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and identity\n\nTo create commitment and clear responsibilities, we drew up a Diversity & Inclusion Policy and rolled it out for the entire Group in 2023. By organising international conferences and appointing people to be responsible for the topic in the various countries, a network has been established that drives the relevant concepts forward and facilitates optimal networking throughout the Group.\n\n#### **Equal pay for work of equal value**\n\nA standardised annual process has been established in Austria for evaluating, analysing and developing measures concerning the pay gap. The adjusted pay gap was again below 1 per cent in 2023.\n\nIn the (core) markets of Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, an equal pay analysis was carried out for the first time in 2023. Preparations were made to carry out the analysis in 2024 in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Ukraine.\n\nThe importance of fair pay is underlined not least by the inclusion of a target for the unexplained gender pay gap in the variable component of management remuneration for 2024.\n\n#### **More women in management positions**\n\nIncreasing the proportion of women in management positions continues to be a very high priority for UNIQA. With this goal in mind, a new assessment according to the Women's Career Index was carried out in 2023. Since the first analysis in 2020/21, this proportion has improved from 63 to 77 index points, which is already well above the target value of 70. The decisive factors behind this increase were a number of targeted measures, including the adoption and communication of the diversity and inclusion strategy and the definition of specific measurable targets, the development of guidelines for filling management positions and promotions, mandatory training for all managers on the topic of \"Unconscious Mind. Inclusive Leadership\", the activities of relevant networks, the UNIQA mentoring programme for women and the offer of job/top sharing and part-time management models.\n\nIn Austria, the proportion of women in all management positions increased in 2023 by almost 9 per cent, rising from 26.0 per cent to 28.3 per cent. However, the target of an increase of 5 percentage points remained unachieved at just 2.3 percentage points (on average). This target was therefore once again defined as a priority for the coming years with a focus on top management positions (Board and Board–1 levels). Differentiated approaches are being developed and pursued for UNIQA's other markets, as the starting situation varies from country to country.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Inclusion, as experienced by employees**\n\nAn inclusion index was created to measure targets and developments. This indicates the extent to which UNIQA has already succeeded in creating a working environment in which appreciation, equal opportunities, fairness and belonging can be experienced. In a Group-wide survey, a score of 4.0 (on a five-point scale) was achieved. This exceeded the target of 3.8.\n\n#### **Generation management**\n\nDemographic change and the increasing shortage of skilled labour continue to pose a major challenge for UNIQA. We are responding to this by training our own specialists, which will be further accelerated in 2024 with the implementation of a new apprenticeship programme at our headquarters in Vienna. International mentoring and reverse mentoring programmes as well as trainee programmes in various countries are also planned.\n\n#### **People with disabilities**\n\nUNIQA has actively addressed the issue of disability as a career factor by taking part in the 2023 myAbility Talent Programme. In addition, structural measures were implemented in the UNIQA Tower to create an inclusive working environment for people with disabilities and chronic illnesses. Examples of this include motorised doors, barrier-free sanitary facilities and height-adjustable desks.\n\n#### **Commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion**\n\nWe are committed to the power of diversity and leave no room for intolerance and marginalisation. This is reflected in our Diversity & Inclusion Policy, which was rolled out internationally in 2023 and will be reviewed annually.\n\nThere is now a clearly defined process and clear contact persons in the event of allegations of discrimination. This allows us to offer affected employees a low-threshold option for addressing stressful situations. In addition, a mandatory e-learning programme on the topic of equal treatment has been implemented in Austria.\n\nTwo new networks were also founded in Austria: \"Gemeinsam besser Familie\" (Better together family) and \"Sustainability\". The existing networks \"Women\", \"People with disabilities\", \"Generations\" and \"LGBTQIA+\" offer interested employees the opportunity to get involved in their respective topics.\n\nUNIQA has also supported and emphasised numerous external initiatives in Austria, for example by supporting the Female Founders, the Minerva Award (a prize for greater diversity in business), the Meritus of Pride Biz Austria (LGBT-QIA+), the national women's football team, the Special Olympics and the Austrian Frauenhäuser (women's shelters). We also welcomed the Mentory Club (women), East meets West (LGBTQIA+) and myAbility Business Forum (people with disabilities) to the UNIQA Tower.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Remuneration policy, Remuneration Report**\n\nThe Remuneration Report 2023 for the Management Board and Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG is prepared in accordance with Sections 78c and 98a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting on 3 June 2024 for approval. Furthermore, the remuneration policy pursuant to Sections 78a and 98a of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act must be resubmitted to this Annual General Meeting for a vote.\n\n#### **Risk report, directors' dealings**\n\nA comprehensive risk report (Rules 69 and 70 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance) is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The notifications concerning directors' dealings in the year under review (Rule 73 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance) can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Group website at www.uniqagroup.com.\n\n#### **External evaluation**\n\nImplementation of, and compliance with, the individual rules in the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance were evaluated by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH for the 2023 financial year – with the exception of Rules 77 to 83. Rules 77 to 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance are evaluated by the law firm Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH. The evaluation is carried out based mainly on the questionnaire, published by the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance, for the evaluation of compliance with the Code.\n\nThe evaluation by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH and Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH confirming that UNIQA complied with the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in 2023 will be published simultaneously with the annual financial report for the 2023 financial year.\n\nVienna, 7 March 2024\n\nQ.

Walter Rothensteiner was a member of the Supervisory Board for almost 28 years, including for 15 years as Chairman. Following his retirement in June of last year – which became necessary once he had reached the statutory age limit – we continued to focus on the key areas initiated by Walter Rothensteiner for the rest of the year.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of the UNIQA Insurance Group AG, which is also the Supervisory Board of the Group's largest subsidiary UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG, is made up of 15 members: ten shareholder representatives, three of whom are women, and five employee representatives, two of whom are women. Beyond the legal requirements, our Board sees its role as that of a diligent and committed sparring partner for the Management Board. As part of this role, the Supervisory Board monitors the company's performance and reputation in a constructive yet critical manner. We provide strategic momentum, seek dialogue with external guest contributors and experts and attach particular importance to a corporate culture of high ethical principles. We try to anticipate the skills that will be of particular importance for the future development of the global insurance industry and to reflect these in a complementary manner within the Supervisory Board. Yet this also means that training and ongoing professional development of the members of the Supervisory Board is a high priority, as is the way in which they collaborate with one another.\n\n#### **1. What was particularly important to us in 2023**\n\nOur nine meetings were focused on evaluating the implementation of our **\"UNIQA 3.0 – Seeding The Future\" strategic programme**, which comes to an end in December 2024. At the same time, primarily in the second half of 2023, we also worked intensively on the cornerstones for the future Group strategy from 2025 onwards, including questions related to governance and the composition of the Management Board team.\n\nThe Supervisory Board deals with a broad range of topics. While regulatory and supervisory issues are taking up more and more of our time (in addition to the obvious evaluation of operational business development), we continue to focus intensively on **three areas that are of particular importance for UNIQA's long-term development**: cultural transformation, diversity and human development, i.e. the battle for the best talent in challenging labour markets. Along these lines, we have welcomed around 6,000 new employees across the Group in the last three years alone; we are focusing on the strategic importance of the ESG concept with its broadbased impact on product design, asset management and governance; and finally, we are devoting ourselves to the costintensive and demanding process of technological and digital transformation of the company.\n\nWalter Rothensteiner had already reported to you two years ago that we pay particularly close attention to the **quality of our cooperation within the Supervisory Board** and also with the Management Board. In 2021, we therefore appointed Professor Werner H. Hoffmann, Director of the Institute for Strategic Management at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, to provide us with professional support with the structured optimisation of cooperation within the Supervisory Board. We continued this work intensively in the 2023 financial year, including with one personnel change: at the last Annual General Meeting, Rudolf Könighofer, General Director of Raiffeisenlandesbank Burgenland, was elected to the Supervisory Board in place of Walter Rothensteiner. In this role, he is showing great commitment in contributing his many years of experience to the Supervisory Board, especially when it comes to selling Raiffeisen Versicherung products.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2. Timeline and details of our main areas of focus**\n\nIn the course of 2023, the Supervisory Board was regularly informed by the Management Board about the business performance and position of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and the Group as a whole. It also supervised the Management Board's management of the business and fulfilled all the tasks assigned to the Supervisory Board by law and the Articles of Association. At the Supervisory Board meetings, the Management Board presented detailed quarterly reports and provided additional oral as well as written reports. The Supervisory Board was given timely and comprehensive information about measures requiring our approval.\n\nFour information events and special seminars were held for the Supervisory Board in 2023, providing information on the topics of \"Diversity & Inclusion\", \"IT Security\", \"ESG\" and \"Compliance & Regulatory\".\n\n#### **Focus of our deliberations**\n\nThe Supervisory Board held nine meetings in 2023. Our meetings focused on the Group's respective current earnings situation and the Group's further strategic development. The Supervisory Board in particular held three extraordinary meetings in the second half of the year to discuss the plans for the development of the corporate strategy from 2025 as well as governance issues. We also took two decisions by way of circular resolution: the first was on 9 May to approve the implementation of a capital measure by STRABAG SE and the second on 12 May to propose Rudolf Könighofer's election to the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n**•** At our meeting held on **22 February**, we mainly discussed the Group's preliminary results for the 2022 financial year. The 2023 budget was also approved in accordance with the new IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 accounting standards.\n\n- **•** The Supervisory Board meeting on **12 April** focused on the audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 and on the reports from the Management Board with upto-date information on the performance of the Group in the first quarter of 2023. We also discussed the items on the agenda of the 24th Annual General Meeting on 6 June, in particular the proposal for the appropriation of profits, the proposal for the election of Supervisory Board members and the proposal to the Annual General Meeting to re-elect PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH as statutory auditors for the 2024 financial year. The report by auditors PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH and lawyers Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH regarding compliance with the provisions of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (ÖCGK) in the 2022 financial year was also acknowledged.\n- **•** At the meeting on **25 May**, we looked in detail at the Group's earnings in the first quarter and development in the ongoing second quarter.\n- **•** The newly elected Supervisory Board was constituted on **6 June** following the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Walter Rothensteiner, stepped down from the Supervisory Board as a result of reaching the statutory age limit. Walter Rothensteiner had held this position for the last eleven years. All in all, he had been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1995. Burkhard Gantenbein succeeded him as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. This event as well as the re-election of the other existing members of the Supervisory Board and Rudolf Könighofer's election to the Supervisory Board resulted in changes to the composition of the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board committees. The Supervisory Board also approved the termination of the remaining volume of the subordinated capital debt issued in 2013 that was still outstanding after the settlement of an exchange offer, effective 31 July 2023.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **•** We met at the registered office of our Polish insurance group company in Warsaw on **23 August** and dealt specifically with the Group's earnings situation in the first half of the year and developments in the ongoing third quarter. The sale of our 75 per cent holding in Raiffeisen Life Russia was also approved, subject to approval by the relevant authorities.\n- **•** The Supervisory Board held three extraordinary meetings on **19 September, 18 October** and **10 November** to discuss the preparations for the development of a new strategic programme from the 2025 financial year onwards, in which the Supervisory Board will be closely involved. Final approval of the programme is scheduled for November 2024. We also discussed governance issues.\n- **•** In addition to reporting on the Group's profits in the first three quarters and ongoing developments in the fourth quarter, our meeting on **22 November** also covered the updated forecast for the 2023 financial year. The 2024 budget put forward by the Management Board and the medium-term planning up to 2028 were also discussed. The acquisition of Warsaw-based Telemedi of Warsaw-based Telemedi, Poland's largest provider of telemedicine services, was also approved. Poland's largest provider of telemedicine services. Cost increases due to rising inflation were also approved for the project to rebuild and merge the Confraternität and Goldenes Kreuz private clinics at the site of the Confraternität private clinic. Finally, we looked at the efficiency of our activities as a Supervisory Board. The decision was also taken to further reduce the size of the Management Board, with the result that it will be made up of seven members in future instead of nine. Peter Eichler and Erik Leyers' terms of office on the Management Board are scheduled to end on 30 June 2024. In order to optimise synergies in the Management Board departments, Wolf-Christoph Gerlach will also take over Erik Leyers' responsibilities and René Knapp those of Peter Eichler. The mandates of the Management Board members were extended until June 2028, with Sabine Pfeffer's mandate running unchanged until the end of 2026 until further notice. Following the discussions at the three extraordinary meetings in September, October and November, the Management Board was finally tasked with drawing up the strategic programme from 2025 onwards.\n\n#### **Committees of the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn addition to the Audit Committee required by law, we have set up and appointed a further six committees in order to ensure that the work of our Supervisory Board is structured effectively.\n\n- **•** The **Committee for Board Affairs** ('Personnel Committee') corresponds with the **Executive Committee of the Supervisory Board** in terms of its composition. The Committee also performs the tasks of a **Nominating and Remuneration Committee** (for the Management Board) in parallel. The Executive Committee or the abovementioned Personnel Committee held several meetings in 2023 for intensive discussions on the progress made in implementing the UNIQA 3.0 strategic programme, as well as on issues relating to the corporate strategy's future direction. The meetings also dealt with the preparation of the remuneration reports for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in alignment with the respective existing remuneration policies as well as remuneration matters relating to the Management Board.\n- **•** The **Audit Committee** held three meetings in the 2023 financial year with representatives of the (Group) auditor PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH also present, with discussions also held with these without the Management Board present. The meeting on 12 April addressed all financial statement documentation, the proposed appropriation of profit and the statutory auditor's report on the audit of the company's risk management. In addition, the 2022 annual report of the Internal Audit department, including the audit plan for the current year and the 2022 annual activity report of the compliance officers, was presented and acknowledged. Furthermore, PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH was once again proposed for election as statutory auditor for the 2024 financial year. At the meeting held on 25 May, the statutory auditor's representatives presented the planning of the audit procedures for the UNIQA Group companies for the 2023 financial year and agreed these with the Committee. At the meeting held on 22 November, representatives of the auditor informed the Committee of the findings from its preliminary audits. In addition, the Committee received quarterly reports from Internal Audit on the areas audited by this department and any material findings that arose from these audit actions, and the Compliance Officer reported on her activities on an ongoing basis. The Committee fulfilled its remit of monitoring the accounting process.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **•** The **Investment Committee** held four meetings during which the members discussed the capital investment strategy, questions concerning capital structure and the focus for risk management and asset liability management.\n- **•** The **IT Committee** held four meetings to discuss the ongoing monitoring of progress in the implementation of the UNIQA Insurance Platform and other IT projects, in particular the project portfolio.\n- **•** The **Digital Transformation Committee** held four meetings devoted to the activities of UNIQA Ventures, CHERRISK and the activities of Mavie Holding, which develops health offerings that go beyond classic insurance products. The progress of insurance products and services available digitally was also evaluated with new and agile ways of working also discussed. As in the previous year, the Committee invited several guest speakers.\n- **•** The **Supervisory Board's Human Resources and General Remuneration Committee** (\"HR Committee\") held four meetings on diversity and inclusion matters, employee development and talent management issues, executive remuneration schemes and employee participation programmes. The Committee also dealt intensively with the progress of the HR strategy within the framework of UNIQA 3.0. The HR Committee's activities are closely coordinated with the Personnel Committee. Guest speakers were invited to the meetings to address specific HR-related topics.\n- **•** The **Working Committee** did not hold any meetings in the past financial year.\n\nThe chairs of the respective committees informed the full Supervisory Board in detail about the meetings and their committees' work.\n\n#### **3. Separate and consolidated financial statements**\n\nThe separate financial statements prepared by the Management Board, the Management Report of UNIQA Insurance Group AG, the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and the Group Management Report for 2023 were audited by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH. The auditor also verified that a combined non-financial report and a consolidated corporate governance report had each been prepared for the 2023 financial year. The audit raised no objections. The separate and consolidated financial statements were each awarded an unqualified audit opinion for 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledged and approved the findings of the audit.\n\nThe evaluation of UNIQA's compliance with the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in the 2023 financial year was carried out by PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH, whereas compliance with Rules 77 to 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance was assessed by Schönherr Rechtsanwälte GmbH. The evaluations found that UNIQA had complied with the rules of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance in the 2023 financial year – to the extent that they were included in UNIQA's declaration of conformity.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledged the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and approved the 2023 annual financial statements of UNIQA Insurance Group AG. It also endorsed both the Management Report and the Group Management Report. The 2023 annual financial statements were thereby adopted in accordance with Section 96(4) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the proposal for the appropriation of profit submitted by the Management Board. Accordingly, a dividend distribution of €0.57 per share will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 3 June 2024.\n\nThis year, once again, I would like to take the opportunity on behalf of the Supervisory Board to extend my warmest thanks to all employees of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and its Group companies for their huge personal commitment in the past financial year 2023 and to wish them good health and continued success!\n\nVienna, April 2024\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\n-J\n\nBurkhard Gantenbein Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# (Consolidated) **Non-financial report**\n\n#### **About this report**\n\nThis report was prepared in accordance with the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (Directive 2014/95/EU) and covers those sustainability concerns that also reflect our material sustainability topics.\n\nThe concepts described in this report correspond to the content of the 2023 Sustainability Report, which was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The sustainability report is published together with the Group Report on 11 April 2024. This non-financial report, which forms part of our 2023 Group Report, covers the 2023 financial year and, thus, the period running from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. Where appropriate to do so, we compare our progress with the targets communicated the previous year and give an insight into our targets for next year.\n\nUNIQA Insurance Group AG decided to prepare the nonfinancial statement as a separate non-financial report (option in accordance with Section 267a(6) and Section 243b(6) of the Austrian Commercial Code) and to summarise the non-financial report for UNIQA Insurance Group AG and the consolidated non-financial report for the Group. The basis of consolidation is disclosed under Other disclosures in the explanatory notes to the 2023 consolidated financial statements. This report includes information and data relating to UNIQA Insurance Group AG (UNIQA Group). All content and data in this report refer to the UNIQA Group and its fully consolidated Group companies. Should any content or key performance indicators not cover the entire UNIQA Group, this is clearly indicated in the report or explained in more detail in footnotes in the respective sections. The Telemedi Group, a Polish start-up, was acquired to supplement our health insurance services effective 31 December 2023. The company has 49 employees. As the company was acquired just before the financial statements, it cannot be included with corresponding ESG-related data for the 2023 financial year. In mid-2023, UNIQA withdrew completely from the Russian market and concluded the contract for the sale of its subsidiary Raiffeisen Life to the Russian insurance company Renaissance Life and now only operates in 17 countries. As UNIQA continued to assume responsibility for employees and environmental matters in the 2023 financial year, these data are included in this report.\n\nSince UNIQA Insurance Group AG (headquartered in Vienna) does not directly operate the insurance business either domestically or abroad, measures to address environmental, social and employee concerns along with observing human rights, anti-corruption and bribery issues are drawn up at Group level and subsequently implemented in the operating Group companies. Accordingly, as regards the separate financial statements, no other modified or restricted concept is being pursued in any other way.\n\nAs in previous years, PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was commissioned to undertake the limited assurance audit in 2023. Further details on the audit outcomes can be found in the report on the independent audit of the consolidated non-financial report.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Company description**\n\nThe UNIQA Group is one of the leading insurance groups in its two core markets of Austria and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). We offer our customers property and casualty insurance as well as life and health insurance products. As a financial services provider, our aim is to consider sustainability-related risks and include opportunities arising from ESG trends (ESG – Environment, Social, Governance). The next section illustrates our management approach. Further information on our business model can be found in the Strategy section of the Group Report. For information on how the policies are followed and issues are managed, please see the following sections.\n\n#### **Sustainability strategy**\n\nWe carefully address those conditions that we consider conducive to a better life. To do this, we enter into dialogue with stakeholders, experts and the public, share our own approaches and play an active role. Sustainability is therefore a key part of our actions. Thanks to our clear position on this matter, we can encourage understanding and support from all our stakeholders, namely employees, customers, investors and the public.\n\nOur sustainability strategy is designed to be holistic. It ties our economic ambitions to a clear environmental and social commitment to protecting the environment and social responsibility.\n\nOur sustainability strategy was approved in October 2020 and is based on five pillars in addition to our People and Culture base and Governance framework:\n\n- ESG investment policy\n- ESG product policy\n- Sustainable operational management\n- Transparent reporting\n- Stakeholder management\n\nOur fundamental objective in 2023, as in the previous year, was to put this sustainability strategy into operation and embed it within the company by using milestone schedules. Our operational focus is on pillars 1 to 3, supported by transparent reporting (pillar 4) and stakeholder engagement (pillar 5). There is also particular focus on our climate strategy, which we pursue in accordance with recognised regulations (SBTi – Science Based Targets initiative) and as part of the memberships we have joined (NZAOA, GFA, PSI, PRI). More details can be found in the Environmental matters section.\n\n#### **Materiality concept**\n\nUNIQA's success is built on the fact that we understand how the world is changing and how we need to be able to respond to this. Our last materiality analysis took place in 2021 and identified those ESG issues deemed by our stakeholders and our business to be the most important. In 2021, we also conducted a new stakeholder identification process, including the associated weighting. We defined four stakeholder groups from this who are directly affected by our business activities, namely customers, employees, investors and the public.\n\nThe materiality analysis forms the basis for our sustainability approach, sustainability strategy and our reporting. The four most important material topics from a stakeholder perspective in 2021 were cyber risks, digital service and customer focus, advice and prevention for natural disasters as well as training and education of employees.\n\nThe five most important topics from UNIQA's perspective were the health and safety of employees, data security and processing, training and education, commitment to the environment as well as diversity and equal opportunity.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, we initiated a group-wide project aimed at preparing us for the reporting requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), where a \"double materiality analysis\" redefines the reporting limits. The analysis includes the initial collection and assessment of impacts, opportunities and risks along the value chain, involving key stakeholders such as NGOs and rating agencies. It will be completed in 2024 and will form the basis for our future reporting.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **ESG integration**\n\nThe Supervisory Board deals with sustainability reporting each year in the advisory body of the Audit Committee. Here it decides on the sustainability strategy to be pursued. The Group Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board on a quarterly basis, looking at progress with regard to environmental and social targets. The ESG Committee is embedded in the governance of the UNIQA Group and is responsible for advising the Group Executive Board. The Supervisory Board also undertakes training sessions every year in order to improve collective knowledge, skills and experience as regards sustainable development. The Annual General Meeting decides on the assessment of the Supervisory Board's performance when granting the annual discharge.\n\nOur key body for sustainability agendas is the Group ESG Committee, which was formed in 2021. It consists of members of the Management Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and heads of key departments, meets on a quarterly basis and provides the Management Board with recommendations to help them make decisions on ESG matters. The Committee is responsible for integrating and enhancing ESG factors in insurance, investment and asset management activities, along with the strategic definition and continuous development of ESG-related ambitions for the entire UNIQA Group. Its tasks also include drafting and introducing appropriate guidelines. In addition, the Committee is responsible for supervising the implementation of the Group-wide climate strategy and environmental management, as well as supporting the implementation of strategic initiatives and projects in the subsidiaries.\n\nThe Sustainability Management team is part of the Sustainability, Ethics and Public Affairs department, which was newly created in early 2020. It is responsible for operationally managing the integration of ESG factors into the UNIQA Group's core business lines. Proposals regarding ESG integration within the company are drawn up and discussed in ESG working groups formed of ESG specialists and/or representatives of various operational units and departments.\n\nIn 2023, we started to integrate strategic ESG coordinators into the local organisational structure and governance in all the UNIQA Group's countries and regions. The aim is to establish sustainability in local structures to a greater extent and to tailor relevant initiatives, products and strategies to the countries or regions' specific circumstances.\n\nPart of the variable remuneration for the Management Board of the UNIQA Group and managers in our Austrian core market is linked to climate-related interim targets. Linking the short-term incentive programme and sustainability performance highlights the priority given to these targets. This model will be extended from 2024 onwards to the Management Boards in other markets and will also be linked to a social objective. The Management Board of the UNIQA Group had a remuneration target in 2023 on reducing CO2 in operational management at our larger Austrian locations. This target had a weighting of 25 per cent of the annual target bonus. In addition, individual targets were set for the CEO, the CFO and the Board member responsible for ESG with regard to reducing the weighted average carbon intensity of our investment portfolio (WACI), which accounted for 20 per cent of their annual bonus. The long-term incentives (LTI) also reflected this prioritisation of ESG targets. In each case, 20 per cent of the targets were linked to reduction of the WACI and an increase in the proportion of investments that meet the Paris climate targets (in accordance with the criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative, SBTi). Similarly, a provision was introduced for managers in the Austrian core market that 5 per cent of their variable component is to be allocated in each case to CO2 reduction in operations management and to increasing the proportion of Paris target issuers in our investment portfolio, based on the WACI. We report on the progress of the key figures relevant to remuneration in the section on environmental matters.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Sustainability risks**\n\nThe UNIQA Group's core business is to protect its customers from risks, minimise these risks through effective bundling and generate profits. To ensure this, the position of Chief Financial and Risk Officer (CFRO) was created at Group level, which is also established on the management boards at the group companies to ensure that decision-making is riskbased.\n\nIn accordance with the latest amendment to the delegated act of the Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC), sustainability risks must be taken into account in the risk management system. This Directive entered into force on 2 August 2022. Our objective in this context is to develop an appropriate and consistent approach to considering sustainability risks, apply this approach at all times and ensure it is updated regularly. The UNIQA Group's risk management actively takes sustainability factors and their impacts into account, and integrates them into the risk strategy and risk management process as well as into internal and external reports. Sustainability risks are treated as part of the general risk classification and are analysed for short, medium and longterm impacts, monitored and reported on as part of the risk management process. The occurrence of sustainability risks may have an actual or potential material adverse impact on the value of the Group's assets, liabilities, financial position or reputation. The results of the sustainability risk identification and assessment process are intended to help support management decisions as part of the UNIQA Group's product design or investment strategy.\n\nIn 2023, the UNIQA Group focused on refining its long-term climate scenarios, taking into account the experience from the previous reporting period. A quantitative approach was developed for the entire Group, analysing both the physical and transitory risks in the portfolio. The Group identified sustainability risks in the operational risk cycle at an early stage. The starting point was the implementation of upcoming changes resulting from a review of the Solvency II quantitative reporting templates. This involves reporting quantitative data on physical and transitional risks directly to the national supervisory authority and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). We also improved the process for evaluating outsourcing risks throughout the Group, explicitly taking the sustainability of our outsourcing partners into account. All the relevant ESG data were integrated into our risk analysis software in 2023 to enable the daily monitoring of ESG limit utilisation rates from 2024 onwards.\n\nThe UNIQA Group's Natural Catastrophes Competence Centre (NCCC) deals with the complexity and evolution of natural disasters, especially in connection with climate change. The NCCC plays a crucial role in analysing various risk factors for the Group. This includes understanding the risk exposure that changes over time, identifying risk concentrations and calculating the expected annual losses based on specific natural hazards and locations, both individually and on an aggregated basis. An essential part of the NCCC's work is to analyse scenarios that realistically depict future events, including extreme and rare events, as well as the impacts of climate change under different temperature scenarios with a focus on floods, storms and hail. A key feature of the NCCC's approach is the use of advanced stochastic models that simulate hundreds of thousands of potential natural events. These models are not only state-of-the-art, but are also regularly refined to incorporate the latest data and methods. A unique feature of the NCCC's approach is that two thirds of these models incorporate the UNIQA Group's own historical claims data and thus offer a tailored risk perspective that differs from the non-specific assessments of general market models. The insights gained from these stochastic natural disaster models are fundamental to the Group's comprehensive natural disaster risk management strategy. The NCCC also plays a crucial role in the assessment of the Group's underwriting and reinsurance strategies, in particular through the annual stress scenario tests.\n\nMaterial risks related to non-financial concerns are explained in more detail in the respective sections of this report.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Environmental matters**\n\nThis section describes the influence of environmental matters on our business activities along with the impacts of our business activities on the environment. It explains the concepts and measures in place as well as specific targets and impacts.\n\nThe following topics in particular are of material importance in terms of environmental matters: commitment to climate action, commitment to European climate targets, and advice on and prevention of natural disasters. We are tackling these challenges by supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy through our investments and insurance products. It is also our aim to structure our own operational management in an exemplary fashion, taking our environmental and social targets into account.\n\n#### **UNIQA climate strategy**\n\nWe took our first major step towards implementing our own climate strategy in early 2019, when we approved UNIQA's decarbonisation policy to phase out coal in our investments and underwriting. To pursue more general climate targets, we acceded to the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) in 2021 and the Green Finance Alliance in 2022, committing ourselves to more binding targets. One major success in 2023 was the validation of our interim targets for 2030 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), both for our investment portfolio and for our own operational management.\n\nThe key objectives in UNIQA's climate strategy are as follows:\n\n- Pursuit of climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement in investments and underwriting, and operational ecology in compliance with both EU climate change mitigation and climate change adaption targets\n- Net-zero emissions in our business model by 2040 in Austria, and by 2050 throughout the entire Group\n- Pursuit of and compliance with science-based interim targets for 2025, 2030 and 2035 based on climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement\n- Increase in sustainable investments to more than €2 billion by 2025\n- Prevention of any negative impact on other EU environmental targets\n- Compliance with minimum social standards\n\nWe define net-zero emissions as (a) the reduction of our scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions to zero at best or to a residual level that is compatible with achieving net-zero emissions at global or sectoral level in corresponding scenarios or sector paths within the framework of the 1.5 degrees Celsius target; and (b) the neutralisation of all residual emissions to the net-zero target year and all greenhouse gas emissions subsequently released into the atmosphere.\n\n#### Validation of our climate targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n\nOur interim targets to reduce CO2 in our investments and own operational management by 2030 have been successfully reviewed and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) since December 2023. The initiative defines and promotes targets based on scientific findings and independently verifies these targets set by companies. These science based 1.5 degrees Celsius targets are based on a simple principle: they focus on the amount of emissions that must be reduced in order to achieve the central aim of the Paris Agreement – to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In line with the SBTi framework, we have set interim targets for our investment portfolio for 2030 in four areas, which account for 23 per cent of our total investment volume. We are focusing on project financing and corporate loans for power generation, other long-term corporate loans, and listed stocks and corporate bonds. We will implement our Science Based Targets by 2030 with our commitment activities and decarbonisation target trajectory. The UNIQA Group has also set itself SBTi interim targets for our operational management. We are specifically committed to reducing our direct Scope 1 and indirect Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42 per cent by 2030 compared to the baseline year 2021.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Environmental matters in investment**\n\nIn our investment strategy, we are guided by the principles of sustainability, commit ourselves to the climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement to achieve net-zero emissions across the Group by 2050, and actively promote decarbonisation as a company and investor. By focusing the analysis of our portfolio on CO2, we identify climate risks and opportunities at an early stage and can assess how ready our issuers are for the transformation in line with the Paris Agreement. Failure to comply with ESG criteria in our investment decisions not only has a negative impact on the environment and society, but also carries the risk of reputational damage. Targeted sustainable investments contribute to financing the transformation, reduce our exposure to ESG risks and increase sustainability-related opportunities. We engage in intensive dialogue with companies and asset managers to fulfil our role as an investor.\n\n#### Decarbonisation strategy\n\nAs part of our membership in the United Nations Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) and the Austrian Green Finance Alliance (GFA), we are committed to the gradual decarbonisation of our portfolio in order to be optimally aligned with the climate target trajectory in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement and achieve net-zero emissions for our investments throughout the Group by 2050.\n\nThis year's successful validation of our interim climate targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) rounds off our sustainability strategy for investments. By 2030, we aim to gradually transform our portfolio and reduce our Scope 3 emissions, which are largely generated in Scope 3.15 (Investments) by our investments. We also encourage our investors to set science-based climate targets themselves. By working with our specialist data provider ISS (Institutional Shareholder Services), we are able to carry out a detailed analysis of our investments in relation to various sustainability factors.\n\nThese data on our investees are necessary, among other things, to ensure our exclusion or phase-out strategy, which provides for the following limitations:\n\n#### **Coal**\n\n- First coal exclusion criteria from 2019\n- No new direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the coal business from 2024\n- Phase-out of existing direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the coal business by 2030\n- New investment products offered will only be coal-free\n\n#### **Oil**\n\n- Orderly withdrawal from oil by 2030\n- No new direct investments in the expansion of oil infrastructure projects from 2025\n- No new direct investments in companies with more than 30 per cent of their revenue from the oil sector from 2025\n- Divestment of direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the oil business by 2030\n\n#### **Natural gas**\n\n- Orderly withdrawal from natural gas by 2035\n- No new direct investments in the expansion of natural gas infrastructure projects from 2026\n- No new direct investments in companies with more than 30 per cent of their revenue from the natural gas sector from 2026\n- Divestment of direct investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from the natural gas business by 2035\n- If a company has SBTi-validated targets, carries out EU taxonomy-aligned activities or publicly commits to the Paris Agreement, an exception can be made for our limits.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Nuclear energy**\n\n- No new direct investments in the expansion of nuclear infrastructure projects from 2025\n- Divestment of investments in companies with more than 5 per cent of their revenue from nuclear energy by 2035\n- If a company has SBTi-validated targets, carries out EU taxonomy-aligned activities or publicly commits to the Paris Agreement, an exception can be made for our limits.\n\n#### Carbon emission intensity\n\nOur decarbonisation target trajectory focuses on individual issuers whose greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the weighted average carbon emission intensity (WACI). This key indicator is calculated for companies as the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions relative to the company's revenue, weighted by our investment volume. We are also observing Scope 3 emissions, but are not currently including them in the key indicator. Once we have meaningful reports on corporate Scope 3 emissions, we plan to take them into account.\n\nWe use the values for 2021 as the baseline to measure our activities and targets. On this basis, the UNIQA portfolio's WACI has fallen by 29 per cent from 2021 to 2023 and by 27 per cent since the previous year. This shows the improvement in the efficiency of the companies in which we are invested, with regard to their Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in relation to their revenue. As such, we have reached our emissions reduction target of 15 per cent compared to 2021, which was set for the beginning of 2025, a year earlier. The decrease from 2022 to 2023 is mainly due to the reduction in the emission intensity of our existing investments.\n\n|                                                                                      | 2021<br>(baseline year) | 2022 | 2023 | 2025<br>(target) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------|------|------------------|\n| Weighted average carbon emission intensity<br>[Scope 1 & 2 t CO2e/€ million revenue] | 99                      | 96   | 701) | 84               |\n\n1) The Executive Board's remuneration for 2023 was linked, among other things, to the WACI key indicator.\n\n#### Carbon Risk Rating\n\nThe Carbon Risk Rating is an overall assessment of companies and countries on a scale of 0 to 100 for climate risk management, determined by ISS. A higher rating indicates improved carbon management. For companies, the assessment is based on more than 100 industry-specific indicators that classify the carbon risk at industry and subsector level. For states, the rating assesses the government's effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate risks. The rating is weighted by investment volume. In 2023, our rating improved by 4 per cent compared with 2022, partly due to our investment decisions and partly due to an improvement in internal risk management at the companies we invested in.\n\n#### ESG performance score\n\nThe ESG performance score monitors the ESG profile of our investments and ranges from 0 to 100, with over 50 considered \"Prime\" and showing above average ESG performance. The score is composed of industry-specific and cross-industry indicators with different weighting depending on the industry. The topics cover dealing with suppliers, the standard of corporate governance in the company as well as environmental aspects. The score is weighted by investment volume. Our ESG performance score remained relatively stable at the ISS Prime level of 51.6 in 2023 compared with 2022.\n\n|                       | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|\n| ESG performance score | 51.3 | 51.6 |\n\n|                    | 2022 | 2023 |\n|--------------------|------|------|\n| Carbon Risk Rating | 50.2 | 52.4 |\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Absolute financed emissions\n\nAbsolute financed emissions provide an indication of the carbon emissions that we finance through our investments in companies and countries. The indicator is calculated by multiplying our holding in a company by its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We obtain this data from ISS. UNIQA's financed emissions increased by 7 per cent compared with 2022, but are still 21 per cent below their 2021 level. In 2023, the share of companies that have set themselves SBTi emission reduction targets in the total emissions financed by UNIQA increased to 31 per cent (compared with 24 per cent in 2022). For this reason, we expect a future reduction in our corporate portfolio's financed emissions.\n\n**2022 2023** Financed emissions from corporate investments\\* [t CO2 e] 383,746 409,714 Share of financed corporate investment emissions with targets approved by SBTi\\* 24% 31%2)\n\n\\* The coverage of financed emissions from our investments in listed companies, corporate bonds (excluding collateralised debt) and corporate loans was 77 per cent for 2023.\n\nIn line with our NZAOA membership, we started monitoring other country-specific issues for government bonds in 2023 using the PCAF methodology3). The monitoring is to be used in future for NZAOA reporting and a key indicator is to be derived as a basis for future targets. We are reporting for the first time on the absolute emissions financed from government bonds for 2023.\n\n|                                             | Volume<br>invested<br>(EUR) | Carbon<br>emissions 2023<br>(Scope 1)<br>[t CO₂e]4) |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Financed emissions from<br>government bonds | 6,029,700,423               | 2,088,428                                           |\n\nThe coverage of the total financed emissions from our investments in listed companies, corporate bonds (excluding collateralised debt), corporate loans and government bonds was 47 per cent for 2023. In the near future, we plan to increase this coverage by engaging in other asset classes.\n\n2) The Executive Board's remuneration for 2023 was linked, among other things, to the SBTi percentage.\n\n3) PCAF methodology: (investment position in government bonds (EUR)/GDP adjusted for purchasing power (EUR) \\* country's Scope 1 production emissions [t CO₂e])\n\n4) The data are taken from the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) database. The data cover 100 per cent of direct investments in government bonds.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Sustainable investments\n\nThe UNIQA Group finances issuers that contribute to emission reduction or social projects. Depending on the asset class, we are guided by the sustainability definitions for Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds according to International Capital Market Association (ICMA) principles. Funds are included in our sustainable investments in accordance with Article 9 (dark green funds) of the EU Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and thus represent investments with the pursuit of a sustainability goal as defined by the SFDR. Qualified investments in infrastructure projects are also included in our sustainable investments. The sustainable investment strategy is set out in the UNIQA Group Responsible Investment Standard. Investments made are regularly reviewed by the Risk Management team. UNIQA's sustainable investments increased by 67 per cent to €2.17 billion between 2021 and 2023. This enabled us to exceed our target of €2 billion for 2025 a year earlier. This target was previously set in 2021, including investments in Article 8 funds. However, due to our stricter reclassification of what we define as sustainable investments, these funds are no longer included. Nevertheless, we have achieved our target, mainly due to the significant increase in our investments in Green Bonds, which have more than doubled since 2021. In addition, the share of sustainable installations in our overall portfolio almost doubled in 2023, to 10 per cent. Our sustainable investments including Article 8 funds amounted to €1.7 billion in 2022. With Article 8 funds having been removed from our definition of sustainable investments, the figure for 2022 was €1.46 billion.\n\n#### Principal adverse impacts\n\nWith reference to the EU Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) we monitor the diverse criteria for the negative impact of individual issuers on the environment and society – described as principal adverse impacts – and have been reporting on these indicators for the first time since mid-2023 for our investment activities. One focus area is the annual reduction of CO2e emissions. Similarly, we monitor social issues such as non-compliance with the principles of the UN Global Compact or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We do not make any new investments in companies that violate these principles. Furthermore we do not finance any companies involved in the manufacture or sales of anti-personnel landmines, cluster ammunition or chemical and biological weapons. We also do not finance any countries with no tax cooperation arrangements in place with the EU and do not make any investments in their government bonds.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Engagement strategy\n\nAs part of our engagement strategy, which was launched in 2022 and expanded further in 2023, we rely on both proactive and reactive engagement in direct and indirect contact with our investees. This engagement is designed to improve the performance of our investees, especially in terms of their climate strategy and decarbonisation targets and measures. We rely on active dialogue to promote the idea of transition in order to prevent the divestment step if possible.\n\nBy proactive engagement we mean direct bilateral contact with individual companies. The focus is on those companies that together account for 65 per cent of our financed emissions. Over the next four years, we will be supporting these companies to achieve their goals in bilateral discussions with the ESG teams.\n\nBy reactive engagement we mean, on the one hand, collaborative engagement, which we have been pursuing since 2022 as part of our membership in the Climate Action 100+ (CA 100+) investor initiative. In this case, a group of international investors contact one of the 170 companies that have the highest emissions globally, to align its climate strategy and reporting with science-based climate targets.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been pursuing controversial or standards-based engagement, which is led by ISS, since 2023. ISS enables investors to engage with companies that commit serious and structural violations of normative criteria in the areas of corporate governance, human and labour rights, the environment, bribery and corruption or fail to take measures to adequately respond to these violations and to take countermeasures. These include, in particular, violations of the principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) and of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nAs part of our engagement, we try to convince our investees to do the following:\n\n- Implement a governance framework that defines climate risk responsibilities and supervisory duties\n- Take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain in line with the Paris climate target of 1.5 degrees Celsius and set SBTi-validated targets, if not already in place\n- Transparent disclosure to demonstrate the resilience of the corporate strategy with regard to different climate scenarios\n\nWe review our engagement activities on the basis of key indicators. In line with our proactive bilateral engagement strategy, we contacted two companies selected for their high share of our financed emissions and obtained an initial overview of our engagement partners' climate-relevant targets, measures and strategies in 2023. Together, these two companies represent 33 per cent of our financed emissions. As part of our membership in CA 100+, we participated in a collaborative case of engagement last year. Together with ISS, we joined 25 standards-based engagements in the 2023 reporting year. These included 15 cases of social violations and ten cases of environmental violations. In 23 cases, measures or commitments have already been adopted by the companies concerned to remedy the violation. Under our membership in the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, we took part in another collaborative engagement with one of the world's largest asset managers in 2023, focussing on climate-specific issues.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Topic           | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decarbonisation | Successful validation of the interim climate targets for our<br>portfolio by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)                                                                                                                                                                                     | We will continuously improve the ESG quality of our<br>assets by aligning our portfolio more closely with the<br>obligations we have entered into with our memberships.<br>Our decarbonisation and engagement measures will<br>continue in line with our science-based targets in<br>the following year.

Our long-term goal is to cover 65 per cent of our financed emissions through our engagements over the next four years. We plan to cover not only relevant climate issues in our bilateral engagements but also other environmental issues such as biodiversity and water, as well as governance issues.                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n#### **Environmental matters in underwriting in the Retail segment**\n\nAs one of the leading insurers in Central and Eastern Europe, we bear equal responsibility for protecting the personal living standards of our customers and the value added processes of our company. Risk prevention and mitigation are key areas in which environmental and social impacts increasingly need to be incorporated into the advisory approach. Sustainability factors are therefore increasingly being taken into account in the underwriting process as well as products and services within our insurance business.\n\nEvery product development follows a structured, transparent process, which is laid down in our policy and our product development process standard. An internal audit process ensures that any product development in Austria is also examined and evaluated from an ESG perspective. This process was further developed and consolidated in 2023.\n\nUNIQA Austria's life insurance is also adaptable. Thanks to highly flexible policy structures and transparent, easyto-understand cost models, it can be tailored to customers' needs. In endowment life insurance, we launched another UNIQA portfolio in category c (sustainability category according to IDD) in autumn 2023 and thus integrated a standardised product range focused on sustainability for various risk classes.\n\nIn property insurance, UNIQA Austria is focussing on important future issues such as the circular economy and alternative energies. The new \"Privatschutz Wohnen & Freizeit\" household and homeowner insurance launched in 2023 includes, for example, increased natural disaster relief and a module for circular economy and renewable energies.\n\nWe support contemporary medical care in health insurance in Austria, motivating our customers to live healthier lives by building medical centres, expanding our partner network LARA, offering telemedicine surgeries and trained Vital-Coaches.\n\nUNIQA Austria has been offering a new senior citizens' casualty insurance product since 2023. In particular, it provides older customers with security in covering care costs so that their standard of living can be maintained. This contributes to more equal access to care services and reduces social inequalities in healthcare.\n\nIn the bancassurance sector in Austria, we are increasingly focused on funds that take social, ecological and ethical criteria into account when it comes to unit-linked products. We also provide special subsidies for taking out homeowner and household insurance policies with ecological elements such as photovoltaic or solar systems, as well as for motor vehicle insurance for electric vehicles.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nLikewise, we are gradually integrating sustainability into our insurance products on international markets, such as insurance coverage for electric vehicles at UNIQA Czechia and UNIQA Slovakia. UNIQA Poland addresses social needs through enhanced cover, taking into account the needs of older people in relation to specific services, as well as student insurance with a focus on diversity and psychological support.\n\n| Topic                               | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                    | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sustainability in<br>life insurance | Expansion of the UNIQA portfolio in category c<br>(sustainability category according to IDD) for endowment<br>life insurance at UNIQA Austria | Exclusively products with a focus on sustainability in<br>unit-linked life insurance from UNIQA Austria (new green<br>individual funds in categories c and b; funds in category b<br>bear the Austrian eco-label) |\n\n### **Environmental matters in underwriting in the Corporate Business line**\n\nAt a time marked by the challenges of climate change, the role of corporate business is growing beyond the mere coverage of risks. As a facilitator for improving financial resilience, UNIQA is at the interface between the development of the industry and responsibility for sustainability. Sustainability developments have a significant impact on the insurance industry and on the insured companies. These include the increase in climate-related damage and the increased market demand for new sustainable products and product components. The UNIQA Group is responding by integrating ESG risks into the underwriting process, incorporating ESG criteria into customer analysis and disclosing the underwriting portfolio's sustainability performance. These innovations support sustainable business and new technologies.\n\n#### **Sustainability strategy in UNIQA's corporate business**\n\nOur sustainability strategy approach in UNIQA's corporate business comprises three main directions:\n\n#### **1. Advice on strengthening resilience to climate-related risks**\n\nThe UNIQA Group offers companies advice to strengthen their resilience to climate risks and to overcome challenges. \"First-aid measures\" expand the recommendations for risk prevention.\n\n#### **2. Decarbonisation of the underwriting portfolio**\n\nThe UNIQA Group aims to achieve net-zero emissions in the underwriting portfolio by 2040 in Austria, and by 2050 in CEE. Decarbonisation steps include the phase-out of coal (since 2019), oil (by 2030), and gas (by 2035) in corporate business.\n\n#### **3. Development of new sustainability products and components**\n\nUNIQA Corporate Business supports customers in their sustainable economic growth and in developing new sustainable technologies through innovative products. The focus is on the circular economy and environmental liability components in insurance solutions.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Insurance-associated emissions\n\nAs a member of the Austrian Green Finance Alliance (GFA), we aim to report on our insurance-associated greenhouse gas emissions and to set targets to reduce our emissions to net-zero in Austria by 2040 and in CEE by 2050. In the 2023 reporting year, we completed the analysis of our Austrian corporate portfolio for the 2022 financial year using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology for measuring insurance-associated emissions. We also carried out the calculation for 2023 in Austria. 2022 serves as the baseline year for future target tracking. The interim targets up to 2040 and 2050 have been drawn up for the entire UNIQA Group and can be found with the emission levels for Austria in the following table:\n\n| Topic                  | 2022<br>(Baseline) | 2023<br>(Status)  | 2025 | 2030 | 2035 | 2040 | 2045 | 2050 |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| UNIQA<br>Austria       | 20,164*<br>t CO₂e  | 19,722*<br>t CO₂e | -5%  | -20% | -40% | -60% | -    | -    |\n| UNIQA<br>International | n.a.**             | n.a.**            | -5%  | -15% | -25% | -40% | -45% | -50% |\n\n\\* The portfolio's insurance-associated emissions in the property and technology insurance (100 per cent) und motor vehicle liability insurance (30 per cent) business lines. The premium coverage of the portfolio analysed is 53 per cent of the total insurance portfolio of industrial insurance (includes property insurance, liability insurance, transport insurance, and financial lines).\n\n\\*\\* Only emissions from Austria are reported in 2023. In 2024, we will in any case complete the analysis with all EU markets, which together are 85 per cent of the UNIQA International premium. Over the following years, the entire Group will gradually follow in the actual recording and detailed planning.\n\n#### **Proxies and estimates used**\n\n#### a) Calculation of insurance-associated emissions\n\nExternally-sourced industry data on the business activities' carbon emission intensity (Scope 1 & 2) (according to NACE codes) were used to calculate the insurance-associated carbon emissions in the underwriting portfolio. We calculated the total amount of carbon emissions from these data, combined with our customers' business activity, revenue, and annual insurance premium, using the PCAF formula. The calculation corresponds to a PCAF data quality factor of 5.\n\nEstimates: where public information on revenue was not available, other public sources containing the companies' financial data, including estimates, were used. Internal estimates were used for public institutions, companies with negative revenue and non-commercial companies.\n\n#### (b) Definition of decarbonisation targets\n\nThe interim decarbonisation targets were defined taking into account:\n\n- the local decarbonisation ambitions of the main UNIQA markets from a premium volume perspective (Austria, Poland, Czechia/Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria),\n- our portfolio's current industry distribution,\n- major decarbonisation initiatives (such as the phasing out of fossil fuels, growth of the renewable energy business),\n- the countries' nationally determined emission reduction plans for the relevant industries represented (in particular energy, heavy industry, transport and waste).\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe level of ambition for the interim targets corresponds with the decarbonisation commitments of the states represented and is reinforced by the comprehensive decarbonisation agenda at UNIQA Corporate Business.\n\n#### ESG risk assessment\n\nIn May 2023, UNIQA Corporate Business introduced the ESG standard for the underwriting process, which integrates the corporate business' ESG risks into the process. The underwriting platform's special functions enable automated risk assessment of the submitted quotes with regard to their exposure to environmental, social and governance risks. The risk assessment is carried out by an external data provider and is based on the guidelines of the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) \"Management of Environmental, Social and Governance Risks in the Non-Life Business\". Of the 15,006 customers rated in the Austrian portfolio, 45 per cent were assigned at least one ESG risk. Of these, 45 per cent had at least one high environmental risk, 68 per cent at least one high social risk, and 42 per cent at least one high governance risk.\n\n| Results of the ESG risk assessment of the Austrian portfolio*            | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Number of customers assessed with respect to their exposure to ESG risks | 15,006 |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with ESG risks allocated to them        | 45%    |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with at least 1 high E risk             | 45%    |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with at least 1 high S risk             | 68%    |\n| Proportion of customers assessed with at least 1 high G risk             | 42%    |\n\n\\* The analysis included companies with standardised insurance products whose premiums make up 25 per cent of the entire SME portfolio. In 2024, we will also analyse Austrian portfolios of industrial insurers and portfolios of industrial insurers or EU markets.\n\nThe results are consistent with the assumption that many of the industries in our underwriting portfolio are potentially exposed to at least one of the high ESG risks. We will publish the progress made in analysing the company data in relation to ESG risks in the next sustainability report.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Decarbonisation of the underwriting portfolio\n\nWe are tracking the business volumes in all our markets with companies in sectors that use coal, oil and natural gas as part of our commitment to exit the fossil fuel business. We have defined a clear timetable for this exit and see clear progress in decarbonising the portfolio, as measured by the absolute premium in Corporate Business (business lines: property, technology and liability insurance). We plan to incorporate further business lines into the analysis in 2024.\n\n| Corporate business<br>Non-life premiums for<br>coal/gas/oil companies | 2022       | 2023       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Coal                                                                  | €6,503,758 | €4,102,667 |\n| Natural gas/oil                                                       | €5,578,239 | €5,399,079 |\n\nThe decline in the coal business in Corporate Business by almost half in 2023 is due to essentially meeting the exit commitments in our Polish portfolio. We monitored all remaining coal customers in the portfolio in 2023 based on available data with regard to their commitment to climate-related targets and relevant climate strategies. We also want to conduct this analysis in 2024 for all oil and gas companies in our portfolio. With respect to the analysis of coal customers, the results of our first step (monitoring publicly available data) provide us with a clear overview of those customers that may be subject to written commitment. In accordance with our decarbonisation declaration, we are committed to exiting all portfolio items in companies that generate more than 5 per cent of their revenue from activities in the coal sector by 2030. This does not include companies that have set science-based climate targets (time horizon: 2050, including five-year interim targets) and are decarbonising their core business in line with the Paris Agreement, or projects that are in line with the Paris targets. Our customers who have published such commitments already, make up 25 per cent according to our analysis of the open data. We will work with those customers who have not yet defined their own decarbonisation pathway to obtain confirmation of their climate plans by the end of 2026. We will gradually stop extending policies for those coal customers who do not commit to emission reduction plans in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\n#### Renewable energy business\n\nWe intend to expand our business activities with companies from the following sectors across the Group as part of our solutions for renewable energies: solar power, wind power, hydropower and biomass energy. In 2023, we increased our premium volume in renewables by 20 per cent. There are multiple UNIQA markets behind this growth, i.e. Austria, Romania and Bulgaria, where we are experiencing significant growth in the renewable energy business and technical consulting for photovoltaics.\n\n|                                                                          | 2022        | 2023        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net annual premium from insured companies in the renewable energy sector | €12,648,649 | €16,434,075 |\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Topic                                       | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Decarbonisation<br>and ESG risk<br>analysis | Calculation of carbon emissions and ESG risk analysis of<br>the underwriting portfolio by integrating external data<br>into the front-end system for automatic ESG-related<br>calculations with each quote<br>Expansion of the underwriting process to include the<br>ESG risk assessment in the internal ESG Standard for<br>Underwriting process regulation document and the ESG<br>consultant role implemented in each business unit to<br>analyse the quotes escalated based on the ESG criteria | We plan to continue our portfolio analysis for greenhouse<br>gas emissions and ESG risks in all UNIQA International<br>markets in 2024.

As UNIQA, we can contribute to this by promoting sustainability and reducing negative impacts both through our business activities and in our own company. Failure to comply with environmental criteria in operational management may have negative impacts on the environment (e.g. increased carbon emissions), which may harm UNIQA's reputation. Negative impacts on the environment and society (such as breaches of social standards) and reputational risks for UNIQA may also occur in procurement. Environmental management in our own operations is therefore a key aspect of our sustainability strategy and the introduction of a certified environmental management system in Austria is one of our most important strategic ambitions.\n\nThe steps we are taking to reduce our carbon emissions are based on the application of international certifications and standards in our dealings with suppliers and on the optimisation of our internal environmental management systems. We are increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions by systematically conserving resources and encouraging the use of low-emission mobility options.\n\nAt group level, we successfully completed the process for calculating and validating science-based climate targets in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2023. These targets not only include aligning our investments with the trajectory for the 1.5 degrees Celsius target set under the Paris Agreement, but also reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our own operational management (direct Scope 1 emissions and indirect Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity and heat). We are specifically committed to reducing our direct Scope 1 and indirect Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42 per cent by 2030 as against the baseline year 2021.\n\nIn 2024, we will conduct a comprehensive detailed survey of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for our Group's own buildings. In the course of 2025, the data quality will be improved so that we can draw up a strategy to achieve our SBTi targets with action plans from 2026 onwards. By implementing this strategy, we aim to achieve net-zero emissions in Austria by 2040 and in CEE by 2050.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nOur internal environmental management strategy is underpinned by our commitment to the Paris climate targets, which we have implemented with an initial programme of operational milestones and measures in 2022 for all sales offices in Austria. This plan includes the following key pillars:\n\n- Use exclusively ecolabel 46 certified green energy from 2024 onwards\n- Increase energy efficiency in our buildings by at least 33 per cent by 2040 compared with 2019\n- Expand photovoltaic capacity to at least 600 kWp by 2035\n- Phase out all oil and gas heating by 2035 at the latest\n- Change over to 100 per cent electric vehicles in the company fleet by 2030 at the latest\n\n#### Introduction of an EMAS-compliant environmental management system\n\nUNIQA actively promotes environmental protection as part of the Group's sustainability strategy and as a member of the Green Finance Alliance. To implement this commitment, an environmental management system according to EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) will be introduced at the Austrian location by the end of 2024. EMAS improves operational environmental performance by assessing key areas such as energy efficiency, emissions and waste management. We have already collected relevant data, evaluated and implemented processes and published our environmental policy. Recycling islands were introduced to improve waste separation and recycling rates in the company. Regular audits will ensure the effectiveness of the environmental management system. We will continue our efforts to reduce our ecological footprint.\n\n#### Sustainability in procurement\n\nUNIQA's Group Procurement Policy lays out our procurement model and our clear commitment to high social and environmental values, including the integrity of our suppliers and the strict prohibition of corruption and bribery. UNIQA is committed to high social and environmental standards, including the selection of suppliers who follow our value system and demonstrate a high level of integrity. Supplier registration verifies the company's master data, cost-effectiveness, certificates (e.g. ISO) and compliance with laws and conventions. Since July 2023, the UNIQA Code of Conduct has been integrated into the supplier registration process, which includes human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. The largest suppliers are assessed annually, also taking into account advanced security, data protection and ESG factors.\n\n#### Corporate carbon footprint\n\nUsing the energy consumption figures and environmental data available for the 2023 financial year, we have once again calculated UNIQA's corporate carbon footprint (CCF). This quantifies the greenhouse gas emissions in our head offices and Austrian regional offices and includes companyspecific and other relevant emissions, measured in CO2 equivalents. The figures cover the main offices in 18 UNIQA countries (including Russia) as well as 9 regional offices in Austria and, for the first time, the 2023 report also includes roughly 55 service centres in Austria. The CCF reflects all emissions directly produced within the company (Scope 1) as well as indirect emissions resulting from bought-in electricity and heating (Scope 2). Additional indirect emissions caused by business travel (by plane and train) are also included (Scope 3.6). In 2023, we introduced changes to the process for calculating the CCF. For example, environmental data collection was switched to a professional web-based tool. This has significantly improved the process, both in terms of collecting data and monitoring the results. The transition also led to a change in the calculation, since other emission databases are used in some aspects. In order to compare 2023 with the previous year on the same basis, the 2022 CCF was recalculated using the new tool. The total carbon emissions \n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nfor the 2022 financial year increased by around 3 per cent as a result of the changeover. This increase is partly due to using different emission factors: in the previous year, we used emission factors from Ecoinvent, the Federal Environment Agency, VDA and the IEA, but in the new calculation, Ecoinvent emission factors were used across the board for consistency. Due to system constraints in the choice of emission factors, a higher emission factor was used for flights. The new calculation used a technology-based factor for district heating consumption (compared to a country-specific factor with the old calculation). Fuel consumption for hybrid vehicles was also included. The table below shows the original and recalculated values for 2022. The targets validated by the SBTi will be recalculated for the 2024 financial year following the future availability of data from all owner-occupied buildings, re-submitted for validation and then disclosed accordingly.\n\nIn 2023, absolute market-based greenhouse gas emissions increased by 19 per cent to 9,909 metric tons of CO2 compared with the previous year, while greenhouse gas emissions per employee fell by around 3 per cent. The increase in absolute emissions is explained by the expansion of the accounting group by a further 55 offices in Austria, which has mainly increased Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in heating, and by the first inclusion of the general electricity at the Warsaw office. Similarly, Scope 3 emissions in mobility increased dramatically across countries as business travel resumed after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, refrigerant consumption was included in the CCF calculation for the first time in 2023, which increased emissions by almost 200 metric tons alone. The ongoing transition to green electricity tariffs cushioned the impact. This and the high level of greening for the new sites added to the accounting group in 2023 led to a slight reduction in carbon emissions per employee.\n\n| Corporate carbon footprint5)                          |                        |                     | 20216)   | 20227)<br>(Old calculation) | 20228)<br>(New calculation) | 20239) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Heating             | 323      | 302                         | 282                         | 44     |\n| Scope 1 – Direct emissions                            | t CO2e                 | Vehicles            | 4,208    | 3,599                       | 4,387                       | 4,410  |\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Refrigerant         | n/a10)   | n/a10)                      | n/a10)                      | 197    |\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Electricity         | 2,958    | 2,125                       | 2,324                       | 2,474  |\n| Scope 2 – Indirect emissions<br>(market-based)        | t CO2e                 | District<br>heating | 2,01611) | 1,813                       | 976                         | 1,682  |\n| Scope 3 – Other indirect<br>emissions                 | t CO2e                 | Flights             | 52       | 253                         | 344                         | 64     |\n|                                                       | t CO2e                 | Train trips         | 28       | 32                          | 32                          | 64     |\n| Total CO2 emissions<br>(market-based)                 | t CO2e                 |                     | 9,585    | 8,124                       | 8,345                       | 9,909  |\n| Total CO2 emissions<br>(market-based) per employee12) | t CO2e per<br>employee |                     | 1.39     | 1.00                        | 1.01                        | 0.99   |\n\n5) Details of the calculations and corresponding definitions of primary energy consumption can be found in the explanatory notes before the table.

In particular, we will explain our approaches to social activities and sponsorships, customer focus and innovative services and products as well as data protection.\n\nNegative macroeconomic trends pose a risk to UNIQA's business model. We are committed to pursuing the UNIQA 3.0 corporate strategy to improve and develop our business so that we can mitigate these risks and contribute to achieving social prosperity.\n\n#### **Social activities and sponsorships**\n\nWe believe that every successful company has an obligation to give back to society.\n\nAs Austria's largest health insurance company, we focus on health and education, supporting physical activity, healthy nutrition and mental resilience for young and disadvantaged people. We also promote non-profit initiatives, especially in art and sport, through targeted sponsorships. UNIQA also places all kinds of emphasis on supporting general interest initiatives. Promoting the arts and sports are important focal points here in all of our markets. In the case of social activities and sponsorship, initiatives must be aligned with corporate values and ethical or sustainability-related standards in order to avoid reputational damage for UNIQA and negative impacts on society. Under the Code for Transparent Cooperation between NGOs and companies, we have been publishing our collaborative partnerships with NGOs and the associated sponsorships and donations on our website since 2020.\n\n#### UNIQA Austria's sponsorship projects in 2023\n\nKURIER Aid Austria educational facilities: supporting deprived children and young people from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds in order to help them enjoy independent learning under their own initiative.\n\nMobile Caritas hospice: the Day Hospice and Mobile Caritas Hospice offer companionship, care and welfare in familiar surroundings for people in the final days of their lives.\n\nMountain Rescue Service (Österr. Bergrettungsdienst): supporting the 13,000 volunteer rescuers who look after and assist people when they encounter difficulties in the mountains.\n\nOne particular highlight last year was supporting the collaboration between UNIQA Stiftung and the Special Olympics Austria (SOÖ) to organise the Inclusion Days. UNIQA Austria is represented at the Special Olympics National Winter Games 2024 in Austria from 14 to 19 March 2024, this time with more than 100 employees from all over Austria. They use their volunteer days for this event to actively contribute and experience inclusion first hand.\n\n| Topic                                   | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate<br>volunteering<br>activities | During the 2023 financial year, the UNIQA Group continued<br>to support social causes through donations, corporate<br>volunteering (UNIQA Sozialtag (volunteer day), and<br>collaboration and initiatives with UNIQA Privatstiftung. | In keeping with our strategy and implementing guidelines,<br>we will continue to put in place suitable measures and<br>initiatives and play our part in general social matters in<br>2024. |\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Customer focus and innovative services and products**\n\nAn insurance company must provide security: our customers expect a level of risk cover that is tailored to their individual circumstances, and we support them in preventing damage and loss with easy customer-friendly communication and rapid processing when there is a claim. As a companion who is there to support our customers, we always think and act from their perspective. Because clarity and transparency play a key role in customer satisfaction, they are given high priority in our internal sales guideline.\n\nThe growing demand for sustainable insurance solutions is strongly shaping our advisory services. Through targeted automation in the advisory process, the UNIQA Group creates a smooth connection between the digital and physical world in order to document the concerns of our customers transparently and efficiently while also making sufficient time for personal consultations. We invest specifically in sustainability training for our sales team, using a variety of training formats such as asynchronous e-learning modules and faceto-face events. We have also been able to obtain support for these measures from experts in academia and NGOs as well as from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action.\n\nWe aim to reduce our ecological footprint by expanding our customer portal myUNIQA. In 2023, around 565,000 registered customers used this innovative service. In addition, more than 21 per cent of our private customers already receive their insurance documents purely digitally by email. This allows us to make relevant savings in carbon emissions.\n\nWe also use customer complaints as an important feedback tool. We deal with requests, problems and complaints quickly using a solution-based approach in order to learn from them and improve our processes. To further simplify the handling of complaints, we are creating a common platform for the Customer Touchpoint & Case Management department and our Ombudsperson's Office, which will be finalised by the end of 2024. In the 2023 reporting year, 1,135 complaints were registered in Austria, a decrease of 11 per cent compared with the previous year (2022: 1,280).\n\n| Topic    | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                                         | Outlook for 2024                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Training | Wide range of training formats to integrate sustainability<br>into the advisory approach; testing and implementation of<br>training formats with the support of experts from academia<br>and NGOs. | LIMAK university course for managers in Austria to increase<br>awareness and understanding of sustainability (tailored to<br>UNIQA as a company) |\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Data protection**\n\nSince UNIQA processes a large volume of data as an insurer and trust is one of our company's key success factors, data protection is our top priority throughout the Group. In specific terms, it involves protecting personal data and the individuals these data relate to from misuse during data collection, processing and use. We minimise data protection risks and continuously improve by using structured processes and setting clear priorities. A comprehensive approach to data protection creates trust in UNIQA as a business partner and serves as a positive selling point. Not only are we required to fulfil a range of data protection requirements, but we also have to be able to provide our customers with information about how their data are used at all times.\n\nTo optimise the integration of the new data protection regulations into our day-to-day business operations, we are actively involved in the implementation of the Austrian industry standard for data protection (ÖBS) for the Austrian Insurance Association (VVO), which was approved by the Data Protection Authority in 2022. Our strategy is to establish data protection internally as an interdisciplinary issue. In addition to implementing interfaces and joint processes for information security and risk management, we have also harmonised our policies. We divide data protection risks into four categories: \"operational\", \"financial\", \"reputational\" and \"regulatory\". Implementing and enhancing our data protection management system allows us to deal with these risks in a structured manner and set targeted priorities. This cross-functional collaboration allows the key elements of risk management and information security to be managed more efficiently and considered when handling projects.\n\nWhen introducing new data processing procedures, we conduct consultations and, if necessary, data protection impact assessments that take technical, legal and process factors into account. Based on this analysis, we make decisions on how to implement new processing activities and focus on operational aspects of data protection, process improvements and the introduction of new data protection governance procedures by cross-functional teams. The continuous further development of the data protection management system remains a basic prerequisite in ensuring data protection compliance. There were 24 enquiries from customers regarding the exercising of data subject rights in 2023 in accordance with Article 15 GDPR (confirmation as to whether personal data are being processed and right to information about processing details) and three complaints from customers and third parties to the data protection authority.\n\n| Topic                                              | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                         | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Implementation<br>of data protection<br>governance | Participation in the development and implementation of<br>process management for group projects to ensure data<br>protection in UNIQA International group projects | Further development of the UNIQA Governance Framework<br>for Data Governance to guarantee data protection in<br>an interdisciplinary and cross-functional manner in<br>compliance with future regulations |\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Cybersecurity**\n\nAs one of the largest insurance companies in Europe, the UNIQA Group has already digitalised its business processes to a large extent. This high level of digitalisation requires comprehensive measures to minimise cyber risks and ensure cybersecurity. Effective cybersecurity makes it possible to organise digital business processes and drive innovation, but at the same time harbours the risk of cyberattacks that can potentially cause considerable financial and reputational damage.\n\nThe UNIQA Group's cybersecurity strategy is agile in responding to evolving threats. Every year, the security requirements are aligned with the threat map to test their effectiveness against attack methods. Statutory provisions, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act, are considered in order to meet regulatory requirements. Internal standards and processes are improved to ensure resilience to cyberattacks while at the same time guaranteeing the integrity and confidentiality of customer data.\n\nAction plans and projects to identify critical assets and strengthen security measures were expedited further in 2023. The business continuity method (BCM) for identifying critical assets was refined and implemented across the Group. Critical assets such as IT applications and other important features have been thoroughly investigated for potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and non-conformities. This allows for targeted security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of these assets.\n\n| Topic           | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk assessment | Group-wide implementation of the business continuity<br>method (BCM) for identifying critical assets and carrying<br>out risk assessments | Management of security issues: targeted minimisation of<br>the security risks identified by risk assessments in order<br>to eliminate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities identified<br>based on the risk |\n\n#### **Employee matters**\n\nOur 15,494 employees13) (2022: 15,296) are at the heart of our sustainability journey. Investing in their development, promoting diversity and introducing new working models allows us to improve our organisational capabilities and contribute towards a more sustainable and equitable future. The focus of this section is on our People strategy as well as the associated concepts and measures. Strong engagement in areas such as diversity, inclusion, education and training is essential to prevent brain drain and the loss of talent. The resulting financial and operational barriers have a negative impact not only on the UNIQA Group but also on the labour market.\n\nIn 2023, we created a strategic Group People function that is aligned with our Corporate Strategy 3.0 and our People strategy and addresses the current needs of employees as well as future challenges and opportunities. By introducing the new Group People operating model in all our core countries, we are strengthening international cooperation and developing a clear matrix organisation. Management dashboards with key performance indicators were introduced in all countries as part of strategic HR development. This enables us to monitor relevant data on employee structure and development in an efficient manner, respond flexibly to personnel changes and implement targeted measures for employee retention.\n\n<sup>13)</sup> The employee key figures include data from the fully consolidated insurance companies in the following countries: Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and Ukraine as well as PremiQaMed. Figures as of 31 December.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want to be one of the most attractive employers in the financial sector, true to our motto, \"Living better together\". This year, the first Group-wide Employee Experience survey was therefore conducted with the involvement of all local People teams. The results were made available to all line managers via online dashboards and formed the basis for developing action plans at Group and local level.\n\nAnnual personal targets are set for all employees to help them achieve the company's overarching goals. A feedback meeting between the employee and manager takes place at least once a year, followed by a meeting at the end of the year. There is currently no standardised Group-wide system, so each country applies its own process. We are planning to develop a Group-wide approach and corresponding reporting in 2024.\n\nWith respect to professional development, we attach great importance to our employees continuously learning and growing in order to provide them with access to the latest knowledge and skills. Our UNIQA academies use a mixture of experience-based learning (70 per cent), mentoring from managers and colleagues (20 per cent), and formal training and further education (10 per cent). On average, our employees invested 16.5 hours in training and education during the 2023 reporting year (2022: 14.8 hours). We have also been offering a new management development programme across the entire UNIQA Group since autumn 2022. This specifically addresses the requirements for our forward-looking UNIQA 3.0 programme and aims to transform our management into inspiring coach leaders.\n\nWe prioritize the work-life balance, personal development and health of our employees in our benefits strategy. Flexible working hours and options for working from home support a balanced lifestyle and allow employees to choose the model that suits them best. For this reason, no distinction is made between part-time and full-time employees when granting benefits. We invest in comprehensive training programmes and encourage professional development. We supplement the state's social systems and organise social events on a regular basis. This strategy reflects our commitment to sustainability and employee well-being and is continuously adapted to the needs of our workforce.\n\nAt both PremiQaMed and UNIQA Austria, risks to health and safety in the workplace are identified, assessed and addressed in accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Employee Protection Act (ASchG) and the measures recommended or specified by the responsible safety experts. Furthermore, any incidents that affect employee safety are investigated in accordance with the Employee Protection Act and appropriate steps are taken to prevent future incidents. In addition, safety officers take care of the well-being of employees.\n\n| Topic                    | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                                       | 2024 targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Attractive<br>employer   | The new People operating model introduced as of 1 July<br>2023 and rolled out in all countries to create a strategic<br>Group function in the area now renamed from HR to People | Development of a differentiated Employee Value<br>Proposition (EVP) with local and functional variants that<br>will position the UNIQA Group as a top employer and<br>help us to attract the right people for the right roles;<br>introduction of a modern, AI-supported and dynamic<br>Group-wide careers website |\n| Employee<br>satisfaction | First Group-wide employee experience survey with a<br>response rate of 75 per cent                                                                                               | Expansion of employee surveys at regular intervals<br>(quarterly) and implementation of action plans in the<br>countries                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Reporting                | Management dashboards with strategic People Analytics<br>rolled out in all countries                                                                                             | Overview of local benefits in each country and developing<br>minimum standards for the UNIQA Group                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Diversity and inclusion**\n\nA community the size of ours at the UNIQA Group lives and breathes through diversity. We believe diversity can only be fully effective within an inclusive environment. If inclusion – consisting of policies, practices, ways of behaving and attitudes – is actively embraced, a diverse organisation will be able to harness its full potential.\n\nOur \"Diversity & Inclusion\" (D&I) strategy published in 2022 is the basis for all our activities and is part of our UNIQA 3.0 programme for the future. It is clearly oriented towards our values, the Guiding Principles. In addition to a selection of initiatives, it also includes specific measurable targets focused on two areas, namely equal pay and women in management positions.\n\nEqual pay for work of equal value: A standardised annual process has been established in Austria for evaluating, analysing and developing measures concerning the pay gap. With the help of this process, we have achieved a sustained reduction in the adjusted pay gap at the Austrian location (office staff) from 1.4 per cent in 2021 to 0.6 per cent in 2022 and 202314). In our core markets of Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania, an equal pay analysis was carried out for the first time in 2023, the results of which are awaiting validation.\n\nMore women in management positions15): With the aim of increasing the proportion of women in management positions in Austria, the Women's Career Index was also evaluated in the 2023 financial year. Targeted and successfully implemented measures have boosted our score from 63 to 77 index points since the first evaluation in 2020/2021. Although this is still well below the external benchmark of 81 for financial services companies, it exceeded our 2023 internal target of 70 points. The measures taken include clear communication, the definition of measurable targets, guidelines for filling management positions and promotions, participation in relevant networks, flexible working models, an established mentoring programme and the implementation of models for job sharing and shared/part-time management. Despite an increase in the proportion of women in leading positions in Austria, the target of a 5 percentage point increase remained unachieved at just 2.3 percentage points, which has prompted us to continue focusing on this issue. No specific targets have been set for other locations.\n\n| Women in management positions*                                  | 2022  | 2023  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Women in the entire workforce**                                 | 57.8% | 57.9% |\n| Percentage of women among managers***                           | 43.0% | 43.6% |\n| Percentage of women on the Management Boards of local companies | 27.1% | 26.3% |\n| Percentage of women on the Management Board                     | 0.0%  | 11.1% |\n| Percentage of women on the Supervisory Board                    | 33.3% | 33.3% |\n\n\\* Key figures as of the reporting date 31 December.\n\n\\*\\* Total workforce is defined as all persons with a valid employment relationship (excluding holiday interns and temporary staff).\n\n\\*\\*\\* A manager is defined as a person who manages at least one employee.

The UNIQA Inclusion Index is used for this16). Our goal was to increase the baseline score of 3.6 (on a 5-point scale) measured in Austria in 2021 to at least 3.8 by 2023. In Austria, the score rose to 3.9 in 2023.\n\nAge diversity: Overall, the average age of our employees decreased slightly in 2023 compared to the previous year. Changes at management level were minimal, but the average age on the Management Boards in local companies dropped significantly.\n\n|                                            | Age diversity amongst employees |       | Age diversity in management* |       | Age diversity of Management Board<br>members in local companies |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------|------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| as of the<br>reporting date<br>31 December | 2022                            | 2023  | 2022                         | 2023  | 2022                                                            | 2023  |\n| < 30 years old                             | 14.9%                           | 15.4% | 2.2%                         | 1.4%  | 0.0%                                                            | 0.0%  |\n| 30 – 50 years old                          | 57.8%                           | 58.5% | 67.9%                        | 68.9% | 66.1%                                                           | 70.2% |\n| > 50 years old                             | 27.2%                           | 26.1% | 29.9%                        | 29.7% | 33.9%                                                           | 29.8% |\n\n\\* A manager is defined as a person who manages at least one employee.

Our human rights policy embodies our strong commitment to key issues of human rights and ensures that they can be protected and upheld. A violation of human rights through our business activities or through projects or customers insured by us would have a serious impact on the individuals in question and would result in reputational damage and legal consequences for the UNIQA Group.\n\nOur accession to the UN Global Compact in 2020 means we are committed to observing the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights throughout the UNIQA Group. The ten principles contained within this have been incorporated into our Group-wide UNIQA Code of Conduct.\n\nAs an insurer, we strive to protect and promote human rights among our employees, among our suppliers, in our investments (including principal adverse impacts) and in the way we deal with our customers. We implemented dedicated policies and standards in each of the abovementioned areas in order to minimise human rights risks and make the most of opportunities. Examples of this are: UNIQA Guidelines for Responsible Investments, UNIQA Corporate Business Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Standard and the corresponding assessment of ESG risks und UNIQA Diversity & Inclusion Policy.\n\n| Topic                          | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                                       | 2024 targets                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Integration of<br>human rights | Embedding the UNIQA Code of Conduct (human rights,<br>labour standards, environmental protection, anti-<br>corruption) in the registration process for suppliers | Further integration of human rights policies into all relevant<br>business lines and core processes |\n\n#### **Combatting corruption and bribery**\n\nAt UNIQA we regard compliance with all relevant statutory regulations, internal Group policies and ethical principles to be an essential part of responsible business practice. A key factor underlying this principle is our awareness that the insurance industry is fundamentally based on trust. Compliance risks such as corruption and bribery have potential economic and legal consequences. The mere suspicion of corruption and bribery can lead to reputational damage and a loss of trust on the part of business partners and customers. Therefore, responsible behaviour is an important basis for our actions.\n\nIn addition to top-quality products and services, UNIQA also strives for the highest standards for employee conduct. That is why we set internal standards for ethical behaviour in our Code of Conduct that go beyond those of the applicable laws, and which are equally binding in all areas of the company. The Code of Conduct is communicated to all employees by the local compliance functions. Its content is also part of the mandatory annual compliance training. The Group Compliance Policy and the Group Compliance Standard describe how the compliance function is organised within the UNIQA Group and contain regulations on key compliance topics, such as preventing corruption, dealing with indications of non-compliance or tasks in connection with the topic of sustainability. The Group compliance team is responsible for creating all these regulations and implementing the compliance programme throughout the entire Group. This central unit is supported by a separate local compliance function within every insurance company of the UNIQA Group.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 2023 reporting year, we continued to pursue our goal of zero violations with respect to legal regulations. Despite our legal initiatives and compliance measures, there were four cases of non-compliance with laws and regulations in the reporting year that resulted in monetary penalties totalling €276,700 (2022: €19,572). In the 2023 reporting year, €445,778 in fines were also paid for two violations of laws and regulations from previous years (of which €395,778 in Hungary and €50,000 in Serbia). In the course of the reporting year, a total of nine proceedings were brought due to significant violations of applicable laws and regulations, against which appeals were lodged during the reporting period. Fines were imposed in six of these cases and non-monetary sanctions were imposed in three cases.\n\nIn contrast, as in the previous year, no confirmed breaches of anti-corruption or money laundering legislation were recorded in the 2023 reporting year. In 2022, there were proceedings due to anti-competitive behaviour, cartel and monopoly practices. In the course of settlement talks, the UNIQA Group was obliged to pay €422,330; this fine was the lowest of all the insurance companies investigated by the competition authority. There were no further legal proceedings due to anti-competitive behaviour, cartels or monopolies in 2023.\n\nIn the reporting year as in the previous year, no violations of regulations resulting in fines or sanctions or of voluntary codes of conduct were identified in connection with product and service information and labelling. In contrast to the previous year, in which one incident occurred that resulted in a warning, a total of eight incidents were registered in the reporting year, each of which resulted in a warning.\n\nIn the reporting year, the anti-corruption regulations were communicated to all members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board of the UNIQA Group, as well as to employees of UNIQA Austria. The e-learning training course on the Code of Conduct was successfully completed by 66.6 per cent of the nine members of the UNIQA Group Management Board and 88.3 per cent of UNIQA Austria employees overall. For members of the UNIQA Group Supervisory Board, the training focus in 2023 was on money laundering prevention and issuer compliance. In 2024, members of the UNIQA Group Supervisory Board will focus on anti-corruption training. In the international insurance companies18), 95.3 per cent of members of the management bodies and 76.6 per cent of employees took part in anti-corruption training.\n\nIn 2023, the EU Whistleblower Directive was transposed into several national laws. Since 2018, the UNIQA Group has had a portal where information on non-compliance in the UNIQA Group's insurance companies can be submitted. The portal was updated in 2023 and expanded to include non-insurance companies. Information can be submitted by UNIQA employees, but also by external persons, which goes beyond the legal obligation. This is of course also anonymous.\n\n| Topic   | Target achievement in 2023                                                                                                                               | 2024 targets                                                                                  |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reports | Implementation of the EU Whistleblower Directive in those<br>insurance and non-insurance companies that are covered<br>by the relevant local regulations | Reports and documentation of conflicts of interest are<br>reviewed and, if necessary, amended |\n\n<sup>18)</sup> The key figures include data from the following countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and Ukraine.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Disclosures according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation**\n\n#### **Premiums in non-life insurance and taxonomyeligible activities**\n\n#### Discretionary judgements and interpretation requirements\n\nIn view of the interpretations by the European Commission only at the end of December 2023 and the first application of the new provisions on taxonomy alignment, current market practice shows that not all details are sufficiently specified and that a common understanding and uniform application in the market need to be developed in order to achieve consistency and comparability.\n\n#### Reporting principles\n\nUnder the Taxonomy Regulation, insurance companies are required to disclose an indicator in relation to their non-life insurance business. European legislators have therefore defined certain business lines of non-life insurance that are considered environmentally sustainable in relation to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation.\n\nIn non-life insurance, we carried out detailed research, according to the regulations from Annex X to the Delegated Regulation (2021/2178), on approximately 40 non-life insurance lines with respect to all premium elements, based on the premiums written, separated by direct and indirect business and before and after any reinsurance. Underwriting specialists analysed the content of insured benefits and scope of cover to establish whether they were adapted to the impacts of climate change. As a result of different cover being issued in places, the private customer business and industrial/commercial business were analysed separately and classified in relation to the insurance activity's taxonomy eligibility and conformity. The proportion of premiums in the analysed non-life insurance lines were then combined into the categories as defined in the Delegated Regulation. Similarly, the proportion of taxonomy-eligible economic activities in relation to the total non-life insurance premiums written (before reinsurance) was then determined and, for the first time, the premium was broken down into premium proportions for climate change adaptation in accordance with the draft Commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (third Commission Notice). This was based on long-term loss histories resulting from recognised climate-related risks. Technical screening criteria (TSC), compliance with minimum social safeguards (MSS) and do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria laid down in the Delegated Regulation were also checked.\n\n#### Limited data availability or documentation\n\nThe abovementioned evidence could not be documented for the private customer business, standardised SME business and active reinsurance business and therefore could not be included in the Taxonomy-aligned premium. Although both the technical screening criteria and the do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria were largely met in the context of the major customer business in a tailor-made contract for partial premiums on insurance cover for natural disasters that are also linked to climate change, the proportioning approach to taxonomy-aligned premiums was also abandoned in this customer segment due to the still insufficient assurance of all the minimum social safeguards being met.\n\nIn line with the current interpretation by the European Commission, only the part which can be applied to the cover of climate-related risks was used for the calculation of the previous year's comparative figure from the premiums. The calculation with the (split) premiums for this purpose now yields 8.51 per cent taxonomy eligibility for 2022 instead of 48.1 per cent taxonomy eligibility (see 2022 report), as shown in the previous year's report without the premium split.\n\nThe details can be found in the table below (template according to Annex X of the Delegated Regulation).\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                                                                              | Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation |                                      |                                      |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--|\n| Economic activities                                                                                                                                          | Absolute premiums,<br>2023<br>€                       | Proportion of premiums,<br>2023<br>% | Proportion of premiums,<br>2022<br>% |  |\n| A.1.

Our Taxonomy classification is conducted with the support of the external data provider ISS STOXX. Since the 2022 financial year was the first time that non-financial undertakings were included in taxonomy alignment reporting, the taxonomy alignment KPIs for the UNIQA Group's revenue and operating expenses are based exclusively on data from non-financial undertakings.\n\nThe published assessment criteria for the first two climate targets set under the EU Taxonomy Regulation were included.\n\nThe draft Commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (third Commission Notice) dated 21 December 2023 was also critically reviewed.\n\nWe took note of FAQ 2 but kept to the IFRS consolidation basis in order to continue to ensure comparability with the consolidated financial statements. This legal view seems acceptable to us, as nothing to the contrary is stated in the Taxonomy Regulation itself.\n\n#### **Reporting principles**\n\nAt the time of reporting, there are still different interpretations as to how to apply the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the associated Delegated Regulations. Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures therefore take into account what we currently know.\n\nThe calculation of the company-related KPIs in accordance with Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation refers to the investments of UNIQA Insurance Group AG (UIG) published in the UIG consolidated Annual Financial Report 2023. For the unconsolidated investment funds due to lack of control, FAQ 4 was noted and the IDW interpretation (IDW QA from 1 December 2023) was subsequently applied, which states that the fund wrap can be used. All further regulatory developments on this will be closely monitored.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Do no significant harm (DNSH)       |                                      |                         |                  |                                       |                   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Climate change<br>mitigation<br>Y/N | Water and marine<br>resources<br>Y/N | Circular economy<br>Y/N | Pollution<br>Y/N | Biodiversity<br>and ecosystems<br>Y/N | Minimum safeg<br> |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n| Y                                   | Y                                    | Y                       | Y                | Y                                     |                   |\n\n#### **Limited data availability or documentation**\n\nA.2 Non-life insurance and reinsurance underwriting Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable\n\nB.

This section describes that the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard contain wordings and definitions that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties. Management describes how they have made the necessary interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard. Due to the inherent risk that undefined legal terms can be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainty. Our audit opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## **Responsibility of Management and the Supervisory Board**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the (consolidated) non-financial report in accordance with the requirements of section 267a UGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard.\n\nManagement's responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the (consolidated) non-financial reporting (in particular the selection of key issues) as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. This responsibility also includes the interpretation of the wordings and definitions contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard, and management is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a (consolidated) non-financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for examining the (consolidated) non-financial report.\n\n#### **Auditor's Responsibility**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on our procedures performed and evidence obtained as to whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the (consolidated) non-financial report as at 31 December 2023 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with section 267a UGB and Article 8 of the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (\"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted in this regard.\n\nWe performed our engagement in accordance with the professional standards applicable in Austria with regard to KFS/PG 13 \"Other assurance engagements\" as well as the International Standards on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) \"Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information\". These standards require that we comply with our ethical requirements, including rules on independence, and that we plan and perform our procedures by considering the principle of materiality to be able to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the assurance obtained.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nThe selection of the procedures lies in the sole discretion of the auditor and comprised, in particular, the following:\n\n- Interviewing the relevant employees responsible for the analysis of materiality considering the concerns of external stakeholders to update the understanding of the procedure for identifying material sustainability matters\n- Assessment of risks regarding the essential non-financial matters / disclosures\n- Updating the overview of the policies pursued by the Company, including due diligence processes implemented with regard to environmental, social and labour matters, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and bribery\n- Updating the understanding of reporting processes by interviewing the relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations\n- Evaluating the reported disclosures by performing analytical procedures regarding non-financial performance indicators, interviewing relevant employees and inspecting selected documentations\n- Assessment of the process for identifying investments qualifying as Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned and activities qualifying as Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned in the underwriting business and the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial reporting by interviewing the relevant employees and inspecting selected internal documentation to assess whether the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation have been adequately addressed\n- Evaluating the presentation and completeness of the disclosures and non-financial information pursuant to section 267a UGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe following was not part of our engagement:\n\n- Examining the prior-year figures, forward-looking information or data from external surveys\n- Examining the correct transfer of data and references from the (consolidated) financial statements to the non-financial reporting; and\n- Examining the information and disclosures on the website or further references on the internet\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\nNeither an audit nor a review of financial statements is objective of our engagement. Furthermore, neither the disclosure and solution of fraud, such as e.g., embezzlement or other kinds of fraudulent acts and wrongful doings, nor the assessment of the effectiveness and profitability of the management are objectives of our engagement.\n\n## **Restriction of Use**\n\nBecause our report is prepared solely for and on behalf of the client, it does not constitute a basis for any reliance on its contents by other third parties. Therefore, no claims of other third parties can be derived from it. We consent to the publication of our report together with the (consolidated) non-financial report. However, the publication may only take place in the complete version certified by us.\n\n## **General Conditions of Contract**\n\nOur report is issued based on the engagement agreed upon with you and is governed by the General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions (AAB 2018) enclosed to this report, which also apply towards third parties.\n\nVienna 15 March 2024\n\nPwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH\n\nWerner Stockreiter Austrian Certified Public Accountant\n\nsigned\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Group Management Report**\n\n#### **Economic environment**\n\nDespite the largest interest rate hikes in 18 months since 1980, neither the US Federal Reserve (Fed) nor the European Central Bank (ECB) managed to get inflation entirely under control in 2023. In the USA, interest rates were raised to 5.5 per cent, the highest level since 2001. In Europe, the historic high since the introduction of the euro was reached in 2023 at 4.5 per cent.\n\nNevertheless, inflation has already fallen significantly as a result: to around 3.1 per cent in the USA and even below 3 per cent in the eurozone. In Austria, however, inflation remained high for the time being (annual average 2023: over 7 per cent, price increase December 2022/December 2023: 5.6 per cent). Unsurprisingly, the sharp interest rate hikes to combat inflation over the course of the year had an impact on the economy. This is particularly evident in the construction and real estate industry, where interest rates directly impact prices and order volumes. However, the industrial sector is also suffering. The German IFO business climate index stands at a subdued 84.3 points, and the gloom is also clearly noticeable in Austria, where the WIFO economic index turned from a highly positive 10.9 points in April 2023 to a clear minus towards the end of the year, reaching minus 7.9 points in October 2023. Germany and Austria will therefore end 2023 in a \"mild\" recession.\n\nThe labour market remained extremely robust both in the USA and throughout Europe as the weakening economy hardly affected the high demand for labour for the time being. In the eurozone, the unemployment rate even fell from 6.7 per cent to 6.4 per cent over the course of 2023, while in Austria it remained stable at 4.7 per cent (both according to ILO calculations).\n\nA similar trend to the western EU countries also characterised the CEE countries: Hungary's economic output shrank by 0.3 per cent in 2023, while Poland and Czechia just managed to record slight growth of 0.6 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. However, the inflation trend in the region proved to be a greater burden than the weak economic trend. In Hungary, inflation was still above 25 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, 20 per cent in Poland and 18 per cent in Czechia. After easing over the course of the year, average price increases for the year were still between 10.9 per cent (Czechia) and 17.7 per cent (Hungary).\n\nThe stable economic trend in the first half of 2023 while inflation remained high caused yields on the bond markets to rise for a long time, albeit with high volatility. In the course of this development, the yield on the ten-year German government bond, for example, climbed above the 3 per cent mark. Only the significant deterioration in the economic outlook and the general expectation of an interest rate cut in 2024 led to a significant rise in bond prices in the last quarter of 2023 and thus to a decline in yields: ten-year interest rates in Germany fell to below 2 per cent and those in Austria to below 2.5 per cent.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **UNIQA Group**\n\nWith a premium volume written (including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance) of €7,185.6 million, the UNIQA Group is among the leading insurance groups in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n#### **UNIQA in Europe**\n\nUNIQA offers its products and services via all distribution channels (hired sales force, general agencies, brokers, banks and direct sales) and covers virtually the entire range of insurance lines. UNIQA is the second-largest insurance group in Austria, with a presence in 14 countries of the CEE growth region: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine. In addition, insurance companies in Switzerland and Liechtenstein are also part of the UNIQA Group.\n\nThe listed holding company UNIQA Insurance Group AG manages the Group and also operates the indirect insurance business concluded as active reinsurance with another insurance company. Moreover, UNIQA Insurance Group AG carries out numerous service functions for UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG and its international Group companies, in order to take best advantage of synergy effects and to implement the Group's long-term corporate strategy consistently.\n\n#### **Property and casualty insurance**\n\nThe property and casualty insurance line includes property insurance for private individuals and companies, as well as private casualty insurance. The UNIQA Group received premiums written in property and casualty insurance in the amount of €4,214.3 million in 2023 (2022: €3,683.0 million) – which is 58.7 per cent (2022: 56.2 per cent) of total premium volume. The largest share by far in the volume of property and casualty insurance comes from private consumer business. Most property and casualty insurance policies are taken out for a limited term of up to three years. A broad spread across the different risks of a great many customers and the relatively short terms of these contracts lead to only moderate capital requirements and also make this business segment attractive as a result.\n\n#### **Health insurance**\n\nHealth insurance in Austria includes voluntary health insurance for private customers, commercial preventive healthcare and opt-out offers for certain independent professions such as lawyers, architects and chemists. Although health insurance is still at the early stages in CEE, increased levels of prosperity in the region make the long-term growth potential even greater. Group-wide, in 2023, premiums written totalled €1,388.1 million, (2022: €1,275.9 million) – which is 19.3 per cent (2022: 19.5 per cent) of total premium volume. UNIQA is the undisputed market leader in this strategically important business line in Austria, with around 44 per cent of market share. At around 91 per cent of premiums, the overwhelming majority comes from Austria, with the remaining 9 per cent from international business.\n\n#### **Life insurance**\n\nLife insurance covers economic risks that stem from the uncertainty as to how long a customer will live. It includes savings products such as classic and unit-linked life insurance. There are also biometric products which hedge against risks such as occupational disability, long-term care needs or death. The life insurance business model is oriented towards the long term: policy terms are around 25 years on average. In life insurance, UNIQA reached a premium volume (including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance) of €1,583.2 million Group-wide in 2023 (2022: €1,589.8 million) – which is 22.0 per cent (2022: 24.3 per cent) of total premium volume.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Companies included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements**\n\nIn addition to the annual financial statements of UNIQA Insurance Group AG, the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries in Austria and abroad as well as those of the investment funds under the Group's control. The basis of consolidation – including UNIQA Insurance Group AG – comprised 32 Austrian (2022: 31) and 61 international (2022: 59) subsidiaries as well as 4 Austrian (2022: 4) and 9 international (2022: 9) controlled pension and investment funds. The associates are 4 Austrian companies (2022: 4) that were included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.\n\nDetails on the consolidated companies and associates are contained in the corresponding overviews in the consolidated financial statements. The accounting and measurement methods are also described in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Risk reporting**\n\nUNIQA's comprehensive risk report is included in the notes to the 2023 consolidated financial statements..\n\n#### **Corporate Governance Report**\n\nSince 2004, UNIQA has pledged to comply with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. UNIQA publishes its consolidated Corporate Governance Report at www.uniqagroup.com in the Investor Relations section.\n\n## **Consolidated non-financial statement, consolidated non-financial report**\n\nIn accordance with Section 267a(6) of the Austrian Commercial Code, UNIQA Insurance Group AG prepares its consolidated non-financial statement as a separate summarised non-financial report. The separate condensed non-financial report is prepared and signed by all legal representatives. It is submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and published together with the Group Management Report pursuant to Section 280 of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\n#### **Discontinued operations**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of IFRS 5, all values attributable to the Russian business were recognised in the consolidated income statement (including the comparative period) in the profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (after tax).\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Group business development**\n\n- **•** Premiums written (including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance) rose by 9.7 per cent to €7,185.6 million\n- **•** Technical result at €562.2 million\n- **•** Combined ratio (gross) improved from 91.7 per cent to 89.4 per cent\n- **•** Financial result increased to €150.2 million\n- **•** Earnings before taxes in 2023 increased by 56.6 per cent to €426.4 million\n- **•** Proposed dividend of €0.57 per share for 2023\n\n| UNIQA Group key figures<br>In € million                                                                                                        | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Premiums written, including savings portions from<br>unit-linked and index-linked life insurance                                               | 7,185.6 | 6,548.7 |\n| Cost ratio                                                                                                                                     | 31.0%   | 30.9%   |\n| Combined ratio (gross before reinsurance)                                                                                                      | 89.4%   | 91.7%   |\n| Earnings before taxes                                                                                                                          | 426.4   | 272.3   |\n| Consolidated profit/(loss) (proportion of the profit/(loss)<br>for the period attributable to the shareholders of<br>UNIQA Insurance Group AG) | 302.7   | 256.0   |\n\n### **Changes in premiums**\n\nUNIQA's total volume of premiums written increased in 2023. Taking into account the savings portions from unitlinked and index-linked life insurance, the volume climbed 9.7 per cent to €7,185.6 million (2022: €6,548.7 million). The main driver for this was the solid growth in both property and casualty insurance and in health insurance.\n\n## **Premiums written, including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance**\n\nIn € million\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/13 description: This image is a bar chart comparing values from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the value is 5,373. In 2020, the value is 5,565. In 2021, the value is 6,358. In 2022, the value is 6,549. In 2023, the value is 7,186.\n\nPremiums written in property and casualty insurance grew by 14.4 per cent to €4,214.3 million in 2023 (2022: €3,683.0 million) due to index adjustments and a good sales performance. In health insurance, premiums written rose by 8.8 per cent to €1,388.1 million in the reporting period due to premium adjustments and good new business development (2022: €1,275.9 million). In life insurance, premiums written, including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance, decreased slightly by 0.4 per cent to €1,583.2 million (2022: €1,589.8 million).\n\nPremiums written, including savings portions from unitlinked and index-linked life insurance, at UNIQA Austria increased by 5.0 per cent to €4,290.0 million in 2023 (2022: €4,086.4 million). The UNIQA International segment saw an increase of 13.8 per cent to €2,787.9 million (2022: €2,450.0 million).\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Change in insurance revenue**\n\nThe insurance revenue of the UNIQA Group rose in 2023 by 12.1 per cent to €5,994.1 million (2022: €5,346.9 million). This development was primarily driven by very strong premium growth in property and casualty insurance and an interest rate-induced higher release of the contractual service margin (CSM release) in health insurance and life insurance.\n\nThe release of the contractual service margin amounted to a total of €318.9 million (2022: €314.5 million).\n\nInsurance revenue in property and casualty insurance grew by 12.9 per cent to €4,006.3 million in 2023 (2022: €3,547.8 million).\n\nIn health insurance, insurance revenue in the reporting period rose by 8.3 per cent to €1,234.7 million (2022: €1,139.7 million). The release of the contractual service margin increased by 10.0 per cent to €94.7 million (2022: €86.1 million).\n\nInsurance revenue in life insurance increased by 14.2 per cent to €753.1 million in 2023 (2022: €659.3 million). In contrast, the release of the contractual service margin decreased slightly by 1.9 per cent to €192.2 million (2022: €196.0 million).\n\n#### **Change in insurance service expenses**\n\nThe insurance service expenses of the UNIQA Group rose in 2023 by 11.5 per cent to €5,291.0 million (2022: €4,744.5 million). The main drivers for this were very high burdens from natural catastrophes and major claims – primarily from the Austrian portfolio.\n\nThe overall cost ratio – the ratio of direct and indirect costs to insurance revenue – nevertheless increased only slightly to 31.0 per cent (2022: 30.9 per cent).\n\nInsurance service expenses in property and casualty insurance increased by 10.0 per cent to €3,580.8 million (2022: €3,254.3 million). The cost ratio improved to 31.9 per cent (2022: 32.5 per cent). The combined ratio (gross before reinsurance) fell to 89.4 per cent (2022: 91.7 per cent) despite the significant impact from natural catastrophes and major claims due to the improved cost ratio and excellent technical performance in the international segment.\n\n#### **Combined ratio (gross before reinsurance)** In per cent\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/12 description: This bar chart compares values for 2022 and 2023.

The cost ratio in this segment increased to 18.2 per cent (2022: 17.3 per cent).\n\nIn life insurance, insurance service expenses rose by 32.8 per cent to €600.0 million (2022: €451.7 million). The cost ratio in life insurance increased to 46.9 per cent (2022: 46.0 per cent).\n\n#### **Technical result from reinsurance**\n\nThe technical result from reinsurance in 2023 amounted to €–140.9 million (2022: €–38.4 million). The reason for this increase is the high burden from both natural catastrophes – especially the storms in the summer months – and major claims.\n\n## **Technical result**\n\nIn 2023, the technical result of the UNIQA Group (see Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements) nevertheless remained at nearly the level of the previous year at €562.2 million (2022: €564.0 million).\n\n## **Financial result**\n\nThe UNIQA Group's investment portfolio (including investment property, financial assets accounted for using the equity method and other investments) rose by €1,055.9 million to €20,431.9 million as at 31 December 2023 compared with the last reporting date (31 December 2022: €19,376.0 million).\n\nNet investment income increased in 2023 to €588.8 million due to the excellent current income (2022: €179.8 million). The financial result increased to €150.2 million as a result (2022: €–49.9 million). Due to the recognition of the 15.7 per cent equity-accounted holding in the construction firm STRABAG SE, there was a positive contribution in the amount of €76.0 million in 2023 (2022: €99.6 million).\n\nNet investment income from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance amounted to €306.0 million in 2023 (2022: €–492.5 million).\n\nA detailed description of the financial result can be found in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## **Non-technical result**\n\nThe non-technical result amounted to €–206.4 million in 2023 (2022: €–161.7 million). Other income rose by 22.2 per cent to €436.1 million (2022: €356.7 million), while other expenses increased by 23.9 per cent to €642.5 million (2022: €518.5 million).\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Earnings before taxes**\n\nOperating profit grew by 43.6 per cent to €506.1 million due to the increased financial result (2022: €352.4 million). The UNIQA Group's earnings before taxes increased accordingly by 56.6 per cent to €426.4 million (2022: €272.3 million).\n\n#### **Earnings before taxes**\n\nIn € million\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/5 description: This bar chart compares values for 2022 and 2023. The value for 2022 is 272, and the value for 2023 is 426.\n\nIn property and casualty insurance, earnings before taxes increased to €211.5 million (2022: €9.5 million), while in health insurance they declined by 20.9 per cent to €44.1 million (2022: €55.8 million). Lastly, in life insurance, earnings before taxes fell by 17.5 per cent to €170.8 million (2022: €207.0 million).\n\nIncome tax expense increased in 2023 to €103.2 million (2022: €16.9 million). This increase is due to the decision not to recognise loss carryforwards, which were higher in the financial year, as deferred tax assets. In consequence, the tax burden increased to 24.2 per cent in 2023 (2022: 6.2 per cent).\n\nThe profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations amounted to €323.1 million (2022: €255.4 million). Due to the planned sale of the Russian business, the company incurred a loss from discontinued operations (after tax) in the amount of € $-19.3$  million in 2023 (2022: €0.3 million). As a result, the profit/(loss) for the reporting period was €303.8 million (2022: €255.7 million).\n\nConsolidated profit/(loss) (proportion of the profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the shareholders of UNIQA Insurance Group AG) increased by 18.3 per cent to €302.7 million (2022: €256.0 million). The earnings per share rose to €0.99 (2022: €0.83). The earnings per share from continuing operations was €1.05 in 2023 (2022: €0.83).\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/10 description: The image is a bar graph comparing values for 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the value is 0.83, and in 2023, the value is 0.99. The y-axis ranges from 0.2 to 1.2.\n\n## **Earnings per share**\n\nIn €\n\nThe return on equity (profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations in relation to the average equity excluding non-controlling interests) increased in the reporting year to 14.1 per cent (2022: 11.6 per cent). This calculation does not take into account the effect of the planned sale of the Russian company (profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (after tax)).\n\nOn this basis, the Management Board will propose a dividend of €0.57 per share to the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting (2022: €0.55 per share).\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Dividend per share**\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/2 description: The image is a bar chart showing values from 2019 to 2023. The y axis is labeled \"In €\". In 2019 the value is 0.18, in 2020 the value is 0.18, in 2021 the value is 0.55, in 2022 the value is 0.55, and in 2023 the value is 0.57.\n\n#### **Own funds and total assets**\n\nTotal equity attributable to the shareholders of UNIQA Insurance Group AG increased by €826.9 million to €2,710.2 million in the past financial year (31 December 2022: €1,883.3 million). This was due to the increased measurement of financial instruments available for sale caused by the fall in the general interest rate level at the end of 2023. Non-controlling interests came to €19.9 million (31 December 2022: €17.7 million). Total assets amounted to €28,151.0 million at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €26,641.1 million).\n\n## **Change in contractual service margin**\n\nThe contractual service margin (CSM) declined to €5,266.3 million as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €5,411.0 million). The main reasons for this development were the ongoing release of the contractual service margin in line with the development of the insurance portfolio and the reclassification of the Russian life insurance business as a discontinued operation. In property and casualty insurance, the CSM increased slightly to €61.9 million (31 December 2022: €60.5 million) and in health insurance to €3,366.2 million (31 December 2022: €3,328.3 million). In life insurance, on the other hand, it fell to €1,838.2 million (31 December 2022: €2,022.2 million).\n\n## **Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows**\n\nUNIQA's net cash flow from operating activities amounted to €325.3 million in 2023 (2022: €–532.0 million). Cash flow from investment activities amounted to €41.0 million (2022: €798.3 million). Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to €–333.7 million (2022: €–188.7 million). Overall, cash and cash equivalents increased by €31.9 million to €699.5 million in the 2023 financial year (2022: €667.6 million).\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Employees**\n\nIn 2023, the average number of employees (full-time equivalents, or FTEs) at UNIQA rose slightly to 14,629 FTEs (2022: 14,515). This includes 3,798 FTEs (2022: 3,813) who were employed as field sales employees. The number of employees in administration was 10,831 FTEs (2022: 10,702).\n\nIn 2023, the Group had an average of 4,963 FTEs (2022: 4,787) in the Central Europe (CE) region – Poland, Slovakia, Czechia and Hungary – as well as 2,197 FTEs (2022: 2,263) in the Southeastern Europe (SEE) region – Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia – and 1,447 FTEs (2022: 1,554) in the Eastern Europe (EE) region – Romania and Ukraine. The average number of FTEs in the other markets in 2023 was 114 (2022: 150). A total of 5,908 FTEs were employed in Austria (2022: 5,761). Including the employees of the general agencies working exclusively for UNIQA, the total number of people working for the Group amounts to 21,089 (2022: 20,994).\n\nIn 2023, 50 per cent of the staff working in administrative positions at UNIQA in Austria were women (2022: 54 per cent). In sales, the ratio was 76 per cent men to 24 per cent women (2022: 78 per cent men to 22 per cent women). 16.5 per cent (2022: 16.6 per cent) of employees were working part-time. The average age in the past year was 43 years (2022: 42 years).\n\nIn Austria, almost all employees have a share in the company's success through some form of variable participation programme. There is a bonus system in place for managers and selected key employees on the one hand and a profit-sharing scheme for eligible employees on the other. In 2023, around 14 per cent of employees participated in the bonus programme for managers and selected key employees, a variable remuneration system that is linked to both the success of the company and personal performance (2022: around 12 per cent). Around 77 per cent of employees will participate in the profit-sharing scheme for 2023 (2022: around 73 per cent). The amount of the profit-sharing budget depends on the achievement of a profit target, and distributions will only take place after the company's success has been determined in the following year.\n\nIn addition, UNIQA offers young people in training the opportunity to get to know foreign cultures and make international contacts. Currently, 101 apprentices are being trained.\n\n| Life insurance<br>In € million            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Premiums written                          | 1,583.2 | 1,589.8 |\n| Insurance revenue                         | 753.1   | 659.3   |\n| Release of the contractual service margin | 192.2   | 196.0   |\n| Insurance service expenses                | – 600.0 | – 451.7 |\n| Technical result from reinsurance         | – 0.3   | – 1.4   |\n| Technical result                          | 152.8   | 206.3   |\n| Financial result                          | 67.9    | 3.4     |\n| Net investment income                     | 303.7   | 185.0   |\n| Non-technical result                      | – 29.2  | 14.9    |\n| Cost ratio                                | 46.9%   | 46.0%   |\n| Earnings before taxes                     | 170.8   | 207.0   |\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Operating segments**\n\n#### **UNIQA Austria**\n\n- **•** Premiums written (including savings portions from unit-linked and index-linked life insurance) rose by 5.0 per cent to €4,290.0 million\n- **•** Technical result stable at €289.4 million\n- **•** Combined ratio (gross) improved from 94.5 per cent to 92.3 per cent\n- **•** Financial result increased to €141.5 million\n- **•** Cost ratio reduced to 24.3 per cent through consistent cost programme\n- **•** Earnings before taxes at €298.5 million\n\n| UNIQA Austria key figures<br>In € million                                                        | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Premiums written, including savings portions from unit-linked<br>and index-linked life insurance | 4,290.0 | 4,086.4 |\n| Cost ratio                                                                                       | 24.3%   | 25.2%   |\n| Combined ratio (gross before reinsurance)                                                        | 92.3%   | 94.5%   |\n| Earnings before taxes                                                                            | 298.5   | 180.6   |\n\n#### Changes in premiums\n\nPremiums written at UNIQA Austria increased by 5.0 per cent to €4,290.0 million in 2023 (2022: €4,086.4 million).\n\nin the reporting period rose by 9.1 per cent to €1,268.0 million (2022: €1,162.1 million).

As impairment losses were already recognised on the communicated insolvency ratio of 30 per cent as at the reporting date, no material impact on the 2024 financial year and subsequent years is expected.\n\n#### **Outlook**\n\n#### **Economic outlook**\n\nWe do not expect to see a prolonged process of economic contraction. GDP in Europe should grow once again by around 1.2 per cent as early as 2024 and in the USA by as much as 1.6 per cent thanks to strong demand. Growth of about 1 per cent is expected in Austria.\n\nDue to the inflation trend, the market strongly expects the first interest rate cuts before mid-2024. Although second-round effects from the sharp wage increases could push prices up again, this effect should be largely offset by the weak economy in China. Significant price reductions on Chinese export goods are generally expected, which should create sufficient room for manoeuvre for interest rate cuts. This means that the end of high inflation is largely in sight: in 2024, the inflation rate in the USA and the eurozone should fall below 2 per cent at times, while the annual average in Austria should be around 3.5 per cent in 2024 according to the IMF. Prices in Eastern Europe are also expected to rise by a maximum of 5 to 6 per cent.\n\nElections in 2024 will be a particularly interesting topic. Although elections will be held in many states and regions this year, the race for the US presidency will clearly be the centre of attention. This election will set the course for global politics for a long time to come and could therefore also have an impact on economic policy.\n\n#### **Business outlook**\n\nFor the 2024 financial year, the last year of our \"UNIQA 3.0 – Seeding the Future\" strategic programme, we are concentrating on further improving our core insurance business in our two home markets of Austria and CEE.\n\nExpectations of strong growth in property and health insurance are based on both targeted sales activities and adjustments in connection with inflation and index developments.\n\nHowever, we again expect pressure on earnings in the 2024 financial year due to rising expenses for insurance benefits (particularly in the areas of property and health insurance) and in the area of costs (primarily due to inflation). It is therefore crucial to maintain strict cost discipline and continuously optimise cost management.\n\nBased on a solvency ratio of at least 170 per cent, we strive to allow our shareholders to participate progressively in the success of our company, i.e. with annually increasing dividend payments. The payout ratio will remain unchanged at up to 60 per cent.\n\nThese forecasts are subject to possible negative influences on our consolidated profit, which may result from geopolitical upheavals and the associated uncertainties for the global capital markets, from a volatile interest rate environment, from the general inflation trend and, above all, from increased claims payments as a result of natural catastrophes. In connection with this, we expect our target profitability to be at the level of 2023.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Information pursuant to Section 243a(1) of the Austrian Commercial Code**\n\n- 1.

The scope and orientation of these systems put in place were designed on the basis of company-specific requirements. Despite creating appropriate frameworks, there is always a certain residual risk because even appropriate and functional systems cannot guarantee absolute security with regard to the identification and management of risks.\n\n#### Objectives:\n\n- a) Identification and measurement of risks that could obstruct the goal of producing (consolidated) financial statements that comply with regulations\n- b) Limiting recognised risks, for example by consulting with external specialists\n- c) Review of external risks with regard to their influence on the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding reporting of these risks\n\nThe aim of the internal control system in the accounting process is to guarantee sufficient security by means of implementing controls so that, despite identified risks, proper financial statements are prepared. Along with the risks described in the Risk Report, the risk management system also analyses additional risks within internal business processes, compliance, internal reporting, etc.\n\n#### **Organisational structure and control environment**\n\nThe company's accounting process is incorporated into the UNIQA Group accounting process. In addition to the SAP S/4 HANA accounting system, a harmonised insurance-specific IT system is also used for the company's purposes. Compliance guidelines and manuals for company organisation, accounting and consolidation exist for the purpose of guaranteeing secure processes.\n\n#### **Identification and control of risks**\n\nAn inventory and appropriate control measures were conducted to identify existing risks. The type of controls was defined in the guidelines and instructions and coordinated with the existing authorisation concept.\n\nThe controls include both manual coordination and comparison routines, as well as the approval of system configurations for connected IT systems. New risks and control weaknesses in the accounting process are quickly reported to management so that it can undertake corrective measures. The procedure for the identification and control of risks is evaluated on a regular basis by an external independent auditor.\n\n#### **Information and communication**\n\nDeviations from expected results and evaluations are monitored by means of monthly reports and key figures, and they form the foundation of information provided to management on an ongoing basis. The management review that is based on this information and the approval of the processed data form the foundation of further treatment in the company's financial statements.\n\n#### **Measures to ensure effectiveness**\n\nRather than being made up of static systems, the internal control and risk management system is adjusted on an ongoing basis to changing requirements and general conditions. In order to identify necessary changes, the effectiveness of all systems must be constantly monitored. The foundations for this are:\n\n- a) Regular self-evaluations by the persons tasked with controls\n- b) Evaluations of key data to validate transaction results in relation to indications that suggest control deficiencies\n- c) Random tests of effectiveness by the Internal Audit department and comprehensive efficacy tests by the Internal Audit department and/or special teams\n\n#### **Reporting to the Supervisory Board/Audit Committee**\n\nIn the context of compliance and internal control and risk management systems, the Management Board reports regularly to the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee by means of Internal Audit department reports and the separate engagement of external auditors.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Proposed appropriation of profit**\n\nThe separate financial statements of UNIQA Insurance Group AG, prepared in accordance with the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) and the Insurance Supervision Act (VAG), show a net profit of €176,789,324.96 for the 2023 financial year (2022: €171,804,370.90). The Management Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 3 June 2024 that this profit be used for the distribution of a dividend of €0.57 for each of the 309,000,000 entitled no-par-value bearer shares issued as of the reporting date and to carry the remaining amount forward to new account.\n\nVienna, 15 March 2024\n\nQ.

Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recorded prospectively. Risks related to the consequences of climate change were taken into account in the measurement of assets and liabilities, such as in the context of the impairment test for assets as well as in the calculation of technical provisions.\n\nDiscretionary judgements and assumptions regarding the future which could have a significant impact on these Consolidated Financial Statements are described in the following notes:\n\nNote 1: Investment property (assumptions used in determining fair values)\n\nNote 2: Financial assets accounted for using the equity method (assumptions and models used in STRABAG SE's earnings estimates)\n\nNote 3: Other investments and unit-linked and indexlinked life insurance investments (determination of fair values and calculation of expected credit losses)\n\nNote 5: Insurance contracts (assumptions and models for the calculation of assets and liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts)\n\nNote 6: Intangible assets (assumptions used in determining goodwill)\n\nNote 11: Deferred taxes (assessment of the ability to realise deferred tax assets)\n\nNote 12: Defined benefit plans (calculation of the present value of the defined benefit obligations)\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the measurement standards for the individual asset and liability items:\n\n## Statement of financial position item Standard of measurement\n\n**Standard of measurement**\n\n| Assets                                                            |                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                                     | Amortised cost                                                                                                                       |\n| -

The aim of these regulations, which will come into force on 1 January 2024, is to ensure an effective minimum tax rate of 15 per cent for multinational groups.\n\nUNIQA is applying the exemption from recognising and disclosing deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in connection with Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nAt this time, UNIQA is carefully studying the implementation of the minimum tax rate. The current assessment is that it will not give rise to a significant additional tax burden for UNIQA.\n\n## Standards to be applied for the first time\n\n## IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 161\n\nOn 25 June 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published the final accounting standard for insurance contracts – IFRS 17. The date of the initial application of IFRS 17 was set for 1 January 2023. UNIQA is exercising the option for insurance companies to defer the initial application date for IFRS 9 to the initial application date for IFRS 17. IFRS 17 was transposed into EU law through the adoption of Regulation (EU) No. 2021/2036 of 19 November 2021 by the European Commission.\n\nDue to the first application of these two accounting standards, a retrospective restatement was made of the figures for the comparative period and as at the comparative date. The impacts on the assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 1 January 2022 are described and explained below.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Annual Financial Report 2023**\n\n162\n\n| Assets<br>In € thousand                                   | Published<br>31/12/2021

IAS 16.29A results in a reclassification of properties for own use at amortised cost to a fair value measurement. In the item \"Property, plant and equipment\", this leads to an appreciation in the amount of €38,714 thousand in the opening balance in accordance with IFRS 17. This only concerns those properties that are the underlying items in life and health insurance with participation features.\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force\n\nUnder IFRS 17, the item \"Deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force\" is no longer reported separately. Instead, deferred acquisition costs in connection with insurance contracts represent a portion of insurance liabilities. Non-insurance deferred acquisition cash flows as well as the value of business in force are now contained in the item \"Intangible assets\".\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe item \"Intangible assets\" contains the value of business in force (VBI) amounting to €175,028 thousand and non-insurance deferred acquisition cash flows arising in connection with contracts for the management of pension and investment funds amounting to €3,697 thousand. These were previously contained in the item \"Deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force\".\n\n#### Investment property\n\nAs for the property for own use, the investment property was also reclassified for a fair value measurement in accordance with IAS 40.32B. In the item \"Investment property\", this leads to an appreciation in the amount of €1,039,042 thousand.\n\n### Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\n\nInvestments under investment contracts, which were recognised in the \"Other investments\" item under IAS 39, are allocated to the \"Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\" category under IFRS 9. Within the framework of the transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, a reevaluation was also performed for those insurance contracts that do not generate significant insurance risk and do not have any discretionary participation features. The reclassifications between insurance contracts and investment contracts performed in this regard are also reflected in the area of investments for coverage purposes in the items \"Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\" and \"Investments under investment contracts\". In addition, corrections of errors in accordance with IAS 8 totalling €3,109 thousand were recognised in this regard, increasing unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments.\n\n### Receivables and other assets\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 163\n\nThe insurance receivables previously reported under \"Receivables and other assets\" amounting to €339,877 thousand include receivables from policyholders, insurance brokers and insurance companies. Under IFRS 17, these are no longer reported separately, but as part of the liabilities from insurance contracts. The reinsurance settlement receivables, which amount to €95,762 thousand at the transition date, are no longer reported separately under IFRS 17; rather, they are reported under assets from reinsurance contracts. Furthermore, this item now contains the previously separately reported income tax receivables, which amount to €84,900 thousand at the transition date. Other corrections of errors made in connection with financial assets in this item in accordance with IAS 8 increase receivables and other assets by €7,557 thousand.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nThe decline in the item \"Other provisions\" in the amount of €19,220 thousand can be largely attributed to the fact that other provisions in connection with the insurance business are no longer recognised separately.\n\n## Liabilities and other items classified as equity or liabilities\n\nThe re-evaluation of those insurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk and do not have discretionary participation features as part of the transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 led to a reclassification between insurance and investment contracts, which is reflected in an increase of €292,405 thousand in the \"Liabilities and other items classified as liabilities\" item. Further effects resulted from the reinsurance settlement liabilities now contained in the technical provisions in accordance with IFRS 17 as well as from the liabilities to policyholders, insurance brokers and insurance companies in the amount of €326,943 thousand. Furthermore, income tax liabilities in the amount of €115,393 thousand were reclassified to this item at the transition date. Miscellaneous corrections of errors made in connection with other liabilities in accordance with IAS 8 increased liabilities by €3,972 thousand.\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe restatements of items from the statement of financial position impacted deferred tax assets in the amount of\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n€24,438 thousand and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €268,004 thousand.\n\n## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – transitional provisions\n\nSince UNIQA's business is predominantly insurancerelated and UNIQA has not yet adopted IFRS 9 in any other version, it was permissible to defer initial application of IFRS 9 to 1 January 2023.\n\nFor the presentation of restated comparative information for the period prior to the initial application of IFRS 9, UNIQA has applied IFRS 9 using classification overlay. Accordingly, IFRS 9 was also applied to the financial assets disposed of in the course of 2022. Impairments for financial assets were determined on the basis of the IFRS 9 impairment model for expected credit losses.\n\nIn principle, IFRS 9 was applied retrospectively. The following evaluations took place based on the facts and\n\ncircumstances that existed at the date of the initial application:\n\n- the definition of the business model in which a financial asset is held;\n- the revocation of previous designations of specific financial assets that were measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and\n- the designation of specific strategic equity investments not held for trading purposes as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nApplication of the expected credit loss model for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and for financial assets measured at amortised cost led to the recognition of an impairment loss of €196,630 thousand under IFRS 9 on 1 January 2023.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following tables show the effects with respect to the classification and measurement in accordance with IAS 39 as at 31 December 2022 and IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2023.\n\n164\n\n€24,438 thousand and deferred tax liabilities in the\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments – transitional provisions Since UNIQA's business is predominantly insurancerelated and UNIQA has not yet adopted IFRS 9 in any other version, it was permissible to defer initial applicacircumstances that existed at the date of the initial appli-\n\nthe definition of the business model in which a financial\n\n the revocation of previous designations of specific financial assets that were measured at fair value through\n\n the designation of specific strategic equity investments not held for trading purposes as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nApplication of the expected credit loss model for financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and for financial assets measured at amortised\n\ncost led to the recognition of an impairment loss of €196,630 thousand under IFRS 9 on 1 January 2023.\n\ncation:\n\nasset is held;\n\nprofit or loss (FVTPL); and\n\nFor the presentation of restated comparative information for the period prior to the initial application of IFRS 9, UNIQA has applied IFRS 9 using classification overlay.

They are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which also includes transaction costs. After initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share in profit/(loss) for the period and in changes in other comprehensive income until the significant influence ends.\n\nAt each reporting date, UNIQA reviews whether there are any indications that the investments in associates are impaired. If this is the case, then the impairment loss is recorded as the difference between the participation carrying amount of the associate and the corresponding recoverable amount and recognised separately in profit/(loss) for the period.

Reclassifications are to be performed prospectively in these cases.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (mandatory):\n\nFinancial assets must be measured at fair value through profit or loss if they\n\n are held within the framework of an \"other\" business model in accordance with IFRS 9; or\n\n the contractual cash flows of the asset do not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (\"SPPI criterion\" is not met).\n\nAll unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments are assigned to an \"other\" business model and are therefore required to be classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAll value changes are recorded in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance<br>investments<br>At 31 December 2023<br>In € thousand | Fixed-income<br>securities | Variable<br>income<br>securities | Loans and<br>other<br>investments | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Investments<br>under<br>investment<br>contracts | Total     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                                              | 1,817,816                  | 2,020,661                        | 175,458                           | 0                                      | 282,439                                         | 4,296,374 |\n| Total                                                                                              | 1,817,816                  | 2,020,661                        | 175,458                           | 0                                      | 282,439                                         | 4,296,374 |\n| Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance<br>investments<br>At 31 December 2022<br>In € thousand | Fixed-income<br>securities | Variable<br>income<br>securities | Loans and<br>other<br>investments | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Investments<br>under<br>investment<br>contracts | Total     |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                                              | 1,785,930                  | 1,875,060                        | 129,686                           | 4                                      | 280,021                                         | 4,070,700 |\n| Total                                                                                              | 1,785,930                  | 1,875,060                        | 129,686                           | 4                                      | 280,021                                         | 4,070,700 |\n\n## Financial assets (required to be) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are required to be recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are\n\n- held as part of a \"hold-and-sell\" business model in accordance with IFRS 9, and\n- the contractual cash flows of the asset represent solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (\"SPPI criterion\" is met).\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.

Changes resulting from the effective interest method, currency translation differences and impairments are recorded in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\n## Business model criterion\n\nTo assess the relevant business models, UNIQA focuses in particular on the strategic management of the investments. As an insurance company, UNIQA holds financial assets mainly to finance liabilities from insurance contracts.\n\nUnder other investments, UNIQA divides the business models into \"hold-and-sell\" and \"hold\". Financial assets under other investments are mainly allocated to the \"holdand-sell\" business model. Only other investments without the intention to sell, such as time deposits and loans, are allocated to the \"hold\" business model.\n\n## SPPI criterion\n\nWhen the SPPI criterion is reviewed, the characteristics of the contractual cash flows are analysed. To analyse the cash flows, UNIQA uses both the specific contracts (such as securities prospectuses) and (semi-)automated IT support from external information systems. External information systems are usually relied upon for exchangetraded securities such as government bonds and corporate bonds because these exchanges record the characteristics of the contractual cash flows in standardised databases.\n\n## Determination of fair value – significant estimates\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 189\n\nA range of accounting policies and disclosures requires the determination of the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. UNIQA has defined a control framework with regard to the determination of fair value. This includes a measurement team, which bears general responsibility for monitoring all major measurements of fair value, including Level 3 fair values, and reports directly to the responsible member of the Management Board.\n\nA review of the major unobservable inputs and the measurement adjustments is carried out regularly. If information from third parties (e.g. price quotations from brokers or price information services) is used to determine fair values, the evidence obtained from third parties is examined in order to determine whether it meets the requirements of IFRSs. The level in the fair value hierarchy to which these measurements are attributable is also tested. Major items in the measurement are reported to the Investment Committee.\n\nAs far as possible, UNIQA uses data that are observable on the market when determining the fair value of an asset or a liability. Based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques, the fair values are assigned to different levels in the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets and liabilities. At UNIQA, these primarily involve quoted shares, quoted bonds and quoted investment funds.\n- Level 2: measurement parameters that are not quoted prices included in Level 1 but which can be observed for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices), or are based on prices from markets that have been classified as inactive. The parameters that can be observed here include, for example, exchange rates, yield curves and volatilities. At UNIQA, these include in particular quoted bonds that do not fulfil the conditions under Level 1, along with structured products.\n- Level 3: measurement parameters for assets or liabilities that are not based or are only partly based on observable market data. The measurement here primarily involves application of the discounted cash flow method, comparative procedures with instruments for which there are observable prices and other procedures. As there are no observable parameters here in many cases, the estimates used can have a significant impact on the result of the\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nmeasurement. At UNIQA, it is primarily other equity investments, private equity and hedge funds as well as structured products that do not fulfil the conditions under Level 2 that are assigned to Level 3.\n\nIf the inputs used to determine the fair value of an asset or a liability can be assigned to different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the entire fair value measurement is assigned to the respective level of the fair value hierarchy that corresponds to the lowest input significant for the measurement overall.\n\nUNIQA recognises reclassifications between different levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the change occurred.\n\nThe measurement processes and methods are as follows:\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nFor the measurement of investments, the procedures best suited for the establishment of the corresponding value are applied. The following standard valuation techniques are applied for financial instruments which come under Levels 2 and 3:\n\n- Market approach\n- The measurement method in the market approach is based on prices or other applicable information from market transactions which involve identical or comparable assets and liabilities.\n- Income approach\n- The income approach corresponds to the method whereby the future (expected) payment flows or earnings are inferred on a current amount.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 191\n\n## Valuation techniques and inputs in the determination of fair values\n\n190\n\nmeasurement.

fixed-income securities is the specific credit spread. In order to be able to measure these securities in a discounted cash flow model, the spreads are determined using a selection of reference securities with comparable characteristics. For the fixed-income securities in Level 3, an increase in the discount rate by 100 basis points results in a 4.6 per cent reduction in value (2022: 9.7 per cent). A reduction in the discount rate by 100 basis points results in a 3.6 per cent increase in value (2022: 8.5 per cent).\n\n#### Other\n\nOther securities under Level 3 mainly comprise private equity funds and other equity investments. Private equity funds are measured based on the net asset values which are determined by the fund manager using specific unobservable inputs for all underlying portfolio positions. This is done in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) Guidelines.\n\n#### Securities lending transactions\n\nSecurities loaned within the framework of securities lending continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position, as the significant opportunities and risks are not transferred through the lending. In return, UNIQA receives collateral in the form of securities, which are accordingly not recognised in the statement of financial position. As at the reporting date, the carrying amount of the financial assets lent in the category \"Fixed-income\n\nsecurities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\" from securities lending transactions amounted to €526,158 thousand (2022: €530,299 thousand). The equivalent value of the collateral received is €571,583 thousand (2022: €591,932 thousand).

Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss and equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (\"FVOCI option\") are not subject to the impairment model.\n\nTo determine the expected credit losses, UNIQA uses a credit deterioration model in which the amount of the risk provision to be recognised is based on the change in the default risk of a financial instrument following its addition. The risk provision is also recognised for expected losses and therefore represents a prospective impairment in the amount of the present value of the expected credit losses. The expected credit losses are determined as at the measure-ment date as the difference between the discounted contractual cash flows and the risk-weighted cash flows. The scenario-based risk weighting of the cash flows is carried out using the probability of default and the loss given default. The model that UNIQA uses to determine expected credit losses aims to come up with an undistorted, scenario-weighted amount. It does this by taking into account the time value of money as well as data on current economic conditions and their future forecasts that are available at the measurement date without unreasonable time and cost. The probabilities of default also include forward-looking information and take the macroeconomic development of the unemployment rate into account as well as the high-yield spreads.\n\nThe probability of default is the probability that debtors will be unable to meet their payment obligations, either within the next twelve months or over the entire remaining term. The loss given default corresponds to the expectation of how much the loss of a financial asset will be in the event of default.\n\nUNIQA obtains most of the data used to calculate the probability of default and the loss given default from external data sources. The probability of default is determined at issuer level, and the loss given default is allocated on the basis of long-term averages of individual classes of financial instruments. In cases where specific input data is not completely available from external data sources (e.g. financial assets that are not externally rated), the risk parameters were allocated on the basis of benchmarks of comparable instruments and expert assessments.\n\nThe time value of money (which is needed to determine the expected credit losses) is the effective interest rate of the respective financial asset, determined at the time when the financial asset was acquired.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 197\n\nThe expected credit loss of a financial instrument is determined based on the assigned impairment level on the measurement date either as the present value of the expected defaults over the next twelve months or as the present value of the expected defaults over the entire remaining term.\n\nAt each measurement date, all financial assets within the scope of the impairment model are assigned to an impairment level.\n\nThe expected credit loss of a financial instrument is determined based on the assigned impairment level on the measurement date.\n\nFor Level 1 financial instruments, an impairment is recognised in the amount of the 12-month expected credit loss (12-month ECL). The 12-month ECL represents a portion of the total expected credit losses (lifetime ECLs) that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within twelve months after the reporting period. Financial instruments for which no significant increase in the credit risk was determined on the measurement date as well as financial instruments first recognised on the measurement date are assigned to Level 1. Furthermore, instruments with a low default risk (investment grade) are regularly assigned to Level 1 of the impairment model. UNIQA makes use of the option of not analysing a significant increase in credit risk for instruments with a low default risk (investment grade – in UNIQA's model up to the equivalent of a rating level of BBB-) on the measurement date.\n\nFor Level 2 financial instruments, an impairment is recognised in the amount of the present value of the expected credit losses over the entire remaining term. Financial instruments for which a significant increase in the credit risk was identified on the measurement date are assigned to Level 2.\n\nFor Level 3 financial instruments, an impairment is recognised in the amount of the present value of the expected credit losses over the entire maturity. Financial instruments viewed as having diminished creditworthiness on the measurement date are assigned to Level 3.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\nUNIQA assesses a significant increase in credit risk overall on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria. To make this quantitative assessment, the probability-ofdefault curve over the lifetime at the measurement date is compared with the forward-looking probability-of-default curve over the lifetime at the time of initial recognition. A significant increase in credit risk is normally assumed whenever there is a relative doubling of the probability of default since the date of purchase. If a significant increase in credit risk is determined on the measurement date, an allocation to “Level 2” is made. As a backstop for the identification of a significant increase in the credit risk of a financial instrument, contractual cash flows are assumed to be overdue at more than 30 days.\n\nIn the overall assessment, a qualitative evaluation of the level allocation for Level 1 or Level 2 is also carried out based on external market indicators and by subject matter experts. In the qualitative assessment, particular consideration is given to factors such as a significant change in contractual terms, a borrower's ability to repay their other exposures, as well as external factors with a potentially significant influence on the borrower's ability to repay.\n\nAn allocation to \"Level 3\" (credit-impaired financial assets) of the impairment model is made if one or more events with an adverse effect on the expected future cash flows of the financial asset occur. Among others, UNIQA considers the following events to be indicators:\n\n- significant financial difficulties on the part of the issuer or borrower;\n- default of or overdue contractual cash flows;\n- financial concessions by lenders;\n- increased likelihood of insolvency or restructuring proceedings;\n- disappearance of an active market due to the financial difficulties of the financial asset; and\n- financial assets with a large discount that already reflects the credit losses incurred.\n\nIn addition, a financial instrument is assigned to Level 3 if contractual cash flows are more than 90 days in default. To assess whether a financial asset is credit-impaired, the indicators are considered both individually and collectively.\n\n## Expected credit losses on fixed-income securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nChanges in value recognised on the basis of the impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 for expected credit losses in the category \"Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\" amount to €–30,642 thousand (2022: €–162,866 thousand).\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Change in impairment                                        |         | Stage 1 |        | Stage 2 |         | Stage 3 |         | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| In € thousand                                               | 2023    | 2022    | 2023   | 2022    | 2023    | 2022    | 2023    | 2022    |\n| At 1 January                                                | 21,514  | 4,096   | 14,726 | 2,930   | 160,390 | 0       | 196,630 | 7,026   |\n| Reclassification as assets in disposal groups held for sale | -15,728 |         | -8,970 |         | -4,808  |         | -29,506 |         |\n| Increase due to acquisition or founding                     | 3,665   | 3,923   | 0      | 0       | 0       | 0       | 3,665   | 3,923   |\n| Changes due to transfer between stages                      | 880     | 352     | -857   | 105     | -23     | -457    | 0       | 0       |\n| Transfers from Stage 1                                      | -122    | 177     | 122    | 280     | 0       | -457    | 0       | 0       |\n| Transfers from Stage 2                                      | 980     | 176     | -980   | -176    | 0       | 0       | 0       | 0       |\n| Transfers from Stage 3                                      | 23      | 0       | 0      | 0       | -23     | 0       | 0       | 0       |\n| Decrease due to derecognition                               | -1,862  | -432    | -1,878 | -344    | -6,813  | 0       | -10,553 | -776    |\n| Changes due to risk parameters                              | -2,345  | 16,977  | 459    | 15,186  | 39,415  | 157,921 | 37,530  | 190,084 |\n| Changes from currency translation                           | -612    | -3,404  | -182   | -3,150  | -452    | 2,926   | -1,246  | -3,628  |\n| At 31 December                                              | 5,512   | 21,514  | 3,299  | 14,726  | 187,710 | 160,390 | 196,521 | 196,630 |\n\n1) The shares of profit/(loss) attributable to the discontinued operations are included in this presentation to enable a reconciliation with the level as at 31 December 2022.

Transitional provisions, judgements and estimates as well as significant accounting policies in connection with this accounting standard, which came into force on 1 January 2023, are explained below.\n\n## Transitional provisions\n\nAs at the transition date to IFRS 17, a large part of UNIQA's insurance portfolio consists of contracts where the conclusion of the contract sometimes dates back decades. IFRS 17 basically stipulates that the standard must be applied fully retrospectively. This means that the items in the statement of financial position should be determined as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. Full retrospective application requires at least an annual roll-up of the contractual service margin over the entire term of the contract, since its inception.\n\nFull retrospective application of IFRS 17 is not practicable for UNIQA for the following reasons:\n\n- The required contract master data and data on transactions concerning the contracts are not available retrospectively with the necessary granularity.\n- The determination of expected future cash flows and their adjustment in the event of non-economic changes in assumptions (e.g. mortality assumptions) is not possible retrospectively, as even in that case no better knowledge would be available (\"without hindsight\").\n- The same applies to the determination of the required allocation of costs attributable to the insurance portfolio.\n- For contracts with participation features, economic assumptions and historical IFRS 17 specifics such as the financing component are not available for stochastic modelling prior to initial application.\n- In the long-term property and casualty insurance business, the historical parameters for determining the technical provisions can only be determined with disproportionate effort and a subdivision into cohorts is not possible due to the lack of historical information for tacit renewals.\n\nIf the full retrospective application of IFRS 17 is not practicable, which is the case for UNIQA, there are two alternatives available:\n\nmodified retrospective approach; and\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 201\n\nfair value approach.\n\nThe aim of the modified retrospective approach is to achieve the best possible approximation to a full retrospective application. Under the fair value approach, the contractual service margin of a group of insurance contracts at the transition date is determined as the difference between the fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 and the corresponding fulfilment cash flows determined under IFRS 17. UNIQA uses both approaches.\n\nThe choice of the appropriate approach for determining the IFRS 17 opening balance is made at the level of portfolios of insurance contracts. To make this choice, it must be determined for all groups in the portfolio whether the contracts are onerous at initial recognition or whether there is no significant probability that they could become onerous.\n\nIn connection with the modified retrospective approach, IFRS 17 allows several modifications to the full retrospective application, of which the following are applied at UNIQA. These modifications can be applied if the required detailed information from prior periods is not available. Due to the lack of availability of contract information in the required granularity, UNIQA is applying the modification IFRS 17.C10, which allows the omission of a subdivision of contract groups by underwriting years.\n\nApplication of the modified retrospective approach for contracts without discretionary participation features:\n\n- UNIQA applies the modifications IFRS 17.C12– C14 for contracts without discretionary participation features. Those deal with the determination of the expected future cash flows, their interest, the risk adjustment and the insurance acquisition cash flows for the initial recognition of groups of insurance contracts. Based on these modifications, a contractual service margin or loss component is determined at the date of initial recognition of groups of insurance contracts.\n- The modifications IFRS 17.C15 and IFRS 17.C16 are applied to adjust the carrying amount of the contractual service margin or loss component from the date of initial recognition to the date of transition to IFRS 17.\n- For portfolios containing contracts with different underwriting years, UNIQA applies the modification IFRS 17.C18(b). This results in the cumulative revaluation reserve being determined as nil at the transition date, provided the OCI option in accordance with IFRS 17.88(b) applies.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor contracts with discretionary participation features, the provisions of IFRS 17.C17 can be applied, which require the contractual service margin to be determined from the following portfolio information:\n\n- the differences between the fair value of the underlying items and the fulfilment cash flows at the date of the transition to IFRS 17;\n- an adjustment for amounts charged by the company to the policyholders before that date;\n- adjustments for the changes in the risk adjustment before that date;\n- adjustment of the carrying amount of the contractual service margin from the date of initial recognition to the date of transition to IFRS 17.\n\nIf this results in a loss component, this must be determined as nil in accordance with IFRS 17.C17(e).\n\nFor insurance contracts with direct participation features, the cumulative amount from the underlying items recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income was recognised in other comprehensive income at the transition date in accordance with IFRS 17 C24(c) and C18(b)ii.\n\nCentral parameters in connection with the fair value approach are, on the one hand, the solvency capital requirement and, on the other hand, the selection of a suitable capitalisation rate. The solvency capital requirements correspond to those under Solvency II (for companies in EU countries) as well as the corresponding local regulations. When determining the contractual service margin using the fair value approach, the appropriate profit margin to be realised is decisive. To determine this, the present value of the expected costs of holding sufficient capital to cover the own funds that the buyer must manage during the remaining term of the portfolio is calculated. For this purpose, the target own funds is defined for each future year.\n\nThe profit margin that the buyer requires is then defined as the present value of the future costs of holding the additional capital for the remaining life of the portfolio. To determine the present value, the capitalisation rates corresponding to those used in the impairment test for goodwill as at 31 December 2021 are applied. Acquisition cash flows incurred before the transition date are not taken into account in the fair value approach and are therefore not recognised in subsequent periods under insurance revenue or insurance service expenses.\n\n## Judgements and estimates\n\n## Judgements\n\nInformation on judgements that have a material effect on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements is provided below:\n\n- Identification of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features: assessment of whether a significant insurance risk is transferred and the contracts thus fall within the scope of IFRS 17, or whether there are any contracts with direct participation features.\n- Determination of the level of aggregation: identification of portfolios of insurance contracts as well as determination of groups of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition and groups of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently.\n- Variable fee approach: assessment of the applicability of the variable fee approach for contracts with direct participation features.\n- Premium allocation approach: applicability of the premium allocation approach for long-term contracts.\n- Estimates of future cash flows: estimates of expected cash flows in connection with the fulfilment of the contract.\n- Insurance acquisition cash flows: determination of whether the insurance acquisition cash flows can be directly allocated.\n- Interest rate assumptions: determination of the yield curves to be used for discounting.\n- Measurement: determination of the method for calculating the risk adjustment for non-financial risk and the coverage units provided.\n- Transitional provisions: determination whether sufficient reasonable and supportable information is available to perform a full or modified retrospective application.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Assumptions and estimates\n\n202\n\nFor contracts with discretionary participation features, the provisions of IFRS 17.C17 can be applied, which require the contractual service margin to be determined\n\nJudgements and estimates\n\nments is provided below:\n\nous subsequently.\n\nipation features.\n\nrectly allocated.\n\ncurves to be used for discounting.\n\ncoverage units provided.\n\ntract.\n\ntion.\n\nInformation on judgements that have a material effect on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial State-\n\n Identification of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features: assessment of whether a significant insurance risk is transferred and the contracts thus fall within the scope of IFRS 17, or whether there are any\n\n Determination of the level of aggregation: identification of portfolios of insurance contracts as well as determination of groups of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition and groups of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming oner-\n\n Variable fee approach: assessment of the applicability of the variable fee approach for contracts with direct partic-\n\n Premium allocation approach: applicability of the premium allocation approach for long-term contracts.

However, these changes would lead to an adjustment of the contractual service margin and would not affect the carrying amount of the insurance contracts, unless the changes result from onerous contracts or do not relate to future benefits:\n\n- Property and casualty insurance contracts: assumptions related to claims development and claims frequency.\n- Health and life insurance contracts: assumptions for estimates of future cash flows related to mortality, longevity, disability or morbidity, customer behaviour (lapse) and profit participation rate.\n\nThe assumptions regarding discount rates and the development of costs have an influence on all the lines of insurance business.\n\nSignificant assumptions and estimates in connection with calculating the fulfilment cash flows, the contractual service margin and the investment component are explained below.\n\n## Fulfilment cash flows\n\nFulfilment cash flows comprise:\n\n- estimates of future cash flows;\n- discounting to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks related to the future cash flows;\n- a risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe objective of an estimate of future cash flows is to determine the expected value of a range of scenarios that reflects the full range of possible outcomes. The cash flows from each scenario are discounted and weighted by the estimated probability of that outcome to derive an expected present value. UNIQA applies stochastic modelling if the cash flows are influenced by complex underlying factors and they therefore do not react linearly to changes in the economic environment. This is the case, for example, with contracts with participation features. If this is not the case, a deterministic calculation is used.\n\nThe estimates of future cash flows incorporate, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows. The information is based on company-specific data provided that the estimates are consistent with observable market data\n\nand the assumptions adequately consider future scenarios. When estimating the cash flows, UNIQA takes into account current expectations of future events that might affect those cash flows. Expectations of future changes in legislation that would change or discharge the present obligation or create new obligations under the existing insurance contract are not taken into account until the change in legislation is substantively enacted.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 203\n\nCash flows within the boundary of an existing insurance contract relate directly to the fulfilment of the contract, including those cash flows for which UNIQA can decide the amount or maturity at its own discretion. These cash flows include premiums, insurance benefits, insurance acquisition cash flows and other costs incurred to fulfil the contract.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows result from the sale of insurance contracts and are directly attributable to the portfolio to which the contract belongs. Other costs recognised in the cash flows are:\n\n- claims handling costs;\n- policy administration and maintenance costs, including recurring commissions; and\n- asset management costs.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows and other costs also include fixed and variable overheads directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts. Such overheads are allocated to groups of contracts using methods that are systematic and rational, and are consistently applied to all costs that have similar characteristics.\n\nAcquisition cash flows and administrative costs are distributed using the premiums written to the respective group of insurance contracts. Claims handling costs are distributed using the actual claims for the respective group of insurance contracts.\n\nInsurance contracts in one group can affect or be affected by the cash flows to policyholders of contracts in a different group (mutualisation). This is the case, for example, when the policyholders share the returns on the same specified pool of underlying items with policyholders of other contracts and the guarantee agreement of one group leads to a reduction in the share of the returns of another group.\n\nMutualisation affects the measurement of the fulfilment cash flows for the groups concerned. The fulfilment cash flows for a group include all payments arising from the\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nterms of existing contracts to policyholders of contracts in other groups and exclude payments to policyholders in the group that have been included in the fulfilment cash flows of another group.\n\nThe contract boundaries determine which future cash flows are to be included in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts. Cash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they result from substantive rights and obligations that exist during a specific period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay the premium or in which UNIQA has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholders with insurance contract services.\n\n## Significant assumptions incorporated into calculating future cash flows\n\n## Property and casualty insurance\n\nFuture cash flows from premiums are estimated using contract data taking future lapses by policyholders into account. The lapse rate is derived from experience in previous years at product group level.\n\nLoss or cost ratios and associated payment patterns are derived from past experience to estimate future cash flows from future service and costs. Where necessary, judgements are also made as to the extent to which past trends can also be expected in the future, as well as whether new trends should be taken into account.\n\nReserves for incurred claims that have not yet been settled, including incurred claims that have not yet been reported, are usually estimated using generally accepted statistical triangular methods (such as chain ladder or Bornhuetter-Ferguson) on the basis of the years in which they occurred. These methods assume that past experience provides a sufficiently good indication of claims payments in the future. Other best practice methods (such as methods based on loss frequency and loss amount) are only used in exceptional cases. The selection of the appropriate method for the respective sub-portfolio is a significant judgement. From the claims payments determined in this way, the future cash flows are finally estimated using settlement patterns also derived from past experience.\n\n#### Health insurance and life insurance\n\nThe best estimate assumptions described below are determined based on past, present and expected developments. These are reviewed and updated at least once a year.\n\n## *Profit participation assumptions*\n\nThe policyholder's assumed profit participation for the corresponding life insurance business is derived for each economic scenario using the management rules. The profit participation is calculated in accordance with the profit participation regulations applicable by law.\n\n#### *Cost assumptions*\n\nCost assumptions are based on the directly attributable actual costs incurred in the years prior to the measurement date. Future additional costs are taken into account in the cost allocation, whereas extraordinary costs are eliminated. The expected cost trend during the projection period is based on the portfolio development, taking into account differences in administrative expenses depending on relevant contract features, such as higher administrative expenses for contracts subject to premiums compared to premium-free contracts.\n\n#### *Lapse assumptions*\n\nThe lapse rate is based on an analysis of previous lapse rates and the average of comparable financial years. The lapse rate for new products is based on similar products from the past.\n\n#### *Commission assumptions*\n\nThe commission estimates are based on the applicable commission agreements.\n\n#### *Mortality and disability assumptions*\n\nMortality and disability assumptions are based on the best estimate of future events.

Where necessary, judgements are also made as to the extent to which past trends can also be expected in the future, as well as whether new\n\nReserves for incurred claims that have not yet been settled, including incurred claims that have not yet been reported, are usually estimated using generally accepted statistical triangular methods (such as chain ladder or Bornhuetter-Ferguson) on the basis of the years in which they occurred. These methods assume that past experience provides a sufficiently good indication of claims payments in the future. Other best practice methods (such as methods based on loss frequency and loss amount) are only used in exceptional cases. The selection of the appropriate method for the respective sub-portfolio is a significant judgement. From the claims payments determined in this way, the future cash flows are finally estimated using settlement patterns also derived from past experience.\n\nAll cash flows are discounted using the adjusted risk-free yield curve, which reflects the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. The risk-free base rates for all relevant currencies are calculated using swap and government bond market data. The underlying market data sources and the parameters required for the interpolation and extrapolation of the risk-free base curves are harmonised with those of EIOPA. The risk-free curve, including adjustments, is extrapolated to a final forward interest rate after the last liquid market data point. The ultimate forward rate reflects long-term real interest rate and inflation expectations and is updated in accordance with the EIOPA parameters.\n\nThe risk-free yield curve is adjusted by an illiquidity premium to reflect the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. Illiquidity adjustments are determined by calculating risk-adjusted spreads on government and corporate bonds within the portfolio of the respective entity. Cash flows that fluctuate based on the yields of the underlying items are adjusted to account for the effects of this volatility using risk-neutral modelling techniques and discounted using the risk-free interest rates including the illiquidity adjustment.\n\n## *Assumptions regarding cash flows to be paid to policyholders*\n\nInsurance contracts without direct participation features often give rise to cash flows to policyholders over which the entity has some discretion. To determine how to identify a change in discretionary cash flows, the basis on which commitments under the contract are to be determined shall be specified at inception of the contract. A change in the discretionary cash flows is regarded as relating to future service, and the carrying amount of the contractual service margin is adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 205\n\nRisk adjustment is the amount that would be required as consideration for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from nonfinancial risk. This reflects the risk compensation effect of insurance contracts issued, which is in line with the consideration required and reflects the degree of risk aversion.\n\nIn property and casualty insurance, the risk adjustment is determined using the confidence level method. In health insurance and life insurance, the cost of capital method is applied.\n\nFor proportional reinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance, the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is derived from that of the primary insurance. The basis for this is the ratio between gross and net liability for incurred claims.\n\n## Confidence level technique\n\nThe probability distribution of all expected future cash flows is estimated and the risk adjustment for non-financial risk is calculated as the difference between the median of the future cash flows and the value-at-risk, measured with a percentile of 75 per cent.\n\n## Cost of capital approach\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk is determined using a cost of capital rate applied to the required principal for all future years. The resulting capital requirements are discounted using a risk-free yield curve adjusted to include a premium for the illiquidity. The required principal is determined by estimating the probability distribution of all future present values of the cash flows and determining the capital required to meet the contractual obligations with a confidence level of 99.5 per cent over the term of the contracts. The cost of capital rate is the additional consideration that investors would demand for exposure to nonfinancial risk. The cost of capital rate is 6 per cent (2022: 6 per cent)\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Contractual service margin\n\nThe contractual service margin is a component of the carrying amount of the asset or liability for a group of insurance contracts representing the unearned profit from a group of insurance contracts that UNIQA will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future.\n\nAn amount of the contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts is recognised in profit or loss in each period to reflect the insurance contract services provided under the group of insurance contracts in that period.\n\n## Identifying the coverage units\n\nThe number of coverage units in a group of insurance contracts is the quantity of insurance contract services provided by the contracts in the group.\n\nThese services include:\n\n- insurance coverage (coverage for an insured event);\n- investment-related services (for insurance contracts with direct participation features): concerns the management of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder; and\n- investment-return services (for insurance contracts without direct participation features).\n\nThe amount recognised in profit or loss is based on the number of coverage units in a group. This number is determined by considering for each contract the quantity of the benefits provided under the contract and its expected coverage period. The coverage units are reviewed once a year and adjusted if necessary.\n\n#### Basis for determining the coverage units\n\n| Life insurance products                                 |                                                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Endowment assurance                                     | Sum insure                                                                                           |\n| Risk insurance                                          | Sum insure                                                                                           |\n| Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance             | Sum insure                                                                                           |\n| Pension insurance                                       | Liability for remaining coverage for investment services and<br>pension for insurance benefits       |\n| Insurance contracts with participation features         | Liability for remaining coverage except for pension                                                  |\n| Reinsurance                                             | Reinsurance premium                                                                                  |\n| Property and casualty insurance products (all products) | Premiums written adjusted for inflation                                                              |\n| Health insurance products                               | Number of existing insurance contracts<br>adjusted for inflation and weighted by annual net premiums |\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor unit-linked and index-linked life insurance, the sum insured represents both insurance benefits and investment benefits – the risk portion is allocated to insurance benefits, while the liability for remaining coverage is allocated to investment benefits.\n\nIn life insurance, the time value of money is taken into account when identifying the coverage units.\n\nUNIQA does not make use of the risk mitigation option provided for in IFRS 17.B115.\n\n## Investment component\n\n206\n\nContractual service margin\n\nThe contractual service margin is a component of the carrying amount of the asset or liability for a group of insurance contracts representing the unearned profit from a group of insurance contracts that UNIQA will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future.\n\nIdentifying the coverage units\n\nThese services include:\n\nand adjusted if necessary.\n\nand\n\nEndowment assurance Sum insured Risk insurance Sum insured Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance Sum insured Pension insurance Liability for remaining coverage for investment services and\n\nInsurance contracts with participation features Liability for remaining coverage except for pensions Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums\n\nProperty and casualty insurance products (all products) Premiums written adjusted for inflation\n\nHealth insurance products Number of existing insurance contracts\n\nvided by the contracts in the group.\n\nThe number of coverage units in a group of insurance contracts is the quantity of insurance contract services pro-\n\n insurance coverage (coverage for an insured event); investment-related services (for insurance contracts with direct participation features): concerns the management of underlying items on behalf of the policyholder;\n\ninvestment-return services (for insurance contracts\n\nThe amount recognised in profit or loss is based on the number of coverage units in a group.

Investment components may not be recognised in insurance revenue or insurance service expenses.\n\nIn life insurance, the investment component during the coverage period results from the lower of the surrender value and the contractually determined amount of the insurance benefit. At the end of the coverage period, the investment component is calculated with the maturity benefit.\n\n## Applicable accounting policies\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts through which a significant insurance risk is assumed. Investment contracts are contracts that do not transfer a significant insurance risk and that do not include discretionary participation features. They fall under the scope of IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments).\n\nUNIQA holds both inward and outward reinsurance contracts. The carrying amount of the portfolios from inward reinsurance contracts (assumed reinsurance) is shown together with the carrying amount of the primary insurance contract portfolios.\n\nInsurance contracts can be divided into contracts with direct participation features and contracts without participation features. Insurance contracts with direct participation features are those for which, at inception:\n\n the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n\n the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 207\n\n the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the changes in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nFor insurance contracts that meet the aforementioned criteria, the variable fee approach must be applied. Whether the aforementioned criteria are met is assessed at inception of the contract and may not be reassessed at a later date unless the contract is modified. In addition, the variable fee approach is applied in health insurance long-term business as well as in unit-linked and index-linked life insurance.\n\nAll other insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts held are classified as insurance contracts without direct participation features and are measured accordingly using the general measurement model or, if the conditions are met, the premium allocation approach.\n\n## Level of aggregation and approach\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nFor measurement purposes, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups. A group of insurance contracts is determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts subject to similar risks and managed together. The defined portfolios are subdivided as follows:\n\n- a group of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition;\n- a group of contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently; and\n- a group of the remaining contracts in the portfolio.\n\nThe aforementioned groups are further subdivided by underwriting years, as only contracts sold within one year may be included in the same group.\n\nIn respect of the obligation to form annual cohorts, which prevents contracts issued more than one year apart from each other from being included together in a group of insurance contracts, an option was established as part of the transposition of IFRS 17 into EU law. According to this option, the European Commission allows users in the EU to not apply the requirement under IFRS 17.22 for certain contracts. UNIQA makes use of this option and applies it in connection with participating contracts. For these\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\ncontracts, new business is presented in the cohort of the transition date.\n\nPrimary insurance contracts and inward reinsurance contracts are recognised at the earliest of the following dates:\n\n- the beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts;\n- the date when the first payment from a policyholder in the group becomes due; and\n- for a group of onerous contracts, when the group becomes onerous.\n\nThe group of insurance contracts is established at initial recognition and no subsequent reassessment of the composition of the groups is permitted. If the recognition criteria are met, the contract is allocated to an existing group of insurance contracts or, if the contract may not be allocated to the existing groups, a new group is formed.\n\n#### Reinsurance contracts held\n\nThe grouping of reinsurance contracts held (outward reinsurance) is based on the same principles as for primary insurance, with the exception that reinsurance contracts cannot be onerous. \n\nA group of reinsurance contracts is recognised at the following dates:\n\n- proportional reinsurance contracts: at initial recognition of any underlying insurance contract;\n- non-proportional reinsurance contracts: at the beginning of the coverage period of the group. However, if a group of onerous underlying insurance contracts is recognised, recognition is at that date, provided the related reinsurance contract was in force at or before that date.\n\nReinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance are mostly non-proportional contracts.\n\nThe separation between assets and liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts is carried out in accordance with IFRS 17.78, which stipulates that portfolios of insurance and reinsurance contracts that are assets must be presented separately from those that are liabilities.\n\n## Insurance acquisition cash flows\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows are allocated to the groups of insurance contracts using a systematic method, if direct allocation to the group is possible, otherwise at portfolio level. To take changes in assumptions into account, the inputs are reviewed for the allocation method applied at the end of each reporting period.\n\nWhen applying the premium allocation approach, UNIQA does not make use of the option to recognise insurance acquisition cash flows as expenses for insurance contracts with a duration of up to one year.\n\n## Contract boundaries\n\nAll the future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group are included in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts. Whether the cash flows are within the contract boundary is determined as follows:\n\n#### Insurance contracts (including assumed reinsurance)\n\nCash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the policyholder is compelled to pay the premiums or in which UNIQA has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance contract services.\n\nA substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when:\n\n- UNIQA has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those risks; or\n- if these criteria are not met for an individual contract but are met for a portfolio and the pricing of the premiums for the coverage period to date does not take into account the risks that relate to future periods.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Reinsurance contracts\n\n208\n\ntransition date.\n\ntracts;\n\ncomes onerous.\n\nthe group becomes due; and\n\nReinsurance contracts held\n\nof any underlying insurance contract;\n\nare mostly non-proportional contracts.\n\ncannot be onerous.\n\nlowing dates:\n\ncontracts, new business is presented in the cohort of the\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows\n\nwith a duration of up to one year.\n\nContract boundaries\n\nvices ends when:\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows are allocated to the groups of insurance contracts using a systematic method, if direct allocation to the group is possible, otherwise at portfolio level.

The fulfilment cash flows include estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment reflecting the time value of money and financial risks, and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk is derived separately from the other estimates and represents the compensation for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk.\n\nThe contractual service margin for a group of insurance contracts depicts the unearned profit that UNIQA will generate with the future provision of services. If there is a net cash inflow on initial recognition, a contractual service margin is recognised to avoid profit recognition. The fulfilment cash flows are compensated by the recognition of the contractual service margin and thus lead to a liability for remaining coverage of zero at initial recognition.\n\nIf there is a net outflow of funds, the contracts are onerous. This amount is recognised in profit or loss and shown as a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage. The reversal of the loss component is shown as an expense reduction in the \"insurance service expenses\" item.\n\nThe provisions relating to initial recognition also apply to the variable fee approach. The differences between the general measurement model and the variable fee approach only arise in subsequent measurement and concern the adjustment of the contractual service margin and determination of insurance finance income or expenses.\n\n#### *Insurance contracts – subsequent measurement*\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 209\n\nSince UNIQA also prepares interim financial statements applying IAS 34, the accounting option regarding the treatment of accounting estimates made in interim financial statements must be observed. An entity has an accounting option to change the treatment of accounting estimates made in previous interim financial statements when applying IFRS 17 in subsequent interim financial statements and in the annual reporting period. UNIQA applies the year-to-date approach, i.e. the treatment of accounting estimates in previous interim financial statements is changed and thus the annual result is not affected by estimates in interim financial statements.\n\nThe measurement of the fulfilment cash flows is based on current estimates of future cash flows, current discount rates and current estimates of the risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk at each reporting date. The change in the fulfilment cash flows is recognised as follows:\n\n- In the event of changes relating to future service, the contractual service margin is adjusted. If the fulfilment cash flows increase, the contractual service margin is reduced; if they decrease, the contractual service margin is increased. If an increase in the fulfilment cash flows exceeds the amount of the contractual service margin, this is reversed in full and the excess amount is recognised as a loss in the insurance service expenses. If, over time, there is a reduction in the fulfilment cash flows, this is recognised as income in the insurance service result until the accumulated losses have been made up. A contractual service margin is again created for the excess.\n- In the event of a change relating to current and past service, the change is recognised in profit or loss under insurance service expenses.\n- Effects of changes in connection with financial assumptions are recognised through profit or loss under insurance finance income or, in cases where the OCI option is applied, divided between insurance finance income and other comprehensive income.\n\nThe contractual service margin of a group of contracts measured using the general measurement model is\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\ncalculated at the end of the financial year from the opening balance adjusted for:\n\n- the contractual service margin of any new contracts;\n- the interest accreted on the carrying amount of the contractual service margin during the reporting period (applying the discount rate determined at the date of initial recognition);\n- the changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service;\n- the effect of any currency exchange differences; and\n- the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of insurance contract services.\n\nThe aforementioned changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service include:\n\n- experience adjustments arising from premiums received in the period that relate to future service, and related cash flows (such as insurance acquisition cash flows);\n- changes in estimates of the present value of the future cash flows in the liability for remaining coverage, except for the effect of the time value of money and the effect of financial risk;\n- differences between any investment component in life insurance expected to become payable in the period and the actual investment component that becomes payable in the period; and\n- changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk that relate to future service.\n\nBecause a change in discretionary cash flows is considered as a future service, the carrying amount of the contractual service margin is changed.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the variable fee approach, there are differences in the adjustment of the contractual service margin with regard to subsequent measurement compared to the general measurement model.\n\nA contract with direct participation features exists if UNIQA has the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items as well as a variable fee that is retained in exchange for the future service provided by the insurance contract. The variable fee comprises the share to which UNIQA is entitled depending on the varying underlying items.\n\nThe contractual service margin of a group of contracts measured using the variable fee approach is calculated at the end of the financial year from the opening balance adjusted for:\n\n- the contractual service margin of any new contracts;\n- the change in the amount of UNIQA's share of the fair value of the underlying items unless the decrease in the amount of the company's share exceeds the carrying amount of the contractual service margin and a loss component would therefore have to be recognised or adjusted;\n- the changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to future service unless the increase in the fulfilment cash flows would exceed the carrying amount of the contractual service margin and therefore a loss component would have to be recognised or adjusted;\n- the effect of any currency exchange differences; and\n- the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of the transfer of insurance contract services.\n\nThe components to be considered in determining the changes in the fulfilment cash flows related to future service are the same as in the general measurement model, but are measured using current discount rates, and also include the change in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks not arising from the underlying items.\n\n#### *Loss component*\n\nAfter a loss has been recognised on onerous insurance contracts and a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage has been established, subsequent changes in fulfilment cash flows must be allocated on a systematic basis between the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for remaining coverage, excluding the loss component.\n\nChanges in the fulfilment cash flows to be taken into account in the systematic allocation include:\n\n- estimates of the present value of future cash flows for claims and expenses released from the liability for remaining coverage because of incurred insurance service expenses;\n- changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk recognised in profit or loss because of the release from risk; and\n- insurance finance income or expenses.\n\nThe systematic allocation is calculated as the share of the loss component divided by the present value of future cash outflows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. In addition, the variable fee approach takes into account\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe company's share of the change in the fair values of the underlying items divided by the expected claims and expenses.\n\nThe systematic allocation shall result in the total amounts allocated to the loss component being equal to zero by the end of the coverage period of a group of contracts.\n\nAny subsequent decreases in the fulfilment cash flows due to changes in the estimated future cash flows relating to future service as well as any subsequent increases in the company's share of the fair value of the underlying items do not result in a split between the liability for remaining coverage with a loss component and the liability for remaining coverage without a loss component. An allocation to the loss component shall only be made until that component has been reduced to zero.\n\n## *Reinsurance contracts held*\n\nFor the measurement of the reinsurance cession, the general measurement model is applied, but with some modifications.\n\n#### *Initial measurement*\n\n210\n\ning balance adjusted for:\n\nrecognition);\n\nfinancial risk;\n\nin the period; and\n\nrelate to future service.\n\nservice margin is changed.\n\nmodel.\n\nservice;\n\ncalculated at the end of the financial year from the open-\n\nthe end of the financial year from the opening balance ad-\n\n the changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to future service unless the increase in the fulfilment cash flows would exceed the carrying amount of the contractual service margin and therefore a loss component would have\n\n the effect of any currency exchange differences; and the amount recognised as insurance revenue because of\n\nThe components to be considered in determining the changes in the fulfilment cash flows related to future service are the same as in the general measurement model, but are measured using current discount rates, and also include the change in the effect of the time value of money and financial risks not arising from the underlying items.\n\nAfter a loss has been recognised on onerous insurance contracts and a loss component of the liability for remaining coverage has been established, subsequent changes in fulfilment cash flows must be allocated on a systematic basis between the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage and the liability for remaining coverage, ex-\n\nChanges in the fulfilment cash flows to be taken into ac-\n\n estimates of the present value of future cash flows for claims and expenses released from the liability for remaining coverage because of incurred insurance service\n\n changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk recognised in profit or loss because of the release from risk;\n\nThe systematic allocation is calculated as the share of the loss component divided by the present value of future cash outflows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.

The default risk is measured at every reporting date and any changes are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAn amount corresponding to the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer is recognised as the risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe requirements related to determining the contractual service margin on initial recognition are modified to reflect the fact that for a group of reinsurance contracts held there is no unearned profit but instead a net cost or net gain on purchasing the reinsurance.\n\nOn initial recognition, the contractual service margin therefore represents any net cost or net gain, measured as follows:\n\n- the fulfilment cash flows;\n- the amount derecognised at that date of any asset or liability previously recognised;\n\n any cash flows arising at the date of initial recognition; and\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 211\n\n- any income from the recognition of a loss-recovery component.\n- However, if the net cost relates to events that occurred before the purchase of the group of reinsurance contracts held, this cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss as an expense.\n\n## *Subsequent measurement*\n\nThe carrying amount of the contractual service margin at the end of the reporting period is measured as the carrying amount determined at the start of the reporting period, adjusted for:\n\n- the effect of any new contracts added to the group;\n- interest accreted on the carrying amount of the contractual service margin, measured at historical interest rates;\n- recognition of revenue from the coverage of onerous primary insurance contracts (loss-recovery component);\n- reversals of a loss-recovery component to the extent those reversals are not changes in the fulfilment cash flows of the group of reinsurance contracts held;\n- changes in the fulfilment cash flows, measured at the discount rates applicable at initial recognition, to the extent that the change relates to future service unless the change results from a change in the fulfilment cash flows from onerous primary insurance contracts;\n- the effect of any currency exchange differences arising on the contractual service margin; and\n- reversal through profit or loss of the contractual service margin because of services received in the period.\n\nA loss-recovery component can only be recognised if the reinsurance contract held is concluded at the same time as or before the recognition of the underlying onerous insurance contracts. The amount for the loss-recovery component, which adjusts the contractual service margin and is recognised in profit or loss, is determined as follows:\n\nMultiplying the reported profit or loss from the underlying insurance contracts by the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts that are expected to be reimbursed by the reinsurer.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Contracts measured using the premium allocation approach\n\nThe measurement is carried out using the premium allocation approach if the following criteria are met:\n\n- if the coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less (taking the specific contract boundaries into account); or\n- if it can be expected that the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage would not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying the general measurement model. This criterion is not met if at the inception of the group significant variability in the fulfilment cash flows is expected that would affect the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage during the period before a claim is incurred.\n\nThese criteria are predominantly applicable in the area of property and casualty insurance. If the criteria are not met, the general measurement model is used.\n\nFor contracts with an average term of one to three years, the premium allocation approach is applied. This approach was developed through sensitivity analyses by comparing the amount of the liability for remaining coverage calculated using the general measurement model and the premium allocation approach.\n\nFor contracts with an average term of more than three years, an estimate must be made regarding the stability of the liability for remaining coverage. This estimate is made using a calculation model in which non-financial assumptions (risk adjustment for non-financial risk, cost, loss ratio and lapse rate) and financial assumptions (interest rate) are stressed after one year. The difference of the liability for remaining coverage in each stressed scenario as well as the basic scenario is compared to a defined threshold.\n\nAll reinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance are measured using the premium allocation approach, for the following reasons:\n\n- The majority of reinsurance contracts are based on claim years with a duration of one year; and\n- for contracts based on the underwriting year, a concept was created that addresses the contract term and the variability of the fulfilment cash flows. All contracts have an average term of up to three years.\n\nIn health insurance, there are only one-year reinsurance contracts, which is why measurement using the premium allocation approach is permissible.\n\nThe reinsurance contracts in life insurance are measured using the premium allocation approach if the contracts have a contract boundary of up to one year and the coverage period is also a maximum of one year.\n\nFor the initial recognition of insurance and reinsurance contracts measured using the premium allocation approach, the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage corresponds to the premiums received minus the insurance acquisition cash flows.\n\nIn subsequent measurement of insurance and reinsurance contracts measured using the premium allocation approach, the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage is increased by the premiums received in the period plus any amounts relating to the amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows. The carrying amount is reduced by the amount recognised as insurance revenue for services provided in the reporting period and for insurance acquisition cash flows in the reporting period. Discounting of the liability for remaining coverage is not carried out, as the contracts do not have a significant financing component.\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage is increased through profit or loss if it is determined during the coverage period that a group of contracts is onerous. The loss to be recognised is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage determined using the premium allocation approach and the (discounted) fulfilment cash flows that relate to remaining coverage determined using the general measurement approach.\n\nThe liability for incurred claims is measured using the fulfilment cash flows relating to claims incurred.

Derecognition also occurs in the event of modifications to the contract in the following cases:\n\n- The modified contract terms would have meant that at initial recognition\n\t- the modified contract would not have fallen within the scope of IFRS 17;\n\t- various components would have had to be separated from the host insurance contract, resulting in a different insurance contract;\n\t- the modified contract would have had a substantially different contract boundary; or\n\t- the modified contract would have been included in a different group of contracts.\n- There is a change in the contract category with or without direct participation features.\n- Due to the contract modifications, the criteria for applying the premium allocation approach are no longer met.\n\nFor contract modifications that do not result in derecognition, the changes in cash flows are treated as changes in estimated fulfilment cash flows. Exercising a right included in the terms of a contract is not a modification.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 213\n\nDisclosures in the consolidated balance sheet are made at portfolio level. The carrying amounts of the portfolios, depending on whether they represent an asset or a liability, are added up and accordingly disclosed separately. These disclosure criteria must also be applied to the reinsurance contracts held, which must also be reported separately from primary insurance. The respective carrying amounts of inward reinsurance are included in the primary insurance.\n\nThe amounts presented in consolidated profit or loss and in other comprehensive income are to be disaggregated into an insurance service result, comprising insurance revenue and insurance service expenses, and insurance finance income or expenses. Investment components may not be presented in insurance revenue or insurance service expenses.\n\nThe balances of reinsurance held are also recognised in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income separately from the primary insurance amounts. In contrast to primary insurance, there is an option to report the insurance service result for the reinsurance as a single amount. UNIQA makes use of this option.\n\nAll the changes in the risk adjustment of non-financial risk can be shown in the insurance service result. Disaggregation of the changes into an insurance service result and insurance finance income or expenses is not required. UNIQA makes use of this option.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Insurance revenue: contracts that are not measured using the premium allocation approach\n\nInsurance revenue represents the amount of consideration for the provision of services under insurance contracts and constitutes the change in the liability for remaining coverage. The expected consideration must cover the following items:\n\n- The claims expected for the reporting period at the beginning of the year and expenses allocated to the contracts. Amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage, repayments of investment components, insurance acquisition cash flows and transaction-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties (e.g. insurance tax) are excluded from this.\n- Change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. This does not include changes that relate to future service (adjustments to the carrying amount of the contractual service margin) or amounts allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage.\n- Amount of the contractual service margin recognised in profit or loss for the services provided in the period.\n- Experience adjustments for premium receipts that relate to current and past service.\n- The portion of the premium that relates to recovering insurance acquisition cash flows. The allocation is carried out pro rata temporis to the reporting period to be allocated. Assuming that insurance contracts are priced in such a way that the insurance acquisition cash flows are earned back, the same amount is also recognised as an insurance service expense.\n\n## Insurance revenue: contracts measured using the premium allocation approach\n\nWith the premium allocation approach, the insurance revenue of a period corresponds to the amount of the expected premium receipts in that period. To allocate the service provided under the insurance contract to the current period, the expected premium receipts are allocated on the basis of the passage of time.\n\n#### Insurance service expenses\n\nInsurance service expenses are recognised in profit or loss as soon as they are incurred and include:\n\n- incurred claims and other incurred insurance service expenses\n- amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows\n- loss components as well as reversals of these loss components\n- adjustments to the liability for incurred claims (except those adjustments arising from discounting)\n- Insurance service expenses shall not include any investment components.\n\n#### Insurance service result from reinsurance held\n\nThe insurance service result includes the amounts reimbursed by the reinsurer, the premiums allocated to the period, and any gains or losses from the change in the lossrecovery component.\n\n#### Insurance finance income or expenses\n\nChanges in the carrying amount resulting from the effect of changes in the time value of money and financial risk must be reported under insurance finance income or expenses.\n\nInsurance finance income or expenses also includes changes in the underlying items.\n\nFor both the general measurement model and the variable fee approach, the OCI option in accordance with IFRS 17.88(b) is applied where the respective allocated financial instruments on the asset side are also measured through other comprehensive income. This option is exercised at the level of the portfolio of insurance contracts. The amounts not recognised in other comprehensive income are determined by a systematic allocation over the duration of the group of insurance contracts and recognised in profit or loss.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor contracts measured using the general measurement model as well as the premium allocation approach, the discount rate determined at initial recognition (\"locked-in yield curve\") is applied.\n\n214\n\nInsurance revenue: contracts that are not measured us-\n\nInsurance service expenses\n\npenses\n\nnents\n\npenses.\n\nment components.\n\nrecovery component.\n\nas soon as they are incurred and include:\n\nInsurance service expenses are recognised in profit or loss\n\nincurred claims and other incurred insurance service ex-\n\nloss components as well as reversals of these loss compo-\n\nadjustments to the liability for incurred claims (except\n\nInsurance service expenses shall not include any invest-\n\nChanges in the carrying amount resulting from the effect of changes in the time value of money and financial risk must be reported under insurance finance income or ex-\n\nInsurance finance income or expenses also includes\n\nfee approach, the OCI option in accordance with\n\nFor both the general measurement model and the variable\n\nIFRS 17.88(b) is applied where the respective allocated financial instruments on the asset side are also measured through other comprehensive income.

Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are generally accounted for using the cost model.\n\nGains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded under the item \"Other non-technical income\", while losses are recorded under \"Other non-technical expenses\".\n\nIf the use of a property changes and an owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the property is reclassified as investment land and buildings with the carrying amount at the date of the change.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over a useful life for buildings of 15 to 80 years and for technical systems and operating and office equipment of 2 to 20 years. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed on every reporting date and adjusted if necessary. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit/(loss) for the period after cost sharing in the technical result and other non-insurance service expenses.\n\nThe exercise of the measurement option in accordance with IAS 16.29A in connection with initial application of IFRS 17 resulted in a transition from the cost model to fair value measurement for those properties that constitute underlying items in life and health insurance with participation features. Investment property is measured using the same model.\n\n## Leases\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 239\n\nThere are around 1,700 contracts throughout the entire Group which fall within the scope of the standard and for which UNIQA is lessee. Nearly all contracts are simple standard contracts. They mainly relate to real estate and in part to operating and office equipment. A significant portion of the capitalised rights of use consists of a small number of contracts concluded for an indefinite period. For these contracts, estimates were made on the basis of the most probable assumptions regarding the term and the exercise of termination options. The terms on which the calculation of these contracts is based are up to 50 years. The average term of the remaining contracts is between three and five years.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the liability consists of the risk-free interest rate adjusted for country risk, creditworthiness and a repayment factor.\n\nLeases with a contractual term of less than twelve months and low value assets were not recognised. Leases where the underlying asset value does not exceed a new value of €5 thousand and those with a contract term of less than twelve months were not recognised.\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Historical cost<br>In € thousand                                               | Land and<br>buildings for<br>own

In order to test the impairment for goodwill, the recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined. Impairment is recognised when the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its value to be covered, consisting of goodwill and the proportional net assets. The impairment of goodwill is recognised in profit/(loss) for the period under the item \"Amortisation of VBI and impairment of goodwill\".\n\n## Determination of the recoverable amount – significant estimates\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGUs with goodwill allocated is calculated on the basis of value in use by applying generally accepted measurement principles by means of the dividend discount method. The budget projections (detailed planning phase) of the CGUs, the estimate of the long-term net profits achievable by the CGUs and longterm growth rates (perpetuity) are used as the starting point for determination of the capitalised value.\n\nThe capitalised value is determined by discounting the future profits with a suitable capitalisation rate after assumed retention to strengthen the capital base. In the process, the capitalised values are separated by the three business lines, which are then totalled to yield the value for the CGU.\n\n#### Cash flow forecast (multi-phase model)\n\nPhase 1: five-year company planning\n\nThe detailed company planning generally encompasses a period of five years. The company plans used for the calculation are the result of a structured and standardised management dialogue. This includes an integrated reporting and documentation process and takes into account empirical values from previous planning periods as well as UNIQA's sustainability strategy and associated climaterelated aspects. The plans are formally approved by the Group Management Board and also include material assumptions regarding the combined ratio, capital earnings, market shares and the like.\n\n#### Phase 2: perpetuity growth rate\n\nThe last year of the detailed planning phase is used as the basis for determining cash flows in phase 2. The perpetuity growth rate is based on medium-term growth forecasts of the respective national economy. The underlying growth assumptions depend on the geographical location and range from 1 to 4 per cent. Various studies and statistical analyses were used as sources to provide a basis for determining the growth rates in order to consistently and realistically reflect the market situation and macroeconomic development. The reference sources include our own research, as well as country risks, growth rate estimations and multiples published by Damodaran (NYU Stern).\n\n#### Determining the capitalisation rate\n\nThe assumptions with regard to risk-free interest rate, market risk premium and business line betas made for determining the capitalisation rate are consistent with the\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nparameters used in the UNIQA planning and controlling process.

The betas for the non-life, life and health insurance business lines were determined using the revenues in the relevant business lines of the individual peer group companies. The health insurance business line, which is strongly focused on the Austrian market, is operated in a manner similar to life insurance. A uniform beta factor for personal insurance is therefore used in relation to the health and life insurance lines.\n\nIn Austrian measurement practice, the market risk premium is derived at the reporting date from the implied market return based on capital market data. The growth factor is derived in the same manner as the growth in the profit from ordinary activities in the impairment test.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 243\n\nAn additional country risk premium was defined in accordance with Professor Damodaran's models. The basic principles for calculation of the country risk premium in accordance with the Damodaran method are as follows: the spread of credit default swap spreads in a rating class of \"risk-free\" US government bonds is determined starting from the rating of the country concerned (Moody's). Then the spread is adjusted by the amount of the volatility difference between equity and bond markets.\n\nThe calculation also factored in the inflation differential for countries outside the eurozone. In general, the inflation differential represents inflation trends in different countries and is used as a key indicator in assessing competitiveness. In order to calculate the inflation differential, the deviation of the inflation forecast for the country of the CGU in question in relation to the inflation forecast for a risk-free environment (Germany, in this case) was used. This is adjusted annually in the detailed planning by the expected inflation, and is subsequently applied for perpetuity with the value of the last year of the detailed planning phase.\n\n| Capitalisation rate 2023                                        |  | Discount factor       |                  | Discount factor perpetuity |                  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| In per cent                                                     |  | Property/<br>casualty | Life &<br>health | Property/<br>casualty      | Life &<br>health |\n| Albania/Kosovo/North Macedonia as subgroup of the SIGAL Group1) |  | 14.2 – 15.2           | 14.5 – 15.5      | 13.4 – 15.7                | 13.7 – 16.7      |\n| Bulgaria                                                        |  | 10.0                  | 10.3             | 10.5                       | 10.7             |\n| Austria                                                         |  | 8.7                   | 8.7              | 8.7                        | 8.7              |\n| Poland                                                          |  | 12.3                  | 12.6             | 9.9                        | 10.2             |\n| Czechia                                                         |  | 10.1                  | 10.4             | 9.0                        | 9.3              |\n| Hungary                                                         |  | 14.0                  | 14.3             | 12.0                       | 12.3             |\n\n1) The discount rate ranges listed for the SIGAL Group relate to the spread over the respective countries grouped under these headings.\n\n| Capitalisation rate 2022                                        | Discount factor   |               | Discount factor perpetuity |               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| In per cent                                                     | Property/casualty | Life & health | Property/casualty          | Life & health |\n| Albania/Kosovo/North Macedonia as subgroup of the SIGAL Group1) | 11.8 – 13.9       | 12.1 – 14.1   | 14.5 – 17.1                | 14.8 – 17.1   |\n| Bulgaria                                                        | 9.1               | 9.3           | 11.1                       | 11.1          |\n| Austria                                                         | 9.0               | 9.3           | 9.0                        | 9.3           |\n| Poland                                                          | 16.9              | 17.1          | 10.3                       | 10.3          |\n| Czechia                                                         | 10.7              | 11.0          | 9.3                        | 9.6           |\n| Hungary                                                         | 17.7              | 17.9          | 12.8                       | 13.0          |\n\n1) The discount rate ranges listed for the SIGAL Group relate to the spread over the respective countries grouped under these headings.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Sensitivity analyses\n\nIn order to substantiate the results of the calculation and estimation of the value in use, sensitivity analyses with regard to the capitalisation rate and the main value drivers are performed.\n\nThese analyses show that sustained surpluses on the part of the individual CGUs are highly dependent on the actual development of these assumptions within the individual national or regional economies (GDP, insurance density, purchasing power parities particularly in the CEE markets) as well as the associated implementation of the individual profit goals. The biggest factor of uncertainty for the forecasts and the associated assessment of the future market situation is the further impact of the war in Ukraine and the consequences of the current phase of high interest rates.\n\nIn the event that the insurance markets develop very differently from the assumptions made in those business plans and forecasts, impairment losses may have to be recognised on the goodwill carried.\n\nA sensitivity analysis shows that only a combination of an interest rate increase of 100 bp and a simultaneous change in cash flows of –10 per cent would result in a shortfall in the value in use of €28.5 million for the CGU Poland and €3.2 million for the CGU Czechia. However, a change in only one of these two parameters does not result in a shortfall in the value in use.\n\n#### Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include both purchased and internally developed software, which is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life of 2 to 20 years.\n\nCosts that are incurred at the research stage for internally developed software are recognised through profit or loss for the period in which they were incurred. Costs that are incurred in the development phase are deferred provided that it is foreseeable that the software will be completed, there is the intention and ability for future internal use, and this will result in a future economic benefit.\n\nThe amortisation of other intangible assets is reported in the profit/(loss) for the period after cost sharing in the technical result and other non-insurance service expenses.\n\n#### Measurement of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of UNIQA's non-financial assets – excluding deferred tax assets – are reviewed at every reporting date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If this is the case, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The goodwill and intangible assets under development are tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs. If there is none, an annual test is done.\n\nImpairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. In the case of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that it does not increase the carrying amount of the asset above the carrying amount that would have been determined net of depreciation or amortisation had no impairment loss been recognised.\n\n## Value of business in force and non-insurance deferred acquisition costs\n\nThe values of life, property and casualty insurance policies in accordance with IFRS 17 as well as pension fund contracts relate to expected future margins from purchased operations. They are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The redemption of the current value of business in force follows the progression of the estimated gross margins. The amortisation of the value of business in force is recognised in the profit/(loss) for the period under \"Amortisation of VBI and impairment of goodwill\".\n\nDeferred acquisition costs not related to contracts are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15. These are essentially contracts for the management of pension and investment funds. They recognise costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been concluded. The amortisation is carried out pro rata temporis over the term of the underlying contracts.\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 245\n\n|

In January 2022, a decision was taken in Austria to reduce the corporate tax rate to 24 per cent in 2023 and to 23 per cent from 2024. Consequently, the reduced tax rates were taken into account for the calculation of deferred taxes – depending on the maturity. National tax regulations in conjunction with life insurance profit participation may lead to a different calculated income tax rate.\n\n| Reconciliation statement<br>In € thousand  | 1 – 12/2023 1 – 12/2022<br>restated |         |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Earnings before taxes                      | 426,373                             | 272,328 |\n| Expected tax expenses1)                    | 102,329                             | 68,082  |\n| Adjusted by tax effects from               |                                     |         |\n| Tax-free investment income                 | -21,901                             | -31,263 |\n| Amortisation of goodwill                   | 0                                   | 18      |\n| Tax-neutral consolidation effect           | -908                                | 3,270   |\n| Other non-deductible expenses/             |                                     |         |\n| other tax-exempt income                    | 2,431                               | -11,312 |\n| Changes in tax rates                       | 5,041                               | -15,442 |\n| Deviations in tax rates                    | -29,703                             | -4,435  |\n| Tax deducted at source                     | 1,255                               | 3,792   |\n| Taxes for previous years                   | 8,713                               | -1,318  |\n| Lapse/impairment of loss carryforwards and |                                     |         |\n| other                                      | 35,980                              | 5,550   |\n| Income tax expenses                        | 103,236                             | 16,941  |\n| Average effective tax burden               |                                     |         |\n| (in per cent)                              | 24.2                                | 6.2     |\n\n1) Earnings before taxes multiplied by the corporate income tax rate\n\n#### Group taxation\n\nIn Austria, UNIQA exercises the option of forming a group of companies for tax purposes. There are three taxable groups of companies with the parent groups UNIQA Insurance Group AG, PremiQaMed Holding GmbH and R-FMZ Immobilienholding GmbH.\n\nThe group members are generally charged, or relieved by, the corporation tax amounts attributable to them by the\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nparent groups through the distribution of their tax burden in the tax group. Losses from foreign group members are also included within the scope of taxable profits. The tax realisation for these losses is accompanied by a future tax obligation to pay income taxes at an unspecified point in time. A corresponding provision is therefore formed for future subsequent taxation of foreign losses.\n\n#### 12. Deferred taxes\n\nThe calculation of deferred taxes is based on the specific tax rates of each country, which were between 9 and 24 per cent in the financial year (2022: between 9 and 25 per cent).\n\nThe deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities stated in the consolidated statement of financial position performed as follows:\n\n## Net deferred tax In € thousand\n\n| In € thousand |\n|---------------|\n|               |\n\n| At 1 January 2022 restated                       | –53,673  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Changes recognised in profit/(loss)              | 52,224   |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income | 201,097  |\n| Foreign exchange differences                     | 1,014    |\n| At 31 December 2022 restated                     | 200,662  |\n| At 1 January 2023                                | 200,662  |\n| Changes recognised in profit/(loss)              | –65,543  |\n| Changes recognised in other comprehensive income | –202,546 |\n| Changes due to changes in basis of consolidation | –3,135   |\n| Reclassifications held for sale                  | –1,422   |\n| Foreign exchange differences                     | 65       |\n| At 31 December 2023                              | –71,918  |\n\nChanges recorded in other comprehensive income essentially relate to measurements of financial instruments and insurance and reinsurance contracts as well as remeasurements of defined benefit obligations.\n\nThe differences between the tax carrying amounts and the carrying amounts in the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position have the following effect:\n\n| In € thousand                                                |  | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022<br>restated |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--|------------|------------------------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                          |  |            |                        |\n| Technical items                                              |  | 89,939     | 180,791                |\n| Investments                                                  |  | 333,565    | 980,930                |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit<br>obligations |  | 42,590     | 33,832                 |\n| Loss carried forward                                         |  | 2,816      | 1,629                  |\n| Other items                                                  |  | 64,188     | 146,655                |\n| Total                                                        |  | 533,098    | 1,343,836              |\n| Netting effect                                               |  | -453,882   | -1,110,053             |\n| Total after netting                                          |  | 79,216     | 233,782                |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                     |  |            |                        |\n| Technical items                                              |  | 218,995    | 302,957                |\n| Investments                                                  |  | 96,070     | 716,927                |\n| Other items                                                  |  | 289,951    | 123,290                |\n| Total                                                        |  | 605,016    | 1,143,174              |\n| Netting effect                                               |  | -453,882   | -1,110,053             |\n| Total after netting                                          |  | 151,134    | 33,121                 |\n| Net deferred tax                                             |  | -71,918    | 200,662                |\n\nThe temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries and associates for which no deferred tax liabilities were recognised amounted to €1,741,860 thousand (2022: €1,604,193 thousand).\n\nAn assessment of the ability to realise deferred tax assets for tax losses not yet used, tax credits not yet used and deductible temporary differences requires an estimate of the amount of future taxable profits.

Defined benefit plans\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 249\n\nThere are individual contractual pension obligations, individual contractual bridge payments, and pension allowances in accordance with association recommendations.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit obligations is carried out annually using the projected unit credit (PUC) method. If the calculation results in a potential asset, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any economic benefit available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Any valid minimum funding requirements are included in the calculation of the present value of the economic benefit.\n\nRemeasurement of net liabilities from defined benefit plans are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The remeasurement includes the actuarial gains and losses, the income from plan assets (not including projected interest income) and the effect of any asset ceiling. Net interest expenses (income) on net liabilities (assets) from defined benefit plans are calculated for the reporting period by applying the discount rate. The discount rate was used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the start of the annual reporting period. This discount rate is applied to net liabilities (assets) from defined benefit plans on this date. Any changes in net liabilities (assets) from defined benefit plans resulting from contribution and benefit payments over the course of the reporting period are taken into account. Net interest expenses and other expenses for defined benefit plans are recognised through profit or loss in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\nIf a plan's defined benefits are changed or a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in the benefit relating to past service costs or the gain or loss on the curtailment is recognised directly in profit/(loss) for the period. Gains and losses from the settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of the settlement. The defined benefit obligations are presented under \"Other provisions\" in the statement of financial position.\n\n#### Pension entitlements\n\nIndividuals who hold an individual contractual agreement are generally entitled to a pension when they reach the age of 60 or 65, subject to certain conditions. The amount of the pension generally depends on the number of their years of service and their last salary before leaving their active employment. In the event of death, the spouse of\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe individual entitled to the claim receives a pension at 60 per cent, 50 per cent or 40 per cent depending on the policy. The pensions are suspended for any period in which a termination benefit is paid, and their value is generally guaranteed. The pensions that are based on individual policies or on association recommendations are financed through provisions. The final pension contribution which guarantees a fixed cash value for when the beneficiary begins their retirement is set aside during the contribution phase and transferred to the pension fund at the time of retirement. The financing is specified in the pension fund's business plan, in the works council agreement and in the pension fund contract.\n\n#### Termination benefit entitlements\n\nIn the case of employees of Austrian companies whose employment began prior to 31 December 2002 and lasted three years without interruption, the employee is entitled to termination benefits when the employment is terminated, unless the employee resigns, leaves without an important reason or is dismissed.\n\n| Defined benefit obligations<br>In € thousand                                     | Defined benefit<br>obligations

The beneficiaries are also entitled to a final pension fund contribution which guarantees them a fixed cash value when they begin their retirement. Since the first pension to be paid out to the beneficiaries has a fixed benefit amount, this commitment is to be classified as a defined benefit in the contribution phase. The works council agreement states the extent to which a final pension fund contribution is provided to the beneficiary's individual assurance cover account in the event of a transfer to the old-age pension or of an incapacity to work or the death of a participant.

The proportion of the share capital represented by newly acquired shares, together with the proportion of other treasury shares that the company has already acquired and still holds, may not exceed 10 per cent of the share capital. The authorisation to acquire treasury shares also includes the acquisition of shares in the company by subsidiaries of the company.\n\nThe treasury shares held via UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG stem from the merger of BL Syndikat Beteiligungs Gesellschaft m.b.H., the transferor, with UNIQA Insurance Group AG, the transferee, in 2016. These shares held are not to be counted towards the 10 per cent limit.\n\n## 18. Capital management\n\nCapital management takes place with due regard to the regulatory and statutory requirements. After Solvency II came into force on 1 January 2016, the definitions and methods used to calculate available own funds, as well as risk capital requirements and management standards, were replaced by Solvency II standards.\n\nThe eligible own funds comprise the consolidated Tier 1 capital, which essentially consisted of the subscribed share capital including the allocated share premium account and the reconciliation reserve. The Tier 2 capital consists entirely of subordinated liabilities. Tier 3 own fund items are mainly net deferred tax assets.\n\nIn the context of Group management, the appropriate coverage of the solvency capital requirement in accordance with Solvency II on a consolidated basis is constantly monitored. Active capital management is implemented in order to ensure that the individual Group companies and the Group as a whole have a reasonable capital base at all times. Aside from the five-year planning, another objective of active capital management is also to actively guarantee UNIQA's financial capacity, including under difficult economic conditions, in order to safeguard the continued existence of the insurance business.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory requirements to meet solvency capital/minimum capital requirements, UNIQA has also set itself a target capitalisation for the Group in the form of a solvency capital ratio – i.e. the eligible own funds in relation to the solvency capital requirement – of at least 170 per cent. The solvency capital ratio is managed using strategic measures which result in a reduction in the capital requirements and/or increase the amount of existing capital.\n\nUNIQA also takes the potential impact on the rating by recognised rating agencies into account in the capital management process. Standard & Poor's (S&P) currently applies a credit rating of “A–” to UNIQA Insurance Group AG. UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG and UNIQA Re AG each have a rating of \"A\". The supplementary capital bond issued in 2015 (initially: €500.0 million, open amount remaining: €326.3 million, Tier 2, first call\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\ndate: 27 July 2026), the bond issued in 2020 (€200.0 million, Tier 2, first call date: 9 July 2025) and the bond issued in 2021 (€375.0 million, Tier 2, first call date: 9 June 2031) are rated \"BBB\" by S&P.\n\n## 19.

Subordinated liabilities\n\nIn July 2013, UNIQA Insurance Group AG successfully placed a supplementary capital bond to the value of €350 million with institutional investors in Europe. The bond had a maturity period of 30 years and could only be terminated after ten years. The supplementary capital bond met the requirements for equity netting as Tier 2 capital under the Solvency II regime. Part of the bond – a nominal amount of €201.3 million – was refinanced on the capital market in December 2021 via a buy-back and new issue. The remaining portion of €148.7 million was repaid on the first termination date in July 2023.\n\nIn July 2015, UNIQA Insurance Group AG successfully placed a subordinated capital bond (Tier 2) to the value of €500 million with institutional investors in Europe. The bond is eligible for netting as Tier 2 capital under Solvency II. The bond is scheduled for repayment after a period of 31 years and subject to certain conditions, and can only be cancelled by UNIQA after eleven years have elapsed and under certain conditions. The coupon equals 6.00 per cent per annum during the first eleven years. After that a variable interest rate applies. The bond has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since July 2015. The issue price was set at 100 per cent.\n\nIn July 2020 a subordinated bond was also issued in the amount of €200 million at an issue price of 99.507 per cent of the nominal amount. With a term of 15.25 years, it can be terminated for the first time at any time between 9 July 2025 and 9 October 2025, subject to certain conditions. The annual interest rate is fixed at 3.25 per cent for the first 5.25 years. After that a variable interest rate applies. The bond is eligible for netting as Tier 2 capital under Solvency II. By issuing a green bond, UNIQA has committed to finance or refinance suitable assets in accordance with the Green Bond Framework at the same level as the issue proceeds. The bond issue has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since July 2020.\n\nUNIQA repurchased subordinated bonds with a total nominal value of €375 million in December 2021. The buyback relates to €201.3 million subordinated bonds placed in 2013 and €173.7 million subordinated bonds placed in 2015. At the same time, a new subordinated bond with a nominal amount of €375 million was placed. This bond is scheduled for repayment after a period of 20 years subject to certain conditions and can be cancelled by UNIQA for the first time at any time between 9 June 2031 and 9 December 2031, under certain conditions. The interest rate is fixed at 2.375 per cent per annum over the first ten years. A variable interest rate applies after this period. The issue price was set at 99.316 per cent of the nominal amount. The subordinated bond is eligible as Tier 2 basic own funds in accordance with the regulatory requirements. By issuing a green bond, UNIQA has committed to making investments in accordance with the Green Bond Framework at the same level as the issue proceeds.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 257\n\n## 21.

Remuneration for the Management Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe members of the Management Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG assume a dual operational role in their function, as they also hold the Management Board function at UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG. This identical composition of the Management Board in both companies enables efficient control of the UNIQA Group. Since 1 July 2020 all employment contracts of the members of the Management Board have been with UNIQA Insurance Group AG, which has paid out all remuneration since this\n\n# date.

For the 2021 financial year, payments of €1,102 thousand are expected in 2025. For the 2022 financial year, payments of €1,102 thousand are expected in 2026. For the 2023 financial year, payments of €4,258 thousand are expected to be made in the subsequent years 2024 and 2027.\n\nAs part of the multi-year share-based remuneration (longterm incentive plan (LTI), payments amounting to €1,327 thousand were made to the members of the Management Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG in 2023 from the 2019 LTI allocation. For the subsequent years 2024 to 2027, a payment of €5,590 thousand is expected for the virtual shares allocated up to 31 December 2023.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 259\n\nFor pension commitments and pension liability insurance to cover these commitments for the members of the Management Board, a total of €896 thousand was paid in the reporting year (2022: €1,059 thousand). The pension liability insurance premium amounts to €332 thousand (2022: €279 thousand). The amount expended on pensions in the reporting year for former members of the Management Board and their surviving dependents was €2,147 thousand (2022: €1,964 thousand).\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board for their work in the 2022 financial year was €1,152 thousand. Provisions of €1,180 thousand have been recognised for the remuneration to be paid for their work in the 2023 financial year. Daily allowances and cash expenses that were paid out in the financial year totalled €148 thousand (2022: €72 thousand). Since 14 April 2020, the members of the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Insurance Group AG who are also members of the Supervisory Board of UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG have received their daily allowances and remuneration exclusively from UNIQA Insurance Group AG despite their dual function. These daily allowances and remunerations therefore also cover the Supervisory Board activities at UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 27. Share-based payment agreement with cash settlement\n\nA share-based remuneration programme has been in place for the members of the Management Boards of UNIQA Insurance Group AG and UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG since the 2013 financial year. As part of this programme, UNIQA virtual shares are granted conditionally for each financial year on the basis of allocation values defined in the service contract, based on the average price of UNIQA ordinary shares in the period of six months prior to the start of the performance period. Cash payments subject to agreed limits are provided for at the end of a performance period of four years for the individual annual tranches or depending on certain performance targets.\n\nThe selected key performance targets aim to ensure a relative market-based performance measurement and an absolute performance measurement depending on UNIQA's company-specific targets. The performance targets, including performance periods up to 2022, comprised the total shareholder return (TSR) of UNIQA ordinary shares compared to the TSR of the shares in the companies on the DJ EURO STOXX TMI Insurance, the net combined ratio (CoR) in UNIQA's property and casualty insurance segment and the return on risk capital (RoRC: the return on economically required capital), with these targets each weighted equally by one-third to determine overall target achievement.\n\nUnder IFRS 9/17, which will apply from the 2023 financial year, the CoR target will no longer be shown. For performance periods from 2023 onwards, two ESG targets were therefore included in the LTI programmes instead of the CoR target. These are the \"Weighted Average Carbon Intensity\" (WACI), which aims to reduce the average emissions intensity of the companies in UNIQA's asset portfolio, and the \"Science Based Target Initiative\" (SBTi), which aims to increase the proportion of companies in UNIQA's asset portfolio that have undertaken commitments to reduce emissions. Only direct investments by UNIQA in the relevant companies in the asset portfolio are involved here. The two ESG targets are each weighted at 20per cent to determine overall target achievement. The TSR and RoRC targets will be reduced from one-third each to 30per cent each.\n\nA transitional regulation applies to the LTI programme for 2020, 2021 and 2022. The annual target achievement(s) of the CoR target (until 2022) and the annual target achievement(s) of the two ESG targets from 2023 (within the four-year overall performance period) are determined and\n\nan average of these three key figures is calculated, which is weighted by one-third to determine the overall target achievement. The TSR and RoRC targets each have an unchanged weighting of one-third.\n\nThe programme stipulates annual investments in UNIQA shares with a holding period also of four years in each case.\n\nThe cash settlement is calculated as follows for each tranche of shares: payment =  $A \\times B \\times C$ \n\nA = number of virtual shares awarded for the performance period.\n\nB = average price of the UNIQA ordinary share in the period of six months before the end of the performance period.\n\nC = degree of target achievement at the end of the performance period for the targets mentioned above. The maximum target achievement is 200 per cent.\n\nThe fair value on the date that share-based payment awards are granted is recognised as expense over the period in which the unconditional entitlement to the award is obtained. The fair value is based on expectations with respect to achievement of the defined key performance targets. Changes in measurement assumptions result in an adjustment of the recognised provision amounts affecting income. Obligations from share-based remuneration are stated under \"Other provisions\".\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 a total of 1,215,805 virtual shares (2022: 1,167,795 shares) were relevant for the measurement. The fair value of share-based remuneration (excluding non-wage labour costs) at the reporting date amounts to €5,590 thousand (2022: 4,420 thousand).\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 28.

Expenses for the auditor of the financial statements\n\nThe statutory auditor fees in the financial year were €2,159 thousand (2022: €2,752 thousand); of which €538 thousand (2022: €712 thousand) is attributable to the annual audit, €1,564 thousand (2022: €2,030 thousand) to other auditing services and €57 thousand (2022: €10 thousand) to other general services.\n\n## 31. Consolidation principles\n\n#### Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by UNIQA. A company is considered to be controlled if:\n\n- UNIQA is able to exercise power over the relevant entity,\n- UNIQA is exposed to fluctuating returns from the participation and\n- the level of returns can be influenced due to the power exercised.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control begins until the date control ends.\n\n## Loss of control\n\nIf UNIQA loses control over a subsidiary, the subsidiary's assets and liabilities and all associated non-controlling interests and other equity components are deleted from the accounts. Any resulting profit or loss is recognised in profit/(loss) for the period. Any retained interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date of the loss of control.\n\n## Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are all the entities over which UNIQA has significant influence but does not exercise control or joint control over their financial and operating policies. This is generally the case as soon as there is a voting share of between 20 and 50 per cent or a comparable significant influence is guaranteed legally or in practice via other contractual regulations. Inclusion in the basis of consolidation is based on the proportionate equity (equity method).\n\n## Pension and investment funds\n\nControlled pension and investment funds are included in the consolidation unless the relevant fund volumes were considered to be immaterial when viewed separately and as a whole. A fund is regarded as controlled if:\n\n- UNIQA determines the relevant activities of the fund, such as the definition of the investment strategy and short- and medium-term investment decisions,\n- UNIQA has the risk of and the rights to variable successes of the fund in the form of distributions and participates in the performance of the fund assets and\n- the determining power over the relevant activities is exercised in the interest of UNIQA by determining the investment objectives and the individual investment decisions.\n- \n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Basis of consolidation 31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n262\n\nsory Board.\n\nties\n\nTransactions with related persons In € thousand\n\nCompensation on termination of employment\n\nOptions to purchase granted\n\nthe current shareholders' agreement.\n\n€10 thousand) to other general services.\n\n31.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition and the identifiable net assets acquired are measured at fair value. Any profit from an acquisition at a price below the fair value of the net assets is recognised directly in profit/(loss) for the period. Transaction costs are recognised as expenses immediately.\n\nThe consideration transferred does not include any amounts associated with the fulfilment of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit/(loss) for the period.\n\nAny contingent obligation to pay consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not revalued, and a settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, later changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the profit/(loss) for the period.\n\n## 32. Basis of consolidation\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 263\n\n## Initial consolidation\n\nUNIQA Real Estate Beteiligungsverwaltung International GmbH (Vienna) was included in the consolidated financial statements for the first time in the second quarter of 2023 and DOROS Immobilien GmbH (Vienna) in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Restructuring processes\n\nIn the third quarter, PremiaFIT GmbH (Vienna) was split and incorporated into PremiQaMed Holding GmbH (Vienna) and PremiQaMed Immobilien GmbH (Vienna).\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn 30 November 2023, UNIQA acquired 65.4 per cent of the shares in Telemedi Sp. z o.o. (Poland, Warsaw) and 100 per cent of the capital shares in each of its subsidiaries Telemedicin Sp. z o.o. (Poland, Warsaw), Przychodnia24 sp. z o.o. (Poland, Warsaw) and Telemedico Spain SL (Spain, Madrid) (referred to jointly as the \"Telemedi Group\" below). Together with the 10.4 per cent already held, UNIQA now holds 75.8 per cent of the capital shares. An \"option agreement\" was concluded with the minority shareholder for the acquisition of the remaining 24.2 per cent with an exercise period of two or three years, according to which the capital shares can be acquired in accordance with an agreed purchase price formula. However, the structure of this means that for the purposes of consolidated accounting in accordance with IAS/IFRS provisions, the Group is already included 100 per cent and no minority interests need to be reported. Future payments resulting from the option agreement are recognised as current expenses in the exercise period in accordance with IAS/IFRS provisions – as 100% have already been recognised in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Telemedi Group constitutes a business operation within the meaning of IFRS 3. The companies were acquired in order to expand the portfolio in the healthcare sector.\n\nThe companies are recognised in the \"Group functions\" segment and in the health insurance business line.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Assets and liabilities from business\n\n## combinations at acquisition date In € thousand\n\n264\n\n| Property, plant and equipment                         | 2      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Intangible assets                                     | 16,972 |\n| Investments                                           | 3      |\n| Receivables and other assets                          | 1,890  |\n| Cash                                                  | 2,794  |\n| Total assets                                          | 21,661 |\n| Liabilities and other items classified as liabilities | 1,249  |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                              | 3,143  |\n| Total liabilities                                     | 4,392  |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired                      | 17,268 |\n\n## Preliminary differential amount In € thousand\n\n| Transferred of consideration                   | 27,376 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Net identifiable assets acquired at fair value | 17,268 |\n| Preliminary differential amount                | 10,108 |\n\n## Consideration transferred In € thousand\n\n| Contractually agreed purchase price                   | 27,376 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Price paid1)                                          | 27,376 |\n| Acquired bank balances                                | -2,794 |\n| Consideration transferred less acquired bank balances | 24,583 |\n\n1) The acquisition price was settled in full through the transfer of cash.\n\nNo revenue or earnings were contributed to UNIQA's profit/(loss) for the period in the 2023 financial year. If the acquisition had already taken place on 1 January 2023, profit/(loss) for the period (the share attributable to the shareholders of UNIQA Insurance Group AG) would amount to around €304,252 thousand and earnings per share would remain unchanged due to the low earnings contribution. Other non-technical income would amount to €447,591 thousand if the acquisition had already taken place on 1 January 2023 due to the revenue contribution of the Telemedi Group.\n\n####

Risk strategy\n\n## Principles\n\nUNIQA's strategic objectives are directly linked to the company's risk strategy. The cornerstones of the risk strategy are based on the business strategy and the risks it entails. A clear definition of the risk preference creates the foundation for all business policy decisions.\n\n## Organisation\n\nUNIQA's core business is to relieve customers of risk, pool the risk to reduce it and thereby generate profit for the company. The focus is on understanding risks and their particular features. To ensure a strong focus on risk, UNIQA has created a separate risk function on the Group's Management Board with a Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who is also acting concurrently as Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In the Group companies, the Chief Risk Officer is also a part of the Management Board. This ensures that decision-making is risk-based in all relevant bodies. UNIQA has established processes that make it possible to identify, analyse and manage risks.\n\nThe risk profile is regularly validated at all levels of the hierarchy and discussions are held in specially instituted committees with the members of the Management Board. Internal and external sources are consulted to obtain a complete picture of the risk situation. UNIQA regularly checks for new threats both in the Group and in the subsidiaries.\n\n## Risk-bearing capacity and risk appetite\n\nUNIQA assumes risk in full awareness of its risk-bearing capacity. This is defined as the capacity to absorb potential losses from extreme events so that medium- and longterm objectives are not jeopardised.\n\nThe Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is at the centre of risk-related decisions. The SCR corresponds to a company-specific risk assessment based on a partial internal model for market risks and non-life risks, as well as on the standard model according to Solvency II for the other risk categories. As such, it corresponds to the regulatory risk calculations under the Solvency II framework. Based on this approach, we aim to achieve a solvency capital ratio above 170 per cent. Immediate steps will be taken to improve the capital position if the marginal value falls below 135 per cent.\n\nNon-quantifiable risks, in particular operational risk, litigation risk and strategic risk are identified and assessed as part of the risk assessment process. This assessment is then used as the basis for implementing any necessary risk mitigation measures.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 269\n\nUNIQA's risk strategy specifies the risks the company intends to assume and those it plans to avoid. Within the scope of the strategy process, risk appetite is defined based on UNIQA's risk-bearing capacity. This risk appetite is then used to determine tolerances and limits, which provide a sufficient early warning system for the company to initiate prompt corrective action in the event of any deviation from targets. UNIQA counters risks that fall outside the defined risk appetite, such as reputational risk, with proactive measures, transparency and careful assessment.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nRisk also means opportunity. UNIQA regularly analyses trends and risks that influence society and thus the customers and UNIQA itself. Employees throughout the company are involved in order to recognise and analyse trends at an early stage, produce suitable action plans and develop innovative approaches.\n\n## 35. Risk management system\n\nThe focus of risk management with management structures and defined processes is the attainment of UNIQA's and its Group companies' strategic goals.\n\nUNIQA's Risk Management Guidelines form the basis for a uniform standard at various company levels. The guidelines are approved by the CFO/CRO and the Group Executive Board and describe the minimum requirements in terms of organisational structure and process structure.\n\nIn addition to the Group Risk Management Guidelines, similar guidelines have also been prepared and approved for the Group companies. The Risk Management Guidelines at company level were approved by the Management Board of the UNIQA Group companies and are consistent with UNIQA's Risk Management Guidelines.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Organisational structure (governance)\n\nThe detailed setup of the process and organisational structure of risk management is set out in UNIQA's Risk Management Guidelines. They reflect the principles embodied in the concept of \"three lines\" and the clear differences between the individual \"lines\".\n\n## First line: risk management within the business activity\n\nThose responsible for business activities must develop and put into practice an appropriate risk control environment to identify and monitor the risks that arise in connection with the business and processes.\n\n## Second line: supervisory functions including risk management functions\n\nThe risk management function and the supervisory functions, such as controlling, must monitor business activities without encroaching on operational activities.\n\n#### Third line: internal audit\n\nThis enables an independent review of the formation and effectiveness of the entire internal control system, which comprises risk management and compliance (e.g. internal auditing).\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 271\n\nImage /page/206/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of the UNIQA risk management structure. The diagram is organized vertically, with the UNIQA Holding Management Board at the top, followed by UNIQA Holding CFO/CRO, Group Risk Committee, Group Risk Management, UNIQA Insurance Business Unit (CRO, RM), and Local Risk Committees at the bottom. Arrows connect the boxes, indicating the flow of information and authority. Each box contains a list of responsibilities or functions. The UNIQA Holding Management Board is responsible for active risk management, approving the UNIQA risk management strategy, approving risk limits, and making decisions regarding risk transfer and mitigation. The UNIQA Holding CFO/CRO is responsible for functional management of the UNIQA risk management unit, chairing the UNIQA Risk Management Committee, shaping the risk management strategy, monitoring the overall risk situation, and providing appropriate structures for risk management and reporting. The Group Risk Committee is responsible for defining the risk management strategy, preparing and monitoring risk-bearing capacity and risk limits, defining capital allocation, and approving model changes. The Group Risk Management is responsible for defining the UNIQA risk management process, conducting the uniform risk management process, coordinating the calculation of solvency capital requirements, defining minimum standards for risk management processes, ensuring effective reporting of risk management information, and preparing and monitoring risk limits. The UNIQA Insurance Business Unit (CRO, RM) is responsible for conducting the uniform UNIQA risk management process, preparing and maintaining minimum standards for risk management processes, preparing and monitoring risk limits, and monitoring overall risk management performance. The Local Risk Committees are not described in detail.\n\ntimely reporting\n\nThe relevant responsibilities are shown accordingly in the overview above.

They are not considered as a separate risk category, but are taken into account as part of the existing ten risk categories. Climate change represents the central sustainability risk with respect to the environmental sustainability factor. Climate-related risks arise in the form of physical risks and transition risks.\n\nPhysical risks arise from the increase in extreme weather events such as floods, earthquakes, storms and heat waves, as well as the rise in average temperature. Transition risks on the other hand are adjustment risks that arise from the transition to a low-carbon economy. These include e.g. risks associated with the change in climate policy, the renewal of technologies and the change in market preferences. In addition to the effect of physical risks on the frequency and amount of claims, there may be further effects from transition risks on UNIQA's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss, particularly in connection with the capital investment strategy pursued.\n\nRisk identification is the starting point for the risk management process, systematically recording all major risks and describing them in as much detail as possible. In order to conduct as complete a risk identification as possible, different approaches are used in parallel, and all risk categories, subsidiaries, processes and systems are included.\n\nThe risk categories of market risk, underwriting risks and default risk are evaluated at UNIQA by means of quantitative methods either based on the Solvency II standard approach or the partial internal model (for non-life or market risks). Furthermore, risk drivers are identified for the results from the standard approach and analysed to assess whether the risk situation is adequately represented (in accordance with the Company's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)). All other risk categories are evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively with their own risk scenarios.\n\n### 36. Activities and objectives in 2023\n\nBased on external and internal developments, activities in 2023 focused on the following:\n\nrising inflation\n\nsustainability (ESG)\n\nsecurity & resilience management\n\n#### Rising inflation\n\nThe global macroeconomy experienced turbulence in 2023 due to a variety of factors such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and rising inflation. Central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB) responded to this situation by raising interest rates. The financial markets reacted sensitively to these interest rate adjustments, and the value of both bonds and equities fell. With regard to UNIQA, inflation had a negative impact on the best estimate reserves in long-term business lines. Rising costs due to inflation and the more attractive alternative investment opportunities increased the lapse risk. Various inflation scenarios were analysed, highlighting potentially significant effects. Effective loss minimisation techniques were developed and implemented. UNIQA adjusted the reserves on a quarterly basis and created special inflation reserves in some regions.\n\n#### Sustainability (ESG)\n\nIn the area of sustainability, UNIQA focused its main objectives on complying with regulatory requirements and further developing risk management activities. For one thing, work was carried out on the development of longterm climate scenarios. Physical and transitory climate risks in the UNIQA Group were analysed. Early identification of sustainability risks and raising awareness of ESG risks in the organisation were other focal points. UNIQA also worked on integrating ESG data into its IT risk analysis software to enable daily monitoring of ESG-related key figures.\n\n#### Security & resilience management\n\nCompanies are increasingly facing a range of security risks, including data theft, ransomware attacks and potential power outages. In 2023, in addition to preventive measures in the areas of information security and physical security, UNIQA placed particular emphasis on preparing for the possible effects of an energy crisis. Action plans have already been developed as part of this focal area and employees have been trained accordingly. In 2023, these action plans were prepared for all of UNIQA's other operationally important sites internationally. The plans include both preventive and reactive measures to prepare UNIQA in the best possible way for large-scale power outages, announced power outages or brownouts.\n\n## 37. Challenges and priorities in risk management for 2024\n\nSustainability (ESG)\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn recent years, UNIQA has created a solid foundation for managing sustainability risks. There are several areas of emphasis for 2024. Early identification of sustainability risks will continue to be a key approach. The aim is to recognise and address potential causes in operational risk management at an early stage and to continuously monitor industry regulations and best practices. UNIQA will adapt its risk management strategies with the latest information on new sustainability guidelines and regulations. The development of climate scenarios will be expanded. This will also include quantitative estimates for areas that have not yet been fully analysed. A comprehensive understanding of the effects of different climate scenarios will enable UNIQA to be better prepared for long-term climate-related risks. Implementation of changes in legislation is essential for sustainability risk management. UNIQA will disclose new key indicators for physical and transitory risks and perform a materiality analysis to review regulatory requirements and their financial implications. The goal here is to further develop limit monitoring through additional automation of data analysis. This will enable a more comprehensive assessment of sustainability risks and promote responsible investment practices.\n\n#### Full internal model\n\n272\n\nnarios.\n\nA Group-wide, standardised risk management process regularly identifies, evaluates and reports on risks to UNIQA and its Group companies within these risk categories.\n\nsecurity & resilience management\n\ninflation reserves in some regions.\n\nSecurity & resilience management\n\nnounced power outages or brownouts.\n\n37.

In 2024, the project will focus on implementing the full internal model in the defined lines of business, as originally planned. However, there will be no regulatory review or approval activities. An alternative date for the application of the full internal model is currently unknown. For the time being, UNIQA will only use the model for internal purposes.\n\n#### Cyber risk\n\nThe increasing dependence on digital technologies and the associated cyber threats is proving to be a constantly growing risk for UNIQA. As a result, UNIQA has developed a holistic cyber security strategy that includes various measures.\n\nThese include regular reviews of the IT infrastructure, implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA), introduction of a security information and event management system (SIEM) and training for employees. Despite these measures, UNIQA is aware that cyber risks are extremely dynamic and require continuous monitoring and adjustments.\n\n### Capital market environment and inflation\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 273\n\nInflation and its impact on insurance companies in 2024 is a topic of particular importance. In view of the developments in interest rates, credit spreads and similar factors, UNIQA and its products will continue to be significantly affected by this. The topic of inflation will also be very important for as long as the observed inflation rates remain high. It is therefore necessary to identify the potential impact of all these risks on the various business lines at an early stage and take appropriate steps. Overall, inflation in 2024 will require UNIQA to plan carefully, adapt and be flexible in order to meet customer needs and still remain profitable.\n\n## 38. Risk profile\n\nUNIQA's risk profile is very heavily influenced by the life and health insurance portfolios of UNIQA Österreich Versicherungen AG. This situation means that market risk plays a central role in UNIQA's risk profile.\n\nThe Group companies in Central Europe operate in the property and casualty business lines as well as in the life and health insurance business lines. In the CEE region, the property and casualty sectors are the most dominant.\n\nThis structure is important to UNIQA because it offers a high level of diversification from the life and health insurance lines that dominate in the Austrian companies.\n\nThe distinctive risk features of the regions are also reflected in the risk profiles determined by using the internal measurement approach.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Market and credit risk\n\nThe strength of the market and credit risks depends on the structure of the capital investment and its allocation to the different asset categories. The table below shows investments classified by asset category.\n\n| Asset allocation<br>In € thousand   | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Fixed-income securities             | 13,296,476 | 12,442,409 |\n| Real estate assets                  | 2,411,947  | 2,372,793  |\n| Pension fund                        | 1,808,177  | 1,928,801  |\n| Equity investments and other stocks | 1,022,366  | 882,288    |\n| Shares and equity funds             | 1,276,852  | 1,156,693  |\n| Time deposits                       | 520,399    | 461,531    |\n| Other investments                   | 95,660     | 131,479    |\n| Total                               | 20,431,878 | 19,375,995 |\n\nHowever, the market and credit risks not only have an impact on the value of investments, but also influence the level of technical liabilities. Thus, there is – particularly in life insurance – a dependence between the (price) growth of assets and liabilities from insurance contracts. UNIQA manages the income expectations and risks of assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts as part of the asset liability management (ALM) process. The objective is to ensure sufficient liquidity while retaining the greatest possible security and balanced risk in order to achieve a return on capital that is sustainably higher than the guaranteed performance of the technical liabilities. To do this, assets and liabilities are allocated to different accounting groups.\n\nThe following two tables show the main accounting groups generated by the various product categories.\n\n| Assets<br>In € thousand                                                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Long-term life insurance contracts with<br>guaranteed interest and profit participation | 10,515,489 | 10,248,697 |\n| Long-term unit-linked and index-linked life<br>insurance contracts                      | 4,291,320  | 4,067,603  |\n| Long-term health insurance contracts                                                    | 5,046,235  | 4,568,680  |\n| Short-term property and casualty insurance<br>contracts                                 | 5,884,178  | 5,552,889  |\n| Total                                                                                   | 25,737,221 | 24,437,868 |\n| In   € thousand                                                                         |            |            |\n| Long-term life insurance contracts with<br>guaranteed interest and profit participation | 9,865,889  | 10,507,775 |\n| Long-term unit-linked and index-linked life<br>insurance contracts                      | 3,919,669  | 3,659,386  |\n| Long-term health insurance contracts                                                    | 3,644,153  | 3,317,023  |\n| Short-term property and casualty insurance<br>contracts                                 | 3,915,834  | 3,437,208  |\n| Total                                                                                   | 21,345,545 | 20,921,392 |\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\n- Land and buildings for own use\n- Investment property\n- Financial assets accounted for using the equity method\n- Other investments\n- Unit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments Cash\n\n#### Net liabilities of insurance and reinsurance contracts In € thousand 31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\n- Liabilities arising from insurance contracts\n- Assets arising from insurance contracts\n- Liabilities arising from reinsurance contracts\n- Assets arising from reinsurance contracts\n\nFurthermore, the net liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts are shown in the following two tables, broken down by region and, for property and casualty insurance, by business line.\n\n#### Net liabilities of insurance and reinsurance contracts (by region) In € thousand 31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n| Austria (AT)                                     | 17,993,912 | 17,692,028 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Central Europe (CE)                              | 2,691,031  | 2,349,497  |\n| Eastern Europe (EE)                              | 133,674    | 133,862    |\n| Russia (RU)                                      | 0          | 259,455    |\n| Southeastern Europe (SEE)                        | 725,709    | 695,670    |\n| Western Europe (WE)                              | -198,782   | -209,121   |\n| Net liabilities in disposal groups held for sale | 0          | 0          |\n| Total                                            | 21,345,545 | 20,921,392 |\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Net liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts in property and casualty insurance (by business line) In € thousand\n\n274\n\nMarket and credit risk\n\nAsset allocation In € thousand \n\ngroups.\n\nAssets In € thousand \n\nments classified by asset category.\n\nThe strength of the market and credit risks depends on the structure of the capital investment and its allocation to the different asset categories.

To do this, assets and liabilities are allocated to different accounting\n\nThe following two tables show the main accounting groups\n\nguaranteed interest and profit participation 10,515,489 10,248,697\n\ninsurance contracts 4,291,320 4,067,603 Long-term health insurance contracts 5,046,235 4,568,680\n\ncontracts 5,884,178 5,552,889 Total 25,737,221 24,437,868\n\ngenerated by the various product categories.\n\nLong-term life insurance contracts with\n\nLong-term unit-linked and index-linked life\n\nShort-term property and casualty insurance\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\nFinancial assets accounted for using the equity method\n\nUnit-linked and index-linked life insurance investments\n\nguaranteed interest and profit participation 9,865,889 10,507,775\n\ninsurance contracts 3,919,669 3,659,386 Long-term health insurance contracts 3,644,153 3,317,023\n\ncontracts 3,915,834 3,437,208 Total 21,345,545 20,921,392\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nLand and buildings for own use\n\nNet liabilities of insurance and\n\nLong-term life insurance contracts with\n\nLong-term unit-linked and index-linked life\n\nShort-term property and casualty insurance\n\nsurance, by business line.\n\nNet liabilities of insurance and reinsurance contracts (by region) In € thousand\n\nThese values refer to the following items:\n\n Liabilities arising from insurance contracts Assets arising from insurance contracts Liabilities arising from reinsurance contracts Assets arising from reinsurance contracts\n\nFurthermore, the net liabilities from insurance and reinsurance contracts are shown in the following two tables, broken down by region and, for property and casualty in-\n\nAustria (AT) 17,993,912 17,692,028 Central Europe (CE) 2,691,031 2,349,497 Eastern Europe (EE) 133,674 133,862 Russia (RU) 0 259,455 Southeastern Europe (SEE) 725,709 695,670 Western Europe (WE) – 198,782 – 209,121 Net liabilities in disposal groups held for sale 0 0 Total 21,345,545 20,921,392\n\nInvestment property\n\nOther investments\n\nreinsurance contracts In € thousand \n\nCash\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n| Property insurance<br>(fire and household insurance) | 604,160   | 882,889   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Liability insurance                                  | 910,313   | 554,304   |\n| Motor TPL insurance                                  | 1,363,982 | 1,149,232 |\n| Other motor insurance                                | 305,368   | 476,401   |\n| Credit insurance                                     | 26,813    | -12,314   |\n| Legal expense insurance                              | 145,994   | 150,275   |\n| Technology insurance                                 | 87,971    | -50,130   |\n| Transport insurance                                  | 61,073    | -51,697   |\n| Casualty insurance                                   | 346,721   | 303,343   |\n| Other forms of insurance                             | 63,438    | 34,905    |\n| Total                                                | 3,915,834 | 3,437,208 |\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\nThe market and credit risk is broken down into interest rate, credit spread, equity, currency and market concentration risk.\n\nThe interest rate risk arises on all asset and liability items of the statement of financial position whose value fluctuates as a result of changes in risk-free yield curves or associated volatility. Given the high proportion of interestbearing securities in the assets, interest rate risk forms an important part of market risk. The interest rate risk is actively managed as part of the ALM-based investment strategy.\n\nThe following table shows the maturity structure of fixedincome securities.\n\n| Exposure by term<br>In € thousand | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Up to 1 year                      | 598,058    | 546,464    |\n| More than 1 year up to 3 years    | 1,612,605  | 1,678,491  |\n| More than 3 years up to 5 years   | 1,906,495  | 1,894,720  |\n| More than 5 years up to 7 years   | 1,750,013  | 1,858,520  |\n| More than 7 years up to 10 years  | 2,219,369  | 1,809,533  |\n| More than 10 years up to 15 years | 1,645,037  | 1,886,347  |\n| More than 15 years                | 3,564,899  | 2,768,334  |\n| Total                             | 13,296,476 | 12,442,409 |\n\nSince the interest rate risk is particularly relevant in life insurance as a result of the long-term liabilities, the focus below is placed on this business line.\n\nThe difference between the change in assets and the change in technical provisions resulting from a change in interest rates is used as the basis for managing the interest rate risk and/or the duration gap. During the annual ALM process, it is determined from a strategic point of view which budgets for interest rate risk can be accepted at the operating company level.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 275\n\nThe discount rate that may be used in the costing when\n\n#### Average technical discount rates, core business by region and currency In per cent EUR USD Local currency\n\n| In per cent               |     |     |     |\n|---------------------------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Austria (AT)              | 2.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Central Europe (CE)       | 2.6 | 0.0 | 3.4 |\n| Eastern Europe (EE)       | 3.2 | 3.3 | 2.8 |\n| Southeastern Europe (SEE) | 2.7 | 3.2 | 2.1 |\n| Russia (RU)               | 2.4 | 2.4 | 3.8 |\n\nAs these interest rates are guaranteed by the insurance company, the financial risk lies in not being able to generate these returns. Since conventional life insurance business predominantly invests in interest-bearing securities, the unpredictability of long-term interest rate trends is the most significant financial risk for a life insurance company. Investment and reinvestment risk arises from the fact that premiums received in the future must be invested to achieve the rate of return guaranteed when a policy is written. However, it is entirely possible that no appropriate securities will be available at the time the premium is received. Likewise, future income must be reinvested to achieve a return equivalent to at least the original discount rate. For this reason, UNIQA has already decided to only offer products in its key markets that are based on a low or zero discount rate. One example of this in Austria is the sale of deferred pension products with a discount rate of 0 per cent.\n\nThe credit spread risk refers to the risk of changes in the price of asset or liability items in the statement of\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nfinancial position, as a consequence of changes in credit risk premiums or associated volatility, and is ascertained for individual securities in accordance with their rating and duration. When investing in securities, UNIQA chooses securities with a wide variety of ratings, taking into consideration the potential risks and returns.\n\nThe following table shows the credit quality of those fixedincome securities that are neither overdue nor written down, based on their ratings.\n\n## Exposure by rating In € thousand\n\n31/12/2023 31/12/2022\n\n| In € thousand |            |            |\n|---------------|------------|------------|\n|               |            |            |\n| AAA           | 2,877,848  | 2,534,616  |\n| AA            | 3,050,482  | 3,070,791  |\n| A             | 3,950,222  | 3,376,771  |\n| BBB           | 2,080,646  | 2,038,529  |\n| BB            | 326,587    | 341,657    |\n| B             | 146,374    | 135,688    |\n| ≤ CCC         | 97,577     | 84,315     |\n| Not rated     | 766,739    | 860,041    |\n| Total         | 13,296,476 | 12,442,409 |\n\nEquity risk arises from movements in the value of equities and similar investments as a result of fluctuations in international stock markets, and therefore stems in particular from the asset categories \"Equity investments and other stocks\" and \"Equities\". The effective equity weighting is controlled by hedging with the selective use of derivative financial instruments.\n\nForeign currency risk is caused by fluctuations in exchange rates and associated volatility. Given the international nature of the insurance business, UNIQA invests in securities denominated in different currencies, thus following the principle of ensuring matching liabilities with assets in the same currency to cover liabilities at the coverage fund or company level. Despite the selective use of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes, it is not always possible on cost grounds or from an investment point of view to achieve complete and targeted currency matching between the assets and liabilities.

liability adequacy test and deferred acquisition costs. The impact of the implied new funds assumption (including reinvestment) is therefore stated below.\n\nIn non-life insurance, the provision for unsettled claims is formed based on reported claims and applying accepted statistical methods. One crucial assumption here is that the pattern of claims observed from the past can be sensibly extrapolated for the future. Additional adjustments need to be made in cases where this assumption is not possible.\n\nThe calculation of claim provisions is associated with uncertainty based on the time required to process claims. In addition to the normal chance risk, there are also other factors that may influence the future processing of the claims that have already occurred. In particular, the reserving process for court damages in property and casualty insurance should be mentioned here. A reserve estimate is prepared here for these damages based on expert assessment, although this estimate can be exposed to high levels of volatility specifically with major damage at the start of the process for collecting court costs.\n\nThe partial internal model in property and casualty insurance is a suitable instrument for quantifying the volatility involved in processing. Pursuant to analysis of these model results, it was determined that a deviation of 5 per cent from the basic provision calculated may represent a realistic scenario. Based on the current provision for unsettled claims of €3,865.7 million (excluding additional provisions such as provisions for claim settlement) in the Group on a gross basis, this would mean an increase in claims incurred by €193.3 million.\n\nIn health insurance (similar to life technique), since 1 July 2021 only tariffs with a discount rate of 0.5 per cent are being sold. Together with measures to reduce the assumed interest rate in the portfolio, an average discount rate of approx. 2.5 per cent was achieved as at 31 December 2023. A reduction in the capital earnings by 100 bp (based on 2022 investment results) would reduce the earnings before taxes by €48.8 million.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nOngoing liquidity planning takes place in order to ensure that UNIQA is able to meet its payment obligations over the next twelve months.\n\nObligations with a term of more than twelve months are covered by investments with matching maturities as far as possible within the framework of the ALM process and the strategic guidelines. In addition, a majority of the securities portfolio is listed in liquid markets and can be sold quickly and without significant markdowns if cash is required.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\nNotional amount1) Coupon payments Total\n\nNotional amount1) Coupon payments Total\n\n| Financial liabilities<br>at 31 December 2023 |  | Bond liabilities   |                    |         | Loan liabilities | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Lease liabilities | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--|--------------------|--------------------|---------|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| In € thousand                                |  | Notional<br>amount | Coupon<br>payments | Total   |                  | Contractual maturities                 |                   |         |\n| 2024                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 124                                    | 13,350            | 21,724  |\n| 2025                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 11,991            | 20,241  |\n| 2026                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 9,816             | 18,066  |\n| 2027                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 8,400             | 16,650  |\n| 2028                                         |  | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0                | 0                                      | 7,606             | 15,856  |\n| > 2029                                       |  | 600,000            | 16,500             | 616,500 | 0                | 6,549                                  | 33,822            | 656,871 |\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 279\n\n| Financial liabilities<br>at 31 December 2022 |                    | Bond liabilities   |         |   | Loan liabilities       | Derivative<br>financial<br>instruments | Lease liabilities | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|---|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| In € thousand                                | Notional<br>amount | Coupon<br>payments | Total   |   | Contractual maturities |                                        |                   |         |\n| 2023                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 12,897            | 21,147  |\n| 2024                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 11,745            | 19,995  |\n| 2025                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 10,724            | 18,974  |\n| 2026                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 8,153             | 16,403  |\n| 2027                                         | 0                  | 8,250              | 8,250   | 0 | 0                      | 0                                      | 7,081             | 15,331  |\n| > 2028                                       | 600,000            | 24,750             | 624,750 | 0 | 11,645                 | 0                                      | 42,354            | 678,749 |\n\n## Subordinated liabilitiesContractual maturities at 31 December 2023In € thousand\n\n| 2024   | 0       | 34,984 | 34,984  |\n|--------|---------|--------|---------|\n| 2025   | 200,000 | 34,984 | 234,984 |\n| 2026   | 326,300 | 28,484 | 354,784 |\n| 2027   | 0       | 8,906  | 8,906   |\n| 2028   | 0       | 8,906  | 8,906   |\n| > 2029 | 375,000 | 26,719 | 401,719 |\n\n1) Contractual maturities based on the first possible termination date\n\n## Subordinated liabilities\n\n278\n\nIn index points\n\nfore stated below.\n\nsible.\n\nEquities index EUR (EURO STOXX 50) CZK (PX)\n\nIn life insurance the interest rate assumptions are the crucial influencing factor on the liability adequacy test and deferred acquisition costs.

This can have a material influence on UNIQA's result in case of late payment (or non-payment) by an individual reinsurer. UNIQA controls such risks with an internal reinsurance company that is responsible for selecting external reinsurance parties, taking into account strict guidelines for avoiding material concentration risks.\n\nHowever, concentration risk can also arise among other things from the composition of balance sheet items reported in the assets. Throughout the investment period, the company continuously checks to ensure that the investment volumes in securities of individual issuers do not exceed certain limits in relation to the total investment volume, defined according to the respective credit rating.\n\n#### Underwriting risks\n\nThe underwriting risks are subdivided into non-life insurance, health insurance and life insurance.\n\nThe underwriting risk in non-life insurance is broken down into the three risk categories of premium, reserve and catastrophe risk.\n\nPremium risk is defined as the risk that future benefits and expenses in connection with insurance operations will exceed the premiums collected for the insurance concerned. Such a loss may also be caused in insurance operations by exceptionally significant, but rare loss events, known as major claims or shock losses. Natural catastrophes represent a further threat from events that are infrequent but that nevertheless cause substantial losses. This risk includes financial losses caused by natural hazards, such as floods, storms, hail or earthquakes. In contrast to major individual claims, insurance companies in this case refer to cumulative losses.\n\nReserve risk refers to the risk that technical provisions recognised for claims that have already occurred will turn out to be inadequate. The loss in this case is referred to as settlement loss. The claim reserve is calculated using actuarial methods. External factors, such as changes in the amount or frequency of claims, legal decisions, repair and/or handling costs, can lead to differences compared with the estimate.\n\nTo counter and actively manage these risks, UNIQA runs a number of processes integrated into its insurance operations. For example, a Group Policy specifies that new products may only be launched if they satisfy certain profitability criteria. Major claims and losses from natural catastrophes are appropriately managed by means of special risk management in the underwriting process (primarily in corporate activities) and by the provision of suitable reinsurance capacity.\n\nIn connection with claim reserves, guidelines also specify the procedures to be followed by local units when recognising such reserves in accordance with IFRSs. A quarterly monitoring system and an internal review process safeguard the quality of the reserves recognised in the whole of the Group.\n\nAn essential element in risk assessment and further risk management is the use of the non-life partial model. This risk model uses stochastic simulations to quantify the risk capital requirement for each risk category at both company and Group levels.\n\nThe health insurance business is operated primarily in Austria. As a result, risk management in this line focuses mainly on Austria.\n\nHealth insurance is a loss insurance which is calculated under consideration of biometric risks and is operated in Austria mainly according to the similar to life technique.\n\nThe main techniques for risk mitigation in health insurance are the adjustment of future profit participations and the premium adjustment, which is carried out in compliance with legal and contractual framework conditions. These measures are crucial for the underlying risk models and contain detailed information and regulations, particularly with regard to profit participation. In practice, conventional risk-mitigation techniques are also relevant here.\n\nFor health insurance they include:\n\n- prudent setting of the discount rate at a level that is expected to be earned in the long term;\n- risk selection, i.e. a targeted pre-selection of prospective customers for insurance products, for example through health checks;\n- careful selection of the termination rate probabilities (death and lapse) in order to calculate adequate premiums for the benefits to be expected;\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n- the consideration of premium adjustment clauses in various health insurance products in order to be able to adjust premiums in line with changes in the calculation principles in case of changes in the expected values; and\n- where necessary, reinsurance solutions are applied to partial portfolios.\n\nble.\n\ntion risks.\n\nUnderwriting risks\n\nand catastrophe risk.\n\nrefer to cumulative losses.\n\nwith the estimate.\n\nConcentration risks\n\nUNIQA strives to keep concentration risks as low as possi-\n\nTo counter and actively manage these risks, UNIQA runs a number of processes integrated into its insurance operations.

In contrast to major individual claims, insurance companies in this case\n\nReserve risk refers to the risk that technical provisions recognised for claims that have already occurred will turn out to be inadequate. The loss in this case is referred to as settlement loss. The claim reserve is calculated using actuarial methods. External factors, such as changes in the amount or frequency of claims, legal decisions, repair and/or handling costs, can lead to differences compared\n\nance, health insurance and life insurance.\n\nIn addition to these conventional risk mitigation techniques, an ongoing process for managing portfolios has been established. This process is carried out annually by determining and evaluating the need for rate adjustments. The effectiveness of the risk mitigation techniques described for the health business is assessed by comparing invoiced and actual benefits as well as by calculating contribution margin calculations.\n\nIn life insurance, the underwriting risk is generally defined as the risk of loss or adverse developments affecting the value of insurance liabilities. It is divided into the categories of mortality, longevity, disability-morbidity, lapse, expense, revision and catastrophe risk.\n\nThe mortality risk depends on possible fluctuations in mortality rates due to an increase in deaths which would have an adverse effect on the expected benefits to pay on risk insurance policies.\n\nLongevity risk refers to the adverse effects of random fluctuations in mortality rates due to a decline in the mortality rate. The insurer is thereby exposed to the risk that the anticipated life expectancy in the calculation of the premium will be exceeded in reality and that the expenditure for pension payments will be higher than planned.\n\nThe disability-morbidity risk is caused by possible adverse fluctuations in disability, sickness and morbidity rates compared to what they were at the time the premium was calculated.\n\nThe lapse risk arises from the fluctuations in policy cancellation, termination, renewal, capital selection and surrender rates of insurance policies. Overall, it represents the uncertainty regarding customer behaviour.\n\nThe expense risk refers to adverse effects due to fluctuations in the administrative costs of insurance and reinsurance contracts.\n\nThe revision risk results from fluctuations in the revision rates for annuities due to changes in the legal environment.\n\nThe catastrophe risk results from significant uncertainty in relation to pricing and the assumptions made in the creation of provisions for extreme/exceptional events. The most relevant risk in this context is an immediate dramatic increase in mortality rates: in this case, death benefits in the risk portfolio could not be fully financed by the risk premium collected.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 281\n\nIn the context of life insurance, the main techniques for risk mitigation are the adjustment of future profit participations or a corresponding premium adjustment as well as additional reinsurance policies, which are carried out in compliance with legal and contractual framework conditions. These measures are crucial for the underlying risk models and contain detailed information and regulations, particularly with regard to profit participation. In practice, profitable new business supports the risk-bearing capacity of the existing portfolio, whereby careful risk selection (e.g. health checks) and cautiously chosen calculation principles for premiums are essential cornerstones when designing products. By including premium adjustment clauses, the potential to reduce risk can be improved, especially in the risk and occupational disability portfolio.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk includes losses that are caused by insufficient or failed internal processes, as well as losses caused by systems, human resources or external events.\n\nThe operational risk includes legal risk, but not reputation or strategic risk. Legal risk is the risk of uncertainty due to lawsuits or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or other legal requirements. At UNIQA, legal risks are monitored on an ongoing basis, and reports are made to the Group Management Board. UNIQA's risk management process also defined the risk process for operational risks in terms of methodology, workflow and responsibilities. The risk manager is responsible for compliance throughout all Group companies.\n\nA distinctive feature of operational risk is that it can surface in all processes and departments. This is why operational risk is identified and evaluated in every operational company at a very broad level within UNIQA. Risks are identified with the help of a standardised risk catalogue that is regularly checked for completeness.\n\nAccording to international standards, UNIQA – as a financial service provider – forms part of the critical infrastructure of key importance to the national community. If this infrastructure were to fail or become impaired, it would\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\ncause considerable disruption to public safety and security or lead to other drastic consequences.\n\nAs a rule, emergencies, crises and disasters are unexpected events for which it is impossible to plan, although systems and processes can be put in place to deal with such events. The systems and processes must then be treated as a special responsibility of management and must be dealt with professionally, efficiently and as quickly as possible.\n\nUNIQA has implemented a business continuity management system covering the issues of crisis prevention, crisis management and business recovery (including business emergency plans). The UNIQA BCM model is based on international rules and standards and is developed on a continuous basis.\n\n#### Emerging risk\n\nEmerging risk refers to newly arising or changing risks that are difficult to quantify and can have a significant impact on an organisation. Among the main drivers of the changing risk landscape are new economic, technological, socio-political and ecological developments and the increasing interdependencies between them, which may lead to a growing concentration of risk. In addition, a changing business environment – the further development of regulatory rules, the increased expectations of stakeholders and the shift in risk perception – must be taken into account.\n\n#### Reputational risk\n\nReputational risk describes the risk of loss that arises because of possible damage to the company's reputation, because of a deterioration in prestige, or because of a negative overall impression caused by negative perception by customers, business partners, shareholders or supervisory agencies. Reputational risks that occur in the course of core processes such as claim processing or advising and service quality are identified, evaluated and managed as operational risks in the Group companies.\n\n#### Contagion risk\n\nGroup risk management analyses whether the reputation risk observed in the Group or in another unit may occur, and whether the danger of \"contagion\" within the Group is possible. The analyses performed guard against contagion risk.\n\n#### Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk refers to the risk that results from management decisions or insufficient implementation of management decisions that may influence current or future income or solvency. This includes the risk that arises from management decisions that are inadequate because they ignore a changed business environment. Like operational and reputational risks, strategic risks are evaluated on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe following table shows a sensitivity analysis of changes in the most significant underwriting risks and market risks with their impact on assets and technical provisions in accordance with Solvency II. The sensitivities stated are based on calculations for the purposes of the company's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment. The technical provisions in accordance with Solvency II amount to €3,890 thousand in property and casualty insurance and to €14,524 thousand in life insurance.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Sensitivity analysis                        |                  | 31/12/2023            |                  | 31/12/2023            |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| In € thousand                               | Impact on assets | Impact on liabilities | Impact on assets | Impact on liabilities |\n| Underwriting risks                          |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Property and casualty insurance             |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Ultimate losses (+1%)                       |                  | 28,613                |                  | 22,467                |\n| Ultimate losses (-1%)                       |                  | -48,866               |                  | -31,399               |\n| Life insurance                              |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Mortality (-5%)                             |                  | -74,410               |                  | -23,540               |\n| Costs (+10%)                                |                  | 128,829               |                  | 114,502               |\n| Lapse rates (+10%)                          |                  | 121,944               |                  | 145,859               |\n| Lapse rates (-10%)                          |                  | -102,951              |                  | -78,987               |\n| Market risks                                |                  |                       |                  |                       |\n| Interest rate change (+50 bp)               | -569,508         | -652,077              | -452,718         | -508,805              |\n| Interest rate change (-50 bp)               | 598,120          | 768,084               | 564,702          | 670,922               |\n| Share price change (-25%)                   | -1,205,798       | -712,628              | -639,003         | -485,622              |\n| Exchange rate change (€-10%)                | -411,845         | -174,352              | -416,803         | -96,233               |\n| Credit spread risk corporate bonds (+50 bp) | -187,450         | 7,172                 | -151,613         | -20,137               |\n\n## 39.

The structure of the purchasing of external reinsurance is linked to the risk management process, thus enabling the risk capital to be relieved.\n\nReinsurance structures support the continuous optimisation of the required risk capital and the management of the use of this risk capital. Great importance is attached to the maximum use of diversification effects. Continuous analysis of reinsurance purchasing for efficiency characteristics is an essential component of internal risk management processes.\n\nUNIQA Re AG in Zurich, Switzerland, is responsible for the operational implementation of these tasks. It is responsible for and guarantees the implementation of the reinsurance policy issued by the Group Management Board. UNIQA Re AG is available to all Group companies as the risk carrier for their reinsurance needs. The assessment of the exposure of the portfolios assumed by the Group companies is of central importance. Periodic risk assessments have been performed for years in the interest of a value-based management of the capital commitment.\n\nExtensive data are used to assess risk capital requirements for the units in question and their reinsurance programmes are structured in a targeted manner.\n\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 283\n\nFor the property and casualty insurer, promises of performance for protection against losses resulting from natural hazards frequently represent by far the greatest stress on risk capital due to the volatile nature of such claims and the conceivable amount of catastrophic damages. UNIQA has set up a specialised unit in order to deal with this problem. Exposure is constantly monitored and evaluated at the country and Group levels in cooperation with internal and external authorities. UNIQA substantially eases the pressure on its risk capital through the targeted utilisation of all applicable diversification effects and the launch of an efficient retrocession programme.\n\nUNIQA Re AG has assumed almost all of the UNIQA Group's required reinsurance business ceded in the reporting period. Only in exceptional cases, such as the purchase of facultative reinsurance, is a portion of the necessary cessions given directly to external reinsurance companies. The Group assumes reasonable deductibles in the retrocession programmes based on risk- and value-based approaches.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Approval for publication\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared by the Management Board as at the date of signing and approved for publication.\n\nVienna, 15 March 2024\n\nQ.

Intangible assets\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 2. Measurement of the contractual service margin at the transition date to IFRS 17 Description\n\nThe International Financial Reporting Standard on Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 (date of initial application). In principle, IFRS 17 is applicable retrospectively as of the transition dated 1 January 2022.\n\nUNIQA has measured its insurance portfolio at the transition date mainly applying the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach. Insurance contracts, assets and deferred acquisition costs are identified and measured as if IFRS 17 had always been applied, with differences to existing amounts recognised in equity.\n\nThe reduction of consolidated equity at the transition date amounting to EUR 771,265k mainly results from the firsttime recognition of the contractual service margin due to initial application of IFRS 17.\n\nAudit approach and key observations\n\nWe:\n\n- compared the accounting and measurement methods with the accounting provisions of IFRS 17,\n- evaluated the appropriateness of the calculation methods at the transition date and examined the significant discretionary decisions and assumptions especially regarding the availability of historical data and the appropriateness of permissible simplifications,\n- verified the completeness and appropriateness of the data for calculating the contractual service margin at the transition date.\n\nThe accounting and measurement methods applied are in accordance with IFRSs. We consider the underlying\n\nassumptions and measurement parameters to be plausible and reasonable.\n\nKONZERNABSCHLUSS 287\n\nReference to related disclosures\n\nRefer to chapter \"Insurance contracts – transition options\" under General information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and to the \"Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\".\n\n## 3. Measurement of liabilities from insurance contracts in life insurance and health insurance pursuant to the variable fee approach (VFA) Description\n\nUNIQA mainly applies the variable fee approach for measuring insurance contracts in life insurance and health insurance. This approach is applied to insurance contracts if defined criteria are met. Differences to the general measurement model only arise in subsequent measuring.\n\nContracts that involve profit participation in life insurance and health insurance are not divided into annual cohorts, using the option provided by EU law.\n\nInsurance contracts in life insurance and health insurance are initially measured by an estimation of future cash flows connected to the fulfilment of the contract. In doing so, significant discretionary decisions especially regarding non-financial assumptions such as mortality, longevity, invalidity or morbidity, customer behaviour (cancellation) or development of medical costs are to be considered.\n\nAs a second step, cash flows are discounted in order to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks. In a third step a risk adjustment is calculated to take into account non-financial risks. The contractual service margin is calculated at the time of initial recognition and represents the as of yet unrealised profit for a group of insurance contracts. The contractual service margin for the life insurance and health insurance business amounts to EUR 5,204,409k as at 31 December 2023.\n\nBased on defined coverage units, an amount of the contractual service margin is recognised in each period in profit or loss for a group of insurance contracts.

The risks of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial\n\nstatements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nKONZERNABSCHLUSS 289\n\n obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nComments on the Management Report for the Group Pursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report for the Group is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report for the Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the provisions of the Austrian Insurance Supervision Act.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian standards on auditing for the audit of the management report for the Group.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations, comprising the details in accordance with section 243a UGB, and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report for the Group came to our attention.\n\nVienna\n\n15 March 2024\n\nAdditional Information in Accordance with Article 10 of the EU Regulation\n\nWe were elected as statutory auditor at the ordinary general meeting dated 23 May 2022.
