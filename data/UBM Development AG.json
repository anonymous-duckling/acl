For a real estate developer, this creates widespread obligations. It demands a farsighted strategy, a finely tuned organisation and full commitment at all levels.\n\n# **3. UBM & Sustainability**\n\n- 3.1. Our strategy\n- 3.2. ESG organisation\n- 3.3. Stakeholder inclusion\n- 3.4. Materiality analysis\n- 3.5. ESG goals and measures\n- 3.6. Risk management\n- 3.7. ESG reporting\n- 3.8. ESG ratings\n- 3.9. Memberships\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Living sustainability.\n\n# **3.1. Our strategy**\n\nProtecting the future viability of our planet is one of the most important social responsibilities of our time. With the announcement of the Green Deal, the European Union underscored its intention to make Europe the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Other megatrends aside from ecology are urbanisation and the transformation of society caused by demographic and social changes. \"Silver Society\" is a term that describes the ageing of society, in which health and the quality of life will be deeply anchored as fundamental values in our consciousness. Changing gender roles and the breakdown of stereotypes have also led to radical changes in society and the business sector. These developments, together with Covid-19, are the decisive factors for the megatrend New Work – meaning people's needs as regards their working world.\n\nWe see these trends not only as a challenge but also as an opportunity: the interaction with ESG is a key success factor for our entrepreneurial activities. In the sense of ecological sustainability, UBM aims to become one of the leading timber construction developers in Europe. Our actions today are already directed to smart, low-barrier or barrier-free, flexible living and working to also meet the needs of tomorrow's users. As a real estate developer, we can give the office new meaning as a communication and collaboration platform – the physical workplace then becomes a place for community and corporate culture. As an employer, we also take advantage of these opportunities – for example, by benefitting from the additional innovation potential created by a diverse workforce.\n\nUBM has anchored the relevance of ESG in its corporate strategy through the focus on *green. smart. and more.* and is introducing specific accompanying measures. The efficient use of resources is an integral part of ongoing operations, as are social issues and adherence to compliance rules. UBM's flagship projects, green building certifications and the activities evolving from the *green. smart. and more.* strategy reflect EU requirements and create new opportunities for UBM.\n\n*green.* stands for measures in support of greening, meaning the redirection of the economy in line with the environment. Our primary focal point is timber construction as well as renewable energies and green building certification.\n\n*smart.* expresses our commitment to intelligent buildings. With the use of sensors and automation, buildings can be adapted to meet users' needs and, at the same time, operations can become more efficient.\n\n*and more.* means we tell stories with our buildings. This involves aesthetics, well-being and customer experience – a \"more\" that is perceptible all over.\n\nOur sustainability activities are based on the applicable rules and regulations in the countries where we are active. For example: government programmes in the countries relevant for UBM cover issues like the expansion of renewable energy, the increase in energy efficiency, subsidy programmes for environmentally friendly behaviour and the strengthening of fundamental and human rights, especially in the supply chain. Additional frameworks are based on national and supranational norms and standards, including the UN Global Compact, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the EU Green Deal and the EU Taxonomy. In the future, UBM will publish its sustainability information in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We have implemented – and regularly evaluate and improve – effective processes to realise our ESG goals and the related measures. Information on our 360° process landscape and the related activities follows in the next sections of this report.\n\nLeading worldwide ESG rating agencies have confirmed UBM's strong position on sustainability. Additional information can be found in section 3.8. **GRI 2-23, 2-24** \n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n# ESG goals at a glance\n\nImage /page/38/Figure/1 description: The image shows ESG goals at a glance. The goals are divided into three categories: Environment, Social, and Governance. Under Environment, the goals are: Timber construction (Over 100,000 m² as a timber construction by 2025), Green building certification (Obtain green building certification for 100% of new developments), Reduction of CO₂ by 30% (Reduction of CO₂ intensity of completed projects by 30% by 2030), Brownfield development (Share of brownfield developments in new projects over 66% by 2025), EU Taxonomy alignment (EU Taxonomy alignment for 100% of new developments in the office asset class), and Increase in renewable energy (Increase the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 30% by 2025 (Standing assets and corporate locations)). Under Social, the goals are: Minimise employee turnover (Hold employee turnover below 15% by 2025), Over 30% women in management positions (Increase percentage of women in management positions to over 30% by 2025), and Yearly ESG training (Annual ESG awareness training for all employees). Under Governance, the goals are: Voluntary external ESG audit (Voluntary external audit of ESG reporting), Code of conduct for business partners (Carry out KYC reviews of new business partners and confirm binding code of conduct), and Code of conduct for employees (Confirm code of conduct in writing with all employees).\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.2. The implementation: organisation & governance**\n\nTogether with our *green. smart. and more.* corporate strategy, we have anchored ESG goals throughout the entire corporation. We see the transformation of our conviction into concrete actions as the shared responsibility of all employees. Only when everyone knows and is committed to our internal ESG goals can ESG become part of our everyday life and have a lasting effect.\n\nThe organisation of and compliance with sustainability issues is anchored at Management Board level. Thomas G. Winkler, the Chief Executive Officer, is in charge of the sustainabilityrelevant areas of strategy, investor relations & ESG as well as legal & compliance. Green building and timber construction report to Peter Schaller, while Patric Thate makes sure the financing is also turning \"green\" and reliable ESG data management becomes reality. Employees and occupational safety are the responsibility of Martina Maly-Gärtner.\n\nThe Management Board and Executive Committee, together with the heads of the involved specialist departments, are responsible for the implementation of ESG activities. The relevance of the sustainability strategy and goals is evaluated at regular intervals, and appropriate steps to reach these goals are defined. The Executive Committee frequently deals with sustainability issues, especially in view of the strategic focus on *green. smart. and more.* The Management Board is included in central decisions and receives routine progress reports.\n\nWith the help of a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), the roles and responsibilities for ESG were transparently defined and recorded. The Investor Relations & ESG department coordinates sustainability issues within the framework of UBM's strategy and business model and is in charge of operative ESG reporting together with the organisation of ESG ratings. Its activities include the further development of the sustainability strategy, the definition and monitoring of goals, and the implementation of measures together with selected specialist departments. This department is also responsible for monitoring changes in the legal framework and serves as an information interface for the company. The Head of Investor Relations & ESG and the Management Board communicate regularly on current developments and issues.\n\nThe specialist departments and country organisations are responsible for managing and implementing sustainability issues. These employees are involved and take the defined actions as part of their regular day-to-day operations and in pilot projects.\n\nIn 2021, UBM became one of the first listed companies in Austria to install an ESG committee at Supervisory Board level. This separate committee allows the Supervisory Board, as the senior controlling body, to meet its responsibilities for the environment, society and governance. The committee members and their positions are listed below. The chairwoman was elected by the committee members.\n\n#### **Member of the ESG Committee**\n\n| Name          | Position          |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| Iris Ortner   | Chairwoman        |\n| Susanne Weiss | Deputy Chairwoman |\n| Birgit Wagner | Member            |\n| Anke Duchow   | Member            |\n\nThe activities of the ESG Committee include the analysis of sustainability criteria and concepts in corporate processes. It is also responsible for overseeing and advancing actions in line with the ESG catalogue of measures based on the clear assignment of responsibilities at Management Board and Supervisory Board levels. The committee additionally monitors and evaluates the implemented ESG measures – above all, the impact of procurement and development processes on ecosystems, the use of resources, the direct and indirect neighbourhood, and good corporate governance.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.5. Concrete goals and measures**\n\n# **3.5.1. Sustainable Development Goals**\n\nUBM is committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015 as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Governments as well as companies are called upon to contribute to reaching these goals. The framework includes 17 goals and 169 sub-goals which are related to global economic, social and ecological challenges.\n\nOur actions are also based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. The assignment of the applicable SDGs and their sub-goals together with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and their relation to the GRI Standard are explained in greater detail in the GRI Index (see section 7).\n\nIn connection with a materiality analysis (see section 3.4.) and a risk/impact assessment (see section 3.6.), UBM examined the SDGs and the related sub-goals in detail and identified the goals where the company can make a direct contribution to the Agenda 2030:\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/6 description: The image is a square graphic with a yellow background.

Conscious handling of risks and their effects**\n\nThe realistic assessment and management of risks are essential factors for business success and sustainable management. In 2021, UBM's became an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate-related risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nThe TCFD recommendations for the reporting of climaterelated risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and are gradually being implemented. Additional information on the risk management system can be found in the annual report (chapter \"Risk report\").\n\n#### **Governance**\n\nThe overall responsibility for general risk management at UBM lies with the Management Board. Additional information on corporate governance can be found in section 3.2. UBM takes a systematic approach to handling risks, whereby different areas of the company are involved. Operating management is responsible for the identification and evaluation of the risks arising from daily business activities as well as the implementation of appropriate measures to contain these risks. The operating units are monitored and receive the necessary assistance. In this way, operating management is systematically strengthened by the risk management functions, and the overall risk for the company can be established by consolidating the individual risks.\n\nThe Head of Risk Management is responsible for the operational risk management process. The compliance function monitors the observance of external and internal rules and regulations. Internal audit ensures independent and objective monitoring. The respective reports are submitted to the Management Board, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee.\n\n#### **Strategy**\n\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of CO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM's long-term success and, consequently, are an elementary part of the *green. smart. and more.* corporate strategy. Given the substantial share of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, regulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and real estate sector can be expected to increase.\n\nAn agreement reached in trialogue by the EU Parliament, the member states and the Commission at the end of 2023 established the most important points of the EU's Building Directive. It deals with the energy efficiency of buildings and the use of renewable energies. Starting in 2030, all new buildings must be built as nearly zero-energy structures. Buildings that do not meet this standard could therefore risk being denied a building permit in the future. Climate protection, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. through regulations covering primary energy requirements). That could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand for investments that are not classified as sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy.\n\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also increasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for building operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 pricing scheme which, for example, was introduced in Austria in October 2022 and is designed to increase annually, will create financial disadvantages for fossil energy carriers. UBM has therefore turned to the carbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies like geothermal power and photovoltaics, and green building certification as part of its *green.* strategy. Intelligent buildings and solutions for efficient building operations are anchored in this strategy with *smart.* Additional information on the corporate strategy can be found in section 3.1.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Risk management**\n\nUBM adapted its risk management in 2023 to fully integrate ESG. The risk catalogue was modified and expanded to include ESG-relevant risks and opportunities. ESG risks are evaluated in line with and integrated in the existing risk measurement system (Value at Risk and Cashflow at Risk).\n\nA valuation scale was introduced to rank ESG opportunities and calculate the effects on cash flow. A net position of risks and opportunities is not presented to enable a more detailed overview of the risk parameters.\n\nThe integration of ESG in risk management involved the Management Board and the Head of Risk Management as well as the Investor Relations & ESG department and external consultants.\n\nAs part of risk management, the probability of occurrence and the scope of possible damages from the individual risks are evaluated twice each year by the Management Board. The members of the Management Board evaluate and quantify the risks along the value chain according to their professional judgement. The estimates for the potential scope of the individual risks are the subject of increasing systemisation, where possible, with mathematical models. The country managing directors and risk owners are involved in the assessment and projected development of the individual risks. The risk system is audited annually and adapted where necessary to meet changing circumstances.\n\nThe ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are classified under the following categories:\n\n- Acute physical climate risks (heatwaves, cold spells, storms, drought, heavy rain, flooding, etc.)\n- Chronic physical climate risks (changes in temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.)\n- Non-climate-related environmental risks (impairment of critical infrastructure)\n- Transitory climate risks (GHG taxation, reporting requirements, change in preferences, etc.)\n- Social risks (human error, employee turnover, reputation risk, heat stress)\n- Governance risks (diversity on the Management and Supervisory Boards, legal and compliance risks, etc.)\n\nESG-relevant opportunities include the following:\n\n- Products and services: the development of buildings as a timber (hybrid) construction, green buildings\n- Resource efficiency: in the construction and development of buildings with low resource consumption\n- Energy sources: use of renewable and low-emission energy\n- Markets: access to new investor groups; green finance\n- Resilience: development of resilient buildings\n\nAs a pure play developer with a limited portfolio of standing assets, the most relevant risks for UBM are selected chronic physical climate risks, non-climate-related environmental risks, transitory climate risks, social and governance risks.\n\n#### **Metrics and targets**\n\nUBM has defined goals, measures and indicators for assessment and management along the three fields of environment, society and governance. The main goals are described on page 37, the details on page 48. Further information can be found in the following sections.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.6.1. Environmental risks**\n\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increasingly important for the planning and realisation of development projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate developers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of their activities on the environment. Economic success and sustainable project development represent an area of tension but go hand in hand at UBM: sustainable management is the basis for economic success – and economic success is the basis for sustainable management. The goal is to reduce environmental risks and, at the same time, identify and utilise business opportunities for UBM in this field.\n\nA scenario was developed for each sustainability issue as part of the materiality analysis. Specific measures are described in greater detail in section 4.\n\nSustainable management is the basis for economic success – and economic success is the basis for sustainable management.\n\n# **3.6.2. Social risks**\n\nWe view our responsibility as an employer, contracting firm, business partner and integral part of the social system as a central element of our economic actions. The realisation of our projects is dependent to a significant degree on our employees. For that reason, UBM places high priority on attracting motivated, committed and qualified employees, giving them opportunities for development, and creating an attractive working environment.\n\nOur success is also based on our proven quality as a business partner and contracting firm that acts with expertise, reliability and transparency.\n\nA scenario was developed for each social issue related to sustainability as part of the materiality analysis. The risks arising from social issues, their impact and the implemented measures are described in greater detail in section 5.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **The

Governance risks**\n\nResponsible, transparent and future-oriented management forms the basis for a company's economic success – and this economic success is the basis for sustainable management. Specifically, that means: the way we address major social challenges and balanced treatment of the interests of all our stakeholders are an essential and integral part of our actions.\n\nA scenario was developed for each governance issue related to sustainability as part of the materiality analysis. The risks arising from social issues, their impact and the implemented measures are described in greater detail in section 6.\n\nThe extensive catalogue of measures to deal with compliance risks covers the entire UBM Group. Corruption risk is viewed as part of governance risks (among others, from internal fraud, corrupt behaviour) and flows into the risk assessment, risk map and overall aggregation. Steps to reduce this risk include, among others, regular training, work instructions (e.g. the dual control principle), obtaining multiple offers, recording order procedures, the separation of orders and payment as well as the related controls. **GRI 205-1** \n\n#### **In the area of governance, the materiality analysis identified the following risks:**\n\n| Sustainability issues                               | Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate Governance<br>and Compliance              | ■ Fines, consequences under criminal law<br>■ Reputational damage<br>■ Risks for the interests of investors and<br>employees, declining share prices<br>■ Financial damages due to invalid agree-<br>ments<br>■ Exclusion from tenders | ■ Commitment to the Austrian Code of<br>Corporate Governance<br>■ Extensive compliance management<br>system<br>■ Whistleblower system<br>■ Internal training and awareness creation<br>■ Code of conduct for business partners<br>■ Ethics code<br>■ 360° process landscape |\n| Sustainable procurement and regional<br>added value | ■ Increasing regulatory requirements for<br>due diligence in the supply chain<br>■ Problems in international supply chains<br>■ Reputational damage                                                                                    | ■ Code of conduct for business partners<br>■ Procurement guideline for the ecologic-<br>ally oriented purchasing<br>■ Supplier checks                                                                                                                                       |\n| Innovation and technologies                         | ■ Impairment of competitive ability<br>■ Loss of know-how                                                                                                                                                                              | ■ Digitalisation of the UBM working world<br>■ Smart Building Innovation<br>■ Foundation (SBIF)<br>■ Cybersecurity training                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.7. ESG reporting**\n\nUBM is not covered by the reporting requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act but has voluntarily and proactively published an annual ESG report in line with the latest GRI standards since 2020. This reporting is in accordance with the Universal Standards 2021 issued by GRI (Global Reporting Initiative). Consequently, the company is very well prepared to address the information requirements at the product and corporate levels that will result from the CSRD and Taxonomy Regulation. UBM will be covered by the CSRD reporting requirements beginning with the 2025 financial year and will report its sustainability information in accordance with ESRS standards. The materiality analysis and reporting reflect, in all respects, the GRI definitions for report content and quality: accuracy, validity, balance/relevance, clarity, comparability, completeness, sustainability context, timeliness and reliability. These criteria apply to both the financial and non-financial information.\n\nReporting will be gradually adapted to reflect the changing regulatory developments – for example, the materiality analysis was already revised under this perspective (see section 3.4.). Moreover, UBM's reporting is based on voluntary frameworks and norms like the UN Global Compact (see section 3.9.). This ESG report serves as a progress report for the UN Global Compact. UBM has been an official supporter of the TCFD recommendations (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) since 2021 and is covering this subject in its current report (see section 3.6.).\n\nIn connection with the concrete, measurable goals for the coming years which were set in 2021 and are regularly evaluated, the ESG report gives UBM a valuable management tool to meet its responsibility to society. The ESG report describes the management approaches, goals and measures related to the environment, society and governance, and highlights successes as well as challenges. The subject areas are based on the materiality analysis carried out in 2021.\n\nUBM calculated its complete corporate carbon footprint (CCF), retroactive for the 2022 reporting year, for the first time in 2023. The CCF provides an overview of a company's direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in t CO2e (CO2equivalents) along the entire value chain. The results are presented in accordance with the requirements of the scientifically based Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and the Guide to Scope 3 Reporting in Commercial Real Estate. Based on the CCF, we can identify opportunities for improvement and evaluate the progress in reaching our goals. We have also submitted ambitious, scientifically based climate goals with the Science Based Targets Initiative and are developing a GHG reduction path. Additional information on the CCF is included in section 4.\n\nThe ESG report is prepared by the Investor Relations & ESG department in coordination with the specialist departments and released by the Management Board. Additional information on UBM, its business development and corporate governance is provided in the 2023 annual report.\n\nTransparency and reliability are also decisive for our ESG reporting, and we therefore arranged for an external limited assurance audit of this ESG report (more information is provided beginning on page 135).\n\nUBM also introduced a central data management tool in 2021, which has been successively developed and used for internal and external reporting since 2022. The goal is to create an informative basis for the definition of internal goals and external evaluations. This tool permits data processing with maximum flexibility and meets all current international sustainability standards. Transparency is ensured by control mechanisms, plausibility checks and the definition of responsibilities.\n\nControlling is responsible for this tool at corporate level, and a contact partner has been designated for each country organisation. Data collection takes place directly in the respective areas and departments in the individual countries. The Controlling, Timber Construction & Green Building and Investor Relations & ESG departments are integrated in the data control. **GRI 2-3, 2-5, 2-14**\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.8. ESG ratings**\n\nLeading global ESG rating agencies have confirmed UBM's strong position in the area of sustainability.\n\n# **CDP: B for UBM in the Climate Change Rating**\n\nThe \"B\" grade received by UBM in its first evaluation (in 2022) by CDP was repeated in 2023 with a \"B\" for the company's actions in the fight against climate change. That places UBM only one level below CDP's \"Leadership\" status. In 2023, UBM was also invited to apply for a water security rating and received a \"C\" grade. UBM has taken part in CDP reporting on climaterelevant data since 2022 and provides its stakeholders with transparent information on the climate protection strategy and actions to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for CDP, which stands for Disclosure Insight Action. The logo consists of a red geometric shape on the left, resembling a stylized flower or starburst, followed by the letters \"CDP\" in a bold, red font. Below the letters, the words \"DISCLOSURE INSIGHT ACTION\" are written in a smaller, sans-serif font.\n\n# **ISS ESG: Prime Status for UBM**\n\nRating by ISS ESG resulted in \"Prime Status\" (Level \"B-\") for UBM Development. That makes UBM Development the most sustainable company in its sector in Germany and Austria.\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/8 description: The image contains a logo with three distinct sections. The first section, a dark blue rectangle, contains the text \"Corporate ESG Performance\" in white. Below this, the text \"RATED BY\" is stacked above \"ISS ESG\" with a right-pointing arrow, also in white. To the right of the blue rectangle is a green square with the word \"Prime\" in white.\n\n#### **EcoVadis: Platinum for UBM**\n\nFollowing Gold from the previous year's evaluation, UBM Development was also awarded Platinum in 2023 – the highest rating given by EcoVadis. That places UBM among the top one per cent of the 100,000 companies graded by EcoVadis worldwide.\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/11 description: The image is a circular badge with a silver border. Inside the border, the word \"PLATINUM\" is written in silver at the top left. To the right of \"PLATINUM\" is a green box with the words \"Top 1%\" written in white. Below \"PLATINUM\" and \"Top 1%\" is the year \"2023\" in a large, bold font. Below the year is the word \"ecovadis\" in a stylized font. Below \"ecovadis\" are the words \"Sustainability Rating\" in a smaller font.\n\n#### **UBM joins the VÖNIX**\n\nUBM's inclusion in Austria's VÖNIX Sustainability Index in 2022 was extended to 2023/24. This sustainability benchmark includes the Austrian companies listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange that hold leading positions with regard to their ecological and social activities.\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/14 description: The image shows a logo for VONIX INDEX MEMBER 2023/24. The word \"VONIX\" is in blue, with \"INDEX MEMBER\" in smaller letters below it. Above the word \"VONIX\" is a green graphic of several circles connected by lines. The text \"2023/24\" is in a green box.\n\n#### **EthiFinance (Gaïa): 76/100 for UBM**\n\nThe EthiFinance rating resulted in a score of 76/100 for UBM and a slight improvement over the previous year's results. Compared with the benchmark (real estate sector), UBM was a high-flyer in all four rating categories (Environment, Social, Governance and external stakeholders).\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.9. Memberships**\n\nOur actions are also based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, a \"network of the future\" which UBM joined in 2021. UBM has additionally been an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2021, where it is one of almost 5,000 organisations committed to fighting climate risks and developing a more resistant financial system through better disclosure.\n\nAn intensive dialogue with stakeholders is guaranteed and reinforced by UBM's participation in various organisations and sector associations. The company has been a member of the Institute for Corporate Governance (ICG) since 2019 and contributes to the ICG's social impact investment initiative. In addition, UBM is a member of the corporate platform respACT (Austrian Council for Sustainable Development), the Austrian Sustainable Building Council (\"Österreichische Gesellschaft für Nachhaltige Immobilienwirtschaft\", ÖGNI) and Hotel Management Associates (HAMA).\n\nUBM expanded its active participation in the interest group \"IG-Lebenszyklus Bau\" to include membership in 2020. The organisation's working group on the shortage of land was headed, among others, by UBM Austria's management. Its central objective is to find ways to stop the wasteful use of land as a limited resource with existing and new framework conditions.\n\nWe also play an active role in the Association of Austrian Project Developers (\"Vereinigung der Österreichischen Projektentwickler\", VÖPE). Together with other VÖPE members, UBM demonstrates that project developers can be strong and reliable partners for the general public and the public sector in the creation of living environments. **GRI 2-28**\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a tree trunk with a vine growing on it. The tree trunk is rough and textured, with a mix of brown and gray colors. The vine is green and has small leaves. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a forest or wooded area.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Showing our colours.\n\nGreen is a fundamental element of UBM's corporate identity. Above and beyond a simple graphic idea, this also underscores our special approach. We want to visibly signalise that the core concept \"green\" is deeply anchored in UBM's projects and transactions along the entire value chain.\n\n# **4. UBM & Environment**\n\n- 4.1. Energy efficiency, renewable energies & CO2 emissions\n- 4.2. Recyclability & durability of building materials\n- 4.3. Ground sealing, climate change adjustments and biodiversity\n- 4.4. Refurbishment and revitalisation\n- 4.5. Healthy building materials & the quality of life\n- 4.6. Water and wastewater utilisation and waste in building operations\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Our company. Our environment.\n\nThe architect Lamia Messari-Becker summarised the environmental effects of construction in a few simple statistics: 40% of energy requirements, 50% of resource consumption, 60% of waste and 70% of ground sealing worldwide are attributable to the construction sector. In view of this high environmental relevance, it is natural for UBM to give high priority to ecological aspects in all decisions.\n\n#### **Future-oriented real estate development**\n\nWith our properties, we design the living space of the future – and that means we also design the environment. Real estate development is not only our core business – at the same time, it gives us the greatest leverage to significantly reduce our carbon footprint. UBM directly addresses the ecological impact of its activities in all project phases. A firm belief in the importance of timber construction, our dedication to renewable energies and energy efficiency, the emphasis on green building certification and our efforts on behalf of the circular economy are an expression of this conviction. Our activities concentrate on the following areas:\n\n- Energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions\n- Durability and recyclability of materials\n- Ground sealing, climate change and biodiversity\n- Refurbishment and revitalisation\n- Healthy building materials and the quality of life\n\n#### **Real estate development projects**\n\n| Projects                              | Total pipeline1 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| GFA (Gross Floor Area) total [m²]     | 523,219         | 58,420 | 99,633 | 118,104 |\n| GFA Office [m²]                       | 272,440         | 0      | 35,775 | 5,430   |\n| GFA Residential [m²]                  | 250,779         | 58,420 | 21,778 | 47,072  |\n| GFA Hotel [m²]                        | 0               | 0      | 16,992 | 51,149  |\n| GFA Other and Mix [m²]                | 0               | 0      | 25,089 | 14,453  |\n| Projects – all asset classes [number] | 36              | 4      | 9      | 10      |\n| Office [number]                       | 12              | 0      | 3      | 1       |\n| Residential [number]                  | 24              | 4      | 3      | 4       |\n| Hotel [number]                        | 0               | 0      | 1      | 4       |\n| Mix and Other [number]                | 0               | 0      | 2      | 1       |\n\n1 The data covers all projects in the pipeline (Q1/2024-Q4/2027). Projects that are composed of different phases or building sites are shown separately.\n\n#### **We measure our locations based on their footprint**\n\nIn addition to our development projects, we want to make our own business operations more sustainable. UBM has office space at 12 locations and is working to steadily reduce its ecological footprint. Relevant activities to reach this goal involve energy consumption and emissions (see section 4.1.). The efficient use of water and correct waste management are also important issues for UBM and are internally managed and reported.\n\n#### **Fewer standing assets**\n\nThe strategic focal point of UBM's business activities is the development and sale of properties. Accordingly, the number of standing assets has been steadily reduced since 2015. UBM also takes action to strengthen sustainability in these properties – here, the key issue is whether the properties are rented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on energy consumption and emissions, for example through the use of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling solutions.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4.1. Energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emissions**\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/2 description: The image shows five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. From left to right, top to bottom, they are: SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).\n\n#### **4.1.1. Importance of the issue**\n\nWith the Paris Agreement, nations across the world have agreed on joint efforts to hold global warming substantially below 2 °C and, through further measures, to limit the increase to 1.5 °C below the pre-industrial level (1990). The EU's Green Deal represents the heart of European sustainability efforts in this context. It calls for a reduction of at least 55% in net greenhouse gas emissions (basis: 1990) in the EU by 2030. This important interim goal in the Green Deal will put Europe on course to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050.\n\nRelated activities include the European Commission's \"Fit for 55\" package which includes draft legislation, among others, for buildings. The requirements involve, among others, a European approach to carbon pricing (certificate trading and CO2 taxes). The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is designed to counter the shift of CO2 emissions to non-EU countries with less ambitious climate policies by introducing CO2 tariffs on certain imports (including cement, iron and steel) starting in 2026. The EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is intended to increase the energy efficiency of buildings in order to achieve a zero emission stock by 2050. The EU Green Bond Standard harmonises and promotes the issue and management of green bonds.\n\nOther sets of regulations and initiatives like the EU Taxonomy currently concentrate, among others, on energy and emissions and establish stricter requirements for companies regarding climate protection activities and the related reporting. Investments not considered sustainable in the sense of the taxonomy are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. Various players – including companies, investors, public institutions and consumers – are called on to accept responsibility and effectively contribute to reaching these goals.\n\nThese ambitious goals are a challenge for the real estate sector because energy consumption and the related greenhouse gas emissions caused by a building over its entire life cycle have a significant impact on the climate balance. In global terms, real estate and construction are the most CO2- and energy-intensive sectors.\n\nNearly 40% of global CO2 emissions and more than one-third of worldwide energy consumption are attributable to the construction and operation of real estate. In spite of a substantial increase in investments and successful results at the global level in reducing the energy intensity of buildings, CO2 emissions from building operations have risen to a historical high of 10 Gt CO2. The real estate and construction sector is, consequently, not on course to decarbonise by 2050 (UNEP 2022). The real estate industry therefore plays an important role – the reduction of energy consumption and the carbon emissions of buildings are essential for the realisation of energyrelated goals.\n\nReal estate developers have a powerful lever to make a valuable, positive contribution in the area of energy and emissions: possible actions involve renewable energies (geothermal power, the installation of photovoltaic or solar energy equipment, inclusion in the planning phase of subsequent refitting and options for the expansion of renewable energy carriers), energy-efficient building shells and technology, low-energy and low-emission building materials (e.g. timber) and the integration of mobility concepts (e.g. e-charging stations). **GRI 3-3**\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4.1.2. Our commitment**\n\nThrough the development of new projects, we create urgently needed living space for society. We are committed to the global agenda and attach great importance to environmentally friendly, resource-conserving and future-oriented construction methods. The carbon footprint of a property can be substantially reduced as early as the planning and construction stage and also through processes required for later building operations. Our attention is therefore directed to low-emission building materials, energy-efficient building design, and the use of renewable energies.\n\nOur commitment to and investments in timber construction are important because of their significant, inherent capability to reduce the carbon footprint. Every cubic metre of wood stores one tonne of CO2 over the long term, while the production of cement and steel is energy-intensive and results in CO2 emissions. The production of the concrete and steel frequently used in building construction is responsible for no less than six per cent of all CO2 emissions worldwide. We therefore evaluate the possible use of the renewable material timber, with its carbon-capturing properties, for every project. Our goal here is to create significantly more than 100,000 m² of office and residential space as a timber hybrid construction by 2025.\n\nThe energy consumption of the buildings developed by UBM (offices, apartments) also has an impact on the environment and is a material cost factor for tenants and users. The energy consumption during building operations can already be reduced during the planning phase. Efficient measures include, among others, good insulation, energy-efficient building technology, the location-based orientation and size of windows, shading equipment, and the energy-efficient regulation of the indoor climate (heating and cooling) with modern sensors.\n\nIn comparison with fossil energy carriers like natural gas or heating oil, the use of renewable energy sources in buildings (geothermal power, photovoltaics, solar technology, etc.) can make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions. This reduction can also be achieved through subsequent refitting or options to increase the use of renewable energy carriers. The possibilities for connection to geothermal power and similar sources, however, must be evaluated when selecting a location and acquiring the site.\n\nOur *green. smart. and more.* strategy places ESG at the centre of our actions along the entire value chain. It is deeply anchored in processes and represents an integral part of all phases. Processes are operationally standardised through an institutionalised 360° principle. As part of the \"Next Level\" efficiency programme, our core and support processes were reviewed on the basis of specific quality gates and defined for the entire UBM Group. These processes were adapted to reflect the strategic focus on *green. smart. and more.* and thereby ensure the implementation of UBM's strategy at the project level. For example: every project must include an evaluation, among others, of the use of timber as a building material, greening and the on-site generation of renewable energy through photovoltaics – as only several examples of the quality gates in our standardised group-wide processes. Additional information on the 360° process landscape can be found in section 6.\n\n# We are building for a greener future – with timber, energy-saving technology and renewable energies.\n\nGreen building certifications are a suitable measurement instrument to make building performance on the real estate market comparable – and to draw conclusions and learn from the results. For many years, we have been actively working to achieve certification for our properties based on this conviction. All new construction projects are sustainably planned, built and subjected to a sustainability assessment. We rely on systems like the ones developed by the German Sustainable Building Council (\"Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen\", DGNB), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). As part of its strategic reorientation, UBM has set a goal to achieve certi\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nfication not only for 100% of its commercial properties, but also for all new projects in the residential asset class – at the latest by 2025.\n\nAs a pure property developer, we cooperate with a wide variety of suppliers and service providers. Our business partners are required to meet the same high standards, for example strict environmental requirements for their production processes and building material components. Environmental protection is also anchored in our code of conduct for business partners (further information can be found in section 6).\n\nEnvironmental aspects at our Group locations are also receiving greater attention. The entire UBM Group was certified in accordance with the international environmental management standard ISO 14001, the quality management standard ISO 9001 and the energy management standard ISO 50001 via a matrix audit. This means that 100% of UBM locations are covered by the certifications. Our binding ethics code, in which the subject of environmental protection is anchored, forms the basis for all business activities and decisions, and compliance is confirmed in writing by our employees (see section 6 for further information).\n\nThe United Nations recommends three steps to achieve climate neutrality: measure emissions, reduce emissions and, finally, compensate for unavoidable emissions. We calculate our emissions based on the internationally recognised Greenhouse Gas Protocol and monitor and report on our performance. One challenge in this respect is the limited availability of data on Scope 3 emissions, i.e. the indirect emissions arising from the purchase, transport or sale of raw materials and other products. In 2023, we calculated UBM's complete corporate carbon footprint (CCF), retroactive for the 2022 reporting year, for the first time. Details can be found on page 74.\n\nIn order to be optimally positioned for the future, UBM established the Smart Building Innovation Foundation (SBIF) in 2022. This non-profit organisation includes partners from industry and science who work together to develop technical applications for smart buildings. Additional information can be found in section 6.3. **GRI 2-23, 2-25, 3-3**\n\n#### **4.1.3. Organisational structure**\n\nWith the Timber Construction & Green Building department, UBM has established a competence centre with six experts to underscore the strategic importance of timber construction. It monitors and assists the operational implementation of green building processes. New national and European requirements are evaluated and implemented at project level in agreement with the *green. smart. and more.* strategy. This department also coordinates the evaluation and organisation of building certification and EU Taxonomy checks for development projects by external partners.\n\nProject managers are responsible for the operational implementation of the green building strategy in development projects. They optimise the projects, e.g. as regards energy, together with external experts based on the alternatives available at the respective location. The implementation of the green building strategy in standing assets and at Group locations is the responsibility of UBM's asset managers. They implement the actions defined by green building to reduce the CO2 emissions from these properties.\n\nAll projects are carefully reviewed and must be approved by UBM's Management Board. **GRI 2-23, 2-24, 3-3**\n\n# **4.1.4. Goals and measures Property development Goals from our sustainability programme:**\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/12 description: The image shows three icons related to sustainable building practices. The first icon depicts three logs stacked on top of each other, with the text \"Timber construction\" below it. The second icon shows a certificate with a leaf growing out of it, with the text \"Green building certification\" below it. The third icon shows a cloud with \"CO2\" written inside it, with arrows pointing downwards, and the text \"Reduction of CO2 by 30%\" below it.\n\nTo reach these ambitious goals, UBM takes specifically defined steps to reduce energy consumption in its projects. Examples are the use of energy-efficient materials for building shells and the installation of energy-efficient technical equipment. The use of timber as a building material makes \n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\na special contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. Targeted actions to implement and improve sustainability best practices makes it possible for UBM to identify and utilise key controls to optimise building performance with regard to energy and CO2 emissions.\n\n#### **Goals and measures in detail:**\n\nTimber construction\n\n- Over 100,000 m² as a timber hybrid construction by 2025\n- For timber (hybrid) construction: CO2 reduction of at least 20% versus conventional construction methods during the production phase of new development projects by 2025\n\nIn order to ensure the correct selection of materials for the construction of buildings, every development project begins with the question: can it be realised with timber construction? The life cycle assessment for every timber construction project must demonstrate savings over conventional construction methods as early as the planning stage. These two quality gates are part of the 360° principle (see section 4.1.2.). The following table provides an overview of UBM's timber hybrid pipeline, whereby the potential for CO2 savings is illustrated by the individual projects. UBM is handling the \"embodied carbon\", i.e. the embedded emissions, during the construction phase by using timber to reduce the CO2 emissions from the building materials.\n\nOne challenge for timber construction is the current lack of specialists in subcontractor companies. The strong dynamics on the timber market were a further source of uncertainty in previous years, but the timber price has stabilised after a speculative phase and this raw material is again available at a reasonable price.\n\n#### **UBM's timber hybrid pipeline**\n\n| Project               | GFA timber hybrid | Asset class      |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| LeopoldQuartier       | 75,700 m²         | Mix              |\n| Timber Factory        | 59,000 m²         | Light Industrial |\n| Timber Marina Tower   | 44,400 m²         | Office           |\n| Timber Living         | 23,200 m²         | Residential      |\n| Timber View           | 18,200 m²         | Residential      |\n| Timber Pioneer        | 17,600 m²         | Office           |\n| Amras                 | 16,600 m²         | Residential      |\n| Timber Port           | 11,800 m²         | Office           |\n| Molenkopf             | 9,800 m²          | Residential      |\n| Timber Works          | 9,700 m²          | Light Industrial |\n| Timber Peak           | 9,500 m²          | Office           |\n| Unterbiberger Strasse | 8,400 m²          | Office           |\n| Timber Praha          | 7,400 m²          | Residential      |\n| Total                 | > 300,000 m²      |                  |\n\nEnergy and CO2 intensity\n\n- Reduction of primary energy requirements to the national \"nearly zero energy building standard\" by 2025\n- Reduction of CO2 intensity by 30% (basis 2019) by 2030\n- Increase in the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 50% by 2030\n\nTo meet its energy and CO2 intensity goals, UBM has defined primary energy requirements for the planning of technical building equipment in all new development projects. The installation of measurement and monitoring systems can lead to the targeted reduction of energy consumption and emissions, for example through intelligent lighting or heating, ventilation and cooling. The durability of buildings, meaning the inclusion of a second or third use in the planning stage, is another important factor: the specific goals set by UBM are reviewed regularly by Life Cycle Assessments (LCA/life cycle evaluations). These planning tools make it possible to determine and, where necessary, optimise the energy requirements and CO2 emissions of buildings from construction to maintenance and dismantling.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe calculation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions is based on the final energy requirements for the respective project.\n\nEnergy intensity depends on the project specifics (asset class, countries) and is therefore subject to fluctuations.\n\n|                                           | 2023      | 2022       | 2021       |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| Total calculated energy consumption [kWh] | 4,395,872 | 11,499,695 | 11,165,679 |\n| % share renewable energy consumption      | 15%       | 15%        | n/a        |\n| GFA of development projects [m²]          | 58,420    | 99,633     | 118,104    |\n| Calculated energy intensity [kWh/m²]1     | 75        | 115        | 95         |\n| Direct/Indirect GHG emissions [t]1        | 1,136     | 3,518      | 3,132      |\n| Intensity of GHG emissions [kg/m²]1       | 34        | 46         | 27         |\n| Property area in total [m²]               | 40,069    | 33,685     | 45,678     |\n\n#### **Energy indicators – real estate development**\n\n1 The decline in energy and GHG intensity is due in particular to the specifics of the asset classes (2023: only residential, 2022: including one hotel). Data source: energy certificates.\n\nBuilding certification\n\n- Certification for 100% of development projects based on DNGB, LEED Gold or BREEAM Excellent as a minimum standard beginning in 2022\n- EU Taxonomy alignment for 100% of new developments in the office asset class by 2022\n\nGreen building certification is a mandatory element of the 360° principle for all new projects. All commercial and residential projects designated for global sales have been evaluated in accordance with internationally recognised certification criteria since 2021. Refurbishments and listed buildings are also certified – e.g. the profiles \"dismantling\" and \"construction site\" were added to UBM's certification programme for the large-scale LeopoldQuartier project in Vienna.\n\nThe following projects were successfully completed in 2023:\n\n- Gmunder Höfe, Section A, Munich\n- Arcus City Phase 1, Prague\n- Rankencity, Graz\n- Noble Residence, Krakow\n\nOur completed projects in 2023 are assigned to the residential asset class. Four residential projects with 58,420 m² of gross floor area (GFA) were completed.\n\nThe projects completed in 2023 were started before the strategic realignment, which is why no certification was carried out.\n\nUBM plans to continue building certification to confirm the sustainability of its property developments. All projects in all asset classes in the pipeline will undergo a sustainability assessment in the future to ensure the attainment of the defined goals over the long term. Moreover, the technical assessment criteria in the EU Taxonomy will be integrated as a requirement for development projects in the office asset class.\n\nImage /page/72/Picture/18 description: The image shows the logos of four different green building certification systems. From left to right, they are: DGNB (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen / German Sustainable Building Council), BREEAM, and LEED (U.S. Green Building Council).\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the classification of certified and uncertified projects:\n\n#### **Development certifications**\n\n|                                       | 2023   | 2022   | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Projects – all asset classes [number] | 4      | 9      | 10      |\n| Office [number]                       | 0      | 3      | 1       |\n| Residential [number]                  | 4      | 3      | 4       |\n| Hotel [number]                        | 0      | 1      | 4       |\n| Mix and Other [number]                | 0      | 2      | 1       |\n| GFA total [m²]                        | 58,420 | 99,633 | 118,104 |\n| GFA certified [%]                     | 0      | 46     | 60      |\n| GFA certified [m²]                    | 0      | 45,511 | 71,032  |\n| GFA not certified [m²]                | 58,420 | 54,122 | 47,072  |\n| Certifications¹ [number]              | 0      | 2      | 6       |\n| DGNB [number]                         | 0      | 1      | 2       |\n| LEED [number]                         | 0      | 1      | 3       |\n| BREEAM [number]                       | 0      | 0      | 1       |\n\n1 The data is based on the absolute number of projects, without an adjustment for double certification.\n\n# **Corporate locations**\n\n**Goals from our sustainability programme:**\n\nImage /page/73/Picture/7 description: The image contains two icons. The first icon shows a lightbulb with a plant inside and arrows circling it, with the text \"Increase in renewable energy\" below it. The second icon shows a car with a plug connected to it, with the text \"Vehicles with alternative drives\" below it.\n\n#### **Goals and measures in detail:**\n\nRenewable energy and energy management\n\n- Increase the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 30% by 2025\n- Establish/optimise energy monitoring at all UBM locations by 2025\n\nTo meet these ambitious goals, UBM is gradually converting its own locations to green electricity suppliers and equipping or refitting these facilities with building management systems to improve energy optimisation and reduce the energy required for heating, ventilation and cooling. One challenge in this area is the availability of green electricity. Renewable energy as a share of UBM's total energy consumption equalled 31% in Austria, 23% in Germany, 45% in Poland and 5% in Czechia (UBM in total: 30%) during 2023. CO2 certificates (Guarantees of Origin) were purchased for the Group's location in Warsaw to neutralise the emissions from electricity consumption due to the lack of low-emission electricity. The contracts for all locations in Germany, Austria, Czechia and Poland will be converted to green electricity, where available, by 2025 at the latest.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nUBM generally relies on district heating for its heating supplies to benefit from the decarbonisation of the national networks and avoid the use of pure fossil energy carriers. Energyefficient LED lighting is also installed when UBM locations are renovated.\n\nUBM has carried out regular energy audits since 2016 in accordance with Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and Directive (EU) 2018/2002 (in Austria, the Energy Efficiency Act; in Germany, the Building Energy Act). All investments over 50% (land, standing assets, new development projects) and locations are covered by these procedures. External energy audits were carried out at the German and Austrian locations in 2019, and verification audits based on ISO 50001 took place in Austria (UBM Development AG and UBM Austria) during 2020 and 2021. The external audit was carried out in Austria in 2023. External audits in Austria, Germany and Czechia are planned for 2024.\n\nAn important process launched by UBM in 2020 and continuously expanded is the transparent and more exact collection of data on energy consumption and emissions. This data will be used to develop further climate protection initiatives in the future.\n\nUBM introduced a central data management tool in 2021, which has been successively filled with E, S and G data since 2022. The goal is to create a useful basis for the definition of internal goals and external evaluations. The tool creates maximum flexibility for data processing and meets all current international sustainability standards. Additional information on this tool can be found in section 3.7.\n\nMotor vehicle pool\n\n Double the number of vehicles with alternative drives by 2025 (basis 2021)\n\nThe petrol and diesel consumption of all Group motor ve hicles has been recorded since 2020 to create a database for defining concrete emission reduction targets. Preference is given to hybrid or electric vehicles when new vehicles are purchased, whereby the decision also involves the availability of suitable charging stations near the employee's home. In 2023, UBM's motor vehicle pool included 38 (2021: 18) vehicles with alternative drives.\n\nTravel\n\nReduce CO2 from air travel by 25% (basis 2019) by 2025\n\nThe Group-wide travel guideline \"think before you travel\" makes clear that business trips should only be undertaken when absolutely necessary. Rail travel must be given preference for shorter distances, shared transport should be targeted, and video conference portals should be used more frequently for meetings. The use of these digital formats has increased substantially as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Since 2022, UBM has received a comprehensive analysis of the CO2 emissions from the travel management providers responsible for its flight reservations. The CO2 emissions from air travel equalled 117 t CO2e (CO2 equivalents) in 2023, which represents a reduction of roughly 77% below the comparative period (2019: 505 t CO2e).\n\n# **Standing assets**\n\n#### **Goal from our sustainability programme:**\n\nImage /page/74/Figure/13 description: The image shows a green icon of a lightbulb with a plant growing inside it. Two arrows are circling the lightbulb. Below the icon, the text \"Increase in renewable energy\" is written in green.\n\n#### **Goals and measures in detail:**\n\nRenewable energy\n\n Increase the share of renewable energy in energy carriers to 30% by 2025\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nUBM is gradually converting its Group locations as well as its standing assets to green electricity suppliers. The W3, a standing asset in Vienna, already purchases green electricity and, in addition to district heating, is also changing over to district cooling. A \"manage to green\" project is currently in progress at the Poleczki Business Park in Poland. It involves the neutralisation of CO2 emissions from the total electricity consumption in 2023 and 2024 through certificates because green electricity is not available at that location. In order to ensure the long-term availability of renewable energy, photovoltaic equipment is currently being installed on the rooftop of one of the office buildings in the commercial park. The share of renewable energy in the standing assets equalled 42% in 2023.\n\nEnergy management and CO2 intensity\n\n- Reduce CO2 intensity by 30% by 2030 (basis 2020)\n- Establish/optimise building management systems for at least 90% of the GFA in all standing assets by 2024\n\nUBM is successively equipping or refitting all standing assets with building management systems (BMS) to improve energy optimisation. Roughly 99% of the GFA in UBM's standing assets were equipped with these systems in 2023. Plans call for the reduction of energy consumption from heating, cooling and air conditioning as well as the CO2 intensity through refitting with highly efficient energy systems and building automation. In addition, UBM issued a Green Lease Framework in 2023. It shows the design possibilities for energy, waste, water consumption, mobility and cleaning and is intended to facilitate building use and management. For our largest standing asset, the Poleczki Business Park in Poland, a catalogue of building-specific energy saving measures was also prepared and is currently being implemented – that represents around 53% of the GFA square metres in UBM's standing assets. This is part of our plans to increase the awareness of our relevant stakeholders for the sustainable use of properties through a greater emphasis on environmentally oriented consumption.\n\nThe CO2 intensity of UBM's standing assets equalled 34 kg CO2e/m2 in 2023 (2022: 23 kg CO2e/m2). **GRI 3-3**\n\n#### **UBM's corporate carbon footprint**\n\nThe Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) provides an overview of a company's direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in tonnes of CO2e (CO2 equivalents) along the entire value chain.\n\nFor 2022, we carried out a complete survey of our CCF for the first time. The entire process of preparing the CCF was supported by external experts, including a review of completeness, correctness and GHG Protocol conformity in accordance with ISO 14071. The results are presented in accordance with the requirements of the scientifically based Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and the Guide to Scope 3 Reporting in Commercial Real Estate. According to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, at least Scope 1 and 2 are considered, and relevant Scope 3 categories should also be included.\n\nA full calculation was carried out again for the 2023 reporting year. This CCF covers the emissions of UBM Development including its investments:\n\n- Project development: four completed projects in 2023, including one renovation.\n- Group locations: seven of the twelve locations in Austria, Germany, Poland and Czechia, at which more than 95% of employees are employed in total (cut-off limit per location: at least 5% of the total workforce must be employed at the location). One investment (UBM hotels, 50%).\n- Existing buildings: six standing assets in Austria, Poland, Czechia and the Netherlands. Undeveloped properties are not relevant for the CCF calculation.\n\nIn accordance with the \"operational control\" approach, the emissions of those companies over which UBM has operational control (i.e. can make operational decisions) are reported in Scope 1 and 2. In Scope 3.15, external investments over which UBM has no operational control are reported (with the percentage of the investment).\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nScopes 3.4, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.14 were identified as not relevant on the basis of UBM's business model and are therefore not reported. For the remaining scopes, measured data (primary data) such as meter readings, delivery receipts or travel records were used where available. Where necessary, estimated data was used (expenditure-based or extrapolations).\n\nThe emission factors were selected to suit the activity, geographical location and time period. In total, the emissions caused by UBM's business activities in 2023 amounted to 22,035 t CO2e. The majority of emissions are attributable to Scope 3 at 78% (Scope 2: 20%, Scope 1: 2%) – a quite typical picture for property developers. Details on the CCF 2023 can be found on the website under \"esg.\" under the \"environment\" menu item.\n\nBased on the CCF, we can identify potential for improvement and measure progress in achieving our targets. In 2023, we submitted ambitious, science-based climate targets to the Science Based Targets Initiative on the basis of the CCF 2022, which were successfully validated in 2024.\n\nImage /page/76/Figure/4 description: The image is a pie chart titled \"Emissions per scope (in %)\". The pie chart is divided into three sections, representing Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions account for 2% of the total, Scope 2 emissions account for 20% of the total, and Scope 3 emissions account for 78% of the total.\n\n#### UBM is committed to\n\n**Scope 3 details**\n\n- reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 42% by 2030 (base year 2022) and\n- achieving Net Zero by 2050 (reducing Scope 1+2+3 emissions by 90% by 2050 from the base year 2022 and neutralising the remaining emissions)\n\nin order to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. UBM is currently developing a concrete transition plan.\n\nImage /page/76/Figure/9 description: This image shows a bar graph with the following data: 3.1 Goods & services: 929, 3.2 Capital goods: 556, 3.3 Energy-related emissions: 45, 3.5 Waste: 526, 3.6 Business travel: 127, 3.7 Employee commuting: 100, 3.8 Upstream leased assets: 331, 3.11 Use of sold products: 8,038, 3.12 End of life: 0, 3.13 Downstream leased assets: 310, 3.15 Investments: 6,250.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **4.2. Recyclability and the durability of building materials**\n\nIn property development, the early planning phase lays the foundation for the ecological footprint and acts as the key to an efficient circular economy. Our planning for structural elements covers, among others, the materials used, their durability and their recycling capability.\n\nThe Austrian Council of Ministers approved a circular economy strategy in 2022, in which the \"9 Rs\" form the core points: refuse, rethink, reduce, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle and recover. The EU Taxonomy anchors, among others, the transition to a circular economy, waste avoidance and recycling (e.g. through regulations covering the hazardous waste from construction and demolition). Investments that fail to meet these requirements are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future.\n\nThe use of environmentally friendly and durable building materials (e.g. timber) creates numerous environmental benefits. They include, among others, the capture of CO2 and a reduction in resource consumption. Timber, as a renewable raw material, stores carbon over the long term and is characterised by high resilience, strength and load-bearing capacity combined with flexibility. Timber also creates time and cost benefits through prefabrication and modular construction, lower transport costs due to reduced weight and increased space through narrower wall construction. And last but not least, timber creates excellent living conditions: wood surfaces equalise humidity and that has a positive influence on the indoor climate.\n\n# With timber construction, we have the largest lever in our hands as a real estate developer.\n\nThe production of steel and concrete, in particular, is carbon intensive, and these materials should be recycled when a building is demolished. Subsequent recycling capacity can be actively included as early as the planning stage, for example through the avoidance of inseparable composites. Timber can be easily recycled – untreated wood can be reused or recycled, while dirtied or treated wood can be used as a renewable energy carrier. These actions illustrate UBM's responsibility for recycling in the sense of the circular economy.\n\nIn the broader sense of the term, this issue also covers measures to ensure the adaptability of buildings over time (e. g. through flexible room design, dynamic usage concepts, scalability).\n\n#### **Goals and measures in detail:**\n\nSustainable building materials and circular economy\n\n Implement circular economy approaches in project development as part of a UBM (pilot) project\n\nUBM's sustainable corporate strategy includes active participation in the development of a circular economy. This also means the use of sustainable and/or recycled building materials, which are evaluated for all projects. A central component of this is a landmark pilot project, in which the innovative \"Madaster\" tool is used. This project underscores UBM's efforts to serve as a pioneer for sustainable construction and resource management.\n\nThe Madaster platform uses a building resource passport to collect, administer and share detailed information on construction materials. The extensive documentation of these materials, their origin and properties will increase transparency in the construction industry. It will also facilitate the realisation of a circular economy by improving and optimising the life cycle of building materials.\n\nIn addition to the pilot project with Madaster, UBM relies on proven concepts like cradle to cradle. This concept is directed to designing products and materials to enable their return to biological or technical cycles. Secondary products are also integrated in construction projects to reduce the dependence on primary resources.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nLife cycle assessments (see section 4.1.2.) are used, above all, for building sections with massive components as well as building sections with different life cycles and renovation cycles. The results of these assessments help UBM to optimise the selection of materials and component assembly and make an important contribution to resource conservation, the reduction of environmentally harmful waste and the return to the materials cycle.\n\nIn the LeopoldQuartier, the demolition of the existing buildings is taking place as sustainably as possible and in line with our *green. smart. and more.* strategy. Special attention is given to recycling and the reuse of building materials, and virtually no landfill deposits are required. Most of the materials are separated mechanically at the site, and high priority is placed on the shortest possible transport routes to the recycling location. And this effort really pays off: nearly 95% of all materials resulting from demolition can be reused. The remaining 5% are hazardous waste (e.g. fluorescent tubes and the like) which must be sent to a landfill in accordance with legal regulations. The LeopoldQuartier was awarded \"Gold\" certification by the DGNB for sustainable building demolition.\n\nActivities are also underway to optimise CO2 emissions over the entire building life cycle at the Village im Dritten project in Vienna's third district.\n\n\"Circular Construction\", a sector research project, was launched in October 2023 to evaluate and improve the applicability of EU Taxonomy criteria to refurbishment projects. The project is backed by UBM together with companies from the real estate sector and representatives from the building materials and building components industry. A core element of the project is the development of a standardised process to analyse the structures scheduled for refurbishment. This will create a broad basis for planning that deals with all goals defined by the EU Taxonomy. The project covers a wide range of reference buildings from various eras, which serve as benchmarks for the renovation of similar buildings throughout Austria. These benchmarks include energy efficiency, the use of sustainable materials and the adaptability to climate change of the selected reference projects. The \"Circular Construction\" project will also identify opportunities for the large-scale recycling or reuse of buildings scheduled for demolition. Refurbishment opportunities are identified and their impact on sustainability is evaluated. The economic efficiency of these plans is evaluated by comprehensive life cycle cost analyses. **GRI 2-23, 2-25**\n\n# **4.3. Ground sealing, climate change adjustments and biodiversity**\n\nUrban development inevitably leads to interference with the local fauna and flora. The direct consequences of construction activity include, for example, the reduction of animal habitats and movement areas, an increase in the air temperature in heavily populated areas, and a decline in the regeneration of groundwater due to lack of direct rainwater seepage and the resulting risk of highwater and flooding. Increased ground sealing changes the microclimate – local temperatures rise and new heat records are set (heat islands) – which can cause serious health problems for the people involved.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy requires, among others, the protection of healthy ecosystems (e.g. through regulations governing construction sites). Investments that have negative effects on the ecosystem are likely to face a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand in the future. Building permits in Austria are granted under sustainability aspects that also cover the issues of ground sealing and biodiversity. At the EU level, a directive for deforestation-free supply chains took effect in June 2023 and prohibits the marketing of goods (including timber and related products) from deforested or damaged forestry areas. Market participants will be required to disclose precise geographic information on usable areas to permit the auditing of compliance with these regulations.\n\nUBM's goal is to avoid the conversion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and, by doing so, limit ground sealing. Preference is given to development projects located in urban areas which have a previous use and, as a rule, are embedded in an existing infrastructure.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nOur value chain for real estate development begins with the purchase of a site. We never use land in protected or sensitive areas for our projects. However, we are well aware that the realisation of greenfield projects is invariably connected with intervention in the ecosystem through ground sealing, the destruction of free space and other aspects. UBM therefore concentrates on brownfield developments to avoid the conversion of natural or undeveloped areas as far as possible and limit ground sealing. Conscious interaction with land as a resource and the creation of valuable outside areas help to improve biodiversity.\n\nIn addition to careful use of land as a resource, the preservation of biological diversity is another important concern. It will be reflected in future projects through rooftops with extensive and intensive biodiverse green areas and facade greening – which will help to reduce the heat island effect in urban areas as well as the heating and cooling load.\n\nThe main elements of UBM's biodiversity agenda are as follows:\n\n- Focus on brownfield developments\n- Biodiversity in designing outdoor facilities\n- Increase in biological diversity through roof and facade greening\n- Ecologically valuable design and non-invasive greening\n\nThe LeopoldQuartier in Vienna, as an example, will include spacious green areas – the developed zones will be reduced by roughly 15% compared with the former setting, which means more than half the property will consist of green areas.\n\n# **Goal from our sustainability programme:**\n\nImage /page/79/Figure/10 description: The image shows a green icon of three buildings of different heights inside of a dashed circle with an arrow curving over the top of the buildings. Below the icon is the text \"Brownfield development\" in a green sans-serif font.\n\n# **Goals and measures in detail:**\n\nBrownfield development\n\n Increase share of brownfield developments in new projects beginning in 2021 to at least 66% by 2025 (cumulative)\n\nAs mentioned above, UBM's acquisition process focuses on brownfield developments (land with existing buildings). Biodiversity has also been integrated into UBM's 360° process landscape. The relevant parameters (tree stock, groundwater, contamination, previous use, etc.) for all asset classes are surveyed and monitored in accordance with the \"Land\" checklist. Our reporting on development projects is based solely on the sealed areas, with a differentiation between greenfield and brownfield. Brownfield developments represent roughly 45% of the 40,069 m² GFA in the nine projects completed during 2023. **GRI 2-23, 2-25**\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Green- & brownfield developments – real estate development**\n\n| Projects                                           | Pipeline<br>2021–2025 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Greenfield developments [number]                   | 9                     | 1      | 2      | 3      |\n| Brownfield developments [number]                   | 36                    | 3      | 7      | 7      |\n| Greenfield developments [total property area [m²]] | 70,301                | 22,079 | 9,617  | 11,038 |\n| Brownfield developments [total property area [m²]] | 188,480               | 17,990 | 24,068 | 34,640 |\n| Greenfield developments [%]                        | 27                    | 55     | 29     | 24     |\n| Brownfield developments [%]                        | 73                    | 45     | 71     | 76     |\n\n2021–2025: according to time horizon of target regarding greenfield/brownfield. Projects that are composed of different phases or building sites are shown separately.\n\n# **4.4. Refurbishment and revitalisation**\n\nThe acquisition of developed land with existing buildings places high requirements on demolition, refurbishment and/or revitalisation. Especially on the commercial property market, signs of a structural transformation are now visible: a growing number of existing/outdated office buildings no longer meet the economic demands of companies, the new work requirements of employees, or the climate policy requirements of investors. We are experiencing a growing gap in the office asset class – on the one side, with increasing vacancies on the mass market and, on the other side, a shortage of available properties in the modern top segment.\n\nThis development is increasing the relevance of refurbishment, revitalisation and conversions. Stricter legal requirements for building demolition can be expected in the future, for example through the consequent separation of construction and demolition waste or the production of qualityassured secondary building materials.\n\nRefurbishment projects are a fixed and steadily increasing component of UBM's real estate development portfolio. In comparison with demolition and subsequent new construction, the conversion and revitalisation of existing buildings involves lower energy consumption and lower carbon emissions – an important ecological aspect that will represent an important criterion in the future. Other resource-conserving benefits include the use of existing infrastructure, a reduction in new soil sealing, less intervention in the existing ecosystems and the preservation of existing building substance. The life cycle of a building is extended as a result, and that means fewer carbon emissions.\n\nIn addition to an increase in projects involving revitalisation, UBM has set a goal to evaluate all refurbishment projects based on sustainability criteria. None of these projects underwent building certification in 2023. Slightly more than 1% of the gross floor area of the projects in the pipeline including 2023 was attributable to revitalisation and refurbishment projects. **GRI 2-23, 2-25**\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Renovation and revitalisation projects – real estate development**\n\n| Pipeline incl. 2023                                 | Type of property | Status    | GFA/number | %    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|------------|------|\n| New construction projects [number]                  |                  |           | 39         | 97.5 |\n| Renovation and revitalisation projects [number]     |                  |           | 1          | 2.5  |\n| Development projects [m²] - total                   |                  |           | 581,639    |      |\n| New construction projects [m²] - total              |                  |           | 573,733    | 98.6 |\n| Renovation and revitalisation projects [m²] - total |                  |           | 7,906      | 1.4  |\n| Noble Residence, Krakow                             | Residential      | completed | 7,906      |      |\n\nProjects that are composed of different phases or building sites are shown separately.\n\n#### **GRI 2-23, 2-25**\n\n# **4.5. Healthy building materials and the quality of life**\n\nThe use of healthy building materials has a positive influence on the indoor climate in UBM's buildings and the comfort of residents, office tenants and hotel guests. The avoidance of harmful substances (e.g. paints, insulating materials, adhesives, synthetic products) can create a pleasant and healthy ambiance for everyone involved. The avoidance and prevention of environmental pollution (e.g. through regulations covering pollutants in paints, insulation, flooring, etc.), among others, are anchored in the EU Taxonomy.\n\nUBM selects the most appropriate quality level for building certification to ensure and confirm the use of healthy building materials. Timber is a particularly important product with regard to living quality and aesthetics: timber surfaces equalise humidity and therefore have a positive influence on the indoor climate. In indoor rooms, timber stands out owing to its pleasant haptics, acoustic properties and atmosphere. This is due, above all, to the fact that timber provides good thermal insulation, and surfaces at room temperature are perceived as comfortable. **GRI 2-23, 2-25**\n\n# **4.6. Water and wastewater utilisation and waste in building operations**\n\nResource conserving water and wastewater utilisation plays an important role in building operations. The recycling of rainwater and grey water as well as water-saving equipment (efficient fittings in kitchens and bathrooms) can reduce the consumption of fresh water. The EU Taxonomy calls, among others, for the sustainable use and protection of water resources (e.g. through requirements for water-efficient fittings and water protection management plans).\n\nWater stress areas are areas in which the demand for water exceeds the supply during a specific period or areas where the usability of existing water supplies is limited by poor quality. In these areas, water stress leads to the deterioration of fresh water supplies for quantitative (overstressing of aquifers, dehydration, etc.) and/or qualitative (pollution, salt intrusion, etc.) reasons. UBM is relatively unaffected by water stress at the present time due to the locations of its business activities.\n\nWe take targeted actions in all cases, even where consumption is primarily influenced by end users.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nOne example is the Mercure Katowice Centrum which was completed in 2021: its 18-metre-high and 260 m2 green facade is much more than a popular exterior symbol of the \"green and clean\" motto. Nearly 7,000 plants root in pockets that are made of recycled materials and mounted on textile panels. This vertical garden is irrigated with rainwater collected in the basement.\n\nWaste management is also important in building operations. The avoidance of waste saves energy and resources, and the organised collection of waste allows for correct material recycling. End users, in particular, also play an important role here by influencing waste generation and separation.\n\nThe following are a few examples of the activities in our standing assets and Group locations:\n\nAt the W3 standing asset in Vienna, the anchor tenant and facility management have implemented a waste management concept.\n\nThe innovative Smart Waste Solutions system created by Hailo Digital Hub was implemented at UBM's Berlin location in 2021. Specifically, the conventional waste bins at employees' individual desks were replaced by central, sensor-controlled collection points and the kitchenettes were equipped with intelligent recycling stations. In the sanitary rooms, waste is now collected in smart individual waste bins which are equipped with wireless communications that allow for mobile, flexible use.\n\nThis solution allows UBM to collect important and very detailed information on waste and, in that way, understand how to reduce the amount of waste and alter disposal behaviour. Dashboards were installed to show the current level of waste volumes in real time. This information builds awareness and increases the motivation to reduce waste. Transparent information provides an ideal basis for discussion and can motivate the team to reduce waste. It can also encourage employees to evaluate their own behaviour. Reusable trash bags are used at the location in Berlin to avoid throw-away plastic bags. In addition, reusable boxes were purchased for employees to use when they order meals at local restaurants instead of causing unnecessary waste with one-way packaging.\n\nA further benefit of the Smart Waste Stations involves cleaning services. The collected data can help to optimise cleaning processes by identifying the ideal waste collection times.\n\nWe also ensure waste separation at our headquarters in Vienna based on an established concept. A digital solution for waste management similar to the one used in Berlin is also in preparation.\n\nPaperless invoices were introduced throughout the Group in 2020. That not only led to a significant reduction in paper consumption but also complements the previously implemented controlling systems. **GRI 2-23, 2-25, 303-1, 306-1, 306-2**\n\n",

We\nsaw the fastest interest rate increase in our generation - and, from zero to 4.5%, one of the most massive\nincreases as well. There were also well over 500 insolvencies in the sector in Germany alone. And what\nwas by far the greatest insolvency in Austria since the Second World War can confidently be described as\na disaster for the sector as a whole. So it is hardly surprising that there is scarcely a real estate company\nthat did not report a loss in 2023.\n\nUBM is no exception here. It is scant consolation that, with write-downs in the region of €70 million, we\n\"only\" sustained a loss of around €40 million before taxes. But glossing things over is not in our DNA. As\na result, we will not be awarding any bonuses to ourselves or our employees and will be recommending\nto the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting that no dividends be paid for the past financial\nyear. We are trying to operate within our means as best possible.\n\nHowever, this not only calls for a turnaround on interest rates and the return of confidence in a transaction\nmarket in which the interests of buyers and sellers are balanced fairly - forced sales have no part in this.\nWe also need to deal with the fact that our products cost too much to build. Of course, this is also related\nto the excessive acquisition costs of the past and the increased interest rates for debt financing. But at the\nsame time, two thirds of total investment costs can be attributed to building and additional costs (with-\nout financing), and only now is efficiency pressure slowly making itself felt in the real estate industry - but\nstill too slowly at present. For real estate developers like us to be able to “produce” more inexpensively,\nnew processes and ideas for building are needed. As well as this, our customers need to become more\nreceptive to standardisation and simplification.\n\nAt UBM, we firmly believe that serial and modular timber construction can be the answer. Relocating parts\nof production from construction sites to factories is a chance to increase efficiency. This is why we have\nset out - with the necessary focus and expertise - to be one of the leading developers of timber construc-\ntion projects in Europe. Not just in the interests of protecting the environment but also in the interests of\nefficiency. At the same time, we need to ask ourselves what our tenants and buyers can still afford. Or in\nother words: what can we leave out without compromising the basic needs of these groups? This issue\nis a socio-political powder keg that goes beyond housing and is becoming a location issue for Europe.\nAction is needed on the part of policymakers, but without the typical calls for state intervention. How\ncan policymakers help to declutter building regulations, cut through red tape and speed up approval\nprocedures? Right now, there is a very real danger of bureaucratic burnout and standstill. Not to mention\na growing chasm between what is standard for existing buildings today and what is required for new ones.\nThis needs to be corrected with a due sense of proportion. Otherwise, a key sector is in danger of losing its\neconomic basis - with far-reaching repercussions for the environment and for society as a whole.\n\nOur team has been working tirelessly in this difficult climate and our shareholders and providers of outside\ncapital have stuck by us - and we would like to take this opportunity to express our wholehearted thanks to\nthem all for this. We promise to maintain the same spirit and momentum throughout 2024 as well.\n\nThe Management Board\n\nsignature\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/0 description: In a sun-drenched forest clearing, four individuals stand together, their attire suggesting a professional setting amidst nature's tranquility.

We are trying to operate within our means as best possible.\n\nreceptive to standardisation and simplification.\n\nINTRODUCTION BY THE MANAGEMENT BOARD\n\nThere is no doubt that 2023 will go down as an annus horribilis in the history of the real estate sector. We saw the fastest interest rate increase in our generation – and, from zero to 4.5%, one of the most massive increases as well. There were also well over 500 insolvencies in the sector in Germany alone. And what was by far the greatest insolvency in Austria since the Second World War can confidently be described as a disaster for the sector as a whole. So it is hardly surprising that there is scarcely a real estate company\n\nUBM is no exception here. It is scant consolation that, with write-downs in the region of €70 million, we \"only\" sustained a loss of around €40 million before taxes. But glossing things over is not in our DNA. As a result, we will not be awarding any bonuses to ourselves or our employees and will be recommending to the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting that no dividends be paid for the past financial\n\nHowever, this not only calls for a turnaround on interest rates and the return of confidence in a transaction market in which the interests of buyers and sellers are balanced fairly – forced sales have no part in this. We also need to deal with the fact that our products cost too much to build. Of course, this is also related to the excessive acquisition costs of the past and the increased interest rates for debt financing. But at the same time, two thirds of total investment costs can be attributed to building and additional costs (without financing), and only now is efficiency pressure slowly making itself felt in the real estate industry – but still too slowly at present. For real estate developers like us to be able to \"produce\" more inexpensively, new processes and ideas for building are needed. As well as this, our customers need to become more\n\nAt UBM, we firmly believe that serial and modular timber construction can be the answer. Relocating parts of production from construction sites to factories is a chance to increase efficiency. This is why we have set out – with the necessary focus and expertise – to be one of the leading developers of timber construction projects in Europe. Not just in the interests of protecting the environment but also in the interests of efficiency. At the same time, we need to ask ourselves what our tenants and buyers can still afford. Or in other words: what can we leave out without compromising the basic needs of these groups? This issue is a socio-political powder keg that goes beyond housing and is becoming a location issue for Europe. Action is needed on the part of policymakers, but without the typical calls for state intervention. How can policymakers help to declutter building regulations, cut through red tape and speed up approval procedures? Right now, there is a very real danger of bureaucratic burnout and standstill. Not to mention a growing chasm between what is standard for existing buildings today and what is required for new ones. This needs to be corrected with a due sense of proportion. Otherwise, a key sector is in danger of losing its\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a wooden wall with the word \"Prologue\" written in the upper left corner.

These planks have several knots and holes, adding to the rustic appearance. Below the planks, there are horizontal logs or beams that are darker in color and more solid in appearance. The logs are stacked on top of each other, creating a layered effect.

The word \"PROLOGUE\" is at the top of the image.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n# A pioneer of modern timber construction\n\n**Hermann Blumer** is a name that many star architects have on speed dial. Hailing from the small Swiss town Waldstatt, he is not only one of the world's leading timber construction engineers, his inventiveness has also been instrumental in the growing trend towards timber construction in cities today. He talks to us about a childhood shaped by the nearby forest and his family's joining yard – and about the international career that only really began when he had already reached retirement age.\n\n6\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/0 description: A portrait of an older man wearing a white shirt and black jacket. The word \"PROLOGUE\" is at the top of the image, and the number \"1\" is at the bottom left.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n**1:**\n\nNothing is impossible. Hermann Blumer is an avant-gardist with unique solutions who finds a way to build seemingly unworkable wooden structures.\n\n#### **2:**\n\nPritzker prizewinner Shigeru Ban worked with Appenzell-born timber engineer Blumer to implement his design for the Centre Pompidou-Metz.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/4 description: This image shows a building with a unique architectural design. The building has a white, tent-like roof structure supported by a wooden frame. The frame is made up of interconnected wooden beams that create a honeycomb-like pattern. The building has large windows and appears to be a public space. A French flag is flying on top of the building. The sky is blue with some white clouds. The number 2 is in the upper right corner of the image.\n\nEven though he recently turned 80, Appenzellborn Hermann Blumer has no plans to slow \ndown. When we meet him, he is on the way \nto Brno to give a lecture on two of the most innovative timber constructions of our time. Structures that, without him, would never have existed in their current form.\n\nPritzker prizewinner Shigeru Ban's design for the Centre Pompidou-Metz was deemed unworkable until inspiration struck Blumer – a trained carpenter and civil engineer – after months of poring over the problem. \"In the end, the solution was quite simple,\" he says modestly. A similar scenario arose with Wisdome Stockholm, an extension of the city's Technical Museum.\n\nHermann Blumer is the troubleshooter of choice when it comes to translating architectural visions into groundbreaking free-form constructions. He is an avant-gardist who finds beauty – and, it would seem, a kind of artistic expression – in sophisticated ways of transferring loads. Not to mention his undeniable gift for winning over other people with his ideas. →\n\n**1**\n\n8\n\n**1**\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### As your family ran a timber construction company, you grew up with wood. What are your earliest memories of this natural onstruction material?\n\nWhen I was a boy, I used to love watching the carpenters cutting the wood in the joining yard or the sawmill operators separating the tree trunks into beams and boards. If the work wasn't too dangerous, I would sometimes even help out. I often went to the woods with my father to saw the barren branches off the fir trees so the wood that grew back would be free of knots. He said that this wood would be there for me later on.\n\n# Was it always a foregone conclusion that you would pursue this kind of career?\n\nYes, I always knew it would have something to do with wood. Building things is clearly in my genes, which drew me to a career as a carpenter early on. Later, I studied steel and concrete engineering at ETH Zurich and got into information technology. After that, I was able to work on a research project at Karlsruhe University determining transverse tensile stresses in curved saddle roof beams. That was what really helped me to develop and gave me the push I needed to get more involved in working with wood.\n\nYou have seen timber construction evolve from being a niche construction segment to the current boom. Did you see this coming at all? No, I didn't anticipate this boom or the appeal that timber construction has today. I used to feel uneasy\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/5 description: The image shows an overhead shot of a modern interior space, likely a building's staircase or walkway.

It was only at Karlsruhe University that I was able to get a better scientific understanding of timber. Even more importantly, I was so fascinated by computer technology that I spent a lot of time programming. Even back in 1969, I was saying that we needed to bring these two areas together: timber and computer science.\n\n#### Which is precisely what gives timber construction a certain advantage today.\n\nYes, I would even say a very significant advantage!

It was laborious but this basic research was enormously important for the later years.\n\n### Why didn't you stay and pursue a career in research?\n\nWhen I had been in Karlsruhe for two years, my father fell ill and I went back home to the company, to continue his legacy. At the time, we had a sawmill, carpentry shop and joinery with around 25 employees. The time spent working together wasn't easy for my father. I was too progressive and constantly called everything into question – and I made a few stupid mistakes too. For example, in 1974 I bought a cabinet-sized computer – a PDP8 from the Digital Equipment Corporation. We were barely able to use it at all because there were hardly any programs for it and, as I said, it\n\ndidn't have a screen.

I worked on that for seven years and when I was on holiday in 1978, I had the breakthrough idea. Something that used to take hours – from planning and calculation to transferring data to the CNC machines – now took a matter of minutes.

Lignatur floor and roof elements are very popular in housing today precisely because they are more versatile than concrete ones.\n\nThe third milestone was the arrival of the Lignamatic CNC machine in 1985 – the idea actually came to me at four in the morning! I was driving from Hanover to Switzerland with mechanical engineer Fritz Krüsi from the neighbouring village of Schönengrund, and the journey developed into a kind of creative frenzy. By the time we arrived home, we had designed the first ever computer-controlled five-axis processing machine. This suddenly opened up entirely new possibilities in timber construction.\n\nThese three milestones were vital in getting us away from the expensive and laborious side of timber construction and ushering in a new era of automation.\n\nYou also performed pioneering work\n\n12\n\ncomputer needed several hours to solve these systems.

What role did that play in the development of timber construction?\n\nChanging the fire safety regulations was actually the fourth milestone that brought about a key turning point in timber construction. The strict fire safety regulations in Zurich only permitted timber constructions with two storeys. Timber faced a lot of discrimination as a construction material back then. We wanted to change that and I started the ball rolling in 1992. Together with Lignum, the umbrella organisation of the Swiss timber industry, we went to the Swiss association of cantonal building insurers and announced that we wanted to make timber buildings more fireproof than concrete and steel buildings. To begin with, they just shook their heads. But it did prompt ETH to begin conducting research, which in turn led to the entire fire safety regulations for timber construction being revised. Switzerland really led the way in opening things up here. \n\n#### **1:**\n\n**Emma Kunz Pavilion** Based on drawings by artist Emma Kunz, Hermann Blumer and his team developed a pavilion in his home town of Waldstatt.\n\n#### **2:**\n\nThe numerous inventions of the 80-year-old engineer provided the impetus behind modern timber construction.\n\n### **3:**\n\n**Wisdome** Blumer supplied the design for a lattice of dowelled beams for the extension of Stockholm Technical Museum.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n»If you want to survive in architecture today, you have to include timber in your designs or you will lose market share.«\n\n14\n\nHermann Blumer\n\n**Skyspace Amarta**\n\nFor American artist James Turrell, the Swiss timber construction pioneer flew to the Maldives and helped to construct the space/light installation made of wood. \n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn spite of the current boom, timber construction accounted for no more than 24% of the Austrian market in 2018, measured in terms of total usable floor area in the building sector. Realistically speaking, where do you see the limits for timber construction?\n\nThe turning points I mentioned earlier threw the market wide open for timber construction – and there is now a clear trend among real estate developers and architects alike. If you want to survive in architecture today, you have to include timber in your designs or you will lose market share. There are a great many public buildings made of timber in Switzerland today.\n\nBut at the same time, you get people asking whether timber isn't more expensive. That's a rather annoying question because it's not all that simple to compare reinforced concrete and steel construction with timber construction. Some benefits of timber construction are overlooked and are therefore not factored into calculations. This kind of tunnel vision has been the bane of my life.\n\n### And what is your prediction for timber construction?\n\nIn the years to come, more and more above-ground constructions around the world will be made of timber because, for ecological reasons, it's the only real option. Timber never used to be seen as a viable option for the future but today the opposite is true: if you're building for the future, you use timber. I can imagine timber construction around the world\n\n**Skyspace Amarta** For American artist James Turrell, the Swiss timber construction pioneer flew to the Maldives and helped to construct the space/light installation made of wood.\n\n14\n\n»If you want to survive in\n\nHermann Blumer\n\narchitecture today, you have to\n\ninclude timber in your designs\n\nor you will lose market share.«\n\nincreasing to as much as a third. You can also see this from the fact that many large contractors are now moving into timber. Previously, nothing was made of wood apart from the concrete formwork.\n\n#### Where do you think the potential of timber construction could be further increased?\n\nWe are already well advanced in the area of construction but when it comes to curative timber construction, for example, it's still early days. In Appenzell, we built the two Mosersweid residential buildings for real estate developer Jan Schoch – larch on the outside and Swiss pine on the inside. These houses are extremely comfortable and there is hardly any need for heating. We are entering a new world where timber is used for more than just supporting or panelling. For example, the wood from Swiss pine actively prevents mould and lowers your heart rate. There are more than 50,000 types of wood in the world. A treasure trove of wood just waiting to be discovered.\n\nYou are regarded as a pioneer of timber construction and have had a hand in many innovative solutions in contemporary architecture. Which ones are you particularly proud of? It was very exciting to work on designs with Shigeru Ban. But it was also very challenging because for every project he came up with a new idea – sometimes almost impossible to implement. People said that it wouldn't be possible to use timber for the Centre Pompidou-Metz. I had\n\na brief meeting with him at the airport and confirmed that it would be possible but had no idea how I would actually go about it. I spent seven months holed up, racking my brains. In the end, the solution was quite simple. And that made all the effort worthwhile.\n\nOther highlights include art projects, some of which appear mystical, like the light sculpture by American artist James Turrell on the Maldives. Or the Emma Kunz Pavilion in my home town of Waldstatt, which I designed together with Norwegian architectural firm Helen & Hard. Emma Kunz was a local artist and alternative practitioner who produced over 500 pendulum drawings on millimetre graph paper, all strictly geometric. My job was to create a walk-in pavilion based on these drawings.\n\n# Wisdome Stockholm, one of the most spectacular timber construction projects of our time, is due to open soon. How did this come about?\n\nArchitects Johan Oscarson and Jonas Elding – together with engineer Florian Kosche – won the competition with a timber gridshell structure. The condition was that timber construction company Stora Enso would provide laminated veneer lumber and cross-laminated timber – in other words, only flat materials. In the planning phase, the project came to me via Blumer Lehmann and I saw that the engineer's proposal was a reciprocal frame, which did not correspond with the grid support structure in the competition →\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: This image shows a close-up of a wooden structure, possibly part of a building's interior.

If we were to make available one cubic metre of timber to each person, this would be like a kind of share (in the financial sense) or – even more so – like a kind of life insurance. At 400 to 500 Swiss francs (around 420-525 euros) a year, this would be an enormous help to many people.\n\nAccording to American biologist Edward O. Wilson's biophilia hypothesis, people have an innate affinity for other life forms like trees. As well as this, it has now been proven that wood has a positive influence on people's health. Doesn't this make building with timber more of an urgent priority?\n\nYes, definitely. The development has already begun in the\n\nbuilding of new hospitals. Shigeru Ban and I are currently involved in a project in this area – a six-storey hospital in Ukraine. It's a fascinating construction, not unlike the Tamedia building. It only consists of pegged timber connections, but this time the construction is made of cross-laminated timber. A local company is providing the elements for this – that's the only way we could offer this solution in the first place.\n\n### Will our connection with nature become even more important in the coming age of digitalisation?\n\n If all we do is stare at our phones and no longer notice the flowers growing by the wayside, then things look pretty dismal for humanity.

The son of a timber construction company owner in Appenzell, he first trained as a carpenter and then went to ETH Zurich to study civil engineering. Between 1971 and 1997, he ran his father's timber construction business before founding Création Holz and focusing all of his energies on developing innovative solutions based on building with timber. As a pioneer of modern timber construction, he has worked with leading architects including Shigeru Ban, Herzog & de Meuron, Peter Zumthor and Daniel Libeskind.\n\n21\n\n20\n\ntimber construction these days?

Wherever feasible in the respective circumstances, UBM uses timber. This focus alone enables the smallest possible carbon footprint for our projects during construction. We lift the burden that is inevitably placed on our environment by steel and cement.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of two weathered wooden planks with a dark gap between them.

Taking the UBM Green Lease Framework as a basis, it is possible to draw up rental agreements that offer sustainable benefits for all involved.\n\nFor instance, besides a reduction in energy and ancillary costs, such agreements enable commercial tenants to implement their corporate sustainability strategy. Lessors also benefit as the building becomes more attractive for lessees with ESG reporting obligations.\n\nThis optimises the relationship between lessor and lessee fundamentally as well. Whereas conventional rental agreements are often restricted to defining individual interests, in the Green Lease both parties agree to sustainability commitments as an overriding goal. This encourages them to work in a partnership that brings longterm advantages on both sides.\n\nOur Green Lease Framework shows starting points and methods for the sustainable utilisation and management of buildings, which results in collective gains for all participants while encouraging open and trusting collaboration. Both parties set their sights on a common interest.\n\n#### **The bigger picture with an attention to detail**\n\nThe UBM Green Lease Framework provides general information and also detailed suggestions on how to achieve more sustainability. It covers all topics of modern building management, up to and including regulations that are specific to a particular building in Green Lease clauses of rental agreements:\n\nSaving energy: Around 28 per cent of global CO2 emissions are produced by the operation of buildings alone. Using renewable energy sources therefore makes a significant contribution towards carbon reduction – and this is implemented by UBM to the greatest possible extent. Energy consumption can be reduced by using an energy monitoring system and smart lighting, and also by switching off equipment.\n\nReducing waste: The Circular Economy action plan was initiated by the European Commission in 2015 to avoid waste. Waste volume and waste separation are also continually monitored during the operation of buildings. Avoiding waste saves energy and resources; sorting waste into individual categories enables technically correct recycling.\n\nSaving water: Resource-friendly use of water and wastewater is vitally important during the utilisation of buildings. As a property developer, UBM includes useful solutions in the area of water consumption. These include the treatment of rainwater and greywater, the separation of drinking and process water, and also water-efficient fixtures, to reduce drinking water requirements considerably.\n\nShaping mobility: UBM develops individual mobility concepts for each project in order to reduce carbon emissions. These include, for example, good public transport connections, electric charging points for cars and bicycles, car sharing and e-bike hire.\n\nOptimising cleaning: One of the many recommendations detailed in the Green Lease Framework is the use of cleaning products with environmental labels such as the Blue Angel or the EU Ecolabel. These do the job while reducing any damage to the environment. In addition, labels that cover the entire product life cycle reveal where packaging waste can be saved.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/46/Picture/0 description: The image shows two brochures standing upright against a white background. The brochure on the left is open, revealing an image of a modern building with green spaces and a logo in the upper right corner. The text \"Green Lease Framework\" is visible at the bottom.

Potential savings can be identified and process optimisation can be triggered with greater precision if exact and informative data is available. Complex or mixed-use real estate inevitably \"produces\" a wealth of information. For this reason, we focus our efforts on the parameters that have already proven relevant to costs, risks or contractual considerations.\n\nMeasuring and counting devices for the consumption of water, heat, cold and power have long been successful in practice. They determine and store figures on each kind of consumption, enabling fair and consumer-friendly billing. Condensed into long-term consumption profiles, this data can also supply valuable reference material on how to achieve even greater efficiency in energy management, for example.\n\n#### **Coming together as a whole**\n\nThe UBM Green Lease Framework also regulates and encourages communication between all involved. For example, it includes plans for either party to provide the other with information soon afterwards if a sustainability issue is detected in the building. Coordination meetings usually take place every three or six months, with problems that occur in-between being solved jointly depending on their size and urgency.\n\nThese range from purely administrative tasks such as monitoring the agreed Green Lease goals, and also complex data evaluations, through to the time-intensive preparation of a sustainability report.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a piece of wood.

This means that we do not just reckon with opportunities for profit, but always have to weigh up the investment risks as well. And just like any company that \"produces\", our economic survival is crucially dependent on being able to sell our projects at a profit. Therefore, the stagnating market in 2023 – marked by a severe reluctance to invest and purchase – hit us hard, as it did many others as well.\n\n#### **The perfect storm fails to subside**\n\nThe fastest increase in interest rates ever experienced, rising construction costs, ongoing inflation fears, the threat of recession and a complete standstill on the transaction market whipped up a perfect storm. This difficult situation resulted in revaluations throughout the entire real estate market and had a serious impact on UBM as well.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Navigating the storm with determination\n\nOver its 150-year history, UBM has repeatedly needed its risk and crisis management skills.

Do women have a different\n\nKarin Sheppard: I think it is important to consider the traits that women and men can learn from each other and therefore bring to their leadership\n\nfemale leadership.\n\nleadership style to men?\n\nMartina Maly-Gärtner: A female leadership style is more inclusive, encourages greater participation and focuses more on sharing information and including employees in decision-making. Women contribute different types of experiences and perspectives to men. And by examining and discussing these different perspectives, you can find the ideal solution.\n\nSheppard: With my current leadership team, the ratio of women to men is 50:50 and I have no doubt that you get the best out of everyone when you bring diversity to the table. Some people prefer to initially listen and reflect, and then only respond afterwards. Others put forward an idea that hasn't been fully thought through. I find a combination of the two works best, drawing on a wealth of different styles and different views. I'm not saying that one is better than the other – rather, it's a question of learning from each other.\n\nSome studies have found that women are often the better choice for leadership positions, particularly in times of crisis. They suggest that a caring outlook, strong communication skills and a willingness to prioritise the common good over personal interests will help lead a company through a crisis with calm and composure. Do you see it that way as well?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: Particularly in times of crisis, it is enormously important to move together, work together and communicate with one another. Clear and transparent communication is definitely a key factor here. Female leaders generally tend to express this a little more than men.\n\nSheppard: No one of us demonstrates a unilateral style, and I think this comes back to my point that there is value in a wealth of different styles and approaches. For me, clarity and empathy were my mantra in all communications during the Covid-19 crisis, especially in new virtual environment. I learned very quickly how important it is to be able to read emotion on a screen during video conferences and to take the time to call someone and ask them if they are OK. I also know that as a leader, I have to be able to balance that out with decisiveness and assertiveness which are traits that are perhaps seen as traditionally male. My point being is that we have to be a mix of styles to be at our most effective.\n\n### Gender equality in leadership positions still seems to be a long way off. Why is it so important?\n\nSheppard: It is difficult to fully perceive why this may be the case, and the reality is that there are so many barriers facing women in the workplace – even today. It is important that we focus on policies and practices that will advance opportunities and development for women. For example, our RISE programme enables female colleagues seeking hotel leadership roles with mentoring and networking. This is going from strength to strength with cohorts in all of our regions globally, with more than 200 graduates. Our Lean In employee network membership has also grown, providing a voice to female colleagues and their allies who consult the business on measures that support a diverse and inclusive workplace. This can range from how we encourage gender and ethnically diverse recruitment shortlists, to ensuring our market-specific leave policies are regularly evaluated to support women and their families through life changes. Most recently, our UK partnership with Busy Bees provides our corporate and managed hotel colleagues a 20% discount on childcare fees.\n\n### What do you think of having a quota for women for certain leadership positions, for example on supervisory, executive or management boards?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: Fundamentally speaking, a woman should get the job if she is qualified for it. Unfortunately, we still need quotas to help speed up this process. UN Sustainable Development Goal Number 5 \n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n# »Particularly in times of crisis, it is enormously important to move together, work together and communicate with one another.«\n\nMartina Maly-Gärtner\n\nsays that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but also a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. We know the qualities and the potential of diverse teams, and we need to work hard to achieve gender equality. This change is only possible if the top level of a company is on board and if a suitable corporate culture exists and is put into practice.\n\nSheppard: I think targets can provide a positive ambition, but to me the main focus should be focusing on diverse slates and how we are supporting women in the organisation to further their career. The challenge is that I would never want anyone to think that women are in a certain position just to make up the numbers.\n\nDo you think it is possible for women in leadership positions to work parttime to balance their career with family commitments? Or maybe to job-share? For example, two female general managers working parttime to ensure a general manager is on-site seven days a week?\n\nSheppard: Yes, flexible working, part-time working and job-sharing are all good ways to remove at least some of the obstacles for women. Generally speaking, women are very suitable for models like these, as they are a little less concerned with ego\n\nand more focused on the practical considerations.\n\nMaly-Gärtner: In my experience, women coming back from maternity leave to work part-time are extremely motivated. They have been looking forward to returning to a business environment, work very efficiently and try to make things happen.\n\n### What has been your personal experience with female leadership? Have you ever encountered obstacles in your career path?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: I'd like to answer this question by giving advice to my younger self: Be more self-confident – because women tend to doubt themselves even though they deliver results! Don't let it get to you when you make mistakes. Learn from them and move on. Speak your mind. You need to find the right time and the right tone, but contribute your thoughts.\n\nSheppard: I have had the same selfdoubt, but I've been very fortunate in that I have always had people supporting me. Self-doubt has its positive benefits as well, though. Humility is a great trait to have if it's used in the right way.\n\nIn 2023, the InterContinental Hotels Group was ranked second out of 850 companies around the world among the Financial Times Diversity Leaders – beaten only by the Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso Group. What were the key points where you outperformed your peers?\n\nSheppard: It was an absolute delight to get an award like that, particularly as it's based on an employee survey. I have no doubt that this is a direct result of the initiatives that we have implemented over the last few years. But I imagine what tipped the balance in our favour was the cultural shift that we have initiated in our company. It's not just about female leadership, but about diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities in all areas and for all people. For instance, we march loudly and proudly in the pride marches in more and more countries. We take on interns from diverse ethnic backgrounds and of all abilities. At IHG, there is genuine intent in bringing about this cultural shift and enough impatience to make sure that it happens. We have achieved a lot already but there is a lot more to do.\n\n# Are women's networks a means of strengthening women in leadership positions?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: Mentors are important, they have shaped my career. And there's no need to be scared of networking events – because at first, it's just a question of stepping out\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/0 description: A woman with blonde hair is standing in a forest.

For example, there's a women's real estate network in Austria called Salon Real. This network has really helped me because sometimes I reach for my phone and ask one of my female colleagues for advice – and sometimes other women call me.\n\n### Does female leadership need the support of men too? Do men have to support women for there to be a greater number of women in leadership positions?\n\nSheppard: Any cause must have allies to be successful and the support given to women by men is very important. When we first launched our initiative to have more women general managers in Australia, we had to make sure it wasn't seen as something that was excluding the men. Instead, we needed to communicate why there was a need for this initiative. And suddenly our area general managers in this region – who were all men back then – became sponsors and mentors and spoke about why this was important for them personally. For example: \"I have a daughter and I want the world to be different when she enters the workforce.\" Or: \"I have a sister and I know what she's\n\nbeen struggling with.\" So they had their own very personal reasons and were wonderful support for the young women coming through. Female leadership should never be seen as a kind of divisive movement – it's about ensuring the best for everyone.\n\nMaly-Gärtner: An important message to men is: don't think women want to take over the world. Recognise the leadership qualities of women and be aware that diverse teams are more successful.\n\nModeration: **Tanja Milner**\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a piece of wood with the word \"Epilogue\" written in white at the top left corner.

Today, Mette Kynne Frandsen (63) is one of Denmark's most prominent managers and an important female role model in an industry that is still dominated by men. In 2019, she received the Knight's Cross from Queen Margrethe II in recognition of her services to architecture. Like many people in Copenhagen, she gets about the city by bicycle. After the interview, she hops on her silver sports\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/0 description: The image shows a construction worker on a blue lift working on a wooden structure. The word \"EPILOGUE\" is at the top of the image.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/82/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a wooden structure, possibly the interior of a building or a large architectural element. The structure is made of light-colored wood, with a visible grain pattern and small knots. The wood is arranged in a series of beams and supports, creating a geometric pattern of intersecting lines and angles. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the texture and color of the wood. The overall impression is one of warmth, naturalness, and structural complexity. At the bottom of the image, there is some text that says \"World of Volvo.\"\n\n**World of Volvo.** The new visitor centre for automobile manufacturer Volvo shows timber construction at its finest.\n\n78\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nThere has been much discussion about structural disadvantages for women in architecture, most recently prompted by a book by German architect Karin Hartmann called \"Black Turtleneck, Round Glasses\". Even though more women have graduated in architecture than men for some time now, they are far less likely to be found in decision-making positions. As one of the most important managers in Denmark, you are living proof to the contrary. What were the decisive prerequisites and turning points in your career that led you to where you are now?\n\nMette Kynne Frandsen: I have been with Henning Larsen for 30 years now. That's quite a long time! For young people today, staying with the same company for 30 years might not be something to aspire to. But I didn't plan it that way. When I started out, there were around 50 of us in the Copenhagen office. As well as working on competition designs, I started taking on more and more project management tasks. As I had studied architecture, I had a very solid technical background but didn't know much about management. So I suggested to Henning Larsen that I study for an MBA for two years and he welcomed the idea. When I had almost completed it, he came to me and said: \"OK, Mette, now that you've had the training, you can take over the management of the company.\" This unconditional support meant an awful lot to me. It was the basis for my whole development after that.\n\n### Were there role models for female managers back then?\n\nTo be honest, there weren't many role models at the time, just over 20 years ago. But Henning Larsen was a role model for me in the way he worked as an architect, especially in the cultural sphere. As he wasn't all that well versed in finance and personnel management, there was a space in the company that I could fill. On this basis, we developed a great working relationship and were able to set about implementing the changes that were planned for the company.\n\n### What changes were these?\n\nAt the time, Henning Larsen was approaching old age. This meant that we were planning a generation change and also wanted to get more partners on board. As well as this, we needed to realign our company's culture, which until then had been shaped solely by Henning. How do you take a company that has been founded by just one very strong personality and steer it towards the future? It was perfectly clear to me that we needed both women and men if we wanted to be successful in the long term. Today, the ratio of women to men in our company is 50:50, including at management level. It's always important to have the right balance, but I think we have really strong female architects and leaders here at Henning Larsen.\n\n# What would you consider the greatest successes in your career?\n\nToday, Henning Larsen is an international company with a broad \n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\npositioning, and is foundation-owned. Rather than just managing international projects from our Copenhagen base, we have set up studios in other regions. We now have offices in New York, Singapore, Berlin, Munich, Oslo and Sydney. That means we are a global organisation and a global community. I firmly believe that the diversity that comes from having as many different voices as possible outside Copenhagen as well is enormously important for design. 60% of our revenue today is generated from projects outside Scandinavia. And I am very proud of that.\n\nWe took another strategically important step four years ago when we became part of the Ramboll Group, a major engineering and consultancy company. Our shared vision is to create sustainable cities and buildings that answer the global challenges. We made this move because, even though we were active internationally, we were still too small to take on legal or financial experts in all these countries. This means that we are still active in architecture and urban planning under the Henning Larsen brand but, with Ramboll, we have a network that supports us in many areas as well. Here, we also benefit from our foundation model, where profit is invested back in the company. Our Innovation and Sustainability department has increased fivefold during this time, which is something that benefits all projects in many different ways. That really helped us to step up our innovation.\n\n### What developments do you envisage for Henning Larsen and architecture in general in the next ten years?\n\nI would like to see Henning Larsen flourish without me in ten years' time. (laughs) Because I'm pretty sure that I won't be here to celebrate my 40th anniversary. But one of our goals is for Henning Larsen to grow as a global community and to become an even stronger partner in sustainability that advises and inspires its clients – regardless of where in the world we are working. Apart from that, we are currently in a transformation period due to the urgent need to address climate change. So in ten years from now, our designs will be very different – you can even see the changes happening now. We are moving away from being a company that used to be mainly interested in new-build projects and towards one that will focus more in future on working with existing buildings. And this really stimulates creativity.\n\n### Where exactly can these changes be seen?\n\n A transformation in construction systems is beginning, and the use of biogenic building and insulation materials is starting to take off. Another change is the close collaboration between architects and landscape architects. This not only affects the way we design buildings but also has an impact on urban planning as a whole. In my position, I am seeing a growing awareness among politicians and clients about how important this collaboration is for all of our lives.\n\nUnder Frandsen's leadership, the firm Henning Larsen received the Mies van der Rohe Award, which is a prize presented by the European Union for contemporary architecture.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/0 description: A woman with short dark hair and glasses is standing in the corner of a room with her arms crossed.

In Copenhagen, politicians were also instrumental in driving forward the concept \n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/0 description: The image shows an architectural rendering of a city.

In this way, we were able to inspire others and to put our well-tried solutions into practice in projects outside Denmark. Many cities are currently revising their mobility concepts. Needless to say, this is an enormous investment, but I think we will see a huge transformation in our cities in the next ten years.\n\nI often travel to our global studios and can see the differences in the cities with my own eyes. Last week, I was in New York visiting our team, and I called my two daughters and said: \"Do you know how lucky you are as young mothers in Denmark? You can take your children to kindergarten and easily bike to work.\" In the US, thanks to differences in urban planning, it can be very difficult for women, and working in the architectural sector is no exception. Of course, we can't change the whole system there, although I can try to provide as much support as possible for the female architects in our New York office.\n\nToday, you often hear people using the terms \"compact city\" and \"city of short distances\" – a concept that feminist city planners were already advocating back in the 1970s. Can you give an example of an urban development project where this was used?\n\nFor example, our master plan for Downsview in Toronto is a huge project that is to be implemented over the next 50 years. Instead of planning cities with a business quarter and residential area, we are breaking up the area into local communities and neighbourhoods. Ten years ago, master plans were really about structures and mega-cities but today the focus is much more on people and community. With this project, there was a large-scale community engagement process beforehand, where people were able to get involved directly. All of this input is reflected in the master plan. The infrastructure is set up to allow people to move about as easily and safely as possible within\n\nthe neighbourhoods. The way that we work today – working from home to a greater extent – has also influenced urban planning.\n\n### What project are you particularly proud of at Henning Larsen?\n\nThings have changed quite a bit in this regard over the years. Ten years ago, we were particularly proud of the iconic buildings like the Opera House. But if you were to go around the office today and ask people that question, you would find they are most proud of the small, innovative projects. For example, Feldballe School, which came about through a cooperation between philanthropic organisation Realdania and a start-up that wanted to launch a façade element made of straw and timber. We implemented this project and succeeded in scaling up the biobased construction system. And now a logistics centre in the Netherlands – the largest anywhere in Europe – is going to be built in the same way as\n\n**1**\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/88/Picture/0 description: A man wearing a green baseball cap and a blue jacket is looking at a wooden box filled with straw.

How important is open-source thinking in your company?\n\nAs we all have the same goal – to have a positive influence on the future of our planet – sharing knowledge is enormously important. We can inspire and learn from one another. Some of our biggest competitors are now our best partners in certain areas. This is a development that I am very happy about.

For example, we can use new technology to reduce the amount of concrete used in buildings. In the past, we poured lots of concrete into buildings to meet the structural requirements – these days, we can use parametric design to optimise the amount of concrete we use. Right now, the price of recycled bricks has escalated because there is a severe shortage. With bio-based materials, there is no end of smart innovations and there is also great interest from investors who recognise the potential they offer. I think it will be important to strike a healthy balance between construction materials in future.\n\nTo date, there has often seemed to be two separate categories for buildings; they were either\n\n**1**\n\n88\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nsustainable or iconic. Henning Larsen regularly succeeds in combining the two – take for example the new World of Volvo visitor centre in Gothenburg, the planned Ørestad Church in Copenhagen, or Prague Central Station. How do you manage that? For a start, timber construction is suddenly opening up whole new design opportunities and freedom – exploring these has been enormously inspiring for the architects. On the other hand, you need the latest digital tools for these forms. Without these, projects like World of Volvo would never have been possible. The great success of this project is also due in no small part to the collaboration between our designers, digital experts and the timber construction engineers and producers.\n\nAs it happens, I was visiting the facilities of Austrian company WIE-HAG when the huge, curved glulam beams were being produced for World of Volvo. That was really impressive.\n\nWhen I was training as an architect, visiting construction sites was an important part of the process. How is a building actually constructed? What exactly does a carpenter do? We had a lot of hands-on knowledge. And this knowledge fell by the wayside a little with the rise of digital design. However, the new construction materials are once again arousing the interest of architects in production processes. I think it's very healthy to have this connection.\n\nJust like the emergence of the \"form follows function\" principle at\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/9 description: This image shows a winter scene with a building in the background and a crowd of people in the foreground.

The dividend payment for the 2022 financial year was approved and the necessary authorisation was passed by the Annual General Meeting during the first half of 2023. In view of the current situation caused by interest policies, discussions by the Supervisory Board and Management Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on 9 April 2024 determined that the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 financial year would not be advisable. The waiver of the dividend will be presented to the Annual General Meeting as a precautionary measure considering the development in the sector and as solidarity towards all UBM stakeholders. This decision does not represent a reversal of UBM's continuous dividend policy, which generally focuses on a distribution rate of 35% to 50% but instead reflects the economic situation.\n\n#### **Bonds**\n\nUBM had three bonds and one hybrid bond as well as five promissory note loans and bearer bonds under Austrian law outstanding as of 31 December 2023. In March 2023, UBM prematurely repaid hybrid capital of €52.9m from the hybrid bond issued in 2018. The outstanding €91.05m of the UBM bond 2018 (3.125% UBM bond 2018–2023) was repaid in November 2023, and a new bond was issued during the reporting year. As part of UBM's Green Finance Framework, the first green bond (volume: €50m) was successfully placed in 2023. An overview of the outstanding bonds together with the respective terms, nominal value, coupon/margin and interest payment dates can be found on the following page.\n\n#### **Investor relations**\n\nContinuous dialogue as well as transparent and timely information represent the core of UBM's communications strategy, which is designed to enable all investors to form a fair and realistic picture of the company. This also applies, in particular, during a difficult market environment. UBM's investor relations activities are focused not only on contacts with existing investors, but also on the acquisition of new long-term investors. In previous years, UBM took part in numerous meetings with investors and analysts in the major European financial centres. Nearly all of these meetings were held virtually in the first half of 2023, while some of the conferences took place in a hybrid format. The second half of the year brought an increase in on-site roadshows, which took place in Vienna, Frankfurt and Milan.\n\nIn addition to the investor events, the press conference on 2023 and the 142nd Annual General Meeting also included the direct attendance of shareholders. UBM reports regularly on its business performance in quarterly telephone conferences with analysts, institutional investors and banks as well as through press releases and social media to keep all stakeholders up to date.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Free float – geographical split (in %)2 Shareholder structure (in %)**\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/2 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of ownership. 49.2% is Free float, 38.8% is Ortner/Strauss syndicate, 7.0% is IGO Industries, and 5.0% is Jochen Dickinger.\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/3 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. 78% is attributed to Austria, 10% to Other Europe, 2% to Other, and 10% to Germany.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Incl. shares held by the Management and Supervisory Board (3.0%) —\n\nThomas G.

The Management Board and Supervisory Board work closely together in the interests of the company and its employees to continuously evaluate and coordinate the strategic orientation of the UBM Group. An ongoing dialogue with the relevant interest groups builds trust and creates the basis for sustainable growth in the future. One of UBM's top priorities is to develop and improve its standards for responsible and sustainable corporate management.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board issued a joint formal declaration in August 2016 which commits the UBM Group to compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. Section 267b of the Austrian Commercial Code requires UBM, as a listed parent company whose shares are traded on a regulated market, to produce a consolidated corporate governance report as defined in Section 1 (2) of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act of 2018. As the UBM Group does not have any listed subsidiaries, the necessary disclosures are limited to the information required by Section 243c of the Austrian Commercial Code and included in the appropriate sections of this corporate governance report. UBM shares have been listed in the Prime Market, the premium segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange since 22 August 2016. This listing formally commits UBM to adherence with increased standards for transparency, quality and publication. UBM is committed to compliance with the behavioural rules defined by the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance – with reference to the deviations listed below in the comply or explain catalogue – and sees the code as a key precondition for responsible corporate management. The latest version of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, as issued by the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance, is available to the general public on the organisation's website under www.corporate-governance.at.\n\nThis corporate governance report is published as part of the annual report and is available on the Group's website under www.ubm-development.com, in the submenu investor relations/financial reports or under corporate governance. In accordance with C-Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the Supervisory Board also conducted a self-evaluation during 2023. The questionnaire used for the evaluation addressed, in particular, the efficiency of the Supervisory Board, its organisation and its working procedures. The findings were evaluated and discussed by the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Comply or explain catalogue**\n\nC-Rule 27: In accordance with C-Rule 27 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the company's current remuneration policy states that the remuneration for each of the Management Board members must include fixed and variable components as required by the applicable legal regulations. The variable, performance-based remuneration components are designed to reflect shareholders' interests in the positive development of the company and increase the Management Board's motivation to take actions which lead to the sustainable, long-term and risk-aware optimisation of Group results. Annual variable remuneration is dependent on the attainment of parameters set by the Supervisory Board, which are based on financial or non-financial criteria or a combination of both. The inclusion of non-financial criteria is not mandatory for determining the amount of variable remuneration in order to support the objectiveness, transparency and plausibility of remuneration. The remuneration policy does not include the possibility of demanding the payback of variable remuneration components (\"clawback\") because this is not required by law and because civil law provides sufficient grounds for the right to claim the return of payments which were based on obviously false data.\n\nC-Rule 27a: The contracts with the Management Board members prior to the implementation of the current remuneration policy follow the legal regulations in effect at that time and, therefore, do not include a specific provision that would limit \n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nseverance compensation for the premature termination of their function without good cause to not more than twice the total annual remuneration and not more than the remaining contract term. Moreover, these contracts currently do not specify that severance payments will not be made when a Management Board contract is terminated prematurely with good cause. The Management Board contracts do not contain any provisions which would require consideration of the circumstances under which a member leaves the company and the economic position of the company in the event of premature resignation. Compliance with C-Rule 27a of the Austria Corporate Governance Code was not yet in the foreground when the existing Management Board contracts were concluded. C-Rule 27a of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance was implemented for the first time in 2021 in preparing the new employment contracts for the Management Board.\n\nC-Rule 38: The job profile and procedure for appointing Management Board members are established on a case-bycase basis. The Supervisory Board defines a job profile when a Management Board position is to be filled, whereby particular attention is paid to the individual candidates' qualifications, experience and industry knowledge. A formally defined appointment procedure and general job profile are not used in the interests of the company because this could exclude candidates from appointments to the Management Board in spite of their exceptional qualifications and outstanding industry knowledge.\n\nC-Rule 49: In line with legal regulations and L-Rule 48 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the Supervisory Board is required to approve all contracts with its members which commit these persons to performing a service for the company or a subsidiary outside their activities on the Supervisory Board for compensation that exceeds an immaterial value. The company does not, however, publish the related details for operational and confidentiality reasons. Moreover, the notes to the consolidated financial statements of UBM Development AG include disclosures on related party transactions; these disclosures cover the remuneration for services by companies in which a Supervisory Board member holds a position on a corporate body and/or an investment outside his or her activities on the Supervisory Board of UBM Development AG.\n\nC-Rule 83: UBM Development AG arranged for an evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management by an auditor who is not also responsible for auditing the annual financial statements. This decision is intended to award two separate audit contracts covering different subjects to different experts. The dual control principle is further strengthened, above all, through the independence of the auditor. A tender process led to the selection of PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH as the best bidder, and this firm was subsequently commissioned to evaluate the risk management system.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Members of the Management Board**\n\nThomas G.

During the interim period from 1 July 2023 to 31 October 2023, the Management Board had three members. The Supervisory Board can designate one member as chairperson and one member as deputy chairperson of the Management Board and can also appoint deputy members (within the defined range of two to six persons). If one member is appointed as chairperson of the Management Board, he or she casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie. The members of the Management Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a maximum term of five years, whereby the renewal or extension of this appointment (in each case, for a maximum of five years) is permitted. The Supervisory Board can dismiss a member of the Management Board before the end of his or her term in office for an important reason, i.e. for a serious breach of duty or if the Annual General Meeting passes a vote of no confidence in the Management Board member. The Management Board is required to conduct its business activities in line with the rules defined by the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the Statutes, other laws and the rules of procedure. The Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the assignment of Management Board responsibilities while, at the same time, maintaining the overall responsibility of the Management Board. The Management Board requires the prior approval of the Supervisory Board before entering into the transactions listed in Section 95 Para. 5 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (current version). To the extent permitted by Section 95 Para. 5 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board sets monetary limits for transactions which do not require its approval. The Supervisory Board is also entitled to add additional transactions to the list of legally defined cases which require its approval (Section 95 Para. 5 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act). The Supervisory Board is required to issue appropriate rules of procedure for the Management Board, and the Management Board must report regularly to the Supervisory Board on its activities.\n\nActivities on behalf of the company must represent the principal occupation for the members of the Management Board. They must manage the company's business with the care of responsible and conscientious managers and in accordance with the interests of shareholders, the staff and the general public.

The company can also be represented by two authorised signatories, with certain legal restrictions. Any deputy Management Board members have the same rights of representation as regular Management Board members.\n\nThe above table lists the Management Board members, their dates of birth, their positions, the date of their initial appointment and the expected end of their term in office.\n\n#### **Supervisory board positions or comparable functions in Austrian or foreign companies (which are not included in the financial statements):**\n\nThomas G. Winkler, Martina Maly-Gärtner and Patric Thate do not serve on a supervisory board or hold a comparable function in an Austrian or foreign company (that is not included in the financial statements). Martin Löcker did not exercise any such functions up to his premature resignation from the Management Board of UBM Development AG on 30 June 2023. Peter Schaller serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of SK Sturm Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH.\n\n#### **Executive and non-executive board positions in material subsidiaries:**\n\nThe Management Board members Thomas G. Winkler, Peter Schaller, Martina Maly-Gärtner and Patric Thate have executive functions in individual project companies, but do not hold any executive or supervisory board positions in material subsidiaries. This also applies to Martin Löcker up to his premature resignation from the Management Board of UBM Development AG on 30 June 2023.\n\n### **Supervisory Board**\n\nThe UBM Supervisory Board is composed of members elected by the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Works Council is authorised by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act to delegate a specific number of members to the Supervisory Board. Section 9 of the Statutes states that the Supervisory Board must have a minimum of three and a maximum of 12 members elected by the Annual General Meeting. In 2023, the Supervisory Board had eight members elected by the Annual General Meeting plus four additional members designated by the Works Council as employee representatives.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are elected up to the end of the Annual General Meeting which votes on the release from liability of the Supervisory Board for the fourth financial year after their election unless the Annual General Meeting specifies a shorter term for one or all of the elected members; the financial year in which the Supervisory Board member is elected does not count towards this term. The re-election of a board member is permitted, also for resigned members. If an elected Supervisory Board member resigns before the end of his or her term, a substitute must only be elected at the next Annual General Meeting. However, an Extraordinary General Meeting must be held within six weeks to elect a substitute if the number of Supervisory Board members falls below three. A substitute member is elected for the remaining term of the former Supervisory Board member, unless decided otherwise by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting can recall a Supervisory Board member before the end of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple majority of the votes cast. Any member of the Supervisory Board can resign, without due cause, by notifying the chairperson of the Supervisory Board in writing, subject to a notice period of 21 days. This notice period can be shortened by the chairperson of the Supervisory Board, or a deputy in the event the chairperson resigns.\n\nA substitute member can be elected concurrently with a regular Supervisory Board member, whereby the substitute would fill the seat effective immediately if the Supervisory Board member resigns before the end of his or her term. If multiple substitutes are elected, the order in which they are to replace a resigning Supervisory Board member must be determined. A substitute member can also be elected for multiple Supervisory Board members to fill a seat on the Supervisory Board if any of these members steps down \n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nprematurely. The term of office of a substitute member ends with the election of a successor to the former Supervisory Board member or, at the latest, with the end of the term of the former Supervisory Board member. If the term of office of a substitute member ends because a successor to a former Supervisory Board member has been elected, the substitute member can still serve as a substitute for the other Supervisory Board members he or she has been chosen to represent.\n\nThe Supervisory Board elects a chairperson and one or more deputies from among its members each year at a meeting held after the Annual General Meeting. If there are two deputies, the order in which they are to substitute for the chairperson must be determined. Their terms of office end with the next Annual General Meeting. A replacement must be elected immediately if the chairperson or one of the elected deputies resigns. If, in this election, no candidate receives a simple majority of the vote cast, a run-off must be held between the persons who received the most votes. If the run-off results in a tie, lots will be drawn to decide the election. If the chairperson or one of the elected deputies resigns, the Supervisory Board must immediately hold a new election to appoint a successor. The chairperson and deputies can resign at any time by notifying the Supervisory Board in writing and in keeping with a 14-day notice period; however, they are not required to resign from the Supervisory Board at the same time.\n\nEvery deputy chairperson has the same rights and responsibilities as the chairperson he or she represents. This also applies to casting the decisive vote for resolutions and in elections. If the chairperson and his deputies are prevented from carrying out their duties, this obligation passes to the oldest Supervisory Board member (in terms of age) for the duration of the impairment. Declarations of intent by the Supervisory Board and its committees must be submitted by the chairperson of the Supervisory Board, or by his deputy if he or she is incapacitated.\n\nThe Supervisory Board issues rules of procedure in line with the responsibilities defined by law and the Statutes. Resolutions by the Supervisory Board on its rules of procedure require a simple majority of the members elected by the Annual General Meeting and must also comply with the general requirements for resolutions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board can form committees from among its members. Their responsibilities and powers as well as their general rules of procedure are determined by the Supervisory Board. The authority to take decisions can also be delegated to the committees, which can be established as permanent bodies or for individual tasks. The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board are entitled to designate voting members to the committees based on the ratio specified by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act. This does not apply to meetings and voting which involve relationships between the company and the Management Board members, with the exception of resolutions on the appointment or recall of a Management Board member as well as resolutions to grant options in company shares.\n\nThe Supervisory Board passes resolutions in its regular meetings. These meetings are to be held as often as required by the interests of the company and at least once each quarter. Five regular Supervisory Board meetings were held in 2023. The chairperson determines the form of the meeting, the way in which resolutions are passed outside of meetings and the procedure for counting votes. The Management Board members attend all meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, unless otherwise decided by the person chairing the meeting.\n\nA member of the Supervisory Board can designate another member in writing to represent him or her at a meeting. A member represented in this way is not included in determining the quorum for the meeting. The right to chair the meeting cannot be delegated. A member who is unable to attend a meeting of the Supervisory Board or its committees is entitled to submit his or her vote on individual agenda items in writing through another board or committee member.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is considered to have a quorum when all members have been correctly invited to attend and when at least three members, including the chairperson or a dep-\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Members of the Supervisory Board**\n\n| Name                | Date of birth | Position     | Member since | Appointed until |\n|---------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Karl-Heinz Strauss1 | 27.11.1960    | Chairman     | 14.4.2011    | AGM 2024        |\n| Iris Ortner2        | 31.8.1974     | Deputy Chair | 14.4.2011    | AGM 2024        |\n| Klaus Ortner4       | 26.6.1944     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Ludwig Steinbauer3  | 26.10.1965    | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Paul Unterluggauer  | 28.4.1967     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Bernhard Vanas3     | 10.7.1954     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Birgit Wagner3      | 9.1.1972      | Member       | 29.5.2019    | AGM 2024        |\n| Susanne Weiss3      | 15.4.1961     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Anke Duchow         | 19.1.1968     | Member       | 27.5.2019    | n/a             |\n| Martin Mann         | 14.2.1972     | Member       | 30.6.2016    | n/a             |\n| Hannes Muster       | 28.11.1967    | Member       | 30.6.2016    | n/a             |\n| Günter Schnötzinger | 20.8.1973     | Member       | 30.6.2016    | n/a             |\n\n1 Karl-Heinz Strauss was Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board from 27 February 2013 until 18 September 2014 and has been Chairman since 18 September 2014 2 Iris Ortner has been Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board since 18 September 2014 and previously served as a member of the Supervisory Board from 2 July 2003 to 5 May 2010\n\n3 Klaus Ortner was previously a member of the Supervisory Board from 18 March 2000 to 14 May 2014\n\n4 Independent member who does not hold more than 10% of the shares (C-Rule 54)\n\n5 Appointed by the Works Council on 30 June 2016 as well as on 27 May 2019 in accordance with Section 110 Paragraph 1 of the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act\n\nuty, participate in the decision-making process. A topic of negotiation which is not on the agenda can only be ruled on by the Supervisory Board if all members are present or represented and no member objects. The Supervisory Board passes its resolutions by simple majority of the votes cast, whereby abstentions are not counted as votes. In the case of a tie – also in elections – the chairperson casts the deciding vote. A deputy representing the chairperson is also entitled to cast the deciding vote on resolutions and in elections; this also applies to committee chairpersons.\n\n#### **Composition of the Supervisory Board**\n\nThe above table shows the members elected to the Supervisory Board in 2019 together with their date of birth, their position, the date of their initial appointment to the Supervisory Board and the expected end of their term. As of 31 December 2023, the members of UBM's Supervisory Board held additional positions on supervisory boards or exercised comparable functions in Austrian and foreign companies (that are not included in the consolidated financial statements). These positions are listed in the table on page 104.\n\n#### **Criteria for independence**\n\nC-Rule 53 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance requires the majority of the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting or appointed by shareholders in line with the Statutes to be independent of the company and its Management Board. A Supervisory Board member is considered to be independent if he or she does not have any business or personal relationships with the company or its Management Board which would constitute a material conflict of interests and could therefore influence the member's behaviour.\n\nThese principles form the basis for the independence criteria established by the UBM Supervisory Board, which are available for review by the general public on the UBM website:\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n- a) The Supervisory Board member did not serve as a member of the Management Board or key employee of UBM or one of its subsidiaries during the past five years.\n- b) The Supervisory Board member does not at the present time or did not during the past year have any business relationships with UBM or one of its subsidiaries in a scope material for that member. The same applies to relationships with companies in which a member of the Supervisory Board has a considerable economic interest, but does not apply to functions in UBM corporate bodies; knowledge of Group issues and the mere exercise of activities as a management board member or managing director by a Supervisory Board member do not, as a rule, lead to the involved company being viewed as a \"company in which a member of the Supervisory Board has a considerable economic interest\" as long as circumstances do not give rise to speculation that the Supervisory Board member gains a direct personal benefit from a business transaction with these companies. The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board pursuant to L-Rule 48 does not automatically lead to classification as not independent.\n- c) The Supervisory Board member did not serve as an auditor of UBM or as a shareholder or employee of the company that audited UBM during the past three years.\n- d) The Supervisory Board member is not a member of the management board of another company in which a member of the UBM Management Board serves on that supervisory board.\n- e) The Supervisory Board member has not served on the Supervisory Board for more than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a direct investment in the company or who represent the interests of such shareholders.\n- f) The Supervisory Board member is not a close family member (direct offspring, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, niece, nephew) of a member of the\n\nUBM Management Board or a person to whom any of the aforementioned items (a to e) apply.\n\nIn accordance with these criteria, the following Supervisory Board members have declared themselves to be independent: Karl-Heinz Strauss (Chairman), Birgit Wagner, Ludwig Steinbauer, Bernhard Vanas and Susanne Weiss.\n\n### **Committees**\n\nThe Statutes allow the Supervisory Board to establish committees from among its members. To support and ensure the efficient handling of complex issues, the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee, Remuneration Committee and ESG Committee were active in 2023.\n\nAudit Committee: The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include (i) monitoring the accounting process and issuing recommendations or suggestions to ensure its reliability; (ii) monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's internal control system, internal audit system (where appropriate) and risk management system; (iii) monitoring the auditing of the separate and consolidated financial statements under consideration of the findings and conclusions in the reports published by the Regulatory Authority on Auditors in accordance with Section 4 Para. 2 (12) of the Supervision of Auditors Act (APAG); (iv) assessing and monitoring the independence of the chartered auditors, in particular as regards any additional services they may have provided for UBM; (v) reporting to the Supervisory Board on the results of the audit, stating how the audit contributed to the reliability of financial reporting and the role played by the Audit Committee in this process; (vi) assessing the annual financial statements and preparing their approval, evaluating the proposal for the use of profit, the management report and the corporate governance report, and reporting on the audit findings to the Supervisory Board; (vii) examining the consolidated financial statements, the Group management report and the consolidated corporate governance report as well as reporting to the Supervisory Board on the audit findings; and (viii) conducting the procedures for the selection of the auditor under consideration of\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Additional functions of the Supervisory Board members**\n\n| Name                | Company                                                                                                                                                        | Function                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Karl-Heinz Strauss  | PORR Bau GmbH<br>PORR GmbH & Co.

The first meeting of the Audit Committee during the reporting year was held on 20 February 2023 without the Management Board in accordance with Rule 81a of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and concentrated on the audit schedule, audit focal points and communication between the auditor and the Audit Committee. In the meeting on 28 March, the auditor reported on the status of the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2022. A further topic at this meeting was the selection process for the appointment of a new auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements of UBM Development AG for the 2024 financial year, the composition of the selection committee and the next steps in the selection process.

While this crisis no longer has such a strong impact on world events, the geopolitical confrontation in Ukraine and the new conflicts in the Near East have led to an increase in interest rates. Initial forecasts for global growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) equalled 2.9% in the first quarter. This estimate was reduced to 2.8% in the second quarter to reflect the turbulence in the financial sector, high inflation, the ongoing effects of Russia's invasion in Ukraine and the three-year COVID crisis. Actions taken by US authorities to contain instability in the banking industry reduced the immediate risks of financial sector chaos and moderated the downward risks for the outlook. However, the conflict in Ukraine continues to intensify and provided grounds for only a moderate increase in growth forecasts to 3.0% in the third quarter. IMF projections point to an increase of 3.1% in the global economy for the full 12 months of 2023.1\n\nThe European economy followed the declines in past years with further weakness in 2023, and the IMF forecasts placed growth in Europe at only 0.6% in 2023. That represents a substantial drop of 3% in economic performance in the eurozone since the previous year and, in global comparison, is also clearly below expectations. The unemployment rate equalled 6.4% in November 2023 (ECB). The inflation rate for 2023 was clearly lower than the previous year (2022: 9.2%) at 2.9% in December (ECB) and, accordingly, only slightly above the in the sense of C-Rules 18 and 18a of the Austrian Code of\n\nGlobal armed conflicts, restrictive monetary policies, the withdrawal of fiscal support and weak underlying productivity growth have had a negative effect on forecasts for the future development of the world's economy. Estimates by the IMF are similar to 2023 with global growth of 3.1% in 2024, while the eurozone is expected to remain weak with an increase of only 0.9%. The difficulty involved in predicting the course\n\n<sup>1</sup> IWF: World Economic Outlook – January, April, July 2023, January 2024\n\nof the wars in the Near East and Ukraine continues to limit forecast security. The current challenges in the banking sector are reflected in a tense climate. In Europe, economic recovery is being driven by rising household consumption. The effects of the energy price shock are fading and inflation is declining. However, various factors – e.g. high interest rates as a tool to fight inflation, the withdrawal of fiscal support and high debt levels, the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the Near East conflict and the high cost of living – will slow growth in 2024.3\n\n#### **Developments in Germany and Austria**\n\nThe German economy continued along a downward course: The GDP decline to 1.9% in 2022 was followed by a further drop of 0.3% in 2023 (IMF). Austria also fell into a recession in 2023 due to the delayed effects of the war in Ukraine and high inflation. A September forecast by the European Commission (Austrian National Bank) failed to confirm the increase of 0.8% projected for the reporting year. According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), the economic downturn will equal -0.8%. The unemployment rate rose from 6.3% to 6.4% in 2023 as reported by the Austrian Economic Chamber. Inflation fell by 0.7% to 7.9% and confirmed the ECB high interest policy.4, 5, 6, 7\n\n<sup>3</sup> IWF: World Economic Outlook – January 2024\n\n<sup>4</sup> IWF: World Economic Outlook – January 2024\n\n<sup>5</sup> Oesterreichische Nationalbank: Konjunktur aktuell – September 2023\n\n<sup>6</sup> WIFO: Konjunkturprognose für Österreich – December 2023\n\n<sup>2</sup> EZB: Economic Bulletin Issue 1 – February 2024\n\n<sup>7</sup> WKO: Wirtschaftslage und Prognose Arbeitslosigkeit – December 2023\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Developments in CEE**\n\nIn May, the European Commission issued positive projections for economic development in the EU Member States in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe apart form Estonia. UniCredit estimated average growth of 0.4% and -0.4%, respectively, for Poland and the Czech Republic in 2023.1, 2\n\n#### **Developments on the real estate markets**\n\n#### **Europe**\n\nOngoing geopolitical conflicts in Europe, weak growth throughout the region and high interest rates were also visible on the European real estate market in 2023. The investment market was unable to match its 2022 performance in the first quarter of 2023, and the transaction volume dropped by 63% year-on-year to €34bn. The remainder of the year was characterised primarily by a downturn on the property market – the investment volume fell by 9% in the second quarter and by 16% in the third quarter. Transaction volumes only improved in the final quarter, with an increase of 22% over the third quarter. Calculations for the full 12 months of 2023 show a sharp year-on-year drop of 47% in the European transaction volume to nearly €160bn (2022: €291.5bn). This reduction is attributable to a lower number of (particularly large) transactions and to imminent price adjustments. The generally weaker economic climate represents an added factor for the negative development of transaction volumes in all sectors. A total of €33.3bn were invested in residential properties during 2023. With a total transaction volume of €37.6bn, the Office asset class remained investors' clear first choice. The overall investment volume fell 61% below the previous year, while the Residential asset class declined by 46%. The hotel sector reported the lowest decline of 13% to €14.5bn, but this performance should be analysed in connection with the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in earlier years. The forecasts for 2023 are more positive because of the improvement in investors' confidence and more stable outlook for interest rates due to the reduced inflationary expectations. The transaction volume for 2024 is, consequently, expected to be 10% higher than 2023.3, 4, 5, 6\n\n#### **Germany – end of the downturn**\n\nTher German real estate market reported a sharp drop in transactions during 2023 for the second year in succession, with a 56% year-on-year reduction that corresponded to the lowest value since 2010. Properties with a combined value of €29.0bn changed hands in 2023. With a total volume of €40.0bn, the German real estate investment market was unable to confirm the expected transaction recovery. The decline resulted, above all, from strong price corrections and the increased financing stress caused by higher credit interest and write-downs.7\n\nThe transaction volume on the commercial property market fell by a massive 59.6% year-on-year to €21.5bn in 2023 (2022: €50.6bn). The office segment dropped from first to fourth place in the asset class turnover ranking with a volume of €4.6bn (2022 €19.9bn) and a decline of 77% below the previous year. Prime rents in this segment rose by 6%, but the increase in mean and average rents was lower at 2% and 4% respectively. Average prime rents in the six top cities ranged from €33.9/m2 in Cologne to €49.75/m2 in Munich. Take-up in the office segment was 26% below the previous year at roughly 2.2m m2 in 2023, which represents the lowest level since 2009.8, 9\n\nPortfolio transactions in the Hotel asset class rose by nearly 55% over the weak 2022 results to a total of €360m in the fourth quarter of 2023. This also reflects the noticeably higher market momentum, particularly in the last quarter of the year. The investment volume at the most important hotel locations amounted to €582m in 2023 and was 28% below the previous\n\n<sup>1</sup> Oesterreichische Nationalbank: Konjunktur aktuell – September 2023\n\n<sup>2</sup> UniCredit: CEE Quarterly – January 2024\n\n<sup>3</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q1 2023\n\n<sup>4</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q2 2023\n\n<sup>5</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q3 2023\n\n<sup>6</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q4 2023\n\n<sup>3</sup> Savills: Investmentmarkt Deutschland – January 2024 <sup>8</sup> Savills: Investmentmarkt Deutschland – January 2024\n\n<sup>9</sup> Savills: Top-6-Büromärkte – January 2024\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nyear. In other words, the volume at these key locations again fell below the previous year and, in comparison with the longterm average for nationwide hotel investments, remained at a low 44%.10\n\nDevelopments on the residential property investment market in Germany were clearly slowed in 2023 by rising financing costs and a substantial increase in uncertainty over regulations. Investments in larger apartment portfolios fell 60% below the previous year to €5.2bn. The decline versus the long-term average was even higher at 72% and represents a value not seen since 2010. The second half-year failed to produce any signs of recovery because of investors' expectations over another price decline and their resulting hesitation to buy, or the postponement or cancellation of projects. Similar to 2022, German investors were responsible for 68% of the €3.5bn transaction volume in 2023. The six top cities represented an above-average share of residential property investments with 59% of the national transaction volume. Berlin again led this ranking with a transaction volume of €1.81bn and a 35% share of the total volume. Of special note is Munich with a volume of €716m, which corresponds to the second highest share of the total volume at 14% and the only top location in Germany with results above the long-term average.11\n\n#### **The investment year in Austria**\n\nNew interest policies and a changing market environment had a massive negative impact on the investment market in Austria and led to transaction data not seen in a decade. At €2.8bn in 2023, the investment volume was one-third below the long-term average as well as 32% lower in year-on-year comparison (2022: €4.1bn). Most of the investment volume was directed to office and retail properties, as in earlier years. Residential properties, which remained the strongest asset class in recent years, played a much less important role with a volume of €200.0m. A trend that emerged during 2023 was the increasing caution of international investors due to the current uncertain times, which was reflected in the 85% market share attributable to national capital. This uncertainty was also reflected in the transaction volume, which declined significantly as a result of the rising interest rates, high construction costs and unpredictable risks. In the residential property sector, Austria recorded a high of 47,500 unit completions and Vienna 18,600 completions in 2023 – but a decline of 11% is projected for 2024, as reported in the previous year, which will be principally visible in freely financed residential construction with a sharp 40% drop. Residential properties comprised only 5% of the investment volume in earlier years, but more activity is expected in 2024 and ESG-compatible buildings are a popular target.\n\nThe mood in the office property sector is positive, despite the limited market offering. Take-up basically reflected the previous year at 175,000 m2 (2022: 170,000 m2). The indicators for office properties have followed a downward trend for several years and are also related to the low number of completions on the Vienna market. Only about 50,000 m² of space were completed in 2023 despite a low vacancy rate of 3.5%, and rents increased at all office locations. Prime rents rose to a new high of €28.00/m2/month. Project developers were forced to set appropriate rental levels for their projects due to the low completion rates, limited vacancies and high construction costs – and this carries an inherent potential for a further moderate increase in rents during 2024. Completions in 2024 are expected to total roughly 80,000 m2, which represents an improvement over the previous year, but 40% of the space can already be considered sold and is not available to the market. An increase in completions is expected in 2025.12\n\n#### **Developments in CEE**\n\nThe CEE-6 countries – Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria – failed to meet the expectations of many analysts in 2023. Growth in this region was 0.6% weaker than anticipated because of geopolitical conflicts, high interest rates and inflation that in certain cases exceeded 10%. Recession characterised the economy in some countries, while others recorded sound performance.\n\n10BNP Paribas: Hotel-Investmentmarkt Deutschland – Q4 2023\n\n12CBRE: Österreich Real Estate Market Outlook – 2024\n\n<sup>11</sup>BNP Paribas: Wohn-Investmentmarkt Deutschland – Q4 2023\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe unemployment rates in all CEE-6 countries are very low and in part lower than ever before. Moreover, record levels of gross capital investment despite weak growth or recession formed the basis for a positive conclusion to 2023.\n\nFor the CEE investment market, this weak growth also meant a decline in the total investment volume to €4.9bn in 2023 (2022: €10.9bn). That corresponds to a reduction of 54% and is in line with the trends in the rest of Europe and in many other parts of the world. Poland again led the ranking with nearly 38% of the total transaction volume in the CEE-6 countries. The Czech Republic followed in second place with €1.1bn or 23% of the total investment volume. None of the countries were able to record transaction growth in 2023. The underlying reason is the lack of market transactions and the resulting difficulty in establishing prices between buyers and sellers. The decline in the individual countries ranged from 18% in Slovakia to 68% in Poland. Office transactions were responsible for the highest share of the total investment volume in 2023 at 34%, followed by retail at 29% and logistics at 27%. Domestic capital from the CEE-6 countries was the main source of funds in 2023 with an impressive 56% share of the total regional volume.\n\nAs in many other European regions, year-end data for 2023 shows that the combination of a limited offering and stable demand with high inflation and the stabilisation of costs led – with few exceptions – to an increase in rents. The upward trend in rents will be driven in the future by high vacancies and a restricted offering, especially in newly built properties that offer top quality, the most popular locations and high ESG-alignment.\n\nColliers estimates the transaction 2024 volume at €6.0bn in view of the current conditions and, in particular, based on the ongoing high cost of external financing. Despite the relatively new supply of real estate in comparison with Western Europe, ecological, social and governance (ESG) considerations are expected to play a much more important role than in past years. Economic growth in the CEE-6 countries is forecasted to equal 2.4% in 2024.13\n\n13Colliers: The CEE Investment Scene 2023/2024\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Business performance**\n\nUBM Development generated Total Output of €284.2m in 2023, compared with €390.7m in the previous year. The largest contributions in 2023 did not come from Germany or Austria, as in earlier years, but from the Other Markets segment. Total Output for the reporting year was influenced, above all, by the progress of construction on and the sale of real estate projects, which is recognised in revenue and earnings over time in accordance with the percentage of completion and realisation. A significant impulse for this positive development was provided by the Arcus City residential project in Prague with over 270 housing units and ten single family houses. The Astrid Garden Residences and Neugraf projects in the Czech Republic provided further substantial support for Total Output. The largest share of Total Output was generated by the hotel business based on an increase from €57.1m in 2022 to €110.4m in 2023. This upward trend reflects the recovery in tourism and travel after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTotal Output in the Germany segment fell to €62.8m in 2023 (2022: €166.1m). An important contribution resulted from the closing of the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt with its 18 storeys and over 60 metres in height following the transfer to the owner, HanseMerkur Grundvermögen, at mid-year. A positive contribution was also made by the progress of construction on the Gmunder Höfe residential project in Munich, which is scheduled for completion in the last quarter of 2024, and by the Flösserhof in Mainz former customs harbour with 92 planned apartments.\n\nThe Austria segment reported a decline in Total Output from\n\n€112.2m in 2022 to €78.2m in 2023. Total Output in this segment was generated chiefly by the hotel business, among others through the sale of the Palais Hansen in Vienna's historic city centre and ongoing operations at the hotel in Jochberg. Contributions from the Residential asset class included, in particular, the Rankencity project in Graz and further sales from the Siebenbrunnengasse residential and office project in Vienna's fifth district.\n\nTotal Output in the Poland segment rose from €46.3m to €50.5m. Business performance was based on the hotel operations, with the location in Krakow playing an important role, as well as the rental of the Poleczki Business Park and various services.\n\nThe Other Markets segment reported a sound improvement in Total Output from €66.1m in 2022 to €92.8m in 2023 and generated the largest share of UBM's Total Output for the reporting year. The largest contribution in this segment came from the Arcus City project with its 284 planned residential units in Prague's Stodůlky district, which is accounted for according to the percentage of completion. Construction started during 2023 on the second phase of Arcus City and, at the same time, on Timber Praha, the city's first multi-storey timber-hybrid residential building. Additional contributions were made by the Astrid Garden Residences in the Holešovice district of Prague and the Neugraf residential project with 177 units. An important transaction involved the sale of a Non-Core Asset in the Czech Republic, with a total of 68.3 hectares.\n\nTotal Output in the Residential segment fell to €62.6m in 2023 (2022: €145.8m) and consisted primarily of the pro-\n\n#### **Total Output by region**\n\n| in €m         | 1–12/2023 | 1–12/2022 | Change |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Germany       | 62.8      | 166.1     | -62.2% |\n| Austria       | 78.2      | 112.2     | -30.3% |\n| Poland        | 50.5      | 46.3      | 9.1%   |\n| Other markets | 92.8      | 66.1      | 40.4%  |\n| Total         | 284.2     | 390.7     | -27.3% |\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\ngress of construction on previously sold apartments in residential projects in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. An important contribution was made by the Arcus City residential project in Prague through a proportional share of revenues from phases 2 and 3. Total Output was also supported by the Siebenbrunnengasse project in Vienna with 178 apartments. Other projects in the German-speaking countries, e.g. the Gmunder Höfe in Germany and the Rankencity in Austria, contributed to Total Output through their sale to institutional investors.\n\nThe Office segment recorded Total Output of €35m in 2023, compared with €77.6m in 2022. Total Output for the reporting year resulted, above all, from the closing of the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt with more than 25,000 m² of rentable space. This new headquarters for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (F.A.Z.) was responsible for the largest component of Total Output in this segment.\n\nThe Hotel segment recorded Total Output of €110.4m in 2023 (2022: €57.1m). This near doubling of Total Output is attributable to the increase in travel after the COVID-19 pandemic and to the sale of the 150-room Palais Hansen in Vienna's first district. The hotel operations in Jochberg (Austria) and in Prague also contributed to Total Output in this segment. No hotel projects are currently under development due to UBM's strategic orientation.\n\nTotal Output in the Other segment fell from €68.8m in the previous year to €23.4m in 2023 and was generated primarily by the rental of mixed-use standing assets in Austria and Germany. The sale of a 68.3-hectare Non-Core Asset in the Czech Republic was responsible for nearly half of Total Output. In contrast, Total Output for 2022 included the sale of building rights to three sites in Vienna as well as the strategic divestment of the German project and construction management subsidiary, alba Bau | Projekt Management GmbH.\n\nIn the Service segment, Total Output rose from €41.4m in 2022 to €53m in 2023. A major component resulted from the provision of services for various projects in the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. This position also includes charges for management services and intragroup allocations.\n\n#### **Total Output by asset class**\n\n| in €m       | 1-12/2023 | 1-12/2022 | Change |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Residential | 62.6      | 145.8     | -57.1% |\n| Office      | 35        | 77.6      | -54.9% |\n| Hotel       | 110.4     | 57.1      | 93.3%  |\n| Other       | 23.4      | 68.8      | -66.0% |\n| Service     | 53        | 41.4      | 28.0%  |\n| Total       | 284.2     | 390.7     | -27.3% |\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Financial performance indicators**\n\n#### **Business development and earnings**\n\nThe core activities of the UBM Group revolve around the project-based real estate business. The revenue reported on the income statement can be subject to strong fluctuations because these projects are developed over a period of several years. Real estate projects are recognised as of the signing date based on the progress of construction and realisation (percentage of completion, PoC). The sale of properties through share deals and the development and sale of projects within the framework of equity-accounted investments are still not included in revenue. In order to provide a better overview and improve the transparency of information on UBM's business performance, Total Output is also reported. This managerial indicator includes – similar to revenue – the proceeds from property sales, rental income and income from hotel operations as well as the general contractor and project management services capitalised or provided to third parties and companies not included through full consolidation. It also contains the profit or loss from companies accounted for at equity and the results of sales through share deals. Total Output is based on the amount of the investment held by UBM. It does not include advance payments, which are primarily related to large-scale or residential construction projects.\n\nTotal Output declined by €106.5m to €284.2m in 2023 (2022: €390.7m). Substantial contributions were made by projects in Germany (F.A.Z. Tower, Hafeninsel IV, Gmunder Höfe), the Czech Republic (Arcus City, Astrid Garden Residences), and Austria (Rankencity, Siebenbrunnengasse). Revenue as reported on the consolidated income statement fell from € 133.9m in the previous year to €85.3m and reflected the decline in contributions which followed the sale of fully consolidated projects. Contributions to revenue were made, above all by residential construction projects in the Czech Republic (Arcus City, Astrid Garden Residences).\n\nThe profit from companies accounted for at equity fell to €-14.1m in 2023 (2022: €25.4m). The positive contribution to earnings in the previous year was based on real estate projects like the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt and the Gmunder Höfe in Munich.\n\nThe income from fair value adjustments to investment property amounted to T€318, compared with €25.5m in 2022. The fair value adjustments in the previous year were related primarily to a large-scale project in Vienna and based on the receipt of the zoning permit from the municipal authority. The expenses from fair value adjustments totalled €40.8m in 2023 and were recognised, in particular, to larger office projects in Austria, Germany and Poland. In 2022, the expenses from fair value adjustments totalled €4.6m.\n\nOther operating income rose to €51.0m in 2023 (2022: €12.7m), chiefly due to the receipt of the legally binding preliminary building permit for the Timber Factory Campus. This position also includes foreign exchange gains, income from space and land rentals, income from the release of provisions, income from the disposal of tangible assets and various other positions.\n\nOther operating expenses rose from €32.6m to €40.8m, above all due to foreign exchange losses, write-downs to properties carried under current assets, and legal and consulting fees. This position also includes administrative costs, travel expenses, advertising costs and office operating costs as well as charges and duties.\n\nThe cost of materials and other related production services declined from €86.9m in the previous year to €70.4m. These expenses consist largely of material costs for the construction of fully consolidated residential properties and various other development projects which were sold through forward transactions. Also included here are the book value disposals from property sales in the form of asset deals and purchased general contractor services.\n\nIncome of €33.0m was recorded in 2023 for changes in the portfolio related to residential property inventories and other IAS 2 properties (2022: expenses of only €3.0m). The increase \n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nin additions is explained by the decline in sales activity caused by the general market situation.\n\nPersonnel expenses were €6.4m lower year-on-year at €30.9m in 2023 (2022: €37.3m). The number of employees in the companies included in the consolidated financial statements totalled 268 as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 292).\n\nEBITDA fell by €66.5m to €–27.3m in 2023 (2022: €39.2m). The decline resulted, above all, from the revaluation of projects and standing assets. Depreciation and amortisation amounted to €2.8m (2022: €5.3m). These factors, in total were responsible for a decline of €64.0m in EBIT to €-30.1m in 2023 (2022: €33.9m).\n\nFinancial income fell from €23.4m in 2022 to €21.8m due to a decline in interest and similar income from project financing for equity-accounted companies and subsidiaries. Financial costs rose to €31.1m in 2023 (2022: €25.9m), above all as a result of higher interest costs for project financing.\n\nEBT amounted to €-39.4m in 2023 and was €70.9m lower than the previous year (2022: €31.5m) due to property writedowns. Tax expense totalled €6.7m, compared with €4.3m in 2022, and the tax rate equalled 17.0% (2022: 13.8%).\n\nThe net loss (net profit after tax) totalled €46.0m in 2023, compared with net profit of €27.1m in 2022. The net loss attributable to the shareholders of the parent company amounted to €52.5m (2022: net profit of €16.8m). Beginning with the 2020 financial year, the method used to calculate earnings per share was changed. The calculation of the net loss attributable to the shareholders of the parent company includes a deduction for the net loss attributable to the hybrid capital holders. The share attributable to the hybrid capital holders fell from €9.1m in 2022 to €5.9m in 2023, and the resulting earnings per share declined from €2.25 to a loss per share of €7.03 in 2023.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Asset and financial position**\n\nTotal assets recorded by the UBM Group amounted to €1,253.8m as of 31 December 2023 and were €198.0m below the level on 31 December 2022 (€1,451.8m). This decline resulted primarily from the premature repayment of the hybrid bond 2018 in March 2023 and also involved writedowns that reduced equity and the payment of the dividend and interest.\n\nNon-current assets declined by €45.3m year-on-year to €745.3m as of 31 December 2023. Property, plant and equipment totalled €11.1m and were slightly lower than on 31 December 2022 (€12.2m). This position consists primarily of capitalised rights of use from lease liabilities.\n\nThe carrying amount of investment property rose by €16.2m to €407.9m as of 31 December 2023. In contrast, the investments in equity-accounted companies declined by €30.6m to €150.2m. Project financing also declined by €37.3m to €143.6m.\n\nCurrent assets totalled €508.5m at year-end 2023 and were €152.7m lower than at year-end 2022. Cash and cash equivalents were reduced, among others, by the following factors: the premature repayment of the hybrid bond 2018, the repayment of the bond 2018-2023, the payment of the purchase price for two acquisitions made in 2022 and 2023, and the payment of the dividend and interest. As of 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents equalled €151.5m.\n\nReal estate inventories totalled €265.4m at the end of December 2023 (31 December 2022: €259.3m). This position includes miscellaneous inventories as well as specific residential properties under development which are designated for sale.\n\nTrade receivables declined from €49.5m at the end of 2022 to €37.3m as of 31 December 2023. Included here, in particular, are real estate inventories which are sold during development as well as the proportional share of forward sales of investment properties.\n\nEquity totalled €379.7m as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €501.5m). The decline is explained, above all, by the repayment of the hybrid capital, the payment of the dividend and the loss recorded for the 2023 financial year. The €8.2m dividend was paid on 30 May 2023. The equity ratio equalled 30.3% at year-end 2023 despite the difficult operating environment (31 December 2022: 34.5%) and remained within the 30–35% target range.\n\nBond liabilities (current and non-current) amounted to €376.1m at the end of December 2023 and were €70.6m lower than the previous year (31 December 2022: €446.7m). In November 2023, €91.1m of the UBM bond 2018–2023 was repaid. Trade payables declined from €46.9m at year-end 2022 to €25.7m as of 31 December 2023 and consisted primarily of outstanding payments for subcontractor services. Other financial liabilities (current and non-current) increased from €25.5m as of 31 December 2022 to €27.9m as of 31 December 2023. Deferred taxes and current taxes payable increased to €17.2m (2022: €20.1m). Financial liabilities (current and non-current) rose by €9.9m to €408.2m.\n\nNet debt totalled €610.3m at year-end 2023 (31 December 2022: €500.2m). This indicator includes current and non-current bonds and financial liabilities, excluding lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. The increase resulted from the repayment of hybrid capital and the payment of the dividend.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Cash flow**\n\n.\n\nOperating cash flow rose from €13.2m in 2022 to €31.6m in 2023. The fair value adjustments included in profit for the reporting year were excluded from operating cash flow because of their non-cash character.\n\nCash flow from operating activities totalled €–54.5m, compared with €–70.7m in the previous year. Cash flow was reduced, above all, by an increase in real estate inventories (€6.1m), interest paid (€27.7m), a reduction in receivables (€5.3m) and a decline in liabilities (€13.7m). These amounts include cash inflows of €35.9m from the sale of real estate inventories. The additions to real estate inventories totalled €42.1m, and the additions to receivables from real estate inventory sales equalled €32.1m. The decline in receivables from real estate receivables amounted to €29.1m.\n\nCash flow from investing activities totalled €12.4m in 2023, compared with €8.4m in 2022. Investments in project financing amounted to €35.6m, and investments in property, plant and equipment, investment property and financial assets equalled €37.7m.\n\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to €-129.7.0m (2022: €-37.9m). New borrowings totalled €45.9m, while €52.9m of hybrid capital and €34.5m of loans were repaid during the reporting period. In addition, dividends and hybrid bond interest of €16.6m were paid in 2023.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Outlook**\n\nIn the midst of geopolitical conflicts and the aftereffects of the Covid-19 crisis, the OECD experts and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are projecting growth of 2.7%, respectively 3.1% for the global economy in 2024. Growth has been slowed by the ongoing war in Europe and the Middle East conflict between Israel and Hamas which has been escalating since mid-2023 as well as continuous high inflation and the resulting high interest rates. A series of interest rate hikes reduced inflation in the eurozone and, as a result, the ECB has held key rates at 4.5% since September 2023. In spite of the recent downward trend in inflation, inflation is only expected to approach the ECB Council's 2% target during the course of 2024 and into 2025.1,2,3\n\nPrevailing interest rates have had a massive influence on the development of the real estate market – in particular, on the valuation of projects and standing assets. UBM recognised write-downs of roughly €70m in connection with the unscheduled revaluation of its projects and properties in 2023. Although UBM, as a developer, did not recognise ECB's 2.0% target.<sup>2</sup> other real estate investors – these revaluations, especially to the development portfolio, are a direct consequence of rising interest rates and the resulting higher yield expectations of future property buyers. Any increase in rents cannot offset the current write-downs to the same extent and, above all, at the same speed. UBM sees the real estate sector in its core markets in an existential crisis for the above reasons.\n\nUBM, as previously mentioned, has been unable to disengage completely from the current market developments, but sees itself in a position of relative strength. Internal management with its focus on cash flow made it possible for UBM to hold the equity ratio above 30%, also in the fourth quarter, and to report more than €150m of liquid funds. It should also be noted that the outstanding volume (€91.05m) of the UBM bond 2018-2023 was repaid on time in the fourth quarter of 2023, entirely from cash reserves. No other bond redemptions are scheduled until November 2025, which creates a competitive advantage.\n\nUBM remains fully operational, as is demonstrated by the sale of the 33.57% interest in the Palais Hansen to Wiener Städtische during the fourth quarter and the sale of a noncore property in the Czech Republic. At the same time, UBM acquired a 25% interest in Bondi Consult's \"Central Hub\" project in TwentyOne.\n\nUBM is continuing to follow its strategic orientation to become the leading developer of timber construction projects in Europe. The company currently has more than 300,000 m2 in timber – slightly more than half in the Light Industrial & Office asset class and the other half in the residential sector. This uncompromising focus on timber construction is a logical consequence of the *green. smart. and more.* corporate strategy. Only a high degree of standardisation and modularisation will make it possible to remain competitive in the future.\n\nThe impact of high inflation, rising interest rates and increasing construction costs will accompany us throughout the entire year. Market recovery to the pre-crisis level will not be seen for a very long time. However, the massive demand overhang can be expected to increase over the coming years due to the market exit of many competitors.\n\nMarket developments remain volatile and difficult to estimate. For this reason, UBM must refrain from issuing any guidance for the 2024 financial year and limit comments to its extremely solid financial position with an equity ratio of over 30%.\n\n<sup>1</sup> IMF: World Economic Outlook – January 2024\n\n<sup>2</sup> Austrian National Bank: Konjunktur aktuell – September 2023\n\n<sup>3</sup> ECB: Geldpolitische Beschlüsse – Press Release December 2023\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Risk report**\n\nThe principal business activity of UBM Development AG and its operating subsidiaries and investments involves the development of real estate projects in selected European countries. This business model exposes the UBM Group to a variety of risks. At the same time, diversification – meaning an active presence in different countries and asset classes – supports the distribution and reduction of risk because changes do not normally take place at the same time or in all markets. Diversification, as a risk management tool, also creates opportunities to give preference to one asset class over another or to expand or reduce the focus on individual asset classes, countries and markets.\n\nUBM's risk management is responsible for monitoring and controlling the related risks, whereby any changes in risk positions are actively addressed.\n\n#### **General goals of UBM risk management**\n\n- To create a risk culture in UBM\n- To identify risks at an early point in time and allow for the implementation of countermeasures\n- To create a uniform view of risks with strict evaluation and documentation\n- To protect the company's assets (e.g. property, capital, image)\n- To meet (payment) obligations at all times\n- To ensure full compliance with legal regulations at all times\n- To safeguard annual results and enable planning\n\n#### **Material risks**\n\nThe material risks for UBM arise from project development as the core business activity and include operating risks as well as macroeconomic and ESG risks. Accordingly, risks are subdivided into the following main categories: real estate acquisition, project calculation, planning and project financing, construction and quality, operations (asset management), realisation (transactions), general business risks (supporting and commercial processes), macroeconomic and other risks, and ESG risks.\n\nUBM has many years of experience in the early identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring and control of risks within its business model. The company monitors all material risks that could have a significant impact on its operating performance and on its asset, earnings and financial position.\n\n#### **Risk Management System (RMS) measures in 2023**\n\n#### **1. Risk identification and analysis/risk system**\n\nThe comprehensive identification and analysis of risks carried out in 2016 forms the basis for the annual critical assessment of the individual risks in UBM's value chain. These individual risks were also evaluated in 2023 by way of a risk inventory. The risk system is evaluated by external specialists each year and adapted, where necessary, to reflect the current situation.\n\nA qualitative evaluation of the ESG risk catalogue was prepared in 2023. The catalogue was subsequently expanded and incorporated in the risk inventory to ensure the complete integration of ESG-relevant risks in UBM's risk system. A total of 29 individual ESG risks were identified in the following categories:\n\n- Environmental risks\n\t- Acute physical climate risks\n\t- Chronic physical climate risks\n\t- Non-climate related environmental risks\n\t- Transitory climate risks\n- Social and governance risks\n\nIn addition to the assessment of operating business risks and macroeconomic risks, the impact of ESG risks on earnings and liquidity will be evaluated from a quantitative perspective beginning with the 2024 financial year. This ESG evaluation will also include the definition of ESG opportunities, in contrast to the methodology applied to operating business risks and macroeconomic risks. The opportunities will be ranked according to a cash flow scale. The risks and opportunities are not presented from a net viewpoint to avoid distorting the overall corporate risk position.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2. Risk assessment**\n\nThe assessment is based on a description of the risks as well as an estimate of the probability of occurrence and the potential extent of damages caused by events that could lead annual results and cash flows to deviate from forecasts. The Management Board prepares this estimate with the assistance of local experts and is supported by regular status and project reports from the country managing directors and by calculation models. This assessment takes place every six months to allow the company to react quickly to possible changes in the individual risk positions.\n\nThe evaluation includes an analysis of the potential damages and probability of occurrence for each risk. The results are presented on a risk map which provides a clear overview of the greatest individual risks for UBM.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the individual positions, UBM's risks are aggregated into an earnings-oriented risk indicator (value at risk, VaR) and a cash flow-oriented risk indicator (cash flow at risk, CFaR). The total risk indicators are then examined to determine their agreement with the defined risk appetite and the company's risk-bearing capacity at corporate level. The identified and quantitatively evaluated ESG risks will be included in the overall risk indicators beginning with the 2024 financial year.\n\n#### **3. Risk documentation**\n\nThe findings are summarised in a report which serves as the basis for the subsequent prioritising and management of risks. This report is submitted to the Supervisory Board twice each year.\n\n#### **4. Risk control and monitoring**\n\nUBM's first step for controlling risks is top-down. It involves the preparation of work instructions and guidelines, followed by communication throughout the Group. Responsibilities are assigned by management to the individual risk owners. In a bottom-up process, the risk owners report to the Management Board as required.\n\n#### **5. Risk management**\n\nRisk management is handled in project teams, at departmental level or directly by the Management Board depending on the importance.\n\nThis structured approach is embedded in the RMS as a continuous process.\n\n#### **Risk categories**\n\nUBM's most important individual risks were aggregated in ten main risk categories.\n\n1. Real estate acquisition risks: The direct and indirect risks connected with the purchase of real estate include the interpretation of zoning regulations, third-party rights (neighbours, easements, etc.), the timeliness of the land register, the length of time needed to secure a building permit, incomplete information on potentially hazardous areas (land register), undocumented contamination, protective legislation (heritage protection, tree stocks, protected areas), more difficult development and/or access, unknown wells, groundwater, emissions, etc. Other relevant issues involve market entry risks, country risks, political risks, and competition and market environment risks.\n\nThese risks are minimised by the operating subsidiaries' knowledge of their respective region and competitive environment, their know-how and established local market networks as well as by standardised due diligence and acquisition processes.\n\n2. Project calculation and planning risks: This project phase focuses on the risks associated with procurement and selling prices, current and future rent levels and changes, project financing and interest rates as well as market viability and third party usage. Internal and external experts develop the necessary fundamentals for decisions by the Management Board.\n\n3. Construction and quality risks: This category includes all risks linked to the actual property construction. These risks arise in connection with construction and ancillary costs, the \n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nlength of construction and possible delays, the potential loss of suppliers and the quality of work (including the costs for subsequent reworking).\n\nUBM minimises these risks with experienced project managers to filter out overpriced offers in the tender phase and to ensure continuous cost, quality and schedule controls during construction. Regular project reports to the Management Board, which include target/actual comparisons, support the early identification of variances.\n\n4. Operating risks: The operation of a property together with office rentals or hotel leasing is connected with a variety of risks. In particular, the assessment process covers the tenant's credit standing (creditworthiness, security of rental income), cluster risk (loss of an important major tenant), vacancy risk, maintenance risk (regular checks, maintenance, servicing, repairs, subsequent technical investments), and facility management risks (insufficient processes for debt collection and payment reminders, inadequate invoicing of operating costs).\n\nIn order to protect the value of a property, a wide range of experts from UBM's subsidiaries and specialist departments or external firms are involved during the operating phase to ensure the steady generation of planned revenues and to protect the technical quality of the buildings over the long term.\n\n5. Distribution, realisation and sale risks: A differentiation is made between the marketing risks associated with the sale of condominiums, realisation risks (rental risks for firsttime letting) and the risks connected with the sale of entire properties. Rental price risk is relevant for these categories because a reduction in rental income has a direct impact on the company's revenue and, in the event of a sale, on the realisable purchase price. Valuation risks are also involved because the sale of a property at a market price (realisable sale price) below the respective carrying amount can result in write-downs. Unforeseen guarantee and warranty risks can materialise after a transaction is settled and lead to increased costs and reduced sale proceeds.\n\nUBM's activities at the beginning of each development project include the technical departments together with separate rental and transaction teams which rely on their wide-ranging expertise in the calculation and determination of rental and selling prices. Continuous contact with major customers, market expertise (for example, knowledge of the buyer's yield expectations) and the identification of the optimal selling time ensure that the product is optimally placed on the market. Additional support is provided by the experts in the legal department and external consultants to ensure the optimal design of the entire realisation and sale process.\n\n6. General business risks: Included here, in particular, are IT risks (hardware, software, data loss, hacking, espionage, etc.), commercial risks (liquidity risk, tax risks, financial penalties, etc.) and legal risks (compensation for damages, general contractual and insurance risks, the legal environment, etc.). These risks are monitored by the respective specialist departments and communicated to the Management Board as required.\n\n7. Macroeconomic and other risks: These risks include the development of the economy (inflation, unemployment, purchasing power, etc.), interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. They are continuously monitored by the responsible Management Board members in close cooperation with the staff units, and appropriate countermeasures are implemented where necessary.\n\n8. Environmental risks: This risk category includes acute and chronic physical climate risks (temperature fluctuations, fluctuations in precipitation or hydrology, change in wind conditions, etc.), non-climate related environmental risks (impairment of critical infrastructure, etc.) and transitory climate risks (costs for the transition to low-emission technologies, expanded requirements for emission reporting, etc.) and their potential effects. These risks are monitored by the ESG department and reported to the Management Board where necessary.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe design of our working environment reflects our strict compliance with the national and international rules and requirements in the markets where we are active. We also base our actions on agreements that include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the international labour standards set by the International Labour Organisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This commitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code and code of conduct for business partners).\n\nSpecially planned training and continuing education programmes are a fixed part of human resources development at UBM. The basis is formed by an annual appraisal meeting, which includes an agreement on focus topics and specific training measures together with the responsible supervisor. UBM actively offers numerous educational opportunities ranging from internal workshops and idea competitions to external training programmes, but also encourages and supports the independent development of its employees.\n\nFurther information on employee concerns can be found in UBM's ESG Report 2023.\n\n#### **Corporate Governance Report**\n\nThis report is part of the annual report and can be downloaded under www.ubm-development.com, submenu investor relations/financial reports or corporate governance.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Research and development** The company has no research or development activities.\n\nVienna, 2 April 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\n\\$\\frac{}{\\frac{}{}}\\$\n\n**Thomas G.

|\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# **1. General information**\n\nThe UBM Group comprises UBM Development AG (UBM) and its subsidiaries. UBM is a public limited company under Austrian law which maintains its registered headquarters at 1100 Vienna, Austria, Laaer-Berg-Strasse 43. It is registered with the commercial court of Vienna under reference number FN 100059x. The business activities of the Group are focused primarily on the development, sale and management of real estate.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Section 245a of the Austrian Commercial Code (\"Unternehmensgesetzbuch\") and in agreement with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European Union as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).\n\nThe reporting currency is the euro, which is also the functional currency of UBM. The functional currency of the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements is the respective national currency. Amounts are reported in thousands of euros (T€) and rounded using the compensated summation method. The reporting year corresponds to the calendar year and ends on 31 December 2023.\n\n# **2. Scope of consolidation**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include UBM as well as 51 (2022: 57) domestic subsidiaries and 73 (2022: 75) foreign subsidiaries. One company was initially included in UBM's consolidated financial statements during the reporting year following its founding and another company was included following its acquisition (see note 2.1.).\n\nOne company was sold and nine were deconsolidated following their liquidation. The sale price of T€10,908 was paid in cash. Assets in the amount of T€7,981 were disposed of.\n\nIn addition, 23 (2022: 27) domestic and 20 (2022: 21) foreign associated companies and joint ventures were accounted for at equity. Three companies were deconsolidated following their liquidation and two companies were sold in 2023.\n\nUBM is entitled to the majority of voting rights in 19 (2022: 21) subsidiaries but does not exercise control over these companies because of specific rules defined by the respective partnership agreements. These companies are accounted for as joint ventures.\n\n### **2.1. Initial consolidations**\n\nThe following companies were initially included through full consolidation in 2023 (see the list of investments for the capital share):\n\n| Due to new foundations                      | Date of initial consolidation |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Polecki Infrastructure sp. z o.o.           | 10.2.2023                     |\n| Due to acquisitions                         | Date of initial consolidation |\n| Timber Marina Tower Immobilien GmbH & Co KG | 4.7.2023                      |\n\nThe purchase of 100% of the project company Timber Marina Tower Immobilien GmbH & Co KG resulted in the addition of assets of T€24,500 and liabilities of T€8,000. The purchase price of T€16,636 was paid in cash.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3. Significant accounting policies**\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for based on the acquisition method. This method requires the measurement of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Any difference between the acquisition cost and the attributable proportion of the acquired net assets at fair value is recognised as goodwill. This goodwill is not written off or reduced through scheduled amortisation but is tested for impairment at least once each year.\n\nAll accounts receivable and payable between consolidated companies are eliminated during the consolidation of liabilities. Intragroup income and expenses are offset during the consolidation of income and expenses. Interim profits or losses from intragroup deliveries are eliminated if the related amounts are material and the respective assets are still included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nShares in the net assets of fully consolidated subsidiaries which are not attributable to UBM are reported separately as part of equity under \"non-controlling interests\".\n\n# **4. Accounting and valuation methods**\n\n#### **Measurement principles**\n\nThe annual financial statements of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared according to standardised accounting and measurement methods. The measurement methods were applied consistently, apart from the newly applied standards.\n\n#### **Currency translation**\n\nThe companies included in the consolidated financial statements prepare their annual financial statements in their respective functional currencies, whereby the functional currency represents the relevant currency for each company's business activities.\n\nThe items in the consolidated statement of financial position are translated at the average exchange rate at the end of the financial year, while income statement items are translated at the average annual exchange rate for the financial year (as an arithmetic mean of all end-of-month quotations). Differences resulting from currency translation are recognised directly in equity and transferred to profit or loss when the business operations are derecognised.\n\nThe following key exchange rates were used for the inclusion and translation of foreign subsidiaries:\n\n|     | Mean exchange rate as of 31 Dec 2023 | Average annual exchange rate |\n|-----|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| PLN | 4.3395                               | 4.5428                       |\n| CZK | 24.7240                              | 24.0009                      |\n|     | Mean exchange rate as of 31 Dec 2022 | Average annual exchange rate |\n| PLN | 4.6808                               | 4.6842                       |\n| CZK | 24.1160                              | 24.5620                      |\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of companies, any adjustments to the carrying amounts of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities to reflect fair value as of the acquisition date or, respectively, goodwill, are treated as assets or liabilities of the acquired subsidiary and are therefore subject to currency translation.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nExchange rate gains or losses on transactions by consolidated companies in a currency other than the functional currency are recognised in profit or loss. Monetary items not denominated in the functional currency of the consolidated companies are translated at the average exchange rate in effect at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIntangible assets are capitalised at their acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. The amortisation rates range from 10.00% to 50.00% (2022: 10.00% to 50.00%).\n\nThe identification of impairment leads to the write-down of the involved intangible asset to its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of fair value less selling costs or the value in use. If the reasons for impairment cease to exist, the impairment loss is reversed at an amount equal to the increase in value, but up to a maximum of the carrying amount which would have resulted from the application of scheduled amortisation to the original acquisition or production cost.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at their acquisition cost, including any ancillary expenses less reductions in this cost, or at production cost. The carrying amount reflects the deduction of accumulated depreciation and the straight-line depreciation recorded for the reporting year. The following depreciation rates are applied:\n\n|                                                 | 2023          | 2022          |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Buildings                                       | 1.50 to 33.33 | 1.50 to 33.33 |\n| Technical equipment and machinery               | 4.00 to 50.00 | 4.00 to 50.00 |\n| Other facilities, fixtures and office equipment | 4.00 to 50.00 | 4.00 to 50.00 |\n\nThe identification of impairment leads to the write-down of the involved item of property, plant or equipment to its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of fair value less selling costs or the value in use. If the reasons for impairment cease to exist, the impairment loss is reversed at an amount equal to the increase in value, but up to a maximum of the carrying amount which would have resulted from the application of scheduled depreciation to the original acquisition or production cost. Major renovation is capitalised, while ongoing maintenance, repairs and minor renovation are expensed as incurred.\n\nRights of use to property, plant and equipment acquired through leases are capitalised at the present value of future lease payments and amortised over the term of the lease or at the indicated amortisation rates on a straight-line basis.\n\nLow-value assets are written off in full in the year of purchase because they are immaterial for the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAssets under construction, including buildings which are to be used for operational purposes or whose use has not yet been established, are accounted for at acquisition or manufacturing cost less any applicable impairment losses.\n\nThe borrowing costs for qualifying assets are included in acquisition or production cost. For investment properties sold through forward deals, the capitalisation of borrowing costs ends on the date of the related agreement. Depreciation on these assets begins with their completion or the attainment of operational status. Interest totalling T€6,449 was capitalised for properties in 2023 (2022: T€1,946). Information on the rate for financing costs is provided in note 36.\n\nInvestment property is real estate that is held to generate rental income and/or for value appreciation. It includes office and commercial buildings that are not used for the company's own business purposes as well as residential buildings and undeveloped land. These assets are carried at their fair value, and any gains or losses from changes in this fair value are recognised in profit or loss of the applicable period. Buildings under construction are accounted for at acquisition or production cost if fair value cannot be reliably determined or at fair value as generally determined by the residual value method.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fair value of investment property is based on appraisals by independent experts, on the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of the property, or on the amounts realised in comparable transactions.\n\nThe rights of use to investment property acquired through leases are capitalised at the present value of the future lease payments and measured at fair value in subsequent periods.\n\nThe sales comparison approach or cost approach was used to establish the fair value of properties carried as real estate inventories, which are intended for sale immediately after completion and whose market value can be determined based on comparable transactions.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale represent properties that are available for immediate sale in their current condition and whose sale is considered highly probable. These properties are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and net realisable value. Investment property is carried at fair value. The probability of sale is evaluated quarterly, and the resulting reclassifications are reported in the notes under the development of property, plant and equipment and investment property.\n\nInvestments in companies accounted for at equity are recognised at acquisition cost, which is allocated between the proportional share of the acquired net assets at fair value and any applicable goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually by the proportional share of annual profit or loss, dividends received and other changes to equity. Goodwill is not subject to scheduled amortisation but is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 once each year or when circumstances point to a possible decline in value. If the recoverable amount falls below the carrying amount, the difference is written off.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised to reflect temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, on the one hand, and the values for tax purposes, on the other hand, at the amount of the expected future tax expense or tax relief. In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for future asset benefits arising from tax loss carryforwards if realisation is sufficiently certain.\n\nThe calculation of deferred taxes is based on the applicable income tax rate in the respective country. The Austrian eco-social tax reform which was enacted in 2022 provides for a gradual reduction in the corporate tax rate from 25.00% to 23.00% (2023: 24.00%, beginning in 2024: 23.00%). The calculation for UBM Development AG and the Austrian subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements for the reporting year was therefore based on a tax rate of 23% instead of 24%.\n\nThe provisions for severance payments, pensions and anniversary bonuses were calculated in accordance with IAS 19 based on the projected unit credit method with the application of the AVÖ 2018-P Generation Life Table, whereby an actuarial valuation is performed as of every reporting date. The calculation parameters included an interest rate of 3.50% (2022: 3%) for Austria as well as salary increases of 3.37% and 3.70% (2022: 3.37% and 3.70%) per year in Austria. The calculation of the provisions for severance payments in Austria did not include any deductions for employee turnover. For anniversary bonuses in Austria, the calculation included deductions for employee turnover based on statistical data within a range of 0.00% to 13.20% (2022: 0.00% to 13.20%). The retirement age assumed for employees in the Austrian companies represents the earliest possible retirement age permitted by law following the 2004 pension reform (corridor pension), also taking all transitional arrangements into account. The calculation of the provisions for Austria is based on the AVÖ 2018-P – Pagler & Pagler Mortality Table, while the 2018 G Mortality Table Guidelines issued by Klaus Heubeck are used for Germany.\n\nActuarial gains and losses on severance payments and pensions are recognised in full in other comprehensive income, while the actuarial gains and losses on anniversary bonuses are included in profit or loss for the period. Service costs are reported as part of personnel expenses, and interest expense is recorded under financial costs.\n\nOther provisions cover all identifiable risks and uncertain obligations. They are recognised at the amount that will presumably be required to settle the underlying obligation.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of future lease payments, whereby discounting is based on the interest rate underlying the lease. If this rate cannot be determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate for the applicable term is used.\n\n#### **Financial instruments**\n\nFinancial instruments that fall under the scope of application of IFRS 9 are assigned to valuation categories based on the underlying business model and the characteristics of the contractually agreed cash flows. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value, depending on the valuation category.\n\nFor financial instruments carried at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), the loss allowance is based on the expected credit loss model. This procedure involves the creation of a risk provision equal to the 12-month expected credit loss (Level 1) on the initial recognition date. In the event of a significant deterioration in the credit risk, the lifetime expected loss is calculated (Level 2). Objective evidence of impairment results in reclassification to Level 3.\n\nUBM applies the simplified approach provided by IFRS 9.5.5.15 to trade receivables, contractual assets and leasing receivables and measures the loss allowance in line with the lifetime expected loss. All available information is used to evaluate the expected credit loss, including historical data as well as forward-looking information. In general, external credit ratings are not available for financial instruments. The expected credit loss equals the product of the expected net claim to the financial instrument, the period-based probability of default and the loss on actual default.\n\nThe general impairment model is applied to project financing. Due to the absence of external credit evaluations, credit risk is monitored according to the development of key indicators, e.g. the loan-to-value ratio or collection period.\n\nTrade receivables, project financing and other financial assets were recognised at amortised cost. No allowances for expected credit losses were recognised in 2023 because neither the historical nor the forecast data indicated any loss rates.\n\nThe investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other investments reported under other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), which is generally determined with valuation procedures like the discounted cash flow method.\n\nSecurities are classified as FVTPL and measured at fair value. If these securities represent debt instruments and consist solely of interest and principal payments, they are carried at amortised cost. Liabilities are carried at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n#### **Revenue from contracts with customers**\n\nRevenue is reported after the deduction of value added taxes, rebates and other sales-based taxes. The recognition of revenue is based on the transaction type as follows:\n\nThe revenue from investment properties that are sold after completion is recognised at a point in time after the material risks and rewards are transferred. The revenue from investment properties is recognised over time when the sale takes place through a forward deal during construction and the company has a legal entitlement to payment for previously provided performance as well as no alternative use for the asset. Revenue from the sale of apartments is recognised over time for units that are sold before completion and for which the company has a legal entitlement to payment for previously provided performance as well as no alternative use for the assets. Revenue from the sale of completed apartments is recognised at a point in time. The rental income and income from hotel operations is recognised over time. The income from invoiced construction services is also recognised over time.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe recognition of revenue over time is based on the progress of construction (percentage of completion, POC method). The percentage of completion represents the previously provided performance as a per cent of the total contract performance. For revenue from real estate, this indicator is calculated as the investment costs incurred to date in relation to the total investment costs for the respective project. The identified performance is recognised, after the deduction of prepayments by customers, as a contract asset under trade receivables or, if the prepayments exceed the previously provided performance, as a contract liability under other liabilities. If the total costs for a contract are expected to exceed the related revenue, the expected loss is recognised in full and immediately at an amount equal to the costs required to fulfil the contract. The costs for contract extensions are capitalised and amortised over the project term unless they represent costs which would not have been incurred if the contract had not been received.\n\nInterest income and expenses are accrued in line with the outstanding balance of the respective loan and the applicable interest rate.\n\nDividend income from financial investments is recognised when a legal entitlement arises.\n\nA lease represents an agreement under which the lessor provides the lessee with a contractual right to control an identified asset for a defined period in return for consideration. The UBM Group acts as a lessee, above all, in connection with office properties and one property which is sublet. There are numerous individual contracts with comparatively low annual rental payments, fixed and open-ended terms, and agreed termination rights. Leases are presented on the statement of financial position as rights of use and corresponding lease liabilities. The lease payments are allocated between an interest and a principal component. The finance costs are recognised to profit or loss over the lease term to produce a periodic cost of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The rights of use are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life and the lease term. Lease payments are measured by applying a country-specific incremental borrowing rate, i.e. the interest rate which the Group would have to pay to borrow funds to purchase an asset of comparable value under comparable conditions in a similar economic environment. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed as incurred. Short-term leases are defined as leases with a term of up to 12 months. The UBM Group also serves as a lessor to a limited extent. These leases usually involve office space, and the related contracts qualify for classification as operating leases. The rental income from these leases is reported under other operating income.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **5. Discretionary judgment and major sources of estimation uncertainty**\n\nThe preparation of annual financial statements invariably involves the use of estimates and assumptions by management for the amount and recognition of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses and the disclosures on contingent liabilities. The major assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty as defined in IAS 1.125 ff are related to the following:\n\nDetermining the fair value of real estate: Fair value generally equals the present value of the realisable rental income. Any change in the estimated future realisable rental income or the expected return on alternative investments will also lead to a change in the fair value of the involved property. The capitalisation rate (2023: 2.96% to 7.50%; 2022: 2.75% to 7.00%) represents the average market rate of return on the property. One criterion for the selection of the capitalisation rate is the general and specific risk for the return on the property.\n\nMost of the investment property was valued in accordance with internationally recognised earnings methodology in 2023, in particular the Term and Reversion approach (see note 20 for additional details on the valuation method and the value of investment property).\n\nThe residual value method was used to value the real estate under development (assets under construction – IAS 40). Under this method, the future income is estimated by the appraisers – provided there has been no pre-letting activity – in consultation with the project developers. The budgeted completion costs, including an appropriate developer margin, are deducted from this income. The remainder represents the fair value of the properties under development.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of changes in key parameters on the fair value of investment property:\n\n# in T€\n\n| Portfolio property  |                              |                                   |         |                              |                                   |         |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|\n|                     |                              | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2023 | 166,172 |                              | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2022 | 175,520 |\n|                     | Adjustment to long-term rent |                                   |         | Adjustment to long-term rent |                                   |         |\n|                     | 0.00%                        | 10.00%                            | -10.00% | 0.00%                        | 10.00%                            | -10.00% |\n| Adjustment to yield |                              |                                   |         |                              |                                   |         |\n| 0.00%               | -                            | 13,271                            | -7,204  | -                            | 16,198                            | -13,805 |\n| 0.50%               | -2,082                       | 4,833                             | -8,738  | -9,112                       | -4,396                            | -20,177 |\n| -0.50%              | 8,438                        | 21,333                            | 733     | 13,478                       | 26,692                            | -9,604  |\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nin T€\n\n#### Development projects\n\n|                                  | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2023 |         | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2022 |         |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Developer profit                 | -5.00%                            | 5.00%   | -5.00%                            | 5.00%   |\n|                                  | 31,264                            | -35,036 | 23,806                            | -22,054 |\n| Adjustment to yield              | -0.50%                            | 0.50%   | -0.50%                            | 0.50%   |\n|                                  | 56,034                            | -52,266 | 46,236                            | -38,054 |\n| Adjustment to construction costs | 10.00%                            | -10.00% | 10.00%                            | -10.00% |\n|                                  | -48,156                           | 41,384  | -27,474                           | 28,826  |\n| Adjustment to rental income      | -10.00%                           | 10.00%  | -10.00%                           | 10.00%  |\n|                                  | -66,061                           | 63,801  | -32,105                           | 38,051  |\n\nThe classification as investment property (IAS 40) or inventories (IAS 2) is based on the following considerations: Projects that are held to generate rental income or for value appreciation are classified as investment property. Inventories comprise real estate that, in advance, is intended for resale. Properties which are sold before completion and for which UBM has no alternative use as well as a legal entitlement to payment for previous performance are accounted for as contract assets in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\nProperties (inventories) held for sale: The sales comparison approach or cost approach was used to determine the fair value of properties for which comparable market transactions were available. This applies primarily to real estate held as current assets (residential buildings) that is intended for immediate sale after completion. In accordance with accounting standards, the carrying amount is only adjusted to reflect a lower fair value. The external appraisers define the parameters together with the local project developers based on the size, age and condition of the buildings as well as country-specific considerations. Information on the carrying amounts and the potential impact of impairment is provided in note 24.\n\nProvisions: The valuation of the provisions for severance payments, pension and anniversary bonus provisions is based on parameters that include discount factors, salary increases and/or employee turnover. Changes in these parameters can lead to higher or lower provisions, personnel expenses and interest costs. Other provisions are based on estimates for the likelihood of an event occurring and the probability of an outflow of funds. Changes in these estimates or the occurrence of an event previously considered unlikely can have a significant impact on the Group's financial performance.\n\nSensitivity analysis of provisions for pensions: The following actuarial assumptions were considered relevant and the following margins were applied: Discount rate +/-0.25%, pension trend +/-0.25%, life expectancy +/-1 year.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of life expectancy was based on a shift in the average life expectancy for all candidates in the respective plan.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the differences to the recorded amounts as a relative deviation:\n\n|             | Interest +0.25%         | Interest -0.25%         |\n|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|             | liquid                  | liquid                  |\n| Pension DBO | -2.20%                  | 2.30%                   |\n|             | Pension trend +0.25%    | Pension trend -0.25%    |\n|             | liquid                  | liquid                  |\n| Pension DBO | 2.30%                   | -2.20%                  |\n|             | Life expectancy +1 year | Life expectancy -1 year |\n|             | liquid                  | liquid                  |\n| Pension DBO | 4.80%                   | -4.80%                  |\n\n■ Energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emisSensitivity analysis of the provision for severance payments: The following actuarial assumptions were considered material and the following margins were applied: Discount rate +/-0.25%, salary trend +/-0.25%, employee turnover +/-0.50% up to 25th year of service, life expectancy +/-1 year.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of life expectancy was based on a shift in the average life expectancy for all candidates in the respective plan.\n\nThe following table shows the differences to the recorded amounts as a relative deviation:\n\n|                        | Interest +0.25%                                  | Interest -0.25%                                  | Salary trend +0.25%     | Salary trend -0.25%     |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Severance payments DBO | -1.59%                                           | 1.63%                                            | 1.62%                   | -1.59%                  |\n|                        | Fluctuation +0.50% until<br>25th year of service | Fluctuation -0.50% until<br>25th year of service | Life expectancy +1 year | Life expectancy -1 year |\n| Severance payments DBO | -0.10%                                           | 0.10%                                            | 0.02%                   | -0.03%                  |\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nProject financing: UBM, as the parent company, grants loans to its equity-accounted entities and subsidiaries. These loans serve as financing for the equity share of real estate projects. They are subject to interest at normal market rates and are payable after the project is sold.\n\nThe actual amounts realised in the future could differ from the estimates and assumptions depending on the success of the individual projects.

An internal valuation team establishes the fair value of properties which are not appraised externally. Discussions concerning the parameters used to determine fair value (Level 3) include the participation of operational project developers, the Management Board and the valuation team.\n\nThe fair values of all properties with a carrying amount over T€1,000 – including the properties held by non-controlling interests which flow into the consolidated financial statements – were established by external appraisers in 2023. These external appraisals covered investment property with a total carrying amount of T€371,416 (2022: T€376,702).\n\nFair value was generally determined by capital earnings methods in 2023 and 2022. The most frequently used method was the term and reversion approach, an internationally recognised real estate valuation technique. The term and reversion approach separates the expected future cash flows into two distinct, independent areas. This separation is necessary for rented properties because the calculations required for the period up to the expiration of the rental agreements in effect on the valuation date – the so-called \"term\" – differ from the calculations for the period after the end of these rental agreements – the so-called \"reversion\" (subsequent rentals).\n\nTerm (contract term): The present value of the net income generated during the contract term is calculated. This present value is not a perpetual yield, but merely a temporary yield which ends with the expiration of the rental agreement.\n\nReversion (adjustment period): The net income for the reversion (market rent beginning with the subsequent rental agreement), including a vacancy period, is capitalised with a normal market interest rate as a perpetual yield. The resulting amount is not discounted separately but included in the selection of the capitalisation rate. Any structural vacancies are reflected in a separate reduction.\n\nThe selection of the capitalisation rate for the term and reversion method reflects current market conditions. In accordance with this estimate, an investor expects a certain return on the respective property. This forms the basis for the selection of an appropriate capitalisation rate for the property in the term and the reversion.\n\nThe selection of the interest rate includes factors like the market potential, vacancy rate and other risks connected with the property.\n\nReal estate under development (assets under construction – IAS 40) was measured according to the residual value method. Under this method, the related income is estimated by the appraisers – provided there has been no pre-letting activity – in consultation with the project developers. The budgeted costs for completion, including an appropriate developer margin, are deducted from this income, and the remainder represents the fair value of the properties under development.\n\nThe following table shows the allocation under the fair value hierarchy, the valuation method and quantitative information for the non-observable inputs used in valuation. The various levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\n- Quoted (non-adjusted prices) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)\n- Input factors that differ from the quoted market prices in Level 1, which are either indirectly observable (i.e. as a price) or directly observable (i.e. derived from the price) (Level 2)\n- Input factors that are based on unobservable market data for the assets or liabilities (Level 3)\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Property type:<br>Investment<br>property | Segment       | Fair

Authorisation of the Management Board to determine the issue price, terms and conditions, the subscription ratio and all other details in agreement with the Supervisory Board (authorised capital 2022). Resolution to amend Section 4 Para. 4 of the Statutes accordingly and authorisation of the Supervisory Board to approve changes to the Statutes resulting from the issue of shares from authorised capital 2022, whereby the subscription right for greenshoe options connected with the issue of shares in exchange for cash contributions is excluded.\n\nResolution concerning a conditional capital increase in accordance with Section 159 Para. 2 (1) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act of up to €5,230,526.00 through the issue of up to 747,218 new ordinary zero par value bearer shares, under the exclusion of subscription rights, for issue to the holders of convertible bonds and determination of the requirements pursuant to Section 160 Para. 2 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. Authorisation of the Management Board to determine the remaining details for the conditional capital increase and its implementation, in particular the details of the issue and conversion procedure for the convertible bonds, the possibility of mandatory conversion, the amount of the issue and the exchange or conversion ratio. Resolutions on the amendment of the Statutes through the addition of a new Para. 5b under Section 4, and authorisation of the Supervisory Board to approve amendments to the Statutes arising from the issue of shares from conditional capital.\n\nResolution in accordance with Section 174 Para. 2 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act authorising the Management Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to issue convertible bonds, also in several tranches, which carry an exchange or subscription right to the purchase of up to 747,218 new bearer shares with a proportional share of up to €5,230,526.00 in share capital. Authorisation of the Management Board to determine all other conditions for the issue and conversion procedure of the convertible bonds as well as the issue amount and the exchange or conversion ratio. The subscription rights of shareholders are excluded. The issue terms can include a provision for mandatory conversion at the end of the term or at another point in time in addition to or in place of a subscription or exchange right. The exchange or subscription right can be serviced by conditional capital or by treasury shares or by a combination of conditional capital and treasury shares. The price of the convertible bonds is to be determined by recognised financial methods through a recognised price-finding procedure.\n\nThe following resolution, among others, was passed at the 142nd Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2023:\n\nResolution a) revoking the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2021 (i) which authorised the Management Board to purchase treasury shares in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1 (4) and (8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and Para. 1a and 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, and (ii) authorisation of the Management Board in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to sell treasury shares; as well as b) a new authorisation of the Management Board to purchase treasury shares in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1 (4) and (8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and Para. 1a and 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act over the stock exchange or over the counter at an amount equalling up to 10% of share capital, also under the exclusion of the proportional subscription rights of shareholders which can accompany this type of purchase (reverse exclusion of subscription rights); and c) a new authorisation of the Management Board in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to sell treasury shares in another manner than over the stock exchange or through a public offering and under the exclusion of any general purchase opportunity (exclusion of subscription rights) of shareholders; and d) authorisation of the Management Board to withdraw treasury shares.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **32. Reserves**\n\nThe capital reserves resulted from the capital increases and capital adjustments carried out in previous years as well as timebarred claims to dividends. These reserves include T€98,954 (2022: T€98,954) which are appropriated and may only be released, to the extent free reserves are not available for coverage, to offset an accumulated loss which would otherwise be reported in UBM's annual financial statements.\n\nOther reserves comprise the following: the reserve from the translation of subsidiaries' foreign currency financial statements (currency translation reserve), the reserve for the remeasurement of defined benefit obligations, UBM's retained earnings including the statutory reserve and the untaxed reserves after the deduction of deferred taxes, the retained earnings of subsidiaries since their acquisition and the effects from the adjustment of the annual financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements to the accounting and measurement methods applied to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNo net profit is available for distribution to UBM's shareholders. Voluntary reserves totalling T€37,798 as of 31 December 2023 (2022: T€37,798) can be released in following periods. The total balance of T€9,409 (2022: T€46,054) includes T€2,220 (2022: T€2,178) from the recognition of deferred tax assets, which are blocked from distribution.\n\nDividends totalling €8,219,398, or €1.10 per share, were distributed to UBM's shareholders in 2023 from net profit for the 2022 financial year. No dividend recommendation will be made for the 2023 financial year as there is no distributable net profit.\n\nEquity interests that are not held by UBM or a Group company are reported under non-controlling interests.\n\n# **33. Hybrid bond**\n\nUBM repaid the outstanding €52.9m from the hybrid bond 2018, a deeply subordinated bond, prematurely after five years on 24 February 2023.\n\nOn 18 June 2021, UBM issued a deeply subordinated sustainability-linked bond (hybrid bond) with a total volume of €100m and an annual coupon of 5.50%. The interest rate is tied to a specific ESG rating. The bond had an unlimited term with an early repayment option for the issuer after five years.\n\nThe hybrid bond is classified as an equity instrument because the payments – interest as well as principal – must only be made under certain conditions whose occurrence can be caused or prevented by UBM and the Group can therefore permanently prevent payments. Interest payments, less any tax effects, and profit distributions are recorded directly in equity as a deduction.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **34.

The category \"Other\" includes provisions for impending losses and outstanding obligations from the acquisition of undeveloped land. The provisions for rental guarantees and impending losses are based on estimates for the settlement of claims in one to two years.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Pension plans**\n\n#### **Defined benefit plans**\n\nProvisions for severance compensation were recognised for salaried and wage employees who have claims to severance payments pursuant to the Austrian Salaried Employee Act, the Austrian Wage Employees Severance Payment Act or individual company agreements. Salaried employees whose employment is subject to Austrian law are entitled to severance compensation if employment began prior to 1 January 2003 and has continued for a specific period and, in any event, if the employment relationship is terminated because the employee reaches the statutory retirement age. The amount of the severance payment depends on the remuneration at the time of termination and the length of employment. These employee claims are therefore accounted for as claims under defined benefit pension plans but are not covered by plan assets.\n\nThe provisions for severance payments developed as follows:\n\n| in T€                                                               | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Present value of severance obligations (DBO) as of 1 Jan            | 1,498 | 1,806 |\n| Currency adjustments                                                | 3     | -1    |\n| Current service cost                                                | 52    | 69    |\n| Interest expense                                                    | 39    | 17    |\n| Severance payments                                                  | -287  | -203  |\n| Actuarial gains(-)/losses(+)                                        | -81   | -190  |\n| of which demographic gains/losses                                   |       | 38    |\n| of which financial gains/losses                                     | -41   | -70   |\n| of which gains/losses from experience-based adjustments             | -40   | -158  |\n| Present value of severance obligations (DBO) as of 31 Dec           | 1,224 | 1,498 |\n| in T€                                                               | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Current service cost (entitlements)                                 | 52    | 69    |\n| Interest expense                                                    | 39    | 17    |\n| Severance costs (recognised in profit and loss for the period)      | 91    | 86    |\n| Severance costs (recognised in comprehensive income for the period) | -81   | -190  |\n\nUBM concluded a group insurance contract to finance these severance payment claims.

Financing normally takes place at the individual project level, and each company is responsible for the respective debt service. Various types of security are available to the lenders as collateral for loans and borrowings, which can be drawn on to satisfy any loans or borrowings that are called. The pledges can involve the following collateral:\n\n- Mortgages on properties\n- Pledges of shares in the project company\n- Pledges of rents receivable\n\nThe conditions, type and scope of the securities are agreed individually (for each project company) and are tied to the project volume and the amount and term of the loans and borrowings.\n\nInformation on pledges of investment property is provided in note 20, while information on pledges of real estate inventories is provided in note 24.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **42. Notes on segment reporting**\n\nSegment reporting is based on geographical regions in accordance with the internal organisational structure of the UBM Group. The individual development companies in a segment are combined into groups for the purpose of segment reporting. Each of these groups constitutes a business area for the UBM Group. The reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities involves, in particular, the elimination of intragroup receivables and liabilities.\n\nInternal reporting is based on the IFRS amounts, which are generally adjusted for intragroup sales. UBM generates substantial revenue through the sale of real estate projects as part of its business activities but is not dependent on individual customers.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                  | Germany |          | Austria

Notes to the cash flow statement**\n\nThe cash flow statement reports cash flows classified by operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flow from operating activities is derived according to the indirect method. The components of cash and cash equivalents consist entirely of cash on hand and at banks over which the Group has free disposal and correspond to cash and cash equivalents as reported on the statement of financial position.\n\nCash flow from operating activities includes interest and dividends received as well as interest paid. In contrast, dividends paid are included under cash flow from financing activities.\n\nThe reconciliation of changes in cash flow from financing activities is as follows:\n\n| in T€                           | Financial liabilities | Leasenobligations | Bonds and<br>promissory note loans | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2022       | 376,463               | 21,876            | 446,702                            | 845,041 |\n| Cash flows (cash changes)       | 13,237                | –1,859            | –70,803                            | –59,425 |\n| Non-cash changes                |                       |                   |                                    |         |\n| Sales/Acquisitions of companies | –4,000                | -                 | -                                  | –4,000  |\n| Additions                       | -                     | 2,477             | -                                  | 2,477   |\n| Exchange rate effects           | -                     | 27                | -                                  | 27      |\n| Accrued interest                | -                     | –41               | 167                                | 126     |\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2023       | 385,700               | 22,480            | 376,066                            | 784,246 |\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in T€                           | Financial<br>liabilities | Lease<br>obligations | Derivates | Bonds and<br>promissory note loans | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2021       | 277,834                  | 21,774               | -         | 526,498                            | 826,106 |\n| Cash flows (cash changes)       | 98,629                   | -1,855               | -         | -81,103                            | 15,671  |\n| Non-cash changes                |                          |                      |           |                                    |         |\n| Sales/Acquisitions of companies | -                        | -675                 | -         | -                                  | -675    |\n| Additions                       | -                        | 2,642                | -         | -                                  | 2,642   |\n| Exchange rate effects           | -                        | -10                  | -         | -                                  | -10     |\n| Accrued interest                | -                        | -                    | -         | 1,307                              | 1,307   |\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2022       | 376,463                  | 21,876               | -         | 446,702                            | 845,041 |\n\nThe \"total\" column in the above table represents the total amount of current and non-current financial liabilities\n\n# **45. Notes on financial instruments**\n\n#### **Capital risk management**\n\nThe goal of capital management in the UBM Group is to maximise the return on investments by optimising the ratio of equity and debt.\n\nEquity totalled €379.7m as of 31 December 2023 and was below the level at year-end 2022 (€501.4m). This decline resulted primarily from necessary valuation adjustments to properties. Equity was also reduced by the repayment of the profit participation rights recorded under equity. The dividend of €8.2m was paid on 30 May 2023. The equity ratio equalled 30.3% at the end of December 2023 and remained within the target range of 30–35% (31 December 2022: 34.5%).\n\n#### **Gearing**\n\nThe capital structure is monitored regularly by the Group's risk management.\n\nGearing at year-end 2023 and 2022 is calculated as follows:\n\n| in T€                     | 31.12.2023     | 31.12.2022     |\n|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Debt1                     | 761,766        | 823,165        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | -151,520       | -322,929       |\n| <b>Net debt</b>           | <b>610,246</b> | <b>500,236</b> |\n| <b>Equity</b>             | <b>379,722</b> | <b>501,449</b> |\n| Net debt to equity        | 160.71%        | 99.76%         |\n\n1 Debt is defined as the sum of non-current and current bonds and non-current and current financial liabilities excl. lease obligations\n\nNet debt totalled €610.2m as of 31 December 2023 (2022: €500.2m), which represents an increase of 21.99%.\n\nThe overriding strategic objective is to protect UBM's long-term financing capacity through promissory note loans and bonds.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Goals and methods of financial risk management**\n\nPrimary financial assets consist, above all, of investments in companies accounted for at equity, project financing and other financial assets, and trade receivables. Primary financial liabilities include bonds and other financial liabilities as well as trade payables.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nInterest rate risk is defined as the risk of an increase in interest expense or a reduction in interest income. For UBM, this risk arises almost exclusively from a potential increase in the interest rates on variable interest financial liabilities, especially in the long-term range. The underlying transactions for the interest rate swaps represent the financing for three project companies. All interest rate swaps involve the exchange for variable interest flows for fixed interest flows. As of 31 December 2023, the fair value measurement of these interest rate swaps equalled T€96 (2022: T€-4).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the UBM Group held the following derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk:\n\n| Derivative         | start      | end        | Reference value<br>in T€ (as of<br>31.12.2023) | Fixed interest<br>rate/cap rate<br>in % | Reference<br>interest rate | Market<br>value T€<br>31.12.2023 | Market<br>value T€<br>31.12.2022 |\n|--------------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Interest rate swap | 30.9.2022  | 30.6.2027  | 4,826                                          | 3.15%                                   | 3 month<br>Euribor         | -103                             | -2                               |\n| Interest rate swap | 30.9.2022  | 30.6.2027  | 4,865                                          | 3.15%                                   | 3 month<br>Euribor         | -103                             | -2                               |\n| Interest rate cap  | 30.12.2022 | 30.12.2025 | 42,900                                         | 2.95%                                   | 3 month<br>Euribor         | 303                              | -                                |\n\nAn analysis of the floating interest rate position, which equalled T€-259,330 as of 31 December 2023 (2022: T€-117,824) shows the following sensitivities under scenarios with an increase of 0.01 BP in interest rates. The extent of the increase in interest rates was derived from the average daily change in interest rates for the 3-month and 6-month EURIBOR in 2023. The interest rate range equalled 1 BP based on a probability of 67.00% and 2 BP based on a probability of 99.00%. The simulated impact on the interest rate positions is as follows:\n\n| in T€                          | Interest balance for the year 2024 | Interest balance (p. a.)<br>with straight-line extrapolation from 2025 |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At interest rate rise of 50 BP | 883                                | 1315                                                                   |\n\nThe receivables from project financing are compounded at a rate that reflects the refinancing rate for the UBM Group. A change of 50 BP would increase interest income for 2024 by T€718 (2022: 50 BP, T€904).\n\n#### **Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk represents the risk of losses caused by the default of a business partner who is no longer able to meet contractual payment obligations. It comprises default and country risks as well as any deterioration in the borrowers' credit standing. The credit risk for the real estate business arises from rental obligations. The default of a tenant and the resulting loss of rental payments reduce the present value of the respective real estate project. This risk is taken into account at project level through expert opinions.\n\nThe risk related to receivables from customers can be classified as marginal due to the broad diversification and ongoing credit assessments. With regard to project financing, the following table on page 211 provides information on the related accumulated impairment losses.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe risk of default on the other primary financial instruments reported under assets in the statement of financial position is also considered low because the contract parties are financial institutions and other debtors with excellent credit ratings. The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum risk of default. The identification of default risks on financial assets is reflected in the recognition of appropriate valuation allowances. No such allowances were recorded in 2023.\n\n#### **Foreign exchange risk**\n\nInterest and foreign currency risks are evaluated regularly by risk management. Market analyses and forecasts by well-known financial service providers are analysed and management is informed by regular reports.\n\nThe foreign exchange risk in the UBM Group is treated as transaction-oriented and results from property development financing.\n\nThe foreign currency risks resulting from intragroup financing transactions and/or from loan financing for project companies were simulated as of 31 December 2023 to estimate the possible risks from changes in foreign exchange rates:\n\n| FX position in T€ | Local currency | FX position in local currency<br>in thousands | VAR1 in T€ |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| -68,943           | CZK            | 276,649                                       | 1,452      |\n| -130,268          | PLN            | 122,274                                       | 3,587      |\n\n1 VAR = Value At Risk at a one-sided 99% confidence interval; this corresponds to a standard deviation of 2.3 over a time period of ten days. Any correlations between currency pairs are not included.\n\nThe simulated loss at a probability of 99.00% over a period of ten days equals a maximum of €5m (2022: €7.4m).\n\n### **Hedging of foreign currency risks**\n\nThe UBM Group held currency futures of CZK88.9m as of 31 December 2023 (2022: CZK7.3m) which were concluded to hedge loans financed in CZK.\n\nChanges in the fair value of currency futures led to the recognition of a T€144 loss to the income statement in 2023 (2022: gain of T€6).\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\n| 2023 in T€                                                         | Undiscounted payment flows |         |           |           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                    | Average interest rate      | 2024    | 2025–2028 | from 2029 |\n| Bonds and promissory note loans at fixed<br>interest rates         | 2.58%                      | 18,635  | 516,096   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at variable interest rates | 6.28%                      | 166,611 | 254,736   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at fixed interest rates    | 4.16%                      | 26,935  | 23,545    | -         |\n| Payables to other lenders at fixed interest rates                  | 1.00%                      | -       | -         | 1,196     |\n| Lease obligations at variable interest rates                       | 4.10%                      | 2,763   | 7,942     | 25,226    |\n| Trade payables                                                     | interest-free              | 25,653  | -         | -         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                        | interest-free              | 26,502  | 856       | 548       |\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2022 in T€                                                         | Average interest rate | Undiscounted payment flows |           |           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                    |                       | 2023                       | 2024–2027 | from 2028 |\n| Bonds and promissory note loans at fixed<br>interest rates         | 3.00%                 | 208,767                    | 469,670   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at variable interest rates | 4.14%                 | 139,647                    | 202,332   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at fixed interest rates    | 3.93%                 | 1,948                      | 50,480    | -         |\n| Payables to other lenders at fixed interest rates                  | 2.23%                 | 1,163                      | 4,398     | 9,730     |\n| Lease obligations at variable interest rates                       | 3.93%                 | 2,710                      | 7,942     | 24,380    |\n| Trade payables                                                     | interest-free         | 46,947                     | -         | -         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                        | interest-free         | 23,657                     | 895       | 950       |\n\nLiquidity risk represents the risk of being able to access funds at any time to settle existing liabilities. UBM defines precise financial forecasts as a key instrument for managing liquidity risk. These forecasts are prepared by every operating company and consolidated centrally. They are used to determine the requirements for financing and bank credit lines.\n\nCredit financing is primarily related to real estate projects in progress whose development is not at risk from the current point of view.\n\nWorking capital financing is managed by UBM's corporate treasury unit. Companies with surplus funds make these funds available to companies that need liquidity. This reduces the volume of third-party financing and optimises net interest. It also minimises the risk that sufficient liquidity reserves may not be available to settle financial obligations on time.\n\nIn addition to previously contracted project financing, UBM had available credit lines of T€7,000 at its disposal as of 31 December 2023 (2022: T€7,000). Liquidity risk, in total, is therefore considered to be minimal.\n\n### **Other price risks**\n\nThe risk of price changes consists primarily of fluctuations in the market interest rate and market prices as well as changes in exchange rates.\n\nUBM minimises the price risk related to rental income by generally indexing its rental agreements. All other service contracts are also indexed. The remaining price risk for the UBM Group is immaterial.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Carrying amounts, valuation and fair value**\n\n|                                                               |                                     |                                         |                     | Measurement in acc. with IFRS 9                   |                                           |                         |                                    | in T€                                                         | Measurement<br>category<br>(IFRS 9) | Carrying<br>amount as of<br>31 Dec 2022 | (Amortised)<br>cost | Fair value<br>(other<br>comprehen-<br>sive income) | Fair value<br>(through<br>profit or loss) | Fair value<br>hierarchy | Fair value<br>as of<br>31 Dec 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| in T€                                                         | Measurement<br>category<br>(IFRS 9) | Carrying<br>amount as of<br>31 Dec 2023 | (Amortised)<br>cost | Fair value<br>(other<br>comprehen<br>sive income) | Fair value<br>(through<br>profit or loss) | Fair value<br>hierarchy | Fair value<br>as of<br>31 Dec 2023 | Assets                                                        |                                     |                                         |                     |                                                    |                                           |                         |                                    |\n| Assets                                                        |                                     |                                         |                     |                                                   |                                           |                         |                                    | Project financing<br>at variable interest rates               | Amortised<br>Cost                   | 180,885                                 | 180,885             | -

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### **Key audit matters**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n1. Valuation of real estate assets\n\n2. Valuation of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing\n\n#### **1. Valuation of real estate assets**\n\n#### Situation and reference to further information\n\nThe majority of assets of the Group is invested in real estate in the balance sheet items property plant and equipment, investment property, inventories as well as trade receivables. These balance sheet items total a real estate value amounting to approximately €717m, which sums up to 57% of the balance sheet total. The valuations mostly depend on the fair value of the real estate on the reporting date. For investment property according to IAS 40 is used, whereas other assets in accordance with IAS 2 and IAS 16 use the fair value as a comparative amount for necessary adjustments of carrying amounts. Real estate assets, which are presented as contract assets within trade receivables for which revenue is recognised over time according to IFRS 15, are accounted for based on the transaction price and the percentage of completion which is derived from the planning calculation.\n\nDue to the lack of available prices in active markets, the fair value is determined by using valuation methods, particularly the Term and Reversion approach. For real estate under development, in general the residual value method is used. The result of valuation depends to a large degree on estimations of material inputs that affect the value such as interest rates, expected rent and capital flows as well as completion costs and developer profits.\n\nThe risk for the consolidated financial statements is primarily the estimation of future cash flows and interest rates which are influenced by future market and economic developments. The valuation of real estate assets and the resulting gains and losses in the income statement are therefore subject to uncertainty. With respect to the real estate accounted for under IFRS \n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n15, the risk to the consolidated financial statements is essentially that the assumptions and estimates required to determine the stage of completion of the total investment cost are uncertain.\n\n#### *Reference to further information*\n\nInformation on accounting and measurement methods for real estate assets can be found in chapter 4 (accounting and measurement methods) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Chapter 5 (discretionary judgment and major sources of estimation uncertainty) contains information on substantial estimation uncertainty. Furthermore, concerning investments properties and inventories the chapter refers to chapters 20 and 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nChapter 20 (investment property) contains a breakdown and movement schedule of investment property divided into asset classes as well as a table with significant inputs for the fair value determination. The section on inventories (24) includes information on carrying amounts of real estate carried at fair value and impairments. Performed appreciations and depreciations are reported in the income statement or in chapter 12 (other operating expenses) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Chapter 25 (Trade receivables) contains information on contract assets and recognised profits set in this context. Inflation and interest rate risks resulting from macroeconomic developments and their effects are explained in section 7. of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Audit response\n\nThe fair value is determined primarily by external appraisers, and partly also by internal valuations. As of 31 December 2023, real estate classified as investment property, inventory and property plant and equipment with a total carrying amount of €440m was valued by external appraisers. In addition, purchase agreements and planning calculations were available for the properties reported under trade receivables amounting to around €35m.\n\nInvestment properties are generally determined by external appraisers when a threshold value is exceeded, whereas real estate classified as inventory and property plant and equipment are externally valuated when there are indicators for impairment. In the course of the audit, we have assessed the appropriateness of the criteria and critically evaluated the selection of external valuation.\n\nWe chose our sample of tested valuations based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, in which we especially paid attention to real estate with material appreciation or depreciation of the fair value. For these properties we performed detailed audit procedures. Other material qualitative criteria were the geographic location and the asset class of the property as well as properties with specific risk and uncertainty factors.\n\nReal estate disposals and the resulting gains and losses were compared to the respective purchase contracts and values according to the latest financial statements. Moreover, purchase contracts containing earn—out clauses or similar were subject to a critical assessment.\n\nFor real estate presented according to IFRS 15 in trade receivables, the existing purchase contracts were verified to substantiate the transaction price. The assumptions with regard to the total investment costs, which are used to measure the stage of completion, were discussed with the management and critically assessed.\n\nFor our sample of tested valuations, our real estate experts performed the following audit procedures:\n\n- Evaluation of the objectivity, independence and expertise of the external appraisers.\n- Evaluation of the used valuation method and assessment whether it is in accordance with internationally accepted standards. For the residual value method of projects under development, we paid particular attention to the applicability of the material assumptions regarding expected development costs and expected real estate utilisation and whether these could be assessed with sufficient certainty and plausibility.\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Critical assessment of the discount rates and their change over time. The discount rates and yields were compared to transactions and valuations of similar asset classes and locations. Within the observed bandwidths, it was assessed whether changes in discount rates were justified due to market conditions or property-specific characteristics and whether they were consistently applied.\n- Our real estate experts tested the plausibility of other material inputs such as rental income, occupancy rates and repair and maintenance costs by comparing them to similar market and experience rates. In addition, the data used was reconciled to underlying data of specific properties, such as, for example, the current lease status or lease payments, this was performed on a sampling basis. In the case of real estate in development, the expected construction costs used in the appraisals were compared to construction costs until completion of comparable objects. The developer profit used for the valuation was assessed through comparison with similar properties.\n- In addition, the expectations, changes and conspicuities with respect to material inputs and the performance of individual properties were discussed with the management and the internal valuation team. These discussions were held both in advance of the assessment and after the assessment results were obtained. We challenged the valuations based on comparable transactions and knowledge of the market. Particular attention was paid to changes that differed from our preliminary expectations.\n\n#### **2. Valuation of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing**\n\nSituation and reference to further information\n\nApart from real estate property in fully consolidated Group companies, the book values of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and therein bound project financing in associated companies and joint ventures form a major part of the Group assets. In total these assets account for about €294m as of 31 December 2023, which amounts to 24% of total assets.\n\nThese are mainly Austrian and foreign real estate project entities, which use the provided funding by UBM for real estate acquisition and investment purposes. The measurement and recoverability of shares in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing are mainly based on the fair value of real estate held by the project entities. Investment property held by companies accounted for under the equity method have to be recorded at fair value and the gains and losses thereof are carried forward in the Group share. Whereas for other real estate classes and project financing, the fair value is used as a comparative amount for the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amount. Real estate assets for which revenue is recognised over time according to IFRS 15 are accounted for based on the transaction price and the percentage of completion which is derived from the planning calculation.\n\nIn the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, the fair value of the properties held in the joint ventures and associated companies is determined. The fair value is determined primarily by means of the discounted cash flow model, in particular through the Term and Reversion method. In general, the residual value method is applied for real estate development.\n\nThe results of the valuations are highly dependent on the estimation of the main inputs influencing the value of interest such as interest rates, expected rental and capital flows, construction costs up to completion and developer profits.\n\nThe risk for the consolidated financial statements is primarily the estimation of the future cash flows and interest rates, which are influenced by future market and economic developments. The valuation of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing and the resulting gains and losses in the income statement are therefore subject to uncertainty. With respect to the real estate accounted for under IFRS 15, the risk to the consolidated financial statements is essentially that the assumptions and estimates required to determine the stage of completion of the total investment cost are uncertain.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Reference to further information*\n\nChapter 4 (accounting and measurement methods) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides information on the accounting and measurement methods for shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing. In chapter 21 (investments in companies accounted for at-equity) the carrying values and the comprehensive income originating from associated companies and joint ventures is disclosed as well as further information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the significant entities. Chapters 22 and 44 contain information regarding the carrying values, impairment and their development of project financing. Inflation and interest rate risks resulting from macroeconomic developments and their effects are explained in section 7. of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Audit response\n\nThe fair value of the real estate held in joint ventures and associated companies is determined in the same manner as the valuation of the real estate that is directly held by the group. It is therefore primarily carried out by assigning external appraisers, whereby external valuations are generally carried out when a certain threshold is exceeded or if there are indications for an impairment. In the course of the audit, we examined the appropriateness of the criteria and the actual selection of the external appraisals.\n\nSimilar to the audit procedures performed on real estate held directly by the Group, we selected a sample for the review of the valuations. This sample was selected based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. For this sample, our real estate appraisal specialists carried out auditing procedures similar to the auditing procedures for real estate held directly by the Group. For real estate accounted for under IFRS 15 the existing purchase contracts were verified to substantiate the transaction price. The assumptions with regard to the total investment costs, which are used to measure the stage of completion, were discussed with the management and critically assessed.\n\nIn addition, we have tested the gains and losses resulting from the fair value movement of investment properties and the evaluation of the net equity of the project companies and the resulting impairment and reversal of impairment of shareholdings and project financing by comparison with the carrying amounts.\n\n#### **Other information**\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information.

With the exception of the corporate governance report already available to us, the annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, as soon as it is available, and, in doing so, to consider whether – based on our knowledge obtained in the audit – the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and of Audit Committee for the consolidated financial statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU and with requirements stated in par. 245a UGB, for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n#### **Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n#### **Reports on other and regulatory requirements**\n\n#### **Comments on the Management Report for the Group**\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Group management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether it was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the Group's management report in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and other legal or regulatory requirements.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing for the audit of the Group's management report.\n\n#### Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the group was prepared in accordance with the valid legal requirements and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the thus obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the Group's management report came to our attention.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Additional information in accordance with article 10 of the EU regulation**\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the ordinary general meeting on 19 May 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on 19 May 2023. We are auditors without cease since 2002.\n\nWe confirm that the audit opinion in the section \"Report on the consolidated financial statements\" is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in article 11 of the EU regulation.\n\nWe declare that no prohibited non-audit services (article 5 par. 1 of the EU regulation) were provided by us and that we remained independent of the audited company in conducting the audit.\n\nWe did not perform additional services for the audited company or entities controlled by it that were not disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Responsible Austrian Certified Public Accountant**\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Mr. Markus Trettnak, Certified Public Accountant.\n\nVienna, 2 April 2024\n\n#### **BDO Assurance GmbH**\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\n**Mag.

Gerhard Fremgen** Auditor\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the English translation of this long-form audit report according to Section 273 of the Austrian Company Code (UGB) is presented for the convenience of the reader only and that the German wording is the only legally binding version.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Use of profits\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023 do not report any net profit for 2023 available for distribution.\n\nNo dividend will therefore be paid out to shareholders for the 2023 business year.\n\nVienna, 2 April 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nT\n\n**Thomas G.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by words like \"expectation\", \"goal\" or similar terms and expressions. Forward-looking statements on future business performance, by definition, include risks and uncertainties. The forecasts concerning the future development of the company represent estimates which are based on the information available to UBM Development AG at the time the annual report was prepared. If the assumptions underlying these forecasts do not materialise or if unexpected risks occur at an amount not quantified or quantifiable, the actual future (business) development and actual future results can differ from these estimates, assumptions and forecasts.\n\nSignificant factors for these types of deviations can include, for example, changes in the general economic environment or the political, legal and regulatory framework in Austria, the EU and other relevant economic areas as well as changes in the real estate sector. UBM Development AG will not guarantee or assume any liability for the agreement of future (business) development and future results with the estimates and assumptions made in this annual report.

The wood is in varying shades of brown and gray, with a rough and textured surface. The upper part of the image features vertical planks that are lighter in color, almost white in some areas, and appear to be decaying or peeling. These planks have several knots and holes, adding to the rustic appearance. Below the planks, there are horizontal logs or beams that are darker in color and more solid in appearance. The logs are stacked on top of each other, creating a layered effect. The overall impression is one of age, decay, and natural beauty.\n\nPrologue\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/9/Picture/0 description: A man in a black suit and white shirt is looking out a window. The word \"PROLOGUE\" is at the top of the image.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n# A pioneer of modern timber construction\n\n**Hermann Blumer** is a name that many star architects have on speed dial. Hailing from the small Swiss town Waldstatt, he is not only one of the world's leading timber construction engineers, his inventiveness has also been instrumental in the growing trend towards timber construction in cities today. He talks to us about a childhood shaped by the nearby forest and his family's joining yard – and about the international career that only really began when he had already reached retirement age.\n\n6\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/0 description: A portrait of an older man wearing a white shirt and black jacket. The word \"PROLOGUE\" is at the top of the image, and the number \"1\" is at the bottom left.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n**1:**\n\nNothing is impossible. Hermann Blumer is an avant-gardist with unique solutions who finds a way to build seemingly unworkable wooden structures.\n\n#### **2:**\n\nPritzker prizewinner Shigeru Ban worked with Appenzell-born timber engineer Blumer to implement his design for the Centre Pompidou-Metz.\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/4 description: This image shows a building with a unique architectural design. The building has a white, tent-like roof structure supported by a wooden frame. The frame is made up of interconnected wooden beams that create a honeycomb-like pattern. The building has large windows and appears to be a public space. A French flag is flying on top of the building. The sky is blue with some white clouds. The number 2 is in the upper right corner of the image.\n\nEven though he recently turned 80, Appenzellborn Hermann Blumer has no plans to slow \ndown. When we meet him, he is on the way \nto Brno to give a lecture on two of the most innovative timber constructions of our time. Structures that, without him, would never have existed in their current form.\n\nPritzker prizewinner Shigeru Ban's design for the Centre Pompidou-Metz was deemed unworkable until inspiration struck Blumer – a trained carpenter and civil engineer – after months of poring over the problem. \"In the end, the solution was quite simple,\" he says modestly. A similar scenario arose with Wisdome Stockholm, an extension of the city's Technical Museum.\n\nHermann Blumer is the troubleshooter of choice when it comes to translating architectural visions into groundbreaking free-form constructions. He is an avant-gardist who finds beauty – and, it would seem, a kind of artistic expression – in sophisticated ways of transferring loads. Not to mention his undeniable gift for winning over other people with his ideas. →\n\n**1**\n\n8\n\n**1**\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### As your family ran a timber construction company, you grew up with wood. What are your earliest memories of this natural onstruction material?\n\nWhen I was a boy, I used to love watching the carpenters cutting the wood in the joining yard or the sawmill operators separating the tree trunks into beams and boards. If the work wasn't too dangerous, I would sometimes even help out. I often went to the woods with my father to saw the barren branches off the fir trees so the wood that grew back would be free of knots. He said that this wood would be there for me later on.\n\n# Was it always a foregone conclusion that you would pursue this kind of career?\n\nYes, I always knew it would have something to do with wood. Building things is clearly in my genes, which drew me to a career as a carpenter early on. Later, I studied steel and concrete engineering at ETH Zurich and got into information technology. After that, I was able to work on a research project at Karlsruhe University determining transverse tensile stresses in curved saddle roof beams. That was what really helped me to develop and gave me the push I needed to get more involved in working with wood.\n\nYou have seen timber construction evolve from being a niche construction segment to the current boom. Did you see this coming at all? No, I didn't anticipate this boom or the appeal that timber construction has today. I used to feel uneasy\n\n**1**\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/5 description: The image shows an overhead shot of a modern interior space, likely a building's staircase or walkway. The dominant material is wood, with a light, natural finish covering the floor and structural elements. A glass railing runs along the edge of the walkway, supported by dark metal posts and a stainless steel handrail. The glass panels are clear, allowing a view of the wooden floor beneath. The floor features a tactile paving surface, indicated by a grid of raised dots, likely for accessibility purposes. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the textures and patterns of the wood grain. The composition is clean and geometric, with the lines of the wood planks, glass panels, and metal supports creating a sense of order and precision. A small number \"10\" is visible in the bottom left corner.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Bjergsted Financial Park** \n\nFor these bank headquarters in Stavanger, Norway, Hermann Blumer arranged for construction of a life-sized mock-up, which ultimately convinced the bank manager to accept the timber design.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n10\n\n**1**\n\nAs your family ran a timber construction company, you grew up with wood.

At ETH Zurich, I was the only one of 220 students to focus on wood in their degree dissertation, and there weren't any separate courses as such. It was only at Karlsruhe University that I was able to get a better scientific understanding of timber. Even more importantly, I was so fascinated by computer technology that I spent a lot of time programming. Even back in 1969, I was saying that we needed to bring these two areas together: timber and computer science.\n\n#### Which is precisely what gives timber construction a certain advantage today.\n\nYes, I would even say a very significant advantage! At the research project in Karlsruhe, I had to develop and solve complex mathematical formulas – this gave rise to systems of equations with around 100 unknowns. The\n\ncomputer needed several hours to solve these systems. There were no computer screens in those days – to edit and save your work, you worked with punch cards and keyboards. It was laborious but this basic research was enormously important for the later years.\n\n### Why didn't you stay and pursue a career in research?\n\nWhen I had been in Karlsruhe for two years, my father fell ill and I went back home to the company, to continue his legacy. At the time, we had a sawmill, carpentry shop and joinery with around 25 employees. The time spent working together wasn't easy for my father. I was too progressive and constantly called everything into question – and I made a few stupid mistakes too. For example, in 1974 I bought a cabinet-sized computer – a PDP8 from the Digital Equipment Corporation. We were barely able to use it at all because there were hardly any programs for it and, as I said, it\n\ndidn't have a screen.

The first was the development of BSB (Blumer-System-Binder), a powerful and also visually appealing connection system for rod-shaped wooden structures. I worked on that for seven years and when I was on holiday in 1978, I had the breakthrough idea. Something that used to take hours – from planning and calculation to transferring data to the CNC machines – now took a matter of minutes. That was a quantum leap and a real breakthrough in timber framework construction.\n\nThe second milestone was the development of Lignatur box beams in 1984.

Lignatur floor and roof elements are very popular in housing today precisely because they are more versatile than concrete ones.\n\nThe third milestone was the arrival of the Lignamatic CNC machine in 1985 – the idea actually came to me at four in the morning! I was driving from Hanover to Switzerland with mechanical engineer Fritz Krüsi from the neighbouring village of Schönengrund, and the journey developed into a kind of creative frenzy. By the time we arrived home, we had designed the first ever computer-controlled five-axis processing machine. This suddenly opened up entirely new possibilities in timber construction.\n\nThese three milestones were vital in getting us away from the expensive and laborious side of timber construction and ushering in a new era of automation.\n\nYou also performed pioneering work\n\n12\n\ncomputer needed several hours to solve these systems.

What role did that play in the development of timber construction?\n\nChanging the fire safety regulations was actually the fourth milestone that brought about a key turning point in timber construction. The strict fire safety regulations in Zurich only permitted timber constructions with two storeys. Timber faced a lot of discrimination as a construction material back then. We wanted to change that and I started the ball rolling in 1992. Together with Lignum, the umbrella organisation of the Swiss timber industry, we went to the Swiss association of cantonal building insurers and announced that we wanted to make timber buildings more fireproof than concrete and steel buildings. To begin with, they just shook their heads. But it did prompt ETH to begin conducting research, which in turn led to the entire fire safety regulations for timber construction being revised. Switzerland really led the way in opening things up here. \n\n#### **1:**\n\n**Emma Kunz Pavilion** Based on drawings by artist Emma Kunz, Hermann Blumer and his team developed a pavilion in his home town of Waldstatt.\n\n#### **2:**\n\nThe numerous inventions of the 80-year-old engineer provided the impetus behind modern timber construction.\n\n### **3:**\n\n**Wisdome** Blumer supplied the design for a lattice of dowelled beams for the extension of Stockholm Technical Museum.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n»If you want to survive in architecture today, you have to include timber in your designs or you will lose market share.«\n\n14\n\nHermann Blumer\n\n**Skyspace Amarta**\n\nFor American artist James Turrell, the Swiss timber construction pioneer flew to the Maldives and helped to construct the space/light installation made of wood. \n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn spite of the current boom, timber construction accounted for no more than 24% of the Austrian market in 2018, measured in terms of total usable floor area in the building sector. Realistically speaking, where do you see the limits for timber construction?\n\nThe turning points I mentioned earlier threw the market wide open for timber construction – and there is now a clear trend among real estate developers and architects alike. If you want to survive in architecture today, you have to include timber in your designs or you will lose market share. There are a great many public buildings made of timber in Switzerland today.\n\nBut at the same time, you get people asking whether timber isn't more expensive. That's a rather annoying question because it's not all that simple to compare reinforced concrete and steel construction with timber construction. Some benefits of timber construction are overlooked and are therefore not factored into calculations. This kind of tunnel vision has been the bane of my life.\n\n### And what is your prediction for timber construction?\n\nIn the years to come, more and more above-ground constructions around the world will be made of timber because, for ecological reasons, it's the only real option. Timber never used to be seen as a viable option for the future but today the opposite is true: if you're building for the future, you use timber. I can imagine timber construction around the world\n\n**Skyspace Amarta** For American artist James Turrell, the Swiss timber construction pioneer flew to the Maldives and helped to construct the space/light installation made of wood.\n\n14\n\n»If you want to survive in\n\nHermann Blumer\n\narchitecture today, you have to\n\ninclude timber in your designs\n\nor you will lose market share.«\n\nincreasing to as much as a third. You can also see this from the fact that many large contractors are now moving into timber. Previously, nothing was made of wood apart from the concrete formwork.\n\n#### Where do you think the potential of timber construction could be further increased?\n\nWe are already well advanced in the area of construction but when it comes to curative timber construction, for example, it's still early days. In Appenzell, we built the two Mosersweid residential buildings for real estate developer Jan Schoch – larch on the outside and Swiss pine on the inside. These houses are extremely comfortable and there is hardly any need for heating. We are entering a new world where timber is used for more than just supporting or panelling. For example, the wood from Swiss pine actively prevents mould and lowers your heart rate. There are more than 50,000 types of wood in the world. A treasure trove of wood just waiting to be discovered.\n\nYou are regarded as a pioneer of timber construction and have had a hand in many innovative solutions in contemporary architecture. Which ones are you particularly proud of? It was very exciting to work on designs with Shigeru Ban. But it was also very challenging because for every project he came up with a new idea – sometimes almost impossible to implement. People said that it wouldn't be possible to use timber for the Centre Pompidou-Metz. I had\n\na brief meeting with him at the airport and confirmed that it would be possible but had no idea how I would actually go about it. I spent seven months holed up, racking my brains. In the end, the solution was quite simple. And that made all the effort worthwhile.\n\nOther highlights include art projects, some of which appear mystical, like the light sculpture by American artist James Turrell on the Maldives. Or the Emma Kunz Pavilion in my home town of Waldstatt, which I designed together with Norwegian architectural firm Helen & Hard. Emma Kunz was a local artist and alternative practitioner who produced over 500 pendulum drawings on millimetre graph paper, all strictly geometric. My job was to create a walk-in pavilion based on these drawings.\n\n# Wisdome Stockholm, one of the most spectacular timber construction projects of our time, is due to open soon. How did this come about?\n\nArchitects Johan Oscarson and Jonas Elding – together with engineer Florian Kosche – won the competition with a timber gridshell structure. The condition was that timber construction company Stora Enso would provide laminated veneer lumber and cross-laminated timber – in other words, only flat materials. In the planning phase, the project came to me via Blumer Lehmann and I saw that the engineer's proposal was a reciprocal frame, which did not correspond with the grid support structure in the competition →\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: This image shows a close-up of a wooden structure, possibly part of a building's interior. The structure consists of a vertical wooden beam supporting a horizontal beam with a curved design. The horizontal beam has two circular indentations on its side. The ceiling above is made of parallel wooden slats, and there is a light source illuminating the space between the horizontal beam and the ceiling.

I found the solution and that in turn triggered a radically different approach in the production process.\n\n### The Japanese architect and Pritzker prizewinner Shigeru Ban sees you as a kind of kindred spirit. What connects the two of you?\n\nWith Shigeru Ban, I always end up in the same kind of situation where I promise something without having any idea how I am going to deliver it. By now, he also realises that's how I operate. But of course, this pressure also leads to advancements in construction.\n\nEven though there was a certain language barrier, we were able to sort of intertwine our knowledge in a similar way to the demonstrations with photons by quantum physicist Anton Zeilinger. Shigeru Ban produces statically optimal sketches where you can already see everything. Just like him, I am always searching. For systems, for solutions and for people to support me.

If we were to make available one cubic metre of timber to each person, this would be like a kind of share (in the financial sense) or – even more so – like a kind of life insurance. At 400 to 500 Swiss francs (around 420-525 euros) a year, this would be an enormous help to many people.\n\nAccording to American biologist Edward O. Wilson's biophilia hypothesis, people have an innate affinity for other life forms like trees. As well as this, it has now been proven that wood has a positive influence on people's health. Doesn't this make building with timber more of an urgent priority?\n\nYes, definitely. The development has already begun in the\n\nbuilding of new hospitals. Shigeru Ban and I are currently involved in a project in this area – a six-storey hospital in Ukraine. It's a fascinating construction, not unlike the Tamedia building. It only consists of pegged timber connections, but this time the construction is made of cross-laminated timber. A local company is providing the elements for this – that's the only way we could offer this solution in the first place.\n\n### Will our connection with nature become even more important in the coming age of digitalisation?\n\n If all we do is stare at our phones and no longer notice the flowers growing by the wayside, then things look pretty dismal for humanity.

We ensure that all stages of planning and working adhere to the highest environmental and efficiency standards. One key aspect here is the selection of sustainable building materials. Wherever feasible in the respective circumstances, UBM uses timber. This focus alone enables the smallest possible carbon footprint for our projects during construction. We lift the burden that is inevitably placed on our environment by steel and cement.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows a tall, modern building with a wooden frame and glass windows. The building is located on a waterfront, and there are trees and other buildings in the background. The text in the image says that the building is called Timber Peak and that it is being developed by UBM. It also says that the building is the tallest timber hybrid building in Rhineland-Palatinate and that it is located in Mainz' former customs port.\n\n26 27\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Timber is perfect for our strategy\n\nUsing wood as a construction material reflects the UBM corporate strategy: green. smart. and more. The aim behind this strategy is to develop sustainable, intelligent and aesthetically sophisticated real estate. Building with wood helps to achieve all three of these aspects. After all, timber hybrid design offers many and varied, far-reaching benefits compared with conventional reinforced concrete construction.\n\n#### **Timber engineering reduces the carbon footprint**\n\nThe construction of buildings is responsible for around six per cent of global CO2 emissions. As an innovative developer, we have the responsibility and the means to make a key contribution to reducing these emissions. We have chosen to pursue this by using wood consistently as a construction material. Unlike mineral construction materials, wood absorbs CO2 instead of generating it – such as during production of steel and concrete. And it is highly efficient: one cubic metre of wood locks up a whole tonne of CO2 over the long term. This enables us to save a proportion of the two billion tonnes of CO2 per year which are currently being emitted into the environment as a result of the huge use of concrete and steel in building construction.\n\n#### **Timber construction saves time and money**\n\n**Timber Peak**\n\nUBM is developing the tallest timber hybrid building in Rhineland-Palatinate, at a height of almost 45 metres, in Mainz' former customs port.\n\nIn timber engineering, a large amount of the construction work is done in advance. Floor and roof decks, walls and even entire rooms are no longer produced on building sites, but instead by automatically controlled CNC machines at timber engineering companies where working conditions are stable. Once they reach the site, the prefabricated, high-precision modules only have to be fitted in place. This makes the whole process much quicker, quieter, safer and cleaner than on a conventional building site, which benefits both the environment and the surrounding neighbourhood. Besides this, modular, standardised and systematised prefabrication is much more advantageous not just for the ongoing construction process, but also for later on when the building is disassembled.\n\n#### **Timber engineering is a safety factor**\n\nIt comes as no surprise that industrial prefabrication and the resultant notable simplification of building site logistics reduce the risk of accidents. Less obviously, but also proven and reassuring is the fact that timber performs much better in terms of fire protection – for instance, compared to steel. This is because a steel construction collapses spontaneously when exposed to extremely high temperatures, whereas a timber construction maintains its load-bearing capacity for longer as wood burns controllably – and very slowly in comparison. In emergencies, residents of a timber building therefore gain valuable time, allowing them to leave safely.\n\n#### **Timber engineering experts on board**\n\nTimber construction is experiencing a global boom – for good reason. In turn, architects and manufacturers of prefabricated wooden elements are amassing the relevant know-how. This wealth of expertise is used by us whenever we develop a project with timber, allowing us to benefit from state-of-the-art solutions that are compelling, from the draft right through to the finished product. Of course, UBM also employs its own renowned timber construction experts. And thanks to our numerous development projects, our know-how is also growing every single day.\n\n#### **Green light for green thinking**\n\nThe EU Taxonomy regulations and detailed ESG specifications are now steering international financial flows towards green companies and projects. This means real estate projects with relevant certification are in with a better chance of success right from the outset. They are seen as investments that are both attractive and sustainable, are more soughtafter on the market and less expensive to run. Timber buildings are generally at an advantage here simply because of the choice of material, and they ultimately bring in higher sums when they are sold or rented out. Timber design offers tangible benefits for all UBM stakeholders. There is a lasting gain for buyers, tenants, investors in the UBM shares and bonds, and naturally the environment throughout the entire life cycle of our real estate projects.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/0 description: This image shows a modern office space with a focus on natural elements.

Back in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, we made the decision to design the building as a timber hybrid construction. This enabled us to solve two problems at the same time. On the one hand, lockdown cast doubt on the success of the originally planned 350-room hotel for an indefinite period. And on the other, the demand for ecologically convincing real estate was increasing all the time. Looking back, it was clear that paradoxically a crisis became the motor for our strategic reorientation and transformation as a developer. It has returned our focus to our asset classes of Residential and Office, while acting as a stimulus for the consistent use of innovative materials and designs.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/0 description: A woman is walking towards a kitchen area in a building.

Located in the attractive Europaviertel of this economic metropolis, in the direct vicinity of the F.A.Z. Tower – another UBM Development project, it offers approx. 15,000 square metres of space. The swift reaction shows that we have captured the current mood, with the right location, asset class and design. Less than four months after the topping-out ceremony on 20 October 2022, and therefore far in advance of completion, we were able to let almost 10,000 square metres to Union Investment. The company is planning to move into its space in the\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/3 description: The image shows a modern building with a glass facade and a white frame.

Timber Pioneer has therefore put us right at the top of the list for all letting in Frankfurt until the 4th quarter of 2023.\n\n# **Building shell finished in record time thanks to digital identification**\n\nTimber Pioneer uses more than just wood as a newly discovered building material, it also employs a new building method. The individual timber elements are prefabricated at an engineering company, then transported to the building site, where they are simply put together in the right places. Owing to its size, this was a superb feat of logistical planning even though the entire production and building process was computer-controlled. The individual elements of glued laminated timber were furnished with QR codes and recorded in a digital system that specified their precise position in the overall construction. A relatively small assembly team then connected the elements of the push-fit system and screwed them to the slim concrete parts, forming a stable unit. This method meant about 1,000 square metres of building shell were completed per week.\n\n# **Identification and motivation**\n\nTimber Pioneer is an excellent example of how wood as a building material can create an atmosphere that is relaxed and inviting. It therefore clearly upholds the trend of more lounge-like interior designs typical of innovative office floors. With more people now returning to offices, timber constructions are enhancing the conventional office as a place where people come together, while also making hybrid modes of working more attractive. Beyond its function in team building, timber construction can even have a positive influence on recruiting. Highly qualified applicants are increasingly likely to choose companies that are aware of their ecological responsibility and offer contemporary workplaces. And so it comes as no surprise that it is especially these aspects that generally increase identification and motivation among all employees.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n# The UBM Timber Family is expanding\n\nAt the end of 2024, Timber Pioneer in Frankfurt am Main will be followed by initial construction stages for further members of our Timber Family at attractive sites in Germany, Austria and Czechia:\n\nTimber Factory (Munich), Timber Marina Tower (Vienna), Timber Living (Munich), Timber View (Mainz), Timber Port (Düsseldorf), Timber Works (Munich),\n\nTimber Peak (Mainz) and Timber Praha (Prague).\n\nIn addition, another major timber construction project is in the pipeline – an entire neighbourhood, and therefore named without the word \"timber\".

Offering a total of 62 apartments, the four residential buildings in a timber hybrid design with several storeys are the first of their kind in Czechia. They are being built in Stodůlky, an up-and-coming district of Prague, as part of Arcus City, which is a development project with 270 apartments, ten single-family houses and five shopping malls.\n\n#### **Sustainable building and operation**\n\nThe low carbon emissions and high energy efficiency of Timber Praha are remarkable, and these attributes are also gaining increased attention and value in Czechia. Planned as a robust wooden construction, the structure is being prefabricated by the globally renowned company ELK in Austria. It consists of solid cross-laminated timber boards for the supporting interior walls and floor/ceiling decks, while the outer walls of the facade have a timber-frame design. The choice of material, environmentally friendly module production and rapid assembly reduce the carbon footprint and costs at the same time. Besides this, the consequent use of geothermal energy, heat pumps and photovoltaics enables the houses to be operated with maximum energy efficiency, which in turn offers the potential for attractive saving over the long term.\n\n#### **Sustainable, efficient – and sold quickly**\n\nIn the middle of September 2023, just three months after the start of construction and about a year before completion, one of the four planned Timber Praha houses with 15 apartments and almost 1,000 square metres was already sold. Key contributors were the planned BREEAM \"Excellent\" certification and the prospect of a Category A energy certificate, which is the most economical. The project's energy efficiency was most persuasive for the buyer, Future X. UBM is now spearheading a platform that aims to raise the twelve-metre limit in Prague for projects with a timber hybrid design.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n# One of the world's tallest timber buildings\n\nAt a height of 113 metres, the Timber Marina Tower developed by UBM will be one of the world's tallest timber hybrid buildings. We are especially pleased that this shows our immense expertise in our home city of Vienna. It was here that UBM was founded more than 150 years ago – and our head office is still located in this Danube metropolis. Building of the Timber Marina Tower is due to start in early 2025, and completion is scheduled for late 2026.\n\nThe tower will consist of 32 upper storeys and 4 basement storeys with approx. 44,350 square metres above ground. Situated in Waterfront, a vibrant development area on the Danube Marina, the Timber Marina Tower will be reachable quickly and easily from Vienna's city centre and also Vienna International Airport. This striking timber construction will adhere to EU Taxonomy and ESG requirements, and the project is also aiming for LEED Gold certification. Environmentally friendly and cost-effective operation of the office tower will be achieved by means of geothermal energy, use of groundwater and the installation of photovoltaics.\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/3 description: The image shows a bridge over a body of water, with a building in the background.

That was quite a bold move, wouldn't you say?\n\nPeter Schaller: UBM's focus on timber and sustainable construction is an excellent strategy with which the company is developing the right product for the future. This was one of the main reasons why I accepted the offer to join its Management Board. As well as that, I have known UBM as a company for many years. One of my first projects as construction manager at PORR was a UBM project: the Anděl City Residence in Prague. That was a major project for me in my younger days – and ultimately a very successful one. And over the last 15 years as head of the PORR office in Styria, I have handled many projects for and with UBM. All of them turned out very well and there was always a real sense of partnership. Which, needless to say, fosters trust.\n\nAs a manager in the construction industry, how did you view the different developers, i.e. your clients?\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, I was able to work with them on the projects on equal terms, in a balanced partnership.

Here, timber construction is not only the most obvious method of construction but also the best. This is why we have committed ourselves to timber construction. Another great advantage of timber is that the constructions can be prefabricated at\n\nengineering companies under constant climate conditions.

The high degree of prefabrication in timber construction means that we are effectively moving construction sites in-house. This helps us to get around the shortage of skilled labour on construction sites and keep quality consistently high. On-site assembly is much faster than conventional reinforced concrete construction and there is less noise and dust, which of course keeps local people happy. And having a shorter construction phase also means lower financing costs and lower construction site overheads.\n\n### However, the high degree of prefabrication in timber hybrid construction means a longer lead time for planning.\n\nYou need to decide at the beginning of the planning process whether to use timber or conventional materials.

The shortage of skilled workers is a general problem that affects all industries. It's probably easier to find skilled workers for engineering companies than for construction sites.

What does this department bring to the table?\n\nUBM is aspiring to be one of the leading developers of timber construction projects in Europe. This means that its entire experience and expertise in this area needs to be bundled centrally so it can make this knowledge available to the entire Group and ensure that the same standard is applied throughout. There is a huge amount happening in this area at the moment – the market is being bombarded with new information, new guidelines, new certifications, inspection results, etc. We need to stay on top of this, and the best way to do that is to have a special department devoted to it. Bernhard Egert and his team do marvellous work and are always on the cutting edge of new developments. Sustainability and timber construction are part of the company's DNA – that is why we need to have this core expertise in-house and expand it. You can't always source it from outside.\n\nhas been CTO of UBM since November 2023. Schaller studied industrial engineering for construction at Graz Technical University and is a renowned construction expert. His career has taken him to Poland, Czechia, Slovenia and Germany, and from 2007 he held management positions at Porr, most recently heading their operations in Graz.\n\nUBM is developing the Timber Marina Tower in Vienna which, at 113 metres, will be one of the world's tallest timber high-rises. Is it fair to say that this project is an enormous challenge?\n\nAbsolutely. I have no doubt whatsoever that timber is up to the task. But fire safety, load-bearing capacity, sound insulation, etc. are issues that need to be resolved in a constant exchange of information between technical planners, contractors and authorities. We are developing the project using the Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) approach. This means that our long-standing contractors are involved in planning and developing the tower from the outset. But yes, this is also uncharted territory for us and it is a major challenge that calls for a certain amount of courage. But it's also a challenge that we relish.\n\n### Sustainability is not only a central question for UBM because of environmental and climate protection factors but also due to economic considerations.\n\nWe have committed ourselves to sustainability and it has become part of our business model. It's important to bear in mind that the individual measures needed for environmentally friendly and sustainable projects also entail costs. But at the end of the day, it also needs to make economic sense. And the market must be willing to pay an appropriate price for our projects.\n\nInterview: **Karl Abentheuer**\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"consequent.\" in white text on a brown background.\n\n38 39\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of two weathered wooden planks with a dark gap between them.

Taking the UBM Green Lease Framework as a basis, it is possible to draw up rental agreements that offer sustainable benefits for all involved.\n\nFor instance, besides a reduction in energy and ancillary costs, such agreements enable commercial tenants to implement their corporate sustainability strategy. Lessors also benefit as the building becomes more attractive for lessees with ESG reporting obligations.\n\nThis optimises the relationship between lessor and lessee fundamentally as well. Whereas conventional rental agreements are often restricted to defining individual interests, in the Green Lease both parties agree to sustainability commitments as an overriding goal. This encourages them to work in a partnership that brings longterm advantages on both sides.\n\nOur Green Lease Framework shows starting points and methods for the sustainable utilisation and management of buildings, which results in collective gains for all participants while encouraging open and trusting collaboration. Both parties set their sights on a common interest.\n\n#### **The bigger picture with an attention to detail**\n\nThe UBM Green Lease Framework provides general information and also detailed suggestions on how to achieve more sustainability. It covers all topics of modern building management, up to and including regulations that are specific to a particular building in Green Lease clauses of rental agreements:\n\nSaving energy: Around 28 per cent of global CO2 emissions are produced by the operation of buildings alone. Using renewable energy sources therefore makes a significant contribution towards carbon reduction – and this is implemented by UBM to the greatest possible extent. Energy consumption can be reduced by using an energy monitoring system and smart lighting, and also by switching off equipment.\n\nReducing waste: The Circular Economy action plan was initiated by the European Commission in 2015 to avoid waste. Waste volume and waste separation are also continually monitored during the operation of buildings. Avoiding waste saves energy and resources; sorting waste into individual categories enables technically correct recycling.\n\nSaving water: Resource-friendly use of water and wastewater is vitally important during the utilisation of buildings. As a property developer, UBM includes useful solutions in the area of water consumption. These include the treatment of rainwater and greywater, the separation of drinking and process water, and also water-efficient fixtures, to reduce drinking water requirements considerably.\n\nShaping mobility: UBM develops individual mobility concepts for each project in order to reduce carbon emissions. These include, for example, good public transport connections, electric charging points for cars and bicycles, car sharing and e-bike hire.\n\nOptimising cleaning: One of the many recommendations detailed in the Green Lease Framework is the use of cleaning products with environmental labels such as the Blue Angel or the EU Ecolabel. These do the job while reducing any damage to the environment. In addition, labels that cover the entire product life cycle reveal where packaging waste can be saved.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/46/Picture/0 description: The image shows two brochures standing upright against a white background.

Potential savings can be identified and process optimisation can be triggered with greater precision if exact and informative data is available. Complex or mixed-use real estate inevitably \"produces\" a wealth of information. For this reason, we focus our efforts on the parameters that have already proven relevant to costs, risks or contractual considerations.\n\nMeasuring and counting devices for the consumption of water, heat, cold and power have long been successful in practice. They determine and store figures on each kind of consumption, enabling fair and consumer-friendly billing. Condensed into long-term consumption profiles, this data can also supply valuable reference material on how to achieve even greater efficiency in energy management, for example.\n\n#### **Coming together as a whole**\n\nThe UBM Green Lease Framework also regulates and encourages communication between all involved. For example, it includes plans for either party to provide the other with information soon afterwards if a sustainability issue is detected in the building. Coordination meetings usually take place every three or six months, with problems that occur in-between being solved jointly depending on their size and urgency.\n\nThese range from purely administrative tasks such as monitoring the agreed Green Lease goals, and also complex data evaluations, through to the time-intensive preparation of a sustainability report.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/47/Picture/0 description: A daytime shot of a modern, multi-story building with a stepped design.

The most recent example is the UBM Green Bond 2023–2027 with a volume of 50 million euros. Our UBM Green Finance Framework was taken as the basis\n\nfor this issue.\n\nCONSEQUENT\n\nIn order to provide a transparent description of our specifications for the issue of sustainable financial instruments, we drew up the UBM Green Finance Framework. It is oriented on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, which were passed as the 2030 Agenda in 2015, and also integrates EU Taxonomy requirements. Our UBM Green Finance Framework is in line with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2021 and also the LMA Green Loan Principles 2023, and it is compliant with the best practices on the market.\n\nThe guidelines set out in the UBM Green Finance Framework apply to every issue of green financial instruments, including Green Bonds, Green Loans and Green Promissory Note Loans. This enables us to ensure that the net proceeds are exclusively used to finance and refinance green projects whose environmental benefits have been irrefutably proven.\n\n#### **Clear specifications for each step**\n\nThe criteria defined in the UBM Green Finance Framework comprise the following recommended focal areas:\n\n- Use of proceeds\n- Project evaluation and selection\n- Management of proceeds\n- Reporting\n\n#### Use of proceeds\n\nOur Green Finance Framework specifies that we use the entire net proceeds from the issue of green financial instruments to finance and/or refinance – in full or in part – new or existing Eligible Projects. These are chosen by an internal panel of experts that assigns them based on clearly defined criteria from the two categories Green Buildings and Renewable Energy.\n\n#### Project evaluation and selection\n\nWe see the evaluation and selection process for Eligible Green Projects as a key procedure. For this reason, UBM established a Green Finance Committee (GFC) comprising the Chief Financial Officer, Head of Treasury, Head of Investor Relations & ESG, Head of Green Building and Head of Controlling. Only projects that receive approval from all GFC members are rated as Eligible Green Projects, and this decision is binding. A list of Eligible Green Projects is drawn up by the Investor Relations & ESG department and updated on an ongoing basis.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nEverything comes together in the UBM Green Finance Committee. Among other things, the GFC is responsible for checking if the proposed allocations are compliant with the general company policies and ESG strategy. For example, it ensures that potential Eligible Green Projects are in line with the categories and eligibility criteria. The GFC meets at least once a year and until all allocations are complete.\n\nUBM has prepared a comprehensive ESG risk analysis to identify the most important environmental, social and governance risks relating to its company management and operations. Negative environmental impact due to high energy consumption, a lack of biodiversity, low recycling levels and durability of construction materials, and also risks for the health and safety of employees are some examples.\n\nThis analysis has been used by UBM to take the strategic decisions necessary to minimise risk and develop a concrete package of measures that include a focus on timber construction and also UBM's emphasis on renewable energy and green building certification. Our integrated management system for occupational safety and health protection sets standards here.\n\nAs soon as a serious ecological or social risk is identified, the GFC already prepares proposals for minimising this risk during the project evaluation and selection process. In addition, the compliance management system introduced by UBM kicks in to minimise the risk of potential violations of legal provisions and also \"systematically\" ensure adherence to all framework conditions.\n\n#### Management of proceeds\n\nThe net proceeds from our green financial instruments are managed by UBM's Treasury department on a portfolio basis. These proceeds are allocated in full to Eligible Green Projects. If the projects are divested or discontinued, or if they fail to fulfil the eligibility criteria at some point, we will replace this asset with a suitable alternative as soon as possible. UBM is committed to reaching full allocation of the net proceeds, to the best of its ability, within 36 months of the relevant issue.\n\n#### Reporting\n\nUBM intends to prepare ongoing reports on the allocation and effects of the Eligible Green Projects in the year after issue of the green financial instruments. These reports will be published on the UBM website. The allocation report provides indicators such as the total amount of outstanding green financial instruments, amount of proceeds, geographical distribution of the Eligible Green Projects, balance of unallocated proceeds, amount or percentage of new financing and refinancing, and also examples of Eligible Green Projects. The impact report documents the effects of the Green Projects. For example, it provides information on certification, generation of renewable energy, and measures on carbon and energy saving. UBM commissioned ISS ESG with the preparation of a Second Party Opinion (SPO) on the Green Finance Framework with regard to adherence to the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2021 and LMA Green Loan Principles 2023. This has been published on the UBM website together with the UBM Green Finance Framework.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Green Bond**  Due to its focus, this bond with a volume of €50m could be placed in July 2023.\n\nImage /page/50/Figure/1 description: This image is an advertisement for UBM Green Bond 2023-2027.

The man is wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a striped tie. The text \"CONSEQUENT\" is visible in the upper left corner of the image.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n# »Right now, cash management is our top priority.«\n\nIn his position as CFO, **Patric Thate** placed UBM's first Green Bond in July 2023 and was able to report over 150 million euros of cash and an equity ratio of approx. 30 per cent as at 31 December 2023. Consistent implementation of UBM's timber construction strategy is designed to generate profit for the future.\n\n# In 2023, UBM Development AG was \nin the red for the first time since \nthe Second World War. What is the reason for that?\n\nCONSEQUENT\n\nWhen the ECB increased interest rates in the summer, it meant that we had to undertake an extraordinary revaluation of our projects as at 30 June. This involved determining to what extent the carrying amounts were still applicable given the changed interest rate situation and rent expectations. We were forced to make further write-downs in the second half of the year. All in all, we devalued our Group-wide projects by €70m, which as a percentage is roughly on a par with what our competitors had to do as well.\n\n### The ECB's interest rate hikes hit the economy hard, mostly because of the sheer speed at which they occurred.\n\nThat's correct. It was the fastest interest rate increase of all time. The increase rate levels themselves were nothing unusual, but the speed at which they were hiked was unheard of. In fact, it was so fast that the markets were unable to adjust properly to the change. This led to all the turbulence we saw on the markets.\n\nUBM's main focus is on the Residential and the Light Industrial & Office asset classes. The balance between supply and demand is severely misaligned in both segments.\n\nYes, you could say that. After all, demand hasn't really changed at all. Our products are still very much in demand. There is a need for housing and commercial spaces, and also as-new, high-grade office space. That is not the problem. The problem is the uncertainty among investors, who have to buy at an ROI that is extremely difficult to gauge because of the changed interest rate environment. The ratios simply aren't right at the moment.\n\nAfter ten interest rate hikes in a row, the ECB has left the key rate at 4.5% since autumn 2023. Does this mean that the markets will return to normality?\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n# »We are in the same kind of situation that Tesla was in four or five years ago.«\n\nPatric Thate\n\nIn the first instance, this stability will assuage investors' fears of buying too expensive. But their fear of buying at the wrong time still remains. Of course, falling interest rates are essentially a good thing. But we have an inverted yield curve at the moment. This means that yields for short-term investments are higher than those of long-term investments. So, a moderate decrease in interest rates won't make much of a difference to our ratios. It will take a while for the market to recover.\n\n### What steps is UBM taking to counteract all of these developments?\n\nWe are focusing our full attention on the resources that we have – i.e. cash. We are monitoring our cash very closely and managing our cash flow very carefully. Right now, cash management is our top priority. We need to know every day where exactly we stand. We need to weigh up precisely what we should spend and what we should not spend. We are keeping our purse strings tight at the moment and can't afford to experiment. It's not the right time for that. At the balance sheet date, we had cash balances of €151.5 million and an equity ratio of 30%. This means we are on a very sound footing. Our reserves will last longer than those of most of our competitors. This will enable us to ride out the adjustment phase that has already begun on the market and will leave us in an even stronger position than ever before.\n\n#### Why do you say that?\n\nThe market will tilt towards demand. At the moment, hardly anything is being produced but the demand is there, the need is there. So, there will be growing pressure to satisfy this demand as well.\n\n### UBM successfully placed its first Green Bond, with a volume of €50 million, as recently as July 2023. That was no mean feat given these challenging times.\n\nYes, we managed to find the right window for placing the bond in these turbulent times. We were the only ones far and wide. You could put it down to good timing, but you always need to have some good fortune as well.\n\n#### The next bond repayment isn't due until the end of 2025.\n\nThat's great, of course, because it means that we won't have to refinance any bonds until then.\n\n### With the zero interest rate phase having come to an end and key rates now at 4.5%, the time factor is suddenly costing money again.\n\nYes, time costs money again. As real estate developers, there are things on our timescale that we can influence, and things that are very difficult for us to influence. One thing we have little or no influence over is approval procedures. They take as long as they take – there is no fixed schedule to be adhered to. Here, we are dependent on someone whose brief is to check\n\nthings with a fine-tooth comb and for whom time is no object. But what we can influence is the time from the approval to the end product. By this I mean not only the actual development stage but above all the building stage. And when it comes to building, modular timber construction saves you precious time.\n\n#### In other words, the high-interest phase is actually helping UBM?\n\nAs crazy as that may sound – and, of course, I would much prefer not to have had the current crisis in the industry, this situation does in fact confirm our strategy once again. Particularly because the time aspect is suddenly of great importance. We have a clear competitive advantage thanks to our focus on developing timber construction projects. This strategy and this focus are one of the few ways in which it is possible to secure long-term future viability in our industry.\n\n### Apart from its clear focus on timber hybrid construction, UBM's commitment to sustainability involves operating buildings using renewable energies, especially geothermal energy and photovoltaics.\n\nUp until Russia's attack on Ukraine, ancillary costs weren't all that important – it was the size of the rent that mattered. But now, the entire package needs to be competitive, i.e. rent and running costs together. This means that it's okay for rent to be a\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Patric Thate**\n\nhas been CFO of UBM since 2017 and is responsible for the considerable improvement in the company's financial positioning and its resultant competitive advantage.

Other advantages of renewable energies are having full control over energy sources and being able to plan costs. With geothermal energy, for example, you know exactly how high energy costs will be in the next 20 or 30 years. Being able to plan has become much more important.\n\nIn the first instance, this stability will assuage investors' fears of buying too expensive. But their fear of buying at the wrong time still remains. Of course, falling interest rates are essentially a good thing. But we have an inverted yield curve at the moment. This means that yields for short-term investments are higher than those of long-term investments. So, a moderate decrease in interest rates won't make much of a difference to our ratios. It will take a while for the\n\nPatric Thate\n\nWhy do you say that?\n\n»We are in the same kind\n\nin four or five years ago.«\n\nof situation that Tesla was\n\ndemand as well.\n\nlenging times.\n\nThe market will tilt towards demand. At the moment, hardly anything is being produced but the demand is there, the need is there. So, there will be growing pressure to satisfy this\n\nCONSEQUENT\n\nthings with a fine-tooth comb and for whom time is no object. But what we can influence is the time from the approval to the end product. By this I mean not only the actual development stage but above all the building stage. And when it comes to building, modular timber construction saves\n\nIn other words, the high-interest phase is actually helping UBM? As crazy as that may sound – and, of course, I would much prefer not to have had the current crisis in the industry, this situation does in fact confirm our strategy once again. Particularly because the time aspect is suddenly of great importance. We have a clear competitive advantage thanks to our focus on developing timber construction projects. This strategy and this focus are one of the few ways in which it is possible to secure long-term future viability in\n\nApart from its clear focus on timber hybrid construction, UBM's commitment to sustainability involves operating buildings using renewable energies, especially geothermal\n\nUp until Russia's attack on Ukraine, ancillary costs weren't all that important – it was the size of the rent that mattered.

That was no mean feat given these chal-\n\nYes, we managed to find the right window for placing the bond in these turbulent times. We were the only ones far and wide. You could put it down to good timing, but you always need to have some good fortune as well.\n\nThe next bond repayment isn't due\n\nThat's great, of course, because it means that we won't have to refinance\n\nWith the zero interest rate phase having come to an end and key rates now at 4.5%, the time factor is sud-\n\nYes, time costs money again. As real estate developers, there are things on our timescale that we can influence, and things that are very difficult for us to influence. One thing we have little or no influence over is approval procedures. They take as long as they take – there is no fixed schedule to be adhered to. Here, we are dependent on someone whose brief is to check\n\ndenly costing money again.\n\nuntil the end of 2025.\n\nany bonds until then.\n\nWhat steps is UBM taking to counteract all of these developments? We are focusing our full attention on the resources that we have – i.e. cash. We are monitoring our cash very closely and managing our cash flow very carefully. Right now, cash management is our top priority. We need to know every day where exactly we stand. We need to weigh up precisely what we should spend and what we should not spend. We are keeping our purse strings tight at the moment and can't afford to experiment. It's not the right time for that. At the balance sheet date, we had cash balances of €151.5 million and an equity ratio of 30%. This means we are on a very sound footing. Our reserves will last longer than those of most of our competitors. This will enable us to ride out the adjustment phase that has already begun on the market and will leave us in an even stronger posi-\n\nmarket to recover.\n\ntion than ever before.\n\n#### Why did UBM decide to go with Green Financing?\n\nOur investors increasingly find themselves having to channel their money into green projects because it is specified and required politically. This is becoming increasingly important in the thinking of institutional investors, at least. That is why we have chosen this path and have continued to pursue it. Our first step here was to issue sustainability-linked bonds, thereby guaranteeing to investors that they were investing in a company with the required green rating. But at this point, we hadn't yet said what\n\nwe were going to do with the money. The second step was when we successfully placed our Green Bond in 2023. With this bond, we guarantee to investors that this money is also invested in properties with green certification, some of which are Taxonomy-eligible and some of which have a green lease as well. With green leases, we try to ensure that the property can actually make full use of its green character when in use. In any case, we have to demonstrate what we have done with the €50 million from the Green Bond, which of course gives us less leeway.\n\n### How do you see UBM's competitive position?\n\nWe have lots of levers that our competitors don't have – and we are making use of them all. We are in the same kind of situation that Tesla was in four or five years ago. Elon Musk went all in on batteries and electric cars. Lots of people had this idea before him – for instance BMW with\n\nthe i3. But they didn't stick to their guns. By contrast, Musk saw his idea through resolutely and secured a competitive edge that has remained. UBM has the product that works best in today's difficult environment, and we have a considerable lead on the technological front. We are in a good position and now need to retain this competitive edge. I have no doubt whatsoever that we will reap the fruits of our strategy because we worked resolutely to implement it – and because it's the right strategy.\n\nInterview: **Karl Abentheuer**\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a rough, textured surface, possibly wood or rock.

This means that we do not just reckon with opportunities for profit, but always have to weigh up the investment risks as well. And just like any company that \"produces\", our economic survival is crucially dependent on being able to sell our projects at a profit. Therefore, the stagnating market in 2023 – marked by a severe reluctance to invest and purchase – hit us hard, as it did many others as well.\n\n#### **The perfect storm fails to subside**\n\nThe fastest increase in interest rates ever experienced, rising construction costs, ongoing inflation fears, the threat of recession and a complete standstill on the transaction market whipped up a perfect storm.

Are these characteristics particularly\n\n#### What competence will see UBM through this existential sector crisis?\n\nWe established our timber construction expertise very quickly, and this is proving to be particularly valuable in the current crisis. All of our timber construction projects are compliant with ESG and EU Taxonomy requirements. As soon as the buyer's market picks up again, those properties whose intrinsic value will still be high in ten years' time will be bought first. And those are the projects that conform to ESG and EU Taxonomy regulations. If we have the financial latitude, we will also continue to implement these projects rather than casting doubt on them.\n\nUBM's stock exchange listing forces the company to be transparent, both externally and internally. That can't always be pleasant for the CEO. No, but the opposite – a lack of transparency – is positively lethal. Full transparency means full verifiability. We have to report on our liquidity situation every quarter. Anyone can see what projects we are pursuing and how much money needs to flow into our project pipeline. So, it's also common knowledge that we started with €423 million in cash at the end of 2021 and originally intended to use this money to buy up bargains. However, since the transaction market has ground to a halt, we are rather using this money as a liquidity cushion instead.\n\nUBM was already in a very difficult situation in 2020 when, due to the coronavirus pandemic, it had to change its strategy from being the largest hotel developer in Europe at the time to being a developer of timber construction projects. The next crisis situation followed in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Is it possible that UBM has become more resilient to crises due to its experience with the coronavirus crisis? Back in 2020, we were already staring into an existential abyss while other companies preferred to take a waitand-see approach. It was only when Putin attacked Ukraine that the public at large realised the boom phase was well and truly over. For the record, we should also point out that interest rates had already begun to rise before the war in Ukraine began. No one could have foreseen that they would stay at zero for so long. But the speed at which interest rates increased from zero to 4.5% was unheard of in our generation – and wholly unexpected.\n\n### No one can say when the interest rate environment will finally settle and when end investors will be ready to start investing again. Does UBM have the right strategic positioning in this uncertain phase?\n\nWe have asked ourselves time and again whether perhaps we are making a product that is no longer needed in this form – and the answer is always a resounding \"no\". If we real estate\n\ndevelopers don't step up and provide the homes that are so desperately needed, who will? Building firms build properties and developers develop them. It's not as if we were developing injection nozzles for diesel engines, where you wonder – and rightly so – whether there will still be a demand for them in the future. Rather, we are developing something that people need: a place to call home. Things are much the same in our second asset class: Light Industrial & Office. An enormous demand surplus is forming in all of these asset classes. Those players in our sector that manage to ride out this difficult phase stand to gain the lion's share of the profit. After all, we don't expect an entire industry to be wiped out.\n\nRecently, there has been a massive drop in the number of new office buildings being constructed because the trend towards working from home firmly established itself in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and many offices are now vacant. Nonetheless, UBM is still focusing on the Office asset class, often combined with Light Industrial.\n\n61 Remote work is now a regular feature of everyday working life. And I'm also aware that one day a week working from home theoretically translates into a 20% reduction in office space and that two days translate into a 40% reduction. But this is counterbalanced by the office zones that you have\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n# »Where geothermal energy can be used, it's almost a crime not to do so.«\n\nThomas G. Winkler\n\nto offer for new ways of working. There is far too little office space to meet these new expectations on the part of employees. That will lead to a paradoxical situation whereby the number of vacancies is increasing but at the same time the supply of office space that can compete with working from home is becoming increasingly scarce. This trend can already be seen very clearly in Vienna, where many new apartments have been built but nowhere near enough new office space for the New Work concept. It's only a matter of time until multiple potential tenants are competing for a small number of available office spaces – which in turn will push prices up again. I have no doubt that this will happen.\n\n### UBM is aiming to plug this gap with its LeopoldQuartier Office, where some 22,000 square metres of office space will be available in a prime location as of the end of 2025.\n\nIn the past, this project development would have been described as speculative and wouldn't have taken place without a preliminary valuation. However, we are living in extraordinary times and the LeopoldQuartier Office is an extraordinary product. Because of this, we are actually speculating that there will be a huge demand for this office space by the time it is completed. It is one of the best office locations – if not the best – currently available in Vienna. The property will be built in pioneering timber hybrid\n\ndesign. And those who want to reduce their commute to and from work can buy an apartment in the back of the LeopoldQuartier, which is surrounded by a park.\n\n### The sustainable nature of UBM's LeopoldQuartier Office is not limited to its timber construction – the building also minimises its operational footprint by using geothermal energy and photovoltaics.\n\nWhere geothermal energy can be used, it's almost a crime not to do so. When it comes to renewable energies, geothermal energy is undoubtedly the way to go.\n\n### It is also widely used in the Village im Dritten, UBM's second major real estate development in Vienna. Here, UBM is the junior partner to property developer Austria Real Estate (ARE) on five sites.\n\nWith ARE, we have a partner who also has a strong social obligation and who gave considerable thought early on in the process to what would be best for the common areas and green areas – and to geothermal energy too. So, we are currently involved in two key sustainability projects in Vienna – playing a leading role in LeopoldQuartier and as a junior partner in the Village im Dritten.\n\n# Back to the sector crisis: as CEO, are you the captain or just a passenger?\n\nYou're always the captain, but there are times when you question whether you're doing the right thing. Of course, when it comes to financing questions, you're just a passenger. However, and aside from the financing aspect, strategic questions – like our radical shift of focus towards timber construction and decisions about whether projects should go ahead or not – are very much on the shoulders of CEOs and depend greatly on their outlook. In a crisis, you are more aware of the risks that you are facing. And if you have backed the right horse several times, there is a greater chance that you will back the wrong one at one point. In the spirit of philosopher Sir Karl Popper, we are called upon to falsify convictions rather than to verify them. But once we have seen that a conviction carries weight, we apply it resolutely.\n\n### In 2023, the Signa Group collapsed with a resounding crash, leading to what was by far the largest insolvency in Austrian post-war history.

You're always the captain, but there are times when you question whether\n\nlimited to its timber construction – the building also minimises its operational footprint by using geothermal energy\n\nby a park.\n\nway to go.\n\non five sites.\n\nand photovoltaics.\n\n»Where geothermal energy\n\ncan be used, it's almost a crime\n\nto offer for new ways of working. There is far too little office space to meet these new expectations on the part of employees. That will lead to a paradoxical situation whereby the number of vacancies is increasing but at the same time the supply of office space that can compete with working from home is becoming increasingly scarce. This trend can already be seen very clearly in Vienna, where many new apartments have been built but nowhere near enough new office space for the New Work concept. It's only a matter of time until multiple potential tenants are competing for a small number of available office spaces – which in turn will push prices up again. I have no doubt\n\nThomas G. Winkler\n\nnot to do so.«\n\nthat this will happen.\n\nUBM is aiming to plug this gap with its LeopoldQuartier Office, where some 22,000 square metres of office space will be available in a prime location as of the end of 2025. In the past, this project development would have been described as speculative and wouldn't have taken place without a preliminary valuation. However, we are living in extraordinary times and the LeopoldQuartier Office is an extraordinary product. Because of this, we are actually speculating that there will be a huge demand for this office space by the time it is completed. It is one of the best office locations – if not the best – currently available in Vienna. The property will be built in pioneering timber hybrid\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/2 description: A man in a light blue shirt and dark tie stands in a wooded area with a dark blue jacket draped over his shoulder. He is wearing glasses and looking off to the side. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a forest or park.\n\nNow is the time for us to think through our business model again and to look at it carefully from all angles. It is already clear at this stage that you can't create any value with mere land speculation and that this is not going to change. Generally speaking, there is less pie to go around – and this is not going to change either. As well as that, the piece of the pie for people selling a plot of land is much smaller than it once was. Increased construction costs are making things difficult for our business model. So, we are asking ourselves the crucial question: how can we make our products cheaper? And the answer is serial and modular timber construction. Assembling rather than building, standardising rather than improvising: these same measures have led to significant cost efficiency in other sectors as well. If you were to build a VW Golf like carmakers used to in the earliest days of automotive construction, it would cost several hundred thousand euros.\n\n#### The EU Taxonomy and ESG regulations also look set to bring about lasting changes to real estate investments.\n\nYes. Both of these come from the recognition that we only have one planet. The EU Taxonomy and ESG are irreversible – in spite of all objections about whether we can actually afford this. There is no way around them. And this is why we are uncompromising in our focus on building with timber. Wood grows with the power of the sun and is completely independent of fossil fuels and the prices being paid for them. It is a renewable raw material with many\n\npositive attributes – it weighs much less and has a higher load-bearing capacity in many building situations. And – esoteric as it might sound – wood creates a completely different atmosphere. When you consider all of these positive attributes together, you can't help but wonder why timber construction and engineering have taken a back seat for over a century.\n\nInterview:\n\n#### **Karl Abentheuer**\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a tree trunk with the words \"Human Resources\" written on it.

Do women have a different\n\nKarin Sheppard: I think it is important to consider the traits that women and men can learn from each other and therefore bring to their leadership\n\nfemale leadership.\n\nleadership style to men?\n\nMartina Maly-Gärtner: A female leadership style is more inclusive, encourages greater participation and focuses more on sharing information and including employees in decision-making. Women contribute different types of experiences and perspectives to men. And by examining and discussing these different perspectives, you can find the ideal solution.\n\nSheppard: With my current leadership team, the ratio of women to men is 50:50 and I have no doubt that you get the best out of everyone when you bring diversity to the table. Some people prefer to initially listen and reflect, and then only respond afterwards. Others put forward an idea that hasn't been fully thought through. I find a combination of the two works best, drawing on a wealth of different styles and different views. I'm not saying that one is better than the other – rather, it's a question of learning from each other.\n\nSome studies have found that women are often the better choice for leadership positions, particularly in times of crisis. They suggest that a caring outlook, strong communication skills and a willingness to prioritise the common good over personal interests will help lead a company through a crisis with calm and composure. Do you see it that way as well?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: Particularly in times of crisis, it is enormously important to move together, work together and communicate with one another. Clear and transparent communication is definitely a key factor here. Female leaders generally tend to express this a little more than men.\n\nSheppard: No one of us demonstrates a unilateral style, and I think this comes back to my point that there is value in a wealth of different styles and approaches. For me, clarity and empathy were my mantra in all communications during the Covid-19 crisis, especially in new virtual environment. I learned very quickly how important it is to be able to read emotion on a screen during video conferences and to take the time to call someone and ask them if they are OK. I also know that as a leader, I have to be able to balance that out with decisiveness and assertiveness which are traits that are perhaps seen as traditionally male. My point being is that we have to be a mix of styles to be at our most effective.\n\n### Gender equality in leadership positions still seems to be a long way off. Why is it so important?\n\nSheppard: It is difficult to fully perceive why this may be the case, and the reality is that there are so many barriers facing women in the workplace – even today. It is important that we focus on policies and practices that will advance opportunities and development for women. For example, our RISE programme enables female colleagues seeking hotel leadership roles with mentoring and networking. This is going from strength to strength with cohorts in all of our regions globally, with more than 200 graduates. Our Lean In employee network membership has also grown, providing a voice to female colleagues and their allies who consult the business on measures that support a diverse and inclusive workplace. This can range from how we encourage gender and ethnically diverse recruitment shortlists, to ensuring our market-specific leave policies are regularly evaluated to support women and their families through life changes. Most recently, our UK partnership with Busy Bees provides our corporate and managed hotel colleagues a 20% discount on childcare fees.\n\n### What do you think of having a quota for women for certain leadership positions, for example on supervisory, executive or management boards?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: Fundamentally speaking, a woman should get the job if she is qualified for it. Unfortunately, we still need quotas to help speed up this process. UN Sustainable Development Goal Number 5 \n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n# »Particularly in times of crisis, it is enormously important to move together, work together and communicate with one another.«\n\nMartina Maly-Gärtner\n\nsays that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but also a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. We know the qualities and the potential of diverse teams, and we need to work hard to achieve gender equality. This change is only possible if the top level of a company is on board and if a suitable corporate culture exists and is put into practice.\n\nSheppard: I think targets can provide a positive ambition, but to me the main focus should be focusing on diverse slates and how we are supporting women in the organisation to further their career. The challenge is that I would never want anyone to think that women are in a certain position just to make up the numbers.\n\nDo you think it is possible for women in leadership positions to work parttime to balance their career with family commitments? Or maybe to job-share? For example, two female general managers working parttime to ensure a general manager is on-site seven days a week?\n\nSheppard: Yes, flexible working, part-time working and job-sharing are all good ways to remove at least some of the obstacles for women. Generally speaking, women are very suitable for models like these, as they are a little less concerned with ego\n\nand more focused on the practical considerations.\n\nMaly-Gärtner: In my experience, women coming back from maternity leave to work part-time are extremely motivated. They have been looking forward to returning to a business environment, work very efficiently and try to make things happen.\n\n### What has been your personal experience with female leadership? Have you ever encountered obstacles in your career path?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: I'd like to answer this question by giving advice to my younger self: Be more self-confident – because women tend to doubt themselves even though they deliver results! Don't let it get to you when you make mistakes. Learn from them and move on. Speak your mind. You need to find the right time and the right tone, but contribute your thoughts.\n\nSheppard: I have had the same selfdoubt, but I've been very fortunate in that I have always had people supporting me. Self-doubt has its positive benefits as well, though. Humility is a great trait to have if it's used in the right way.\n\nIn 2023, the InterContinental Hotels Group was ranked second out of 850 companies around the world among the Financial Times Diversity Leaders – beaten only by the Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso Group. What were the key points where you outperformed your peers?\n\nSheppard: It was an absolute delight to get an award like that, particularly as it's based on an employee survey. I have no doubt that this is a direct result of the initiatives that we have implemented over the last few years. But I imagine what tipped the balance in our favour was the cultural shift that we have initiated in our company. It's not just about female leadership, but about diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities in all areas and for all people. For instance, we march loudly and proudly in the pride marches in more and more countries. We take on interns from diverse ethnic backgrounds and of all abilities. At IHG, there is genuine intent in bringing about this cultural shift and enough impatience to make sure that it happens. We have achieved a lot already but there is a lot more to do.\n\n# Are women's networks a means of strengthening women in leadership positions?\n\nMaly-Gärtner: Mentors are important, they have shaped my career. And there's no need to be scared of networking events – because at first, it's just a question of stepping out\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/0 description: A woman with blonde hair is standing in a forest.

For example, there's a women's real estate network in Austria called Salon Real. This network has really helped me because sometimes I reach for my phone and ask one of my female colleagues for advice – and sometimes other women call me.\n\n### Does female leadership need the support of men too? Do men have to support women for there to be a greater number of women in leadership positions?\n\nSheppard: Any cause must have allies to be successful and the support given to women by men is very important. When we first launched our initiative to have more women general managers in Australia, we had to make sure it wasn't seen as something that was excluding the men. Instead, we needed to communicate why there was a need for this initiative. And suddenly our area general managers in this region – who were all men back then – became sponsors and mentors and spoke about why this was important for them personally. For example: \"I have a daughter and I want the world to be different when she enters the workforce.\" Or: \"I have a sister and I know what she's\n\nbeen struggling with.\" So they had their own very personal reasons and were wonderful support for the young women coming through. Female leadership should never be seen as a kind of divisive movement – it's about ensuring the best for everyone.\n\nMaly-Gärtner: An important message to men is: don't think women want to take over the world. Recognise the leadership qualities of women and be aware that diverse teams are more successful.\n\nModeration: **Tanja Milner**\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a piece of wood with the word \"Epilogue\" written in white at the top left corner.

Even though more women have graduated in architecture than men for some time now, they are far less likely to be found in decision-making positions. As one of the most important managers in Denmark, you are living proof to the contrary. What were the decisive prerequisites and turning points in your career that led you to where you are now?\n\nMette Kynne Frandsen: I have been with Henning Larsen for 30 years now. That's quite a long time! For young people today, staying with the same company for 30 years might not be something to aspire to. But I didn't plan it that way. When I started out, there were around 50 of us in the Copenhagen office. As well as working on competition designs, I started taking on more and more project management tasks. As I had studied architecture, I had a very solid technical background but didn't know much about management. So I suggested to Henning Larsen that I study for an MBA for two years and he welcomed the idea. When I had almost completed it, he came to me and said: \"OK, Mette, now that you've had the training, you can take over the management of the company.\" This unconditional support meant an awful lot to me. It was the basis for my whole development after that.\n\n### Were there role models for female managers back then?\n\nTo be honest, there weren't many role models at the time, just over 20 years ago. But Henning Larsen was a role model for me in the way he worked as an architect, especially in the cultural sphere. As he wasn't all that well versed in finance and personnel management, there was a space in the company that I could fill. On this basis, we developed a great working relationship and were able to set about implementing the changes that were planned for the company.\n\n### What changes were these?\n\nAt the time, Henning Larsen was approaching old age. This meant that we were planning a generation change and also wanted to get more partners on board. As well as this, we needed to realign our company's culture, which until then had been shaped solely by Henning. How do you take a company that has been founded by just one very strong personality and steer it towards the future? It was perfectly clear to me that we needed both women and men if we wanted to be successful in the long term. Today, the ratio of women to men in our company is 50:50, including at management level. It's always important to have the right balance, but I think we have really strong female architects and leaders here at Henning Larsen.\n\n# What would you consider the greatest successes in your career?\n\nToday, Henning Larsen is an international company with a broad \n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\npositioning, and is foundation-owned. Rather than just managing international projects from our Copenhagen base, we have set up studios in other regions. We now have offices in New York, Singapore, Berlin, Munich, Oslo and Sydney. That means we are a global organisation and a global community. I firmly believe that the diversity that comes from having as many different voices as possible outside Copenhagen as well is enormously important for design. 60% of our revenue today is generated from projects outside Scandinavia. And I am very proud of that.\n\nWe took another strategically important step four years ago when we became part of the Ramboll Group, a major engineering and consultancy company. Our shared vision is to create sustainable cities and buildings that answer the global challenges. We made this move because, even though we were active internationally, we were still too small to take on legal or financial experts in all these countries. This means that we are still active in architecture and urban planning under the Henning Larsen brand but, with Ramboll, we have a network that supports us in many areas as well. Here, we also benefit from our foundation model, where profit is invested back in the company. Our Innovation and Sustainability department has increased fivefold during this time, which is something that benefits all projects in many different ways. That really helped us to step up our innovation.\n\n### What developments do you envisage for Henning Larsen and architecture in general in the next ten years?\n\nI would like to see Henning Larsen flourish without me in ten years' time. (laughs) Because I'm pretty sure that I won't be here to celebrate my 40th anniversary. But one of our goals is for Henning Larsen to grow as a global community and to become an even stronger partner in sustainability that advises and inspires its clients – regardless of where in the world we are working. Apart from that, we are currently in a transformation period due to the urgent need to address climate change. So in ten years from now, our designs will be very different – you can even see the changes happening now. We are moving away from being a company that used to be mainly interested in new-build projects and towards one that will focus more in future on working with existing buildings. And this really stimulates creativity.\n\n### Where exactly can these changes be seen?\n\n A transformation in construction systems is beginning, and the use of biogenic building and insulation materials is starting to take off. Another change is the close collaboration between architects and landscape architects. This not only affects the way we design buildings but also has an impact on urban planning as a whole. In my position, I am seeing a growing awareness among politicians and clients about how important this collaboration is for all of our lives.\n\nUnder Frandsen's leadership, the firm Henning Larsen received the Mies van der Rohe Award, which is a prize presented by the European Union for contemporary architecture.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/0 description: A woman with short dark hair and glasses is standing in the corner of a room with her arms crossed.

It has even given rise to the term \"Copenhagenisation\".\n\nI think that we in Denmark have found very good solutions and have a lot of expertise in effective urban planning. In Copenhagen, politicians were also instrumental in driving forward the concept \n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/0 description: The image shows an architectural rendering of a city.

In this way, we were able to inspire others and to put our well-tried solutions into practice in projects outside Denmark. Many cities are currently revising their mobility concepts. Needless to say, this is an enormous investment, but I think we will see a huge transformation in our cities in the next ten years.\n\nI often travel to our global studios and can see the differences in the cities with my own eyes. Last week, I was in New York visiting our team, and I called my two daughters and said: \"Do you know how lucky you are as young mothers in Denmark? You can take your children to kindergarten and easily bike to work.\" In the US, thanks to differences in urban planning, it can be very difficult for women, and working in the architectural sector is no exception. Of course, we can't change the whole system there, although I can try to provide as much support as possible for the female architects in our New York office.\n\nToday, you often hear people using the terms \"compact city\" and \"city of short distances\" – a concept that feminist city planners were already advocating back in the 1970s. Can you give an example of an urban development project where this was used?\n\nFor example, our master plan for Downsview in Toronto is a huge project that is to be implemented over the next 50 years. Instead of planning cities with a business quarter and residential area, we are breaking up the area into local communities and neighbourhoods. Ten years ago, master plans were really about structures and mega-cities but today the focus is much more on people and community. With this project, there was a large-scale community engagement process beforehand, where people were able to get involved directly. All of this input is reflected in the master plan. The infrastructure is set up to allow people to move about as easily and safely as possible within\n\nthe neighbourhoods. The way that we work today – working from home to a greater extent – has also influenced urban planning.\n\n### What project are you particularly proud of at Henning Larsen?\n\nThings have changed quite a bit in this regard over the years. Ten years ago, we were particularly proud of the iconic buildings like the Opera House. But if you were to go around the office today and ask people that question, you would find they are most proud of the small, innovative projects. For example, Feldballe School, which came about through a cooperation between philanthropic organisation Realdania and a start-up that wanted to launch a façade element made of straw and timber. We implemented this project and succeeded in scaling up the biobased construction system. And now a logistics centre in the Netherlands – the largest anywhere in Europe – is going to be built in the same way as\n\n**1**\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/88/Picture/0 description: A man wearing a green baseball cap and a blue jacket is looking at a wooden box filled with straw.

How important is open-source thinking in your company?\n\nAs we all have the same goal – to have a positive influence on the future of our planet – sharing knowledge is enormously important. We can inspire and learn from one another. Some of our biggest competitors are now our best partners in certain areas. This is a development that I am very happy about.

The building appears to be a warehouse or distribution center, with multiple levels and a high ceiling supported by large wooden beams and columns. The wooden structure is light in color, giving the space a bright and airy feel. There are conveyor belts visible on the ground floor, suggesting the movement of goods within the building. On the upper levels, there are office spaces with glass walls, providing views of the warehouse operations below. People can be seen working in these offices and walking along the upper levels. The overall impression is one of a well-lit, organized, and efficient workspace with a strong emphasis on sustainable building materials.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/1 description: The image shows a multi-story building with a grid-like facade, where each section of the grid reveals a different interior scene. The building appears to be constructed with light-colored wood framing the large windows. The top row of windows shows glimpses of a ceiling with wooden slats and hanging light fixtures. The middle row displays various rooms with people, furniture, and artwork on the walls. One section shows people sitting at a table, while another shows a person walking. The bottom row features different living room setups with chairs, tables, lamps, and artwork. The overall impression is that of a building with a modern, open design, showcasing the interior spaces through its large windows.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **1:**\n\nHenning Larsen used the comfortable ambience of wood to create a new world of work at the new headquarters of Copenhagen's biggest housing association KAB.\n\n**2:** A spectacular timber construction is set to turn Prague Central Railway Station into a fascinating destination.\n\nI think it's a combination of both. For example, we can use new technology to reduce the amount of concrete used in buildings. In the past, we poured lots of concrete into buildings to meet the structural requirements – these days, we can use parametric design to optimise the amount of concrete we use. Right now, the price of recycled bricks has escalated because there is a severe shortage. With bio-based materials, there is no end of smart innovations and there is also great interest from investors who recognise the potential they offer. I think it will be important to strike a healthy balance between construction materials in future.\n\nTo date, there has often seemed to be two separate categories for buildings; they were either\n\n**1**\n\n88\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nsustainable or iconic. Henning Larsen regularly succeeds in combining the two – take for example the new World of Volvo visitor centre in Gothenburg, the planned Ørestad Church in Copenhagen, or Prague Central Station. How do you manage that? For a start, timber construction is suddenly opening up whole new design opportunities and freedom – exploring these has been enormously inspiring for the architects. On the other hand, you need the latest digital tools for these forms. Without these, projects like World of Volvo would never have been possible. The great success of this project is also due in no small part to the collaboration between our designers, digital experts and the timber construction engineers and producers.\n\nAs it happens, I was visiting the facilities of Austrian company WIE-HAG when the huge, curved glulam beams were being produced for World of Volvo. That was really impressive.\n\nWhen I was training as an architect, visiting construction sites was an important part of the process. How is a building actually constructed? What exactly does a carpenter do? We had a lot of hands-on knowledge. And this knowledge fell by the wayside a little with the rise of digital design. However, the new construction materials are once again arousing the interest of architects in production processes. I think it's very healthy to have this connection.\n\nJust like the emergence of the \"form follows function\" principle at\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/9 description: This image shows a winter scene with a building in the background and a crowd of people in the foreground.

The ad includes the text \"Umtauschfrist: 14. 06. – 26. 06. 2023 (für Umtausch der UBM-Anleihe 2018-2023)\" and \"Zeichnungsfrist: 27. 06. – 03. 07. 2023 ISIN: AT0000A35FE2\". It also mentions UBM Development and its focus on Green Building and Smart Office in cities like Vienna, Munich, Frankfurt, and Prague. The ad highlights UBM's commitment to sustainability, its 150 years of experience, and its listing on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The image includes a picture of a modern building and the text \"Timber Peak Mainz\". The ad also contains legal disclaimers and information about the Green Finance Framework. The bottom of the ad features the text \"green. smart. and more.\" and the website address www.ubm-development.com.\n\n#### Green Bond and Green Finance Framework\n\nUBM successfully places its first Green Bond with a volume of €50m. The bond is based on the UBM Green Finance Framework, which regulates the issue of green financial instruments whose net proceeds are exclusively used for the (re)financing of green projects. This framework was developed in compliance with the best practices on the market and the EU Taxonomy, and it has been checked by the ESG ratings and research agency ISS ESG in a Second Party Opinion.\n\nUBM plans development of one of the world's tallest timber high-rises in Vienna Vienna will be the site of Timber Marina Tower, a 113-metre-high office tower with a timber hybrid design. The project has 32 upper storeys and 4 basement storeys with approx. 44,350 square metres of floor space. Timber Marina Tower represents a further milestone for UBM on its way to becoming the leading developer of timber construction projects in Europe. UBM currently has over 300,000 square metres of timber hybrid projects in the pipeline.\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/5 description: The image shows a waterfront view of two modern high-rise buildings, one with a stacked cube design and the other with a more complex, textured facade.

Peter Schaller is a graduate engineer and will be responsible for Operational Controlling and Timber Construction as well as Quality Management at UBM.\n\n#### Timber trio in Munich receives preliminary building permit\n\nUBM Development receives another preliminary building permit in Munich. Following the receipt of permits for Timber Factory and Timber Living, the preliminary building permit for the commercial project Timber Works developed by UBM in Munich also becomes legally binding. Planned with a timber hybrid design, the building will be constructed on a plot of land with approx. 6,500 m² and will offer over 9,650 m² gross floor area.\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/10 description: The image contains three different architectural renderings of buildings.

Presented for the first time in 2023, all companies listed on the ATX Prime Index are eligible for the award, which uses qualitative and quantitative methods in a three-level scoring model. UBM therefore emerges as the sustainability leader on the Austrian capital market, 150 years after its establishment.\n\n#### Punctual repayment as a reliable issuer\n\nIn November 2023 UBM repays the remaining €91.05m from the 3.125% UBM Bond 2018-2023 punctually after five years. A total of €28.94m from the 3.125% UBM Bond 2018-2023 is already exchanged for the UBM Green Bond 2023-2027 in June 2023, and the outstanding €91.05m from this bond is then repaid. Repaying this financial instrument on time reduces UBM's future annual interest costs by €2.85m.\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/6 description: The image shows a square icon with a light green background.

Expectations of declining inflation rates in the first half year and the related prospects for a shift to looser interest policies by central banks led to increasing hopes of a reduction in inflationary pressure and lower interest rates. The result was a strong year end for the markets. In comparison with the past years – which were influenced by crises like the Covid-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and accompanied by unusually high trading volumes – 2023 was a year with less movement on the markets and lower volatility. The MSCI World Index benefitted from the economic upturn and rose by 21.8%, which represents the highest increase since 2019.\n\nIn the USA, key interest rates were also the focal point of inflationary pressure in 2023 and were raised four times by the Federal Reserve to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% in January 2024. The S&P 500 share index outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Index (+14%) by a full 10% with a year-on-year increase of 24%. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite closed the year with even stronger performance of 43%. The European markets reflected the international trend, and the EURO STOXX rose by 19%. Asia presented a mixed picture: The Japanese Nikkei rose by 28%, but the Chinese CSI 300 fell by 11%.\n\nThe German DAX index ended the reporting year with a plus of 20% and slightly topped the pan-European index. In Austria, the ongoing war in Ukraine led to growing reservation on the part of international investors and to weaker development of the ATX. Austria's strong connections in Central and Eastern Europe held the ATX to an increase of 9.2%.\n\n### **Development of the UBM share**\n\nUBM's share has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since 10 April 1873. On 22 August 2016, it entered the Prime Market, the top segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange with the highest transparency standards. The share is also included in Austria's IATX real estate stock index.\n\nThe UBM share recovered by more than a fourth from the downturn that began at year-end 2022. This continued up to the end of January 2023 and it traded at €29.90 on 31 January 2023. This positive development continued into mid-February but was followed by a decline to €26.90 in mid-April. The downward trend was short-lived, however, and the share rose to an annual high of €32.90 on 18 May 2023. After a positive first half-year, trading started the second half-year at €26.80 and was characterised by negative sidewards movement up to September. The share fell to an annual low of €20.00 at the end of October and only recovered to €23.00 in mid-December. The UBM share closed 2023 at €21.10, for a decline of 7% since December 2022. UBM's market capitalisation totalled €157.7m at year-end 2023.\n\nThe average daily stock exchange trading volume in UBM shares equalled 3,966 shares from January to December 2023 (2022: 2,652) and the turnover amounted to 1,007,391 shares.\n\n# **Analyst coverage**\n\nThe following investment firms regularly published estimates and analyses of UBM in 2023: Erste Group, NuWays by Hauck Aufhäuser, M.M.Warburg & CO, Raiffeisen Bank International and SRC Research. At the end of December, four investment houses issued buy recommendations for the UBM share and one issued a hold recommendation. The target price for the UBM share equalled €28.64 based on the analysts' consensus.\n\n### **Shareholder structure**\n\nThe share capital of UBM Development AG totalled € 52,305,260.00 as of 31 December 2023 and is divided into 7,472,180 shares. The syndicate comprising IGO Industries and the Strauss Group continued to hold 38.8% of the shares outstanding at year-end 2023. In addition, IGO Industries held 7% of UBM outside the syndicate. A further 5.0% were held by Jochen Dickinger, a private investor. Free float comprised 49.2% of the shares and included the 3.0% of the shares held by the Management and Supervisory Boards. Most of the other free float was held by investors in Austria (78%).

This sustainability index \ncomprises Austrian companies listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange with \noutstanding ecological/social activities and achievements.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nman shareholders held 10%, shareholders in other European countries also held roughly 10%, and 2% were attributable to other investors.\n\n### **Dividend policy**\n\nUBM has a reliable dividend policy that is based on continuity and reflects the company's future earning power. The dividend payment for the 2022 financial year was approved and the necessary authorisation was passed by the Annual General Meeting during the first half of 2023. In view of the current situation caused by interest policies, discussions by the Supervisory Board and Management Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on 9 April 2024 determined that the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 financial year would not be advisable. The waiver of the dividend will be presented to the Annual General Meeting as a precautionary measure considering the development in the sector and as solidarity towards all UBM stakeholders. This decision does not represent a reversal of UBM's continuous dividend policy, which generally focuses on a distribution rate of 35% to 50% but instead reflects the economic situation.\n\n#### **Bonds**\n\nUBM had three bonds and one hybrid bond as well as five promissory note loans and bearer bonds under Austrian law outstanding as of 31 December 2023. In March 2023, UBM prematurely repaid hybrid capital of €52.9m from the hybrid bond issued in 2018. The outstanding €91.05m of the UBM bond 2018 (3.125% UBM bond 2018–2023) was repaid in November 2023, and a new bond was issued during the reporting year. As part of UBM's Green Finance Framework, the first green bond (volume: €50m) was successfully placed in 2023. An overview of the outstanding bonds together with the respective terms, nominal value, coupon/margin and interest payment dates can be found on the following page.\n\n#### **Investor relations**\n\nContinuous dialogue as well as transparent and timely information represent the core of UBM's communications strategy, which is designed to enable all investors to form a fair and realistic picture of the company. This also applies, in particular, during a difficult market environment. UBM's investor relations activities are focused not only on contacts with existing investors, but also on the acquisition of new long-term investors. In previous years, UBM took part in numerous meetings with investors and analysts in the major European financial centres. Nearly all of these meetings were held virtually in the first half of 2023, while some of the conferences took place in a hybrid format. The second half of the year brought an increase in on-site roadshows, which took place in Vienna, Frankfurt and Milan.\n\nIn addition to the investor events, the press conference on 2023 and the 142nd Annual General Meeting also included the direct attendance of shareholders. UBM reports regularly on its business performance in quarterly telephone conferences with analysts, institutional investors and banks as well as through press releases and social media to keep all stakeholders up to date.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Free float – geographical split (in %)2 Shareholder structure (in %)**\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/2 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of ownership. 49.2% is Free float, 38.8% is Ortner/Strauss syndicate, 7.0% is IGO Industries, and 5.0% is Jochen Dickinger.\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/3 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. 78% is attributed to Austria, 10% to Other Europe, 2% to Other, and 10% to Germany.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Incl. shares held by the Management and Supervisory Board (3.0%) —\n\nThomas G.

The Management Board team has recognised the enormous demand for sustainable products in Europe, and the ambitious goal to become the leading developer of timber construction projects in Europe which makes this transformation visible gained momentum during the past financial year. The timber-hybrid pipeline with more than 300,000 m2 includes pioneering projects like the LeopoldQuartier in Vienna and the Timber Factory in Munich. However, difficult economic times for developers require a solid financial foundation. UBM is well positioned with an equity ratio of over 30%. The Supervisory Board was informed regularly and in detail during the past year, and is convinced that the Management Board team has not only set the right strategic focal points but is also optimally suited to follow this course.\n\nThe Supervisory Board extensively evaluated the resolutions required for this transformation and passed the necessary resolutions unanimously. In this respect, the Supervisory Board actively accompanied and supported the company's development within the scope of its assigned responsibilities. In accordance with Section 81 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the Management Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular written and verbal reports that contained timely and extensive information on the development of business and the financial position of the Group and its investments, on issues related to employees and planning, and on investment and acquisition projects. The Management Board also discussed the corporate strategy, future business policies and risk management with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board held five meetings in 2023 at which the necessary resolutions were passed. The approvals were obtained for transactions which require the consent of the Supervisory Board according to Section 95 Para. 5 of the Stock Corporation Act; in urgent cases, the decisions were taken by a written vote. The average attendance at the Supervisory Board meetings equalled 92%.\n\nThe ESG Committee, which was created in 2021, held two meetings during 2023. Discussions with the Management Board at the meeting on 11 May 2023 covered the auditor's report on the voluntary review of the ESG report for 2022, recent developments in the area of taxonomy, the progress made by UBM Development AG with ESG ratings and ESG reporting as well as current and future measures and goals, for example related to green finance and green building. At the meeting on 5 December 2023, the Management Board reported on the latest developments in taxonomy and CSRD issues (e.g. the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) at the beginning of January 2023 as the basis for ongoing national application) and on UBM's progress in ESG (e.g. corporate carbon footprint, green lease, green building, ESG ratings, project certifications, social events). The members of the ESG Committee are Iris Ortner (Chairwoman), Susanne Weiss (Deputy Chairwoman), Birgit Wagner and Anke Duchow.\n\nThe Nomination Committee met once in 2023, on 24 August. The agenda included the appointment of Peter Schaller to the Management Board of UBM Development AG to succeed Martin Löcker who resigned prematurely at his own request as of 30 June 2023. Other issues included the extension of the Management Board contracts for Thomas G. Winkler, Patric Thate and Martina Maly-Gärtner.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee held one meeting in 2023, on 28 March, which included the determination of the annual bonus for the Management Board members of UBM Development AG.\n\nThe Audit Committee met six times during the 2023 financial year. The first meeting was held on 20 February without the Management Board in accordance with Rule 81a of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and concentrated on the audit schedule, audit focal points and communication between the auditor and the Audit Committee. In the meeting on 28 March, the auditor reported on the status of the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2022. This meeting also covered the selection process for the appointment of a new auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements of UBM Development AG for the 2024 financial year, including the appointment of the respective selection committee and definition of the next steps in the selection process. The Audit Committee meeting on 11 April included the auditor and covered the evaluation of and preparations for the approval of the separate and consolidated financial statements for 2022. At this same meeting, the Audit Committee also discussed the selection of an auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023, the audit schedule for 2023, the report by the Management Board on related party transactions in \n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n2022 and risk management. The Audit Committee meeting on 21 September 2023 was also attended by the auditor and dealt, among others, with the report by the Management Board on the effectiveness of the internal control system, the internal audit system and risk management (fraud) as well as compliance (corruption) in the sense of C-Rules 18 and 18a of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and planning for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements. A progress report was also received on the process to select an auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2024. In the meeting on 16 October 2023, the candidates for the auditor selection process for the year-end and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2024 were interviewed and assessed by the audit committee. The last meeting of the year was held on 6 December and covered the report by the Management Board on the effectiveness of risk management in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance as well as a recommendation to the Supervisory Board for the appointment of an auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements of UBM Development AG for the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe separate financial statements of UBM Development AG as of 31 December 2023, including the notes and the management report, and the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023, which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applied in the EU, together with the Group management report, were audited by BDO Assurance GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft. The audit, which was based on the company's bookkeeping and records as well as explanations and documentation provided by the Management Board, indicated that the bookkeeping and the separate and consolidated financial statements comply with legal regulations and provide no grounds for material objections. The management reports for the company and the Group agree with the separate and consolidated financial statements. The above-mentioned auditor therefore issued an unqualified audit opinion for the separate and consolidated financial statements of the 2023 financial year.\n\nAll documents related to the financial statements, the corporate governance report, the proposal by the Management Board for the use of profits and the auditor's report were discussed in detail by the Audit Committee together with the auditors on 9 April 2024 and submitted to the Supervisory Board. Following extensive discussion and examination, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements as of 31 December 2023, the management report, the corporate governance report and\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/3 description: A man in a suit and tie is standing in front of a wooden wall. He is wearing glasses and has a serious expression on his face. The text \"© PORR\" is visible in the bottom left corner of the image.\n\nthe Management Board's proposal for the use of profits. The separate financial statements as of 31 December 2023 are therefore considered approved. In addition, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board approved the consolidated financial statements for 2023, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS, and the Group management report.\n\nIn view of the current situation caused by interest policies, discussions by the Supervisory Board and Management Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on 9 April 2024 determined that the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 financial year would not be advisable. The waiver of the dividend will be presented to the Annual General Meeting as a precautionary measure considering the development in the sector and as solidarity towards all UBM stakeholders. This decision does not represent a reversal of UBM's continuous dividend policy, which generally focuses on a distribution rate of 35% to 50% but instead reflects the economic situation.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank UBM's customers and shareholders for their confidence and commitment to the company, and also commend the Management Board and the many women and men who work for UBM Development for their tireless efforts and exceptional performance during the past year.\n\nWith my best wishes,\n\nKarl-Heinz Strauss, MBA, FRICS\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n\nVienna, April 2024\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Governance\n\n### **Commitment to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance**\n\nUBM Development AG views corporate governance as a comprehensive concept within the framework of responsible and transparent management as well as the related system of wide-ranging controls. The Management Board and Supervisory Board work closely together in the interests of the company and its employees to continuously evaluate and coordinate the strategic orientation of the UBM Group. An ongoing dialogue with the relevant interest groups builds trust and creates the basis for sustainable growth in the future. One of UBM's top priorities is to develop and improve its standards for responsible and sustainable corporate management.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board issued a joint formal declaration in August 2016 which commits the UBM Group to compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance. Section 267b of the Austrian Commercial Code requires UBM, as a listed parent company whose shares are traded on a regulated market, to produce a consolidated corporate governance report as defined in Section 1 (2) of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act of 2018. As the UBM Group does not have any listed subsidiaries, the necessary disclosures are limited to the information required by Section 243c of the Austrian Commercial Code and included in the appropriate sections of this corporate governance report. UBM shares have been listed in the Prime Market, the premium segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange since 22 August 2016. This listing formally commits UBM to adherence with increased standards for transparency, quality and publication. UBM is committed to compliance with the behavioural rules defined by the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance – with reference to the deviations listed below in the comply or explain catalogue – and sees the code as a key precondition for responsible corporate management. The latest version of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, as issued by the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance, is available to the general public on the organisation's website under www.corporate-governance.at.\n\nThis corporate governance report is published as part of the annual report and is available on the Group's website under www.ubm-development.com, in the submenu investor relations/financial reports or under corporate governance. In accordance with C-Rule 36 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the Supervisory Board also conducted a self-evaluation during 2023. The questionnaire used for the evaluation addressed, in particular, the efficiency of the Supervisory Board, its organisation and its working procedures. The findings were evaluated and discussed by the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Comply or explain catalogue**\n\nC-Rule 27: In accordance with C-Rule 27 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the company's current remuneration policy states that the remuneration for each of the Management Board members must include fixed and variable components as required by the applicable legal regulations. The variable, performance-based remuneration components are designed to reflect shareholders' interests in the positive development of the company and increase the Management Board's motivation to take actions which lead to the sustainable, long-term and risk-aware optimisation of Group results. Annual variable remuneration is dependent on the attainment of parameters set by the Supervisory Board, which are based on financial or non-financial criteria or a combination of both. The inclusion of non-financial criteria is not mandatory for determining the amount of variable remuneration in order to support the objectiveness, transparency and plausibility of remuneration. The remuneration policy does not include the possibility of demanding the payback of variable remuneration components (\"clawback\") because this is not required by law and because civil law provides sufficient grounds for the right to claim the return of payments which were based on obviously false data.\n\nC-Rule 27a: The contracts with the Management Board members prior to the implementation of the current remuneration policy follow the legal regulations in effect at that time and, therefore, do not include a specific provision that would limit \n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nseverance compensation for the premature termination of their function without good cause to not more than twice the total annual remuneration and not more than the remaining contract term. Moreover, these contracts currently do not specify that severance payments will not be made when a Management Board contract is terminated prematurely with good cause. The Management Board contracts do not contain any provisions which would require consideration of the circumstances under which a member leaves the company and the economic position of the company in the event of premature resignation. Compliance with C-Rule 27a of the Austria Corporate Governance Code was not yet in the foreground when the existing Management Board contracts were concluded. C-Rule 27a of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance was implemented for the first time in 2021 in preparing the new employment contracts for the Management Board.\n\nC-Rule 38: The job profile and procedure for appointing Management Board members are established on a case-bycase basis. The Supervisory Board defines a job profile when a Management Board position is to be filled, whereby particular attention is paid to the individual candidates' qualifications, experience and industry knowledge. A formally defined appointment procedure and general job profile are not used in the interests of the company because this could exclude candidates from appointments to the Management Board in spite of their exceptional qualifications and outstanding industry knowledge.\n\nC-Rule 49: In line with legal regulations and L-Rule 48 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the Supervisory Board is required to approve all contracts with its members which commit these persons to performing a service for the company or a subsidiary outside their activities on the Supervisory Board for compensation that exceeds an immaterial value. The company does not, however, publish the related details for operational and confidentiality reasons. Moreover, the notes to the consolidated financial statements of UBM Development AG include disclosures on related party transactions; these disclosures cover the remuneration for services by companies in which a Supervisory Board member holds a position on a corporate body and/or an investment outside his or her activities on the Supervisory Board of UBM Development AG.\n\nC-Rule 83: UBM Development AG arranged for an evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management by an auditor who is not also responsible for auditing the annual financial statements. This decision is intended to award two separate audit contracts covering different subjects to different experts. The dual control principle is further strengthened, above all, through the independence of the auditor. A tender process led to the selection of PwC Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH as the best bidder, and this firm was subsequently commissioned to evaluate the risk management system.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Members of the Management Board**\n\nThomas G.

Martin Löcker resigned from the Management Board of UBM Development AG as of 30 June 2023 at his own request.\n\n#### **Management Board**\n\nThe Management Board must have between two and six members as defined in Section 6 of the Statutes and had four members in 2023 until the resignation of Martin Löcker on 30 June 2023 and the appointment of Peter Schaller to this corporate body on 1 November 2023. During the interim period from 1 July 2023 to 31 October 2023, the Management Board had three members. The Supervisory Board can designate one member as chairperson and one member as deputy chairperson of the Management Board and can also appoint deputy members (within the defined range of two to six persons). If one member is appointed as chairperson of the Management Board, he or she casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie. The members of the Management Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a maximum term of five years, whereby the renewal or extension of this appointment (in each case, for a maximum of five years) is permitted. The Supervisory Board can dismiss a member of the Management Board before the end of his or her term in office for an important reason, i.e. for a serious breach of duty or if the Annual General Meeting passes a vote of no confidence in the Management Board member. The Management Board is required to conduct its business activities in line with the rules defined by the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the Statutes, other laws and the rules of procedure. The Supervisory Board is responsible for determining the assignment of Management Board responsibilities while, at the same time, maintaining the overall responsibility of the Management Board. The Management Board requires the prior approval of the Supervisory Board before entering into the transactions listed in Section 95 Para. 5 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (current version). To the extent permitted by Section 95 Para. 5 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board sets monetary limits for transactions which do not require its approval. The Supervisory Board is also entitled to add additional transactions to the list of legally defined cases which require its approval (Section 95 Para. 5 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act). The Supervisory Board is required to issue appropriate rules of procedure for the Management Board, and the Management Board must report regularly to the Supervisory Board on its activities.\n\nActivities on behalf of the company must represent the principal occupation for the members of the Management Board. They must manage the company's business with the care of responsible and conscientious managers and in accordance with the interests of shareholders, the staff and the general public. The members of the Management Board may not take on any other employment without the approval of the Supervisory Board and may not take on an executive function in any companies that are not part of the UBM Group.\n\n#### **Members of the Management Board**\n\n| Name                 | Date of birth | Position                         | Member since | Appointed until |\n|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Thomas G.

The company can also be represented by two authorised signatories, with certain legal restrictions. Any deputy Management Board members have the same rights of representation as regular Management Board members.\n\nThe above table lists the Management Board members, their dates of birth, their positions, the date of their initial appointment and the expected end of their term in office.\n\n#### **Supervisory board positions or comparable functions in Austrian or foreign companies (which are not included in the financial statements):**\n\nThomas G. Winkler, Martina Maly-Gärtner and Patric Thate do not serve on a supervisory board or hold a comparable function in an Austrian or foreign company (that is not included in the financial statements). Martin Löcker did not exercise any such functions up to his premature resignation from the Management Board of UBM Development AG on 30 June 2023. Peter Schaller serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of SK Sturm Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH.\n\n#### **Executive and non-executive board positions in material subsidiaries:**\n\nThe Management Board members Thomas G. Winkler, Peter Schaller, Martina Maly-Gärtner and Patric Thate have executive functions in individual project companies, but do not hold any executive or supervisory board positions in material subsidiaries. This also applies to Martin Löcker up to his premature resignation from the Management Board of UBM Development AG on 30 June 2023.\n\n### **Supervisory Board**\n\nThe UBM Supervisory Board is composed of members elected by the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Works Council is authorised by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act to delegate a specific number of members to the Supervisory Board. Section 9 of the Statutes states that the Supervisory Board must have a minimum of three and a maximum of 12 members elected by the Annual General Meeting. In 2023, the Supervisory Board had eight members elected by the Annual General Meeting plus four additional members designated by the Works Council as employee representatives.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are elected up to the end of the Annual General Meeting which votes on the release from liability of the Supervisory Board for the fourth financial year after their election unless the Annual General Meeting specifies a shorter term for one or all of the elected members; the financial year in which the Supervisory Board member is elected does not count towards this term. The re-election of a board member is permitted, also for resigned members. If an elected Supervisory Board member resigns before the end of his or her term, a substitute must only be elected at the next Annual General Meeting. However, an Extraordinary General Meeting must be held within six weeks to elect a substitute if the number of Supervisory Board members falls below three. A substitute member is elected for the remaining term of the former Supervisory Board member, unless decided otherwise by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting can recall a Supervisory Board member before the end of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple majority of the votes cast. Any member of the Supervisory Board can resign, without due cause, by notifying the chairperson of the Supervisory Board in writing, subject to a notice period of 21 days. This notice period can be shortened by the chairperson of the Supervisory Board, or a deputy in the event the chairperson resigns.\n\nA substitute member can be elected concurrently with a regular Supervisory Board member, whereby the substitute would fill the seat effective immediately if the Supervisory Board member resigns before the end of his or her term. If multiple substitutes are elected, the order in which they are to replace a resigning Supervisory Board member must be determined. A substitute member can also be elected for multiple Supervisory Board members to fill a seat on the Supervisory Board if any of these members steps down \n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nprematurely. The term of office of a substitute member ends with the election of a successor to the former Supervisory Board member or, at the latest, with the end of the term of the former Supervisory Board member. If the term of office of a substitute member ends because a successor to a former Supervisory Board member has been elected, the substitute member can still serve as a substitute for the other Supervisory Board members he or she has been chosen to represent.\n\nThe Supervisory Board elects a chairperson and one or more deputies from among its members each year at a meeting held after the Annual General Meeting. If there are two deputies, the order in which they are to substitute for the chairperson must be determined. Their terms of office end with the next Annual General Meeting. A replacement must be elected immediately if the chairperson or one of the elected deputies resigns. If, in this election, no candidate receives a simple majority of the vote cast, a run-off must be held between the persons who received the most votes. If the run-off results in a tie, lots will be drawn to decide the election. If the chairperson or one of the elected deputies resigns, the Supervisory Board must immediately hold a new election to appoint a successor. The chairperson and deputies can resign at any time by notifying the Supervisory Board in writing and in keeping with a 14-day notice period; however, they are not required to resign from the Supervisory Board at the same time.\n\nEvery deputy chairperson has the same rights and responsibilities as the chairperson he or she represents. This also applies to casting the decisive vote for resolutions and in elections. If the chairperson and his deputies are prevented from carrying out their duties, this obligation passes to the oldest Supervisory Board member (in terms of age) for the duration of the impairment. Declarations of intent by the Supervisory Board and its committees must be submitted by the chairperson of the Supervisory Board, or by his deputy if he or she is incapacitated.\n\nThe Supervisory Board issues rules of procedure in line with the responsibilities defined by law and the Statutes. Resolutions by the Supervisory Board on its rules of procedure require a simple majority of the members elected by the Annual General Meeting and must also comply with the general requirements for resolutions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board can form committees from among its members. Their responsibilities and powers as well as their general rules of procedure are determined by the Supervisory Board. The authority to take decisions can also be delegated to the committees, which can be established as permanent bodies or for individual tasks. The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board are entitled to designate voting members to the committees based on the ratio specified by Section 110 Para. 1 of the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act. This does not apply to meetings and voting which involve relationships between the company and the Management Board members, with the exception of resolutions on the appointment or recall of a Management Board member as well as resolutions to grant options in company shares.\n\nThe Supervisory Board passes resolutions in its regular meetings. These meetings are to be held as often as required by the interests of the company and at least once each quarter. Five regular Supervisory Board meetings were held in 2023. The chairperson determines the form of the meeting, the way in which resolutions are passed outside of meetings and the procedure for counting votes. The Management Board members attend all meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, unless otherwise decided by the person chairing the meeting.\n\nA member of the Supervisory Board can designate another member in writing to represent him or her at a meeting. A member represented in this way is not included in determining the quorum for the meeting. The right to chair the meeting cannot be delegated. A member who is unable to attend a meeting of the Supervisory Board or its committees is entitled to submit his or her vote on individual agenda items in writing through another board or committee member.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is considered to have a quorum when all members have been correctly invited to attend and when at least three members, including the chairperson or a dep-\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Members of the Supervisory Board**\n\n| Name                | Date of birth | Position     | Member since | Appointed until |\n|---------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Karl-Heinz Strauss1 | 27.11.1960    | Chairman     | 14.4.2011    | AGM 2024        |\n| Iris Ortner2        | 31.8.1974     | Deputy Chair | 14.4.2011    | AGM 2024        |\n| Klaus Ortner4       | 26.6.1944     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Ludwig Steinbauer3  | 26.10.1965    | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Paul Unterluggauer  | 28.4.1967     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Bernhard Vanas3     | 10.7.1954     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Birgit Wagner3      | 9.1.1972      | Member       | 29.5.2019    | AGM 2024        |\n| Susanne Weiss3      | 15.4.1961     | Member       | 15.1.2015    | AGM 2024        |\n| Anke Duchow         | 19.1.1968     | Member       | 27.5.2019    | n/a             |\n| Martin Mann         | 14.2.1972     | Member       | 30.6.2016    | n/a             |\n| Hannes Muster       | 28.11.1967    | Member       | 30.6.2016    | n/a             |\n| Günter Schnötzinger | 20.8.1973     | Member       | 30.6.2016    | n/a             |\n\n1 Karl-Heinz Strauss was Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board from 27 February 2013 until 18 September 2014 and has been Chairman since 18 September 2014 2 Iris Ortner has been Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board since 18 September 2014 and previously served as a member of the Supervisory Board from 2 July 2003 to 5 May 2010\n\n3 Klaus Ortner was previously a member of the Supervisory Board from 18 March 2000 to 14 May 2014\n\n4 Independent member who does not hold more than 10% of the shares (C-Rule 54)\n\n5 Appointed by the Works Council on 30 June 2016 as well as on 27 May 2019 in accordance with Section 110 Paragraph 1 of the Austrian Labour Constitutional Act\n\nuty, participate in the decision-making process. A topic of negotiation which is not on the agenda can only be ruled on by the Supervisory Board if all members are present or represented and no member objects. The Supervisory Board passes its resolutions by simple majority of the votes cast, whereby abstentions are not counted as votes. In the case of a tie – also in elections – the chairperson casts the deciding vote. A deputy representing the chairperson is also entitled to cast the deciding vote on resolutions and in elections; this also applies to committee chairpersons.\n\n#### **Composition of the Supervisory Board**\n\nThe above table shows the members elected to the Supervisory Board in 2019 together with their date of birth, their position, the date of their initial appointment to the Supervisory Board and the expected end of their term. As of 31 December 2023, the members of UBM's Supervisory Board held additional positions on supervisory boards or exercised comparable functions in Austrian and foreign companies (that are not included in the consolidated financial statements). These positions are listed in the table on page 104.\n\n#### **Criteria for independence**\n\nC-Rule 53 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance requires the majority of the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting or appointed by shareholders in line with the Statutes to be independent of the company and its Management Board. A Supervisory Board member is considered to be independent if he or she does not have any business or personal relationships with the company or its Management Board which would constitute a material conflict of interests and could therefore influence the member's behaviour.\n\nThese principles form the basis for the independence criteria established by the UBM Supervisory Board, which are available for review by the general public on the UBM website:\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n- a) The Supervisory Board member did not serve as a member of the Management Board or key employee of UBM or one of its subsidiaries during the past five years.\n- b) The Supervisory Board member does not at the present time or did not during the past year have any business relationships with UBM or one of its subsidiaries in a scope material for that member. The same applies to relationships with companies in which a member of the Supervisory Board has a considerable economic interest, but does not apply to functions in UBM corporate bodies; knowledge of Group issues and the mere exercise of activities as a management board member or managing director by a Supervisory Board member do not, as a rule, lead to the involved company being viewed as a \"company in which a member of the Supervisory Board has a considerable economic interest\" as long as circumstances do not give rise to speculation that the Supervisory Board member gains a direct personal benefit from a business transaction with these companies. The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board pursuant to L-Rule 48 does not automatically lead to classification as not independent.\n- c) The Supervisory Board member did not serve as an auditor of UBM or as a shareholder or employee of the company that audited UBM during the past three years.\n- d) The Supervisory Board member is not a member of the management board of another company in which a member of the UBM Management Board serves on that supervisory board.\n- e) The Supervisory Board member has not served on the Supervisory Board for more than 15 years. This does not apply to Supervisory Board members who are shareholders with a direct investment in the company or who represent the interests of such shareholders.\n- f) The Supervisory Board member is not a close family member (direct offspring, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, niece, nephew) of a member of the\n\nUBM Management Board or a person to whom any of the aforementioned items (a to e) apply.\n\nIn accordance with these criteria, the following Supervisory Board members have declared themselves to be independent: Karl-Heinz Strauss (Chairman), Birgit Wagner, Ludwig Steinbauer, Bernhard Vanas and Susanne Weiss.\n\n### **Committees**\n\nThe Statutes allow the Supervisory Board to establish committees from among its members. To support and ensure the efficient handling of complex issues, the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee, Remuneration Committee and ESG Committee were active in 2023.\n\nAudit Committee: The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include (i) monitoring the accounting process and issuing recommendations or suggestions to ensure its reliability; (ii) monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's internal control system, internal audit system (where appropriate) and risk management system; (iii) monitoring the auditing of the separate and consolidated financial statements under consideration of the findings and conclusions in the reports published by the Regulatory Authority on Auditors in accordance with Section 4 Para. 2 (12) of the Supervision of Auditors Act (APAG); (iv) assessing and monitoring the independence of the chartered auditors, in particular as regards any additional services they may have provided for UBM; (v) reporting to the Supervisory Board on the results of the audit, stating how the audit contributed to the reliability of financial reporting and the role played by the Audit Committee in this process; (vi) assessing the annual financial statements and preparing their approval, evaluating the proposal for the use of profit, the management report and the corporate governance report, and reporting on the audit findings to the Supervisory Board; (vii) examining the consolidated financial statements, the Group management report and the consolidated corporate governance report as well as reporting to the Supervisory Board on the audit findings; and (viii) conducting the procedures for the selection of the auditor under consideration of\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Additional functions of the Supervisory Board members**\n\n| Name                | Company                                                                                                                                                        | Function                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Karl-Heinz Strauss  | PORR Bau GmbH<br>PORR GmbH & Co.

The first meeting of the Audit Committee during the reporting year was held on 20 February 2023 without the Management Board in accordance with Rule 81a of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and concentrated on the audit schedule, audit focal points and communication between the auditor and the Audit Committee. In the meeting on 28 March, the auditor reported on the status of the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2022. A further topic at this meeting was the selection process for the appointment of a new auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements of UBM Development AG for the 2024 financial year, the composition of the selection committee and the next steps in the selection process. The meeting on 11 April 2023 included \n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe auditor and covered the evaluation of and preparations for the approval of the separate and consolidated financial statements for 2022. At this same meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed the selection of an auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023, the audit schedule for 2023 and the reports by the Management Board on related party transactions in 2022 and risk management.\n\nThe Audit Committee meeting on 21 September 2023 was also attended by the auditor and dealt, among others, with the report by the Management Board on the effectiveness of the internal control system, the internal audit system and risk management (fraud) as well as compliance (corruption) <sup>1</sup> Earnings per share after the deduction of hybrid capital interest <sup>2</sup> Based on the price at the end of the year <sup>3</sup> Dividend in relation to earnings per share after deduction of hybrid capital interest Corporate Governance and planning for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements. A progress report was also received on the selection of an auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2024. The last meeting of the year was held on 6 December and dealt with the report by the Management Board on the effectiveness of risk management and the recommendation for the appointment of an auditor for the separate and consolidated financial statements of UBM Development AG for the 2024 financial year. The members of the Audit Committee are Karl-Heinz Strauss (Chairman), Iris Ortner, Bernhard Vanas (financial expert) and Susanne Weiss.\n\nNomination Committee: The responsibilities of this committee are as follows: (i) to prepare appointments to the Management Board, including succession planning: in advance of an appointment to Management Board, the Nomination Committee defines a profile for the position, which also reflects the corporate strategy and state of the company, and prepares the decision for the full Supervisory Board; (ii) to recommend candidates for positions on the Supervisory Board when seats become available: the Nomination Committee is involved in planning for appointments to the Supervisory Board. It proposes candidates for positions on the Supervisory Board; after approval by the full\n\nSupervisory Board, these recommendations are presented to the Annual General Meeting for a decision. Recommendations for appointments to the Supervisory Board must be based on the qualifications and personal skills of the members and be selected to achieve a balance of specialists in line with UBM's structure and business. Appropriate consideration must also be given to diversity with regard to gender, age and internationality. Persons who have been convicted of a crime which questions their professional reliability are excluded from recommendations for appointments to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Nomination Committee met once in 2023, on 24 August 2023. The agenda focused on the appointment of Peter Schaller to the Management Board and on the extension of the Management Board contracts with Thomas G. Winkler, Patric Thate and Martina Maly-Gärtner. The members of this committee are Karl-Heinz Strauss (Chairman), Iris Ortner and Susanne Weiss.\n\nRemuneration Committee: This committee is responsible for the following duties in connection with the current remuneration policy and in accordance with applicable legal regulations: (i) matters related to the remuneration of the Management Board members and the content of the employment contracts with these persons, in particular, the definition and implementation of the underlying principles for the remuneration of the Management Board members and the criteria for the variable remuneration components in line with C-Rules 27 (above all, the preparation of a catalogue for the variable remuneration components), 27a and 28 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance; (ii) evaluating the remuneration policy for the Management Board members at regular intervals; (iii) approving the assumption of sideline activities by the Management Board members.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee held one meeting in 2023, on 28 March, which involved the determination of the annual bonuses for the members of the Management Board. The members of the Remuneration Committee are Karl-Heinz Strauss (Chairman), Iris Ortner and Susanne Weiss (remuneration expert).\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nESG Committee: The activities of the ESG Committee include the analysis of sustainability criteria and social responsibility concepts in corporate processes – in particular, identifying the most important environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) that are determined by the company's sector affiliation and business model and subject to regional influence. ESG focuses on including the factors which result from a company's influence on or through the environment (ecological), society and corporate governance and from the company's statutes and management. The ESG Committee is also responsible for overseeing and supporting actions in line with the ESG catalogue of measures with clear assignment of responsibilities at Management Board and Supervisory Board levels. It also monitors and evaluates the implemented ESG measures – above all, the impact of procurement and development processes on ecosystems, on the use of resources, on the direct and indirect neighbourhood, and on good corporate management.\n\nThe ESG Committee met twice in 2023. Discussions with the Management Board at the meeting on 11 May covered the auditor's report on the voluntary review of the ESG report for 2022, the latest developments in the areas of taxonomy, the progress made by UBM Development AG in ESG ratings and ESG reporting, and current and future measures and goals related to green finance and green building. In the meeting on 5 December 2023, the Management Board reported on recent developments in taxonomy and CSRD (e.g. the enactment of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) at the beginning of January 2023 as the basis for national laws) and UBM's progress in the area of ESG (e.g. corporate carbon footprint, green lease, green building, ESG ratings, project certification, social events). The members of the ESG Committee are Iris Ortner (Chairwoman), Susanne Weiss (Deputy Chairwoman), Birgit Wagner and Anke Duchow.\n\n#### **Support for women**\n\nUBM is reinforcing its efforts to increase the share of women in its organisation. In comparison with other companies in the real estate sector, the UBM Group had a positive standing with 24 women in key positions (Supervisory Board, managing directors, authorised signatories and key staff at UBM Development AG and its subsidiaries) as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 24). As a company that believes in sustainable operations, UBM places high priority on socially relevant topics that include equal opportunities in the workplace. Activities to achieve and maintain equal opportunities are focused, in particular, on the identification of suitable female candidates when managers and staff are recruited. Twenty-two new employees were hired during 2023: 16 women and 6 men (excluding hotel employees). There are no salary differences between men and women who perform the same activity and have the same qualifications. Women are specifically addressed in job advertisements. In order to support the work-life balance, the company offers flexible working hours through a flexi-time system.\n\nUBM is proactively and sustainably committed to a working environment free of discrimination and a culture of mutual respect and appreciation among all employees. The company treats all employees equally – regardless of gender, social background, sexual orientation, nationality, religion or age. Any form of discrimination is categorically opposed.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Diversity concept in connection with appointments to the Management Board and Supervisory Board**\n\nWith regard to the composition of the Management and Supervisory Boards, the Supervisory Board does not follow a specific diversity concept. UBM is increasing its efforts to raise the percentage of women in the overall workforce and in management positions. Moreover, employees – regardless of their function and hierarchical level – are never discriminated against because of their gender, social background, sexual orientation, nationality, religion or age. The Supervisory Board therefore views the establishment of diversity targets for control bodies to be neither expedient nor useful. Education and professional experience play a significant role because a person under consideration for a Supervisory Board position must be capable of optimally performing his or her duties. These preconditions are not defined in advance in an abstract manner but evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, the expertise and specific requirements for the respective employment situation are the only deciding factors in preparing proposals for the Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board also believes these same principles apply to the composition of the Management Board.\n\n### **Remuneration**\n\nInformation on the remuneration of the Management Board and Supervisory Board is provided in the remuneration report which will be presented at the 143rd Annual General Meeting in 2024.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a weathered wooden structure, possibly a wall or part of a building.

While this crisis no longer has such a strong impact on world events, the geopolitical confrontation in Ukraine and the new conflicts in the Near East have led to an increase in interest rates. Initial forecasts for global growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) equalled 2.9% in the first quarter. This estimate was reduced to 2.8% in the second quarter to reflect the turbulence in the financial sector, high inflation, the ongoing effects of Russia's invasion in Ukraine and the three-year COVID crisis. Actions taken by US authorities to contain instability in the banking industry reduced the immediate risks of financial sector chaos and moderated the downward risks for the outlook. However, the conflict in Ukraine continues to intensify and provided grounds for only a moderate increase in growth forecasts to 3.0% in the third quarter. IMF projections point to an increase of 3.1% in the global economy for the full 12 months of 2023.1\n\nThe European economy followed the declines in past years with further weakness in 2023, and the IMF forecasts placed growth in Europe at only 0.6% in 2023. That represents a substantial drop of 3% in economic performance in the eurozone since the previous year and, in global comparison, is also clearly below expectations. The unemployment rate equalled 6.4% in November 2023 (ECB). The inflation rate for 2023 was clearly lower than the previous year (2022: 9.2%) at 2.9% in December (ECB) and, accordingly, only slightly above the in the sense of C-Rules 18 and 18a of the Austrian Code of\n\nGlobal armed conflicts, restrictive monetary policies, the withdrawal of fiscal support and weak underlying productivity growth have had a negative effect on forecasts for the future development of the world's economy. Estimates by the IMF are similar to 2023 with global growth of 3.1% in 2024, while the eurozone is expected to remain weak with an increase of only 0.9%. The difficulty involved in predicting the course\n\n<sup>1</sup> IWF: World Economic Outlook – January, April, July 2023, January 2024\n\nof the wars in the Near East and Ukraine continues to limit forecast security. The current challenges in the banking sector are reflected in a tense climate. In Europe, economic recovery is being driven by rising household consumption. The effects of the energy price shock are fading and inflation is declining. However, various factors – e.g. high interest rates as a tool to fight inflation, the withdrawal of fiscal support and high debt levels, the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the Near East conflict and the high cost of living – will slow growth in 2024.3\n\n#### **Developments in Germany and Austria**\n\nThe German economy continued along a downward course: The GDP decline to 1.9% in 2022 was followed by a further drop of 0.3% in 2023 (IMF). Austria also fell into a recession in 2023 due to the delayed effects of the war in Ukraine and high inflation. A September forecast by the European Commission (Austrian National Bank) failed to confirm the increase of 0.8% projected for the reporting year. According to the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), the economic downturn will equal -0.8%. The unemployment rate rose from 6.3% to 6.4% in 2023 as reported by the Austrian Economic Chamber. Inflation fell by 0.7% to 7.9% and confirmed the ECB high interest policy.4, 5, 6, 7\n\n<sup>3</sup> IWF: World Economic Outlook – January 2024\n\n<sup>4</sup> IWF: World Economic Outlook – January 2024\n\n<sup>5</sup> Oesterreichische Nationalbank: Konjunktur aktuell – September 2023\n\n<sup>6</sup> WIFO: Konjunkturprognose für Österreich – December 2023\n\n<sup>2</sup> EZB: Economic Bulletin Issue 1 – February 2024\n\n<sup>7</sup> WKO: Wirtschaftslage und Prognose Arbeitslosigkeit – December 2023\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Developments in CEE**\n\nIn May, the European Commission issued positive projections for economic development in the EU Member States in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe apart form Estonia. UniCredit estimated average growth of 0.4% and -0.4%, respectively, for Poland and the Czech Republic in 2023.1, 2\n\n#### **Developments on the real estate markets**\n\n#### **Europe**\n\nOngoing geopolitical conflicts in Europe, weak growth throughout the region and high interest rates were also visible on the European real estate market in 2023. The investment market was unable to match its 2022 performance in the first quarter of 2023, and the transaction volume dropped by 63% year-on-year to €34bn. The remainder of the year was characterised primarily by a downturn on the property market – the investment volume fell by 9% in the second quarter and by 16% in the third quarter. Transaction volumes only improved in the final quarter, with an increase of 22% over the third quarter. Calculations for the full 12 months of 2023 show a sharp year-on-year drop of 47% in the European transaction volume to nearly €160bn (2022: €291.5bn). This reduction is attributable to a lower number of (particularly large) transactions and to imminent price adjustments. The generally weaker economic climate represents an added factor for the negative development of transaction volumes in all sectors. A total of €33.3bn were invested in residential properties during 2023. With a total transaction volume of €37.6bn, the Office asset class remained investors' clear first choice. The overall investment volume fell 61% below the previous year, while the Residential asset class declined by 46%. The hotel sector reported the lowest decline of 13% to €14.5bn, but this performance should be analysed in connection with the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in earlier years. The forecasts for 2023 are more positive because of the improvement in investors' confidence and more stable outlook for interest rates due to the reduced inflationary expectations. The transaction volume for 2024 is, consequently, expected to be 10% higher than 2023.3, 4, 5, 6\n\n#### **Germany – end of the downturn**\n\nTher German real estate market reported a sharp drop in transactions during 2023 for the second year in succession, with a 56% year-on-year reduction that corresponded to the lowest value since 2010. Properties with a combined value of €29.0bn changed hands in 2023. With a total volume of €40.0bn, the German real estate investment market was unable to confirm the expected transaction recovery. The decline resulted, above all, from strong price corrections and the increased financing stress caused by higher credit interest and write-downs.7\n\nThe transaction volume on the commercial property market fell by a massive 59.6% year-on-year to €21.5bn in 2023 (2022: €50.6bn). The office segment dropped from first to fourth place in the asset class turnover ranking with a volume of €4.6bn (2022 €19.9bn) and a decline of 77% below the previous year. Prime rents in this segment rose by 6%, but the increase in mean and average rents was lower at 2% and 4% respectively. Average prime rents in the six top cities ranged from €33.9/m2 in Cologne to €49.75/m2 in Munich. Take-up in the office segment was 26% below the previous year at roughly 2.2m m2 in 2023, which represents the lowest level since 2009.8, 9\n\nPortfolio transactions in the Hotel asset class rose by nearly 55% over the weak 2022 results to a total of €360m in the fourth quarter of 2023. This also reflects the noticeably higher market momentum, particularly in the last quarter of the year. The investment volume at the most important hotel locations amounted to €582m in 2023 and was 28% below the previous\n\n<sup>1</sup> Oesterreichische Nationalbank: Konjunktur aktuell – September 2023\n\n<sup>2</sup> UniCredit: CEE Quarterly – January 2024\n\n<sup>3</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q1 2023\n\n<sup>4</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q2 2023\n\n<sup>5</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q3 2023\n\n<sup>6</sup> CBRE: European Real Estate Investment Volumes Q4 2023\n\n<sup>3</sup> Savills: Investmentmarkt Deutschland – January 2024 <sup>8</sup> Savills: Investmentmarkt Deutschland – January 2024\n\n<sup>9</sup> Savills: Top-6-Büromärkte – January 2024\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nyear. In other words, the volume at these key locations again fell below the previous year and, in comparison with the longterm average for nationwide hotel investments, remained at a low 44%.10\n\nDevelopments on the residential property investment market in Germany were clearly slowed in 2023 by rising financing costs and a substantial increase in uncertainty over regulations. Investments in larger apartment portfolios fell 60% below the previous year to €5.2bn. The decline versus the long-term average was even higher at 72% and represents a value not seen since 2010. The second half-year failed to produce any signs of recovery because of investors' expectations over another price decline and their resulting hesitation to buy, or the postponement or cancellation of projects. Similar to 2022, German investors were responsible for 68% of the €3.5bn transaction volume in 2023. The six top cities represented an above-average share of residential property investments with 59% of the national transaction volume. Berlin again led this ranking with a transaction volume of €1.81bn and a 35% share of the total volume. Of special note is Munich with a volume of €716m, which corresponds to the second highest share of the total volume at 14% and the only top location in Germany with results above the long-term average.11\n\n#### **The investment year in Austria**\n\nNew interest policies and a changing market environment had a massive negative impact on the investment market in Austria and led to transaction data not seen in a decade. At €2.8bn in 2023, the investment volume was one-third below the long-term average as well as 32% lower in year-on-year comparison (2022: €4.1bn). Most of the investment volume was directed to office and retail properties, as in earlier years. Residential properties, which remained the strongest asset class in recent years, played a much less important role with a volume of €200.0m. A trend that emerged during 2023 was the increasing caution of international investors due to the current uncertain times, which was reflected in the 85% market share attributable to national capital. This uncertainty was also reflected in the transaction volume, which declined significantly as a result of the rising interest rates, high construction costs and unpredictable risks. In the residential property sector, Austria recorded a high of 47,500 unit completions and Vienna 18,600 completions in 2023 – but a decline of 11% is projected for 2024, as reported in the previous year, which will be principally visible in freely financed residential construction with a sharp 40% drop. Residential properties comprised only 5% of the investment volume in earlier years, but more activity is expected in 2024 and ESG-compatible buildings are a popular target.\n\nThe mood in the office property sector is positive, despite the limited market offering. Take-up basically reflected the previous year at 175,000 m2 (2022: 170,000 m2). The indicators for office properties have followed a downward trend for several years and are also related to the low number of completions on the Vienna market. Only about 50,000 m² of space were completed in 2023 despite a low vacancy rate of 3.5%, and rents increased at all office locations. Prime rents rose to a new high of €28.00/m2/month. Project developers were forced to set appropriate rental levels for their projects due to the low completion rates, limited vacancies and high construction costs – and this carries an inherent potential for a further moderate increase in rents during 2024. Completions in 2024 are expected to total roughly 80,000 m2, which represents an improvement over the previous year, but 40% of the space can already be considered sold and is not available to the market. An increase in completions is expected in 2025.12\n\n#### **Developments in CEE**\n\nThe CEE-6 countries – Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria – failed to meet the expectations of many analysts in 2023. Growth in this region was 0.6% weaker than anticipated because of geopolitical conflicts, high interest rates and inflation that in certain cases exceeded 10%. Recession characterised the economy in some countries, while others recorded sound performance.\n\n10BNP Paribas: Hotel-Investmentmarkt Deutschland – Q4 2023\n\n12CBRE: Österreich Real Estate Market Outlook – 2024\n\n<sup>11</sup>BNP Paribas: Wohn-Investmentmarkt Deutschland – Q4 2023\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe unemployment rates in all CEE-6 countries are very low and in part lower than ever before. Moreover, record levels of gross capital investment despite weak growth or recession formed the basis for a positive conclusion to 2023.\n\nFor the CEE investment market, this weak growth also meant a decline in the total investment volume to €4.9bn in 2023 (2022: €10.9bn). That corresponds to a reduction of 54% and is in line with the trends in the rest of Europe and in many other parts of the world. Poland again led the ranking with nearly 38% of the total transaction volume in the CEE-6 countries. The Czech Republic followed in second place with €1.1bn or 23% of the total investment volume. None of the countries were able to record transaction growth in 2023. The underlying reason is the lack of market transactions and the resulting difficulty in establishing prices between buyers and sellers. The decline in the individual countries ranged from 18% in Slovakia to 68% in Poland. Office transactions were responsible for the highest share of the total investment volume in 2023 at 34%, followed by retail at 29% and logistics at 27%. Domestic capital from the CEE-6 countries was the main source of funds in 2023 with an impressive 56% share of the total regional volume.\n\nAs in many other European regions, year-end data for 2023 shows that the combination of a limited offering and stable demand with high inflation and the stabilisation of costs led – with few exceptions – to an increase in rents. The upward trend in rents will be driven in the future by high vacancies and a restricted offering, especially in newly built properties that offer top quality, the most popular locations and high ESG-alignment.\n\nColliers estimates the transaction 2024 volume at €6.0bn in view of the current conditions and, in particular, based on the ongoing high cost of external financing. Despite the relatively new supply of real estate in comparison with Western Europe, ecological, social and governance (ESG) considerations are expected to play a much more important role than in past years. Economic growth in the CEE-6 countries is forecasted to equal 2.4% in 2024.13\n\n13Colliers: The CEE Investment Scene 2023/2024\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Business performance**\n\nUBM Development generated Total Output of €284.2m in 2023, compared with €390.7m in the previous year. The largest contributions in 2023 did not come from Germany or Austria, as in earlier years, but from the Other Markets segment. Total Output for the reporting year was influenced, above all, by the progress of construction on and the sale of real estate projects, which is recognised in revenue and earnings over time in accordance with the percentage of completion and realisation. A significant impulse for this positive development was provided by the Arcus City residential project in Prague with over 270 housing units and ten single family houses. The Astrid Garden Residences and Neugraf projects in the Czech Republic provided further substantial support for Total Output. The largest share of Total Output was generated by the hotel business based on an increase from €57.1m in 2022 to €110.4m in 2023. This upward trend reflects the recovery in tourism and travel after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTotal Output in the Germany segment fell to €62.8m in 2023 (2022: €166.1m). An important contribution resulted from the closing of the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt with its 18 storeys and over 60 metres in height following the transfer to the owner, HanseMerkur Grundvermögen, at mid-year. A positive contribution was also made by the progress of construction on the Gmunder Höfe residential project in Munich, which is scheduled for completion in the last quarter of 2024, and by the Flösserhof in Mainz former customs harbour with 92 planned apartments.\n\nThe Austria segment reported a decline in Total Output from\n\n€112.2m in 2022 to €78.2m in 2023. Total Output in this segment was generated chiefly by the hotel business, among others through the sale of the Palais Hansen in Vienna's historic city centre and ongoing operations at the hotel in Jochberg. Contributions from the Residential asset class included, in particular, the Rankencity project in Graz and further sales from the Siebenbrunnengasse residential and office project in Vienna's fifth district.\n\nTotal Output in the Poland segment rose from €46.3m to €50.5m. Business performance was based on the hotel operations, with the location in Krakow playing an important role, as well as the rental of the Poleczki Business Park and various services.\n\nThe Other Markets segment reported a sound improvement in Total Output from €66.1m in 2022 to €92.8m in 2023 and generated the largest share of UBM's Total Output for the reporting year. The largest contribution in this segment came from the Arcus City project with its 284 planned residential units in Prague's Stodůlky district, which is accounted for according to the percentage of completion. Construction started during 2023 on the second phase of Arcus City and, at the same time, on Timber Praha, the city's first multi-storey timber-hybrid residential building. Additional contributions were made by the Astrid Garden Residences in the Holešovice district of Prague and the Neugraf residential project with 177 units. An important transaction involved the sale of a Non-Core Asset in the Czech Republic, with a total of 68.3 hectares.\n\nTotal Output in the Residential segment fell to €62.6m in 2023 (2022: €145.8m) and consisted primarily of the pro-\n\n#### **Total Output by region**\n\n| in €m         | 1–12/2023 | 1–12/2022 | Change |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Germany       | 62.8      | 166.1     | -62.2% |\n| Austria       | 78.2      | 112.2     | -30.3% |\n| Poland        | 50.5      | 46.3      | 9.1%   |\n| Other markets | 92.8      | 66.1      | 40.4%  |\n| Total         | 284.2     | 390.7     | -27.3% |\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\ngress of construction on previously sold apartments in residential projects in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. An important contribution was made by the Arcus City residential project in Prague through a proportional share of revenues from phases 2 and 3. Total Output was also supported by the Siebenbrunnengasse project in Vienna with 178 apartments. Other projects in the German-speaking countries, e.g. the Gmunder Höfe in Germany and the Rankencity in Austria, contributed to Total Output through their sale to institutional investors.\n\nThe Office segment recorded Total Output of €35m in 2023, compared with €77.6m in 2022. Total Output for the reporting year resulted, above all, from the closing of the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt with more than 25,000 m² of rentable space. This new headquarters for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (F.A.Z.) was responsible for the largest component of Total Output in this segment.\n\nThe Hotel segment recorded Total Output of €110.4m in 2023 (2022: €57.1m). This near doubling of Total Output is attributable to the increase in travel after the COVID-19 pandemic and to the sale of the 150-room Palais Hansen in Vienna's first district. The hotel operations in Jochberg (Austria) and in Prague also contributed to Total Output in this segment. No hotel projects are currently under development due to UBM's strategic orientation.\n\nTotal Output in the Other segment fell from €68.8m in the previous year to €23.4m in 2023 and was generated primarily by the rental of mixed-use standing assets in Austria and Germany. The sale of a 68.3-hectare Non-Core Asset in the Czech Republic was responsible for nearly half of Total Output. In contrast, Total Output for 2022 included the sale of building rights to three sites in Vienna as well as the strategic divestment of the German project and construction management subsidiary, alba Bau | Projekt Management GmbH.\n\nIn the Service segment, Total Output rose from €41.4m in 2022 to €53m in 2023. A major component resulted from the provision of services for various projects in the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. This position also includes charges for management services and intragroup allocations.\n\n#### **Total Output by asset class**\n\n| in €m       | 1-12/2023 | 1-12/2022 | Change |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|--------|\n| Residential | 62.6      | 145.8     | -57.1% |\n| Office      | 35        | 77.6      | -54.9% |\n| Hotel       | 110.4     | 57.1      | 93.3%  |\n| Other       | 23.4      | 68.8      | -66.0% |\n| Service     | 53        | 41.4      | 28.0%  |\n| Total       | 284.2     | 390.7     | -27.3% |\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Financial performance indicators**\n\n#### **Business development and earnings**\n\nThe core activities of the UBM Group revolve around the project-based real estate business. The revenue reported on the income statement can be subject to strong fluctuations because these projects are developed over a period of several years. Real estate projects are recognised as of the signing date based on the progress of construction and realisation (percentage of completion, PoC). The sale of properties through share deals and the development and sale of projects within the framework of equity-accounted investments are still not included in revenue. In order to provide a better overview and improve the transparency of information on UBM's business performance, Total Output is also reported. This managerial indicator includes – similar to revenue – the proceeds from property sales, rental income and income from hotel operations as well as the general contractor and project management services capitalised or provided to third parties and companies not included through full consolidation. It also contains the profit or loss from companies accounted for at equity and the results of sales through share deals. Total Output is based on the amount of the investment held by UBM. It does not include advance payments, which are primarily related to large-scale or residential construction projects.\n\nTotal Output declined by €106.5m to €284.2m in 2023 (2022: €390.7m). Substantial contributions were made by projects in Germany (F.A.Z. Tower, Hafeninsel IV, Gmunder Höfe), the Czech Republic (Arcus City, Astrid Garden Residences), and Austria (Rankencity, Siebenbrunnengasse). Revenue as reported on the consolidated income statement fell from € 133.9m in the previous year to €85.3m and reflected the decline in contributions which followed the sale of fully consolidated projects. Contributions to revenue were made, above all by residential construction projects in the Czech Republic (Arcus City, Astrid Garden Residences).\n\nThe profit from companies accounted for at equity fell to €-14.1m in 2023 (2022: €25.4m). The positive contribution to earnings in the previous year was based on real estate projects like the F.A.Z. Tower in Frankfurt and the Gmunder Höfe in Munich.\n\nThe income from fair value adjustments to investment property amounted to T€318, compared with €25.5m in 2022. The fair value adjustments in the previous year were related primarily to a large-scale project in Vienna and based on the receipt of the zoning permit from the municipal authority. The expenses from fair value adjustments totalled €40.8m in 2023 and were recognised, in particular, to larger office projects in Austria, Germany and Poland. In 2022, the expenses from fair value adjustments totalled €4.6m.\n\nOther operating income rose to €51.0m in 2023 (2022: €12.7m), chiefly due to the receipt of the legally binding preliminary building permit for the Timber Factory Campus. This position also includes foreign exchange gains, income from space and land rentals, income from the release of provisions, income from the disposal of tangible assets and various other positions.\n\nOther operating expenses rose from €32.6m to €40.8m, above all due to foreign exchange losses, write-downs to properties carried under current assets, and legal and consulting fees. This position also includes administrative costs, travel expenses, advertising costs and office operating costs as well as charges and duties.\n\nThe cost of materials and other related production services declined from €86.9m in the previous year to €70.4m. These expenses consist largely of material costs for the construction of fully consolidated residential properties and various other development projects which were sold through forward transactions. Also included here are the book value disposals from property sales in the form of asset deals and purchased general contractor services.\n\nIncome of €33.0m was recorded in 2023 for changes in the portfolio related to residential property inventories and other IAS 2 properties (2022: expenses of only €3.0m). The increase \n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nin additions is explained by the decline in sales activity caused by the general market situation.\n\nPersonnel expenses were €6.4m lower year-on-year at €30.9m in 2023 (2022: €37.3m). The number of employees in the companies included in the consolidated financial statements totalled 268 as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 292).\n\nEBITDA fell by €66.5m to €–27.3m in 2023 (2022: €39.2m). The decline resulted, above all, from the revaluation of projects and standing assets. Depreciation and amortisation amounted to €2.8m (2022: €5.3m). These factors, in total were responsible for a decline of €64.0m in EBIT to €-30.1m in 2023 (2022: €33.9m).\n\nFinancial income fell from €23.4m in 2022 to €21.8m due to a decline in interest and similar income from project financing for equity-accounted companies and subsidiaries. Financial costs rose to €31.1m in 2023 (2022: €25.9m), above all as a result of higher interest costs for project financing.\n\nEBT amounted to €-39.4m in 2023 and was €70.9m lower than the previous year (2022: €31.5m) due to property writedowns. Tax expense totalled €6.7m, compared with €4.3m in 2022, and the tax rate equalled 17.0% (2022: 13.8%).\n\nThe net loss (net profit after tax) totalled €46.0m in 2023, compared with net profit of €27.1m in 2022. The net loss attributable to the shareholders of the parent company amounted to €52.5m (2022: net profit of €16.8m). Beginning with the 2020 financial year, the method used to calculate earnings per share was changed. The calculation of the net loss attributable to the shareholders of the parent company includes a deduction for the net loss attributable to the hybrid capital holders. The share attributable to the hybrid capital holders fell from €9.1m in 2022 to €5.9m in 2023, and the resulting earnings per share declined from €2.25 to a loss per share of €7.03 in 2023.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Asset and financial position**\n\nTotal assets recorded by the UBM Group amounted to €1,253.8m as of 31 December 2023 and were €198.0m below the level on 31 December 2022 (€1,451.8m). This decline resulted primarily from the premature repayment of the hybrid bond 2018 in March 2023 and also involved writedowns that reduced equity and the payment of the dividend and interest.\n\nNon-current assets declined by €45.3m year-on-year to €745.3m as of 31 December 2023. Property, plant and equipment totalled €11.1m and were slightly lower than on 31 December 2022 (€12.2m). This position consists primarily of capitalised rights of use from lease liabilities.\n\nThe carrying amount of investment property rose by €16.2m to €407.9m as of 31 December 2023. In contrast, the investments in equity-accounted companies declined by €30.6m to €150.2m. Project financing also declined by €37.3m to €143.6m.\n\nCurrent assets totalled €508.5m at year-end 2023 and were €152.7m lower than at year-end 2022. Cash and cash equivalents were reduced, among others, by the following factors: the premature repayment of the hybrid bond 2018, the repayment of the bond 2018-2023, the payment of the purchase price for two acquisitions made in 2022 and 2023, and the payment of the dividend and interest. As of 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents equalled €151.5m.\n\nReal estate inventories totalled €265.4m at the end of December 2023 (31 December 2022: €259.3m). This position includes miscellaneous inventories as well as specific residential properties under development which are designated for sale.\n\nTrade receivables declined from €49.5m at the end of 2022 to €37.3m as of 31 December 2023. Included here, in particular, are real estate inventories which are sold during development as well as the proportional share of forward sales of investment properties.\n\nEquity totalled €379.7m as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €501.5m). The decline is explained, above all, by the repayment of the hybrid capital, the payment of the dividend and the loss recorded for the 2023 financial year. The €8.2m dividend was paid on 30 May 2023. The equity ratio equalled 30.3% at year-end 2023 despite the difficult operating environment (31 December 2022: 34.5%) and remained within the 30–35% target range.\n\nBond liabilities (current and non-current) amounted to €376.1m at the end of December 2023 and were €70.6m lower than the previous year (31 December 2022: €446.7m). In November 2023, €91.1m of the UBM bond 2018–2023 was repaid. Trade payables declined from €46.9m at year-end 2022 to €25.7m as of 31 December 2023 and consisted primarily of outstanding payments for subcontractor services. Other financial liabilities (current and non-current) increased from €25.5m as of 31 December 2022 to €27.9m as of 31 December 2023. Deferred taxes and current taxes payable increased to €17.2m (2022: €20.1m). Financial liabilities (current and non-current) rose by €9.9m to €408.2m.\n\nNet debt totalled €610.3m at year-end 2023 (31 December 2022: €500.2m). This indicator includes current and non-current bonds and financial liabilities, excluding lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. The increase resulted from the repayment of hybrid capital and the payment of the dividend.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Cash flow**\n\n.\n\nOperating cash flow rose from €13.2m in 2022 to €31.6m in 2023. The fair value adjustments included in profit for the reporting year were excluded from operating cash flow because of their non-cash character.\n\nCash flow from operating activities totalled €–54.5m, compared with €–70.7m in the previous year. Cash flow was reduced, above all, by an increase in real estate inventories (€6.1m), interest paid (€27.7m), a reduction in receivables (€5.3m) and a decline in liabilities (€13.7m). These amounts include cash inflows of €35.9m from the sale of real estate inventories. The additions to real estate inventories totalled €42.1m, and the additions to receivables from real estate inventory sales equalled €32.1m. The decline in receivables from real estate receivables amounted to €29.1m.\n\nCash flow from investing activities totalled €12.4m in 2023, compared with €8.4m in 2022. Investments in project financing amounted to €35.6m, and investments in property, plant and equipment, investment property and financial assets equalled €37.7m.\n\nCash flow from financing activities amounted to €-129.7.0m (2022: €-37.9m). New borrowings totalled €45.9m, while €52.9m of hybrid capital and €34.5m of loans were repaid during the reporting period. In addition, dividends and hybrid bond interest of €16.6m were paid in 2023.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Outlook**\n\nIn the midst of geopolitical conflicts and the aftereffects of the Covid-19 crisis, the OECD experts and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are projecting growth of 2.7%, respectively 3.1% for the global economy in 2024. Growth has been slowed by the ongoing war in Europe and the Middle East conflict between Israel and Hamas which has been escalating since mid-2023 as well as continuous high inflation and the resulting high interest rates. A series of interest rate hikes reduced inflation in the eurozone and, as a result, the ECB has held key rates at 4.5% since September 2023. In spite of the recent downward trend in inflation, inflation is only expected to approach the ECB Council's 2% target during the course of 2024 and into 2025.1,2,3\n\nPrevailing interest rates have had a massive influence on the development of the real estate market – in particular, on the valuation of projects and standing assets. UBM recognised write-downs of roughly €70m in connection with the unscheduled revaluation of its projects and properties in 2023. Although UBM, as a developer, did not recognise ECB's 2.0% target.<sup>2</sup> other real estate investors – these revaluations, especially to the development portfolio, are a direct consequence of rising interest rates and the resulting higher yield expectations of future property buyers. Any increase in rents cannot offset the current write-downs to the same extent and, above all, at the same speed. UBM sees the real estate sector in its core markets in an existential crisis for the above reasons.\n\nUBM, as previously mentioned, has been unable to disengage completely from the current market developments, but sees itself in a position of relative strength. Internal management with its focus on cash flow made it possible for UBM to hold the equity ratio above 30%, also in the fourth quarter, and to report more than €150m of liquid funds. It should also be noted that the outstanding volume (€91.05m) of the UBM bond 2018-2023 was repaid on time in the fourth quarter of 2023, entirely from cash reserves. No other bond redemptions are scheduled until November 2025, which creates a competitive advantage.\n\nUBM remains fully operational, as is demonstrated by the sale of the 33.57% interest in the Palais Hansen to Wiener Städtische during the fourth quarter and the sale of a noncore property in the Czech Republic. At the same time, UBM acquired a 25% interest in Bondi Consult's \"Central Hub\" project in TwentyOne.\n\nUBM is continuing to follow its strategic orientation to become the leading developer of timber construction projects in Europe. The company currently has more than 300,000 m2 in timber – slightly more than half in the Light Industrial & Office asset class and the other half in the residential sector. This uncompromising focus on timber construction is a logical consequence of the *green. smart. and more.* corporate strategy. Only a high degree of standardisation and modularisation will make it possible to remain competitive in the future.\n\nThe impact of high inflation, rising interest rates and increasing construction costs will accompany us throughout the entire year. Market recovery to the pre-crisis level will not be seen for a very long time. However, the massive demand overhang can be expected to increase over the coming years due to the market exit of many competitors.\n\nMarket developments remain volatile and difficult to estimate. For this reason, UBM must refrain from issuing any guidance for the 2024 financial year and limit comments to its extremely solid financial position with an equity ratio of over 30%.\n\n<sup>1</sup> IMF: World Economic Outlook – January 2024\n\n<sup>2</sup> Austrian National Bank: Konjunktur aktuell – September 2023\n\n<sup>3</sup> ECB: Geldpolitische Beschlüsse – Press Release December 2023\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Risk report**\n\nThe principal business activity of UBM Development AG and its operating subsidiaries and investments involves the development of real estate projects in selected European countries. This business model exposes the UBM Group to a variety of risks. At the same time, diversification – meaning an active presence in different countries and asset classes – supports the distribution and reduction of risk because changes do not normally take place at the same time or in all markets. Diversification, as a risk management tool, also creates opportunities to give preference to one asset class over another or to expand or reduce the focus on individual asset classes, countries and markets.\n\nUBM's risk management is responsible for monitoring and controlling the related risks, whereby any changes in risk positions are actively addressed.\n\n#### **General goals of UBM risk management**\n\n- To create a risk culture in UBM\n- To identify risks at an early point in time and allow for the implementation of countermeasures\n- To create a uniform view of risks with strict evaluation and documentation\n- To protect the company's assets (e.g. property, capital, image)\n- To meet (payment) obligations at all times\n- To ensure full compliance with legal regulations at all times\n- To safeguard annual results and enable planning\n\n#### **Material risks**\n\nThe material risks for UBM arise from project development as the core business activity and include operating risks as well as macroeconomic and ESG risks. Accordingly, risks are subdivided into the following main categories: real estate acquisition, project calculation, planning and project financing, construction and quality, operations (asset management), realisation (transactions), general business risks (supporting and commercial processes), macroeconomic and other risks, and ESG risks.\n\nUBM has many years of experience in the early identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring and control of risks within its business model. The company monitors all material risks that could have a significant impact on its operating performance and on its asset, earnings and financial position.\n\n#### **Risk Management System (RMS) measures in 2023**\n\n#### **1. Risk identification and analysis/risk system**\n\nThe comprehensive identification and analysis of risks carried out in 2016 forms the basis for the annual critical assessment of the individual risks in UBM's value chain. These individual risks were also evaluated in 2023 by way of a risk inventory. The risk system is evaluated by external specialists each year and adapted, where necessary, to reflect the current situation.\n\nA qualitative evaluation of the ESG risk catalogue was prepared in 2023. The catalogue was subsequently expanded and incorporated in the risk inventory to ensure the complete integration of ESG-relevant risks in UBM's risk system. A total of 29 individual ESG risks were identified in the following categories:\n\n- Environmental risks\n\t- Acute physical climate risks\n\t- Chronic physical climate risks\n\t- Non-climate related environmental risks\n\t- Transitory climate risks\n- Social and governance risks\n\nIn addition to the assessment of operating business risks and macroeconomic risks, the impact of ESG risks on earnings and liquidity will be evaluated from a quantitative perspective beginning with the 2024 financial year. This ESG evaluation will also include the definition of ESG opportunities, in contrast to the methodology applied to operating business risks and macroeconomic risks. The opportunities will be ranked according to a cash flow scale. The risks and opportunities are not presented from a net viewpoint to avoid distorting the overall corporate risk position.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **2. Risk assessment**\n\nThe assessment is based on a description of the risks as well as an estimate of the probability of occurrence and the potential extent of damages caused by events that could lead annual results and cash flows to deviate from forecasts. The Management Board prepares this estimate with the assistance of local experts and is supported by regular status and project reports from the country managing directors and by calculation models. This assessment takes place every six months to allow the company to react quickly to possible changes in the individual risk positions.\n\nThe evaluation includes an analysis of the potential damages and probability of occurrence for each risk. The results are presented on a risk map which provides a clear overview of the greatest individual risks for UBM.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the individual positions, UBM's risks are aggregated into an earnings-oriented risk indicator (value at risk, VaR) and a cash flow-oriented risk indicator (cash flow at risk, CFaR). The total risk indicators are then examined to determine their agreement with the defined risk appetite and the company's risk-bearing capacity at corporate level. The identified and quantitatively evaluated ESG risks will be included in the overall risk indicators beginning with the 2024 financial year.\n\n#### **3. Risk documentation**\n\nThe findings are summarised in a report which serves as the basis for the subsequent prioritising and management of risks. This report is submitted to the Supervisory Board twice each year.\n\n#### **4. Risk control and monitoring**\n\nUBM's first step for controlling risks is top-down. It involves the preparation of work instructions and guidelines, followed by communication throughout the Group. Responsibilities are assigned by management to the individual risk owners. In a bottom-up process, the risk owners report to the Management Board as required.\n\n#### **5. Risk management**\n\nRisk management is handled in project teams, at departmental level or directly by the Management Board depending on the importance.\n\nThis structured approach is embedded in the RMS as a continuous process.\n\n#### **Risk categories**\n\nUBM's most important individual risks were aggregated in ten main risk categories.\n\n1. Real estate acquisition risks: The direct and indirect risks connected with the purchase of real estate include the interpretation of zoning regulations, third-party rights (neighbours, easements, etc.), the timeliness of the land register, the length of time needed to secure a building permit, incomplete information on potentially hazardous areas (land register), undocumented contamination, protective legislation (heritage protection, tree stocks, protected areas), more difficult development and/or access, unknown wells, groundwater, emissions, etc. Other relevant issues involve market entry risks, country risks, political risks, and competition and market environment risks.\n\nThese risks are minimised by the operating subsidiaries' knowledge of their respective region and competitive environment, their know-how and established local market networks as well as by standardised due diligence and acquisition processes.\n\n2. Project calculation and planning risks: This project phase focuses on the risks associated with procurement and selling prices, current and future rent levels and changes, project financing and interest rates as well as market viability and third party usage. Internal and external experts develop the necessary fundamentals for decisions by the Management Board.\n\n3. Construction and quality risks: This category includes all risks linked to the actual property construction. These risks arise in connection with construction and ancillary costs, the \n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nlength of construction and possible delays, the potential loss of suppliers and the quality of work (including the costs for subsequent reworking).\n\nUBM minimises these risks with experienced project managers to filter out overpriced offers in the tender phase and to ensure continuous cost, quality and schedule controls during construction. Regular project reports to the Management Board, which include target/actual comparisons, support the early identification of variances.\n\n4. Operating risks: The operation of a property together with office rentals or hotel leasing is connected with a variety of risks. In particular, the assessment process covers the tenant's credit standing (creditworthiness, security of rental income), cluster risk (loss of an important major tenant), vacancy risk, maintenance risk (regular checks, maintenance, servicing, repairs, subsequent technical investments), and facility management risks (insufficient processes for debt collection and payment reminders, inadequate invoicing of operating costs).\n\nIn order to protect the value of a property, a wide range of experts from UBM's subsidiaries and specialist departments or external firms are involved during the operating phase to ensure the steady generation of planned revenues and to protect the technical quality of the buildings over the long term.\n\n5. Distribution, realisation and sale risks: A differentiation is made between the marketing risks associated with the sale of condominiums, realisation risks (rental risks for firsttime letting) and the risks connected with the sale of entire properties. Rental price risk is relevant for these categories because a reduction in rental income has a direct impact on the company's revenue and, in the event of a sale, on the realisable purchase price. Valuation risks are also involved because the sale of a property at a market price (realisable sale price) below the respective carrying amount can result in write-downs. Unforeseen guarantee and warranty risks can materialise after a transaction is settled and lead to increased costs and reduced sale proceeds.\n\nUBM's activities at the beginning of each development project include the technical departments together with separate rental and transaction teams which rely on their wide-ranging expertise in the calculation and determination of rental and selling prices. Continuous contact with major customers, market expertise (for example, knowledge of the buyer's yield expectations) and the identification of the optimal selling time ensure that the product is optimally placed on the market. Additional support is provided by the experts in the legal department and external consultants to ensure the optimal design of the entire realisation and sale process.\n\n6. General business risks: Included here, in particular, are IT risks (hardware, software, data loss, hacking, espionage, etc.), commercial risks (liquidity risk, tax risks, financial penalties, etc.) and legal risks (compensation for damages, general contractual and insurance risks, the legal environment, etc.). These risks are monitored by the respective specialist departments and communicated to the Management Board as required.\n\n7. Macroeconomic and other risks: These risks include the development of the economy (inflation, unemployment, purchasing power, etc.), interest rate risk and exchange rate risk. They are continuously monitored by the responsible Management Board members in close cooperation with the staff units, and appropriate countermeasures are implemented where necessary.\n\n8. Environmental risks: This risk category includes acute and chronic physical climate risks (temperature fluctuations, fluctuations in precipitation or hydrology, change in wind conditions, etc.), non-climate related environmental risks (impairment of critical infrastructure, etc.) and transitory climate risks (costs for the transition to low-emission technologies, expanded requirements for emission reporting, etc.) and their potential effects. These risks are monitored by the ESG department and reported to the Management Board where necessary.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n9. Social risks: All employee-related risks are included here, among others the risks arising from human error, unscheduled staff turnover, reputation damage and the effects of heatwaves on the health of the workforce. These risks are monitored by the Human Resources department and reported to the Management Board where necessary.\n\n10. Governance risks: This risk category covers, above all, the compliance risks which can arise from the violation of contracts, regulations or laws in the global supply chain. It also deals with the risk associated with a lack of diversity in UBM's corporate bodies. Here, the Management Board is supported, above all, by the legal department and external consultants.\n\n#### **Additional risks**\n\nInformation on the risks associated with financial instruments is provided in note 45. \"Notes on financial instruments\" in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Risks connected with the economic environment and the war in Ukraine**\n\n#### General situation\n\nThe geopolitical situation remained unstable throughout 2023. The war in Ukraine continues, and the resulting tensions between western countries (USA, EU, Canada) and the Russian Federation have in no way declined. Economic sanctions against the Russian Federation were further intensified, with the result that direct trading and capital market transactions have virtually come to a standstill. The EU's growing independence in the area of gas supplies has eased the pressure on the energy sector, but prices are still substantially above the pre-war level. There are currently no signs of a return to the \"old\" price levels for energy, and the primary and secondary effects on inflation persist. The Ukraine war has been reflected in strong support from European partners and a sharp rise in defence spending. This reduces the flexibility for national households and has led to the cancellation of budgets in other areas.\n\nHigh inflation, with a downward trend towards the end of the year, characterised 2023. Energy prices, in particular, initially represented one of the main drivers, but the core inflation (i.e. the inflation rate excluding energy) increased significantly during the course of the year. It was fuelled by higher food prices, rents and other everyday products. These developments triggered a series of high wage settlements, in individual sectors even above inflation, which added – and will continue to add – to the inflationary momentum.\n\nThe ECB reacted to the high inflation in the eurozone with a steady increase in interest rates which rose at an unprecedented speed. The key interest rate rose from 0% in mid-2022 to 4.5% in September 2023, where it has remained since that time. This has caused economic distortions, above all in sectors with high capital expenditure. The end of 2023 brought the first major insolvencies in the real estate sector, with corresponding effects on all sector participants including UBM.\n\nA further conflict in the form of the Near East crisis materialised at the end of the year. It is expected to result in the disruption of trade routes and influence international tourism flows. Countries which support Israel, directly or indirectly, are also subject to an increasing risk of terror.\n\nThe impact on UBM's business model is described in greater detail in the following section.\n\n#### Impact on UBM's business model\n\nEven though UBM is not directly engaged in the countries involved in the war (the commitment in Russia ended in 2021), this military conflict can have a future influence on the countries bordering Ukraine. The geographical and cultural proximity to its Ukrainian neighbour creates a risk that the Polish market – where UBM acts as both a real estate developer and hotel operator – will suffer from the current crisis. This risk has, however, not materialised to date. Direct financial support for Ukraine by the countries where UBM is active and increased household spending for defence have led, in total, to strained government budgets. In addition to discussions on tax increases, this has had, and could further have, an influence on subsidies for the real estate sector.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nUBM's primary business model is the development and sale of properties. The rapid rise in interest rates brought the real estate market to a near standstill in 2023. Major transactions, apart from the sale of individual apartments, are limited and generally involve emergency sales. The pressure on interest rates is not only visible in higher interest costs for development projects but, above all, in low selling prices because financing costs for buyers have increased significantly and alternative investments generate substantially better yields. Higher yield expectations and lower purchase prices for properties are the result. Other important factors for a functioning real estate business include the ability to obtain loans and the inflow of capital. The rising number of insolvencies, also by larger real estate developers, in the second half of 2023 have reduced the risk appetite of financing banks. The lower valuations caused by reduced selling prices and higher yields have also led to a reduction in lending limits. This translates, in turn, into significantly higher equity requirements for property developers and investors. Lower LTVs also lead to higher equity requirements for potential buyers.\n\nThe capital market climate for the issue of bonds and other debt instruments by non-rated (real estate) companies is expected to remain difficult. This will add to the already high volatility and instability on the capital market. However, a flat repayment profile for 2024 and comparatively good liquidity help UBM to sit out this instable climate. The successful issue of UBM's first green bond in 2023 has also shown that a stronger focus on sustainability is positively received by (bond) investors.\n\nInflation in the EU is currently declining and, consequently, further interest rate hikes by the ECB are not expected in the near future. Forecasts point to the downward adjustment of interest rates by the ECB, as can be seen in the recent inverse interest rate curve. This could trigger a decline in expected yields on the investor side over the medium term and, based on rising rent levels, could produce a new market equilibrium. The risk of an EU-wide recession failed to materialise in 2023, but the economic outlook remains clouded over the short and medium term due to the high interest levels.\n\nThese risks have been incorporated into both current planning and the risk assessment. With its sound liquidity and equity base together with a pipeline that is focused on EU Taxonomy-aligned properties, UBM is solidly positioned to remain active in this difficult environment.\n\nHotel operations: The Near East conflict and the war in Ukraine are expected to disrupt travel, especially by international guests. This has slowed the expected recovery in hotel overnight stays, and 2023 was not the hoped-for normalised year after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHigh inflation has also increased the costs of hotel operations. These costs have been passed on in part to customers through higher room prices, but the profitability of the hotel business model remains under pressure.\n\n#### **Internal Control System**\n\nThe main objectives of UBM's Internal Control System (ICS) are to verify compliance with business policies and defined goals, to safeguard the company's assets, to ensure the reliability of accounting and reporting, to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of operating processes as well as the timely identification of risks and the reliable assessment of potential risks, to confirm compliance with statutory and legal provisions and to support the efficient use of resources and cost savings.\n\nIn addition to the internal controls which represent an integral part of core processes, UBM has installed commercial and technical controlling units which report directly to the Management Board. Commercial controlling monitors current business developments for deviations from target figures and ensures that the necessary information is communicated to management in the event of differences. Technical controlling supervises the ongoing realisation of projects with regard to schedules, construction costs, the progress of construction and all processes relevant to the technical implementation. Its regular reports provide management with the basis for any measures required to meet the agreed goals.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to legal requirements, UBM has a broad spectrum of rules and process flows. The roles and responsibilities within the processes are clearly assigned, and control mechanisms are regularly adapted to reflect changing conditions. The related procedures and rules provide employees with appropriate tools for performing their duties and support the efficient design of processes and controls. These types of work instructions, guidelines and models create transparency, facilitate communication and documentation, help to create efficient work processes, and allow for effective controls.\n\nUBM has therefore taken the necessary precautions to ensure compliance with both legal and internal guidelines and allow for the fast identification and correction of potential weaknesses in operating and organisational processes.\n\nIn the accounting area, uniform accounting and valuation rules ensure that financial reporting is correct and informative. Reliable and accurate bookkeeping and accounting are ensured by the clear separation of functions and control measures such as plausibility tests, regular control activities and invoice approval procedures, together with the dual-control principle.\n\nThis systematic control management ensures that accounting processes in the UBM Group are consistent with national and international accounting standards as well as internal guidelines.\n\nAs part of the internal control system, the Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring accounting procedures and financial reporting on behalf of the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### **Internal Audit**\n\nThe Internal Audit department provides independent and objective audit and consulting services within the UBM Group. Its work is based on internal audit rules, which establish its legitimation outside the company, and the internal audit manual, which specifies the tasks, competencies and responsibilities within UBM. In accordance with C-Rule 18 of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, this department reports directly to the full Management Board. Internal Audit reviews corporate processes and the effectiveness of internal controls and contributes to their improvement.\n\nThis department also carries out ad-hoc audits as required by order of the Management Board.\n\nThe findings and recommendations in the audit reports are used to develop specific measures for improvement. The implementation of these measures is monitored by Internal Audit to ensure the realisation of the improvements on schedule. Individual audit procedures are supported by external consultants on a project-related basis.\n\nInternal Audit also serves as an advisor to the Management Board. Its integrated perspective and knowledge of the company allow it to highlight constructive ways to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and profitability of processes.\n\nThe annual audit plan is approved by the Management Board and submitted to the Supervisory Board. There were no special ad-hoc audits in 2023.\n\n### **Disclosures acc. to Section 243a of the Austrian Commercial Code as of 31 December 2023**\n\n#### **1. Composition of capital**\n\nShare capital comprised 7,472,180 zero par value shares as of 31 December 2023, each of which represents an equal investment in the total share capital of €52,305,260.00. As of that date, all 7,472,180 shares were outstanding. All shares carry the same legal rights and obligations, in particular the right to vote which is exercised based on the number of shares held. The company's share capital is fully paid in. In accordance with Section 5 Para. 3 of the Statutes and Section 10 Para. 2 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, these bearer shares must be securitised in one or more global certificates and deposited at a collective securities depository in accordance with Section 1 Para. 3 of the Austrian Securities Deposit \n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nAct or at a comparable foreign institution. Section 4 Para. 5(b) of the Statutes also stipulates that the share capital may be conditionally increased in accordance with Section 159 Para. 2 (1) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act up to a nominal amount of €5,230,526.00 through the issue of up to 747,218 new, ordinary, zero par bearer shares for issue to the holders of convertible bonds (conditional capital increase).\n\n#### **2. Limitations on voting rights or the transfer of shares**\n\nA syndicate agreement is in place between the Strauss Group and IGO Industries (IGO Industries & Strauss Syndicate). The Management Board has no knowledge of the content of this agreement. The syndicate members are required to vote in line with all resolutions passed by the syndicate, and a reciprocal purchase right is in effect.\n\n#### **3. Direct or indirect investment**\n\nThe following shareholders held a direct or indirect interest amounting to at least ten per cent of the share capital as of 31 December 2023: Ortner & Strauss Syndicate 38.84% (of which the IGO Industries Group holds 27.62% and the Strauss Group 11.22%). In addition, the IGO Industries Group holds a further 7% which are not part of the IGO Industries & Strauss Syndicate.\n\n#### **4. Shares with special control rights**\n\nThe company has no shares with special control rights.\n\n#### **5. Employee participation models**\n\nUBM Development AG has no employee participation models under which employees do not exercise voting rights directly.\n\n#### **6. Provisions on the composition of the Management Board and Supervisory Board and on amendments to the Statutes**\n\nIn accordance with Section 6 Para. 1 of the Statutes, the Management Board consists of between two and six members as determined by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board may appoint deputies to the Management Board within these limits according to Section 6 Para. 2 of the Statutes. Section 6 Para. 3 of the Statutes authorises the Supervisory Board to designate one member as chairperson and one member as deputy chairperson of the Management Board. Any deputy Management Board members have the same powers of representation as the regular Management Board members as defined by Section 8 Para. 3 of the Statutes.\n\nIn accordance with Section 9 Para. 1 of the Statutes, the Supervisory Board must have a minimum of three and a maximum of twelve members elected by the Annual General Meeting. Section 9 Para. 8 of the Statutes permits the election of a substitute member concurrent with the election of a Supervisory Board member, whereby the substitute would fill the seat effective immediately if the Supervisory Board member retires before the end of his/her term. If multiple substitute members are elected, the order in which they are to replace a retiring Supervisory Board member must be determined. A substitute member can also be elected for multiple Supervisory Board members to fill a seat on the Supervisory Board if any of these members steps down prematurely. The term of office of a substitute member ends with the election of a successor to the former Supervisory Board member or, at the latest, with the end of the term of the former Supervisory Board member. If the term of office of a substitute member ends because a successor to a former Supervisory Board member has been elected, the substitute member can still serve as a substitute for the other Supervisory Board members he or she has been chosen to represent. In accordance with Section 9 Para. 2 of the Statutes, the Annual General Meeting can approve a shorter term of office than legally stipulated for individual elected Supervisory Board members or all of the elected members. If an elected Supervisory Board member retires before the end of his or her term, Section 9 Para. 6 of the Statutes does not require the election of a substitute before the next Annual General Meeting. However, an Extraordinary General Meeting must be held within six weeks to elect a substitute if the number of Supervisory Board members falls below three. In accordance with Section 9 Para. 4 of the Statutes, the Annual General Meeting can rescind the appointment of a Supervisory Board member before the end of his or her term with a resolution based on a simple majority of the votes cast.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nSection 20 Para. 1 of the Statutes determines the voting process at the Annual General Meeting: Resolutions are passed with a simple majority of the votes cast, unless otherwise required by legal regulations, and, in cases where a majority of share capital is required, resolutions are passed with a simple majority of the share capital represented at the time of voting. From the legal viewpoint of the Management Board, this provision of the Statutes reduces the majority of at least three quarters of share capital represented at the time of voting, which is generally required by the Austrian Stock Corporation Act for amendments to the Statutes, to a simple majority of share capital unless voting involves a change in the corporate purpose.\n\n#### **7. Authority of the Management Board members**\n\nSection 4 Para. 4 of the Statutes authorises the Management Board as of 31 December 2023 to increase share capital by up to €5,230,526.00, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, through the issue of up to 747,218 new ordinary zero par value bearer shares in exchange for cash and/or contributions in kind, also in multiple tranches, through indirect subscription rights pursuant to Section 153 Para. 6 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and through the exclusion of subscription rights (authorised capital). Furthermore, the Management Board is authorised to determine the issue price, issue conditions, subscription ratio and other details with the approval of the Supervisory Board. This authorisation by the Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2022 is valid for five years beginning on the date of recording in the company register, i.e. up to 9 June 2027. The subscription rights of shareholders to the new shares issued from authorised capital are excluded if and to the extent that the exercise of this authorisation (authorised capital) involves the issue of shares in exchange for cash under greenshoe options connected with the placement of new shares in the company. The Management Board is also authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of shareholders. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorised to approve amendments to the Statutes which result from the use of this authorisation by the Management Board.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and in accordance with Section 4 Para. 5(b) of the Statutes, the Management Board is authorised to determine the remaining details for the conditional capital increase and its implementation with the approval of the Supervisory Board, in particular the details of the issue and the conversion procedure for the convertible bonds, the issue price and the exchange or conversion ratio. The Supervisory Board is authorised to pass resolutions on amendments to the Statutes arising from the issue of shares from conditional capital. The issue price and conversion ratio are to be determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and the company's share price using an accepted pricing procedure. If the terms and conditions for the issue of convertible bonds include a conversion obligation, the contingent capital will also be used to meet this conversion obligation.\n\nSection 4 Para. 6 of the Statutes authorises the Management Board, in accordance with Section 159 Para. 3 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, to conditionally increase the company's share capital in agreement with Section 159 Para. 2 no. 3 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by up to €3,917,480.00 through the issue of up to 559,640 new ordinary zero par bearer shares, also in multiple tranches. These new shares are intended to service the stock options granted to employees, key managers and members of the Management Board of the company and its subsidiaries within the framework of the Long-Term Incentive Programme 2017 and within the framework of the continuation and extension of the Long-Term Incentive Programme 2017 (including the modification of plan conditions in 2017) which was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2021. This authorisation by the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2021 is valid for five years beginning on the date of recording in the company register, i.e. up to 9 July 2026. The strike price was set at €36.33. The Supervisory Board was authorised to pass resolutions on amendments to the Statutes arising from the conditional capital increase.\n\n#### **8. Significant agreements**\n\nA bond (partial debentures) with an original nominal value of €75,000,000.00 (term: 2018–2023) was issued in November 2018. This UBM bond 2018-2013 was topped up to a total volume of €120,000,000.00 through a private placement in \n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 2019. In June/July 2023, the issuer made an offer to the bondholders to exchange their partial debentures for the UBM green bond 2023-2027. Partial debentures from the UBM bond 2018-2023 with a total nominal value of €28.94m were exchanged for partial debentures of the UBM green bond 2023-2027. The remaining partial debentures of the UBM bond 2018-2023 (total nominal value: €91.05m) were redeemed in full on 16 November 2023.\n\nThe UBM bond 2019-2025 with a total nominal value of €120,000,000.00 and a six-year term (2019–2025) was issued in October/November 2019. It included an offer to investors to exchange the UBM bond 2015–2020 for the UBM bond 2019–2025 as well as a cash subscription offer. Partial debentures from the bond issued in 2015 with a total nominal value of €25,164,000.00 were exchanged for 2019 UBM partial debentures, while the cash subscription involved the issue of partial debentures with a total nominal value of €94,836,000.00.\n\nA bearer bond (UBM bearer bond 2020–2025) with a total nominal value of €21,500,000.00 was issued in December 2020. The bearer bond issued in November 2016 (term: 2016- 2021; total nominal value: €18,500,000.00) was extended to December 2025 at an amount of €10,500,00.00 and an additional €11,000,000.00 were newly arranged. The remainder of the bearer bond 2016-2021 that was not extended was repaid in December 2021.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the company issued a bearer bond with a total nominal value of €7,000,000.00 (term: 2021-2025) and other bearer bonds with a volume of €500,000.00 (term: 2021–2025).\n\nThe sustainability-linked UBM bond 2021-2026 with a total nominal volume of €150,000,000.00 and a five-year term (2021-2026) was issued by the company in May 2021. The issue included an option for the holders of the bond 2017- 2022 to exchange their partial debentures for the new UBM bond 2021-2016 as well as a cash subscription offer. (For information on the bond issued in 2017, see above.) Partial debentures from the bond issued in 2017 with a total nominal value of €68,897,500.00 were exchanged for 2021 UBM partial debentures, while the cash subscription involved the issue of partial debentures with a total nominal value of €81,102,500.00. The bond (partial debentures) issued in May 2021 with a total nominal value of €150,000,000.00 and five-year term (2021–2026) represents a sustainability-linked bond. That means the repayment amount can exceed 100% of the nominal value if the company's ESG rating deteriorates during the bond's term.\n\nThe deeply subordinated sustainability-linked hybrid bond 2021 (total nominal volume: €100,000,000.00) was issued in the second quarter of 2021. Within the framework of this issue, nearly 50% of the hybrid bond 2018 were repurchased prematurely and the remainder was extended to 2026. The terms of the sustainability-linked hybrid bond 2021 entitle the issuer to call the hybrid partial debentures prematurely and in full in the event of a change of control as defined by the Austrian Takeover Act (as defined in the bond terms) at an increased nominal amount plus accrued interest as of the repayment date; the increased nominal value equals at least the nominal amount of the partial debentures, subject to the increase(s) after the occurrence of an adjustment event involving the ESG rating and the issuer's sustainability recognition level.\n\nIn July 2023, the company issued its first green bond (UBM green bond 2023-2027) with a nominal value of €50,000,000.00 and four-year term (2023–2027) to finance sustainable development projects. This issue included an option for the holders of the UBM bond 2018-2023 to exchange their partial debentures for the new UBM green bond 2023-2027 as well as a cash subscription offer. (For information on the exchange of the bond issued in 2018, see above.) Partial debentures from the bond issued in 2018 with a nominal amount of €28.94m were exchanged for partial debentures of the UBM green bond 2023-2027, and partial debentures with a total nominal volume of €91.05m were issued in connection with the cash subscription.\n\nThe terms and conditions of these bonds include, above all, the following stipulation: If there is a change of control in the sense of a takeover (respectively, the attainment of a direct \n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\ncontrolling interest in the issuer as defined in the Austrian Takeover Act with the legal consequence of a mandatory offer by a natural person or legal entity who/which did not hold any, or any controlling, interest when the bond was issued; i.e. a change of control event as defined in the bond terms and conditions), and this change of control leads to a deterioration of the issuer's credit rating, and the issuer is unable to produce proof of its credit standing within 60 days of the announcement of the change of control, every bondholder is entitled to call his or her partial debentures and demand immediate repayment at the nominal amount together with accrued interest up to the repayment date.\n\nMoreover, the company concluded contracts for promissory note loans with a total nominal value of €32,000,000.00 in November 2016; €20,500,000.00 of this total were extended up to December 2025 and the remaining amount not extended was repaid in December 2021. Further promissory note loans with a total nominal value of €9,500,000.00 were concluded in December 2020. The related contracts include a termination right in the event of a change of control which leads to (i) a significant impairment of the company's ability to meet its obligations from the respective loan agreement or (ii) a breach of legally binding regulations by the respective lender. (In this context, a change of control means the acquisition of a direct controlling interest in the company pursuant to the Austrian Takeover Act with the legal consequence of a mandatory offer by a natural or legal person who did not hold an interest in the company when the respective loan agreement was concluded.) According to the December 2020 contracts for the promissory note loans, the bondholders are only entitled to call their partial debentures and demand immediate repayment, together with accrued interest up to the repayment date, if this change of control leads to a deterioration of the issuer's credit rating, and the issuer is unable to produce proof of its credit standing within 60 days of the announcement of the change of control.\n\nAn overview of the bonds is provided on page 99.\n\nThere are no other significant agreements as defined by Section 243a (8) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\n#### 9. Compensation agreements\n\nThere are no compensation agreements in the sense of Section 243a (9) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\n#### **10. Other information Branch offices**\n\nUBM Development AG maintains the following branch offices which are recorded in the company register: Styria (Thalerhofstrasse 88, 8141 Unterpremstätten) and Tyrol (Porr-Strasse 1, 6175 Kematen).\n\n#### **Non-financial performance indicators**\n\nUBM prepares a separate non-financial report which meets the requirements of Section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code. This ESG report is published concurrently with the annual report.\n\n#### Environmental concerns\n\nThe real estate and construction sector is, from the global viewpoint, the most CO2- and energy-intensive sector. Nearly 40% of all global CO2 emissions and more than one-third of worldwide energy consumption are attributable to the construction and operation of buildings. It is, consequently, clear that ecological aspects play a key role in all UBM's decisions. Our commitment to timber construction, the special attention we give to renewable energies and energy efficiency as well as our focus on green building certification and our efforts on behalf of the circular economy are an expression of this conviction.\n\nWith the Timber Construction & Green Building department, UBM has established a competence centre with six experts to underscore the strategic importance of timber construction. It supports and monitors the operational implementation of green building processes throughout the UBM Group. New national and European requirements are evaluated and implemented at project level in agreement with the *green. smart. and more*. strategy. This department also coordinates the evaluation and organisation of building certification and EU Taxonomy checks for development projects by external partners. Project managers are responsible for the operational implementation of the green building strategy in \n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\ndevelopment projects. Their work involves the optimisation of projects, together with external experts, in many areas – for example energy – based on the specifics of the respective locations. The implementation of the green building strategy in standing assets and at Group locations is the responsibility of UBM's asset managers.\n\n#### *Future-oriented real estate development*\n\nWith our properties, we design the living space of the future – and that means we also design the environment. Real estate development is not only our core business, it also gives us the greatest leverage to significantly reduce our carbon footprint. UBM directly addresses the ecological impact of its activities in all project phases. A commitment to timber construction, the special attention we give to renewable energies and energy efficiency as well as our focus on green building certification and our efforts on behalf of the circular economy are an expression of this conviction. Our activities concentrate on the following areas:\n\n- extensive revaluations in earlier years in contrast to many sions\n- Durability and recyclability of materials\n- Ground sealing, climate change and biodiversity\n- Refurbishment and revitalisation\n- Healthy building materials and the quality of life\n\n#### *We measure our locations based on their footprint*\n\nIn addition to our development projects, we want to make our own business operations more sustainable. Our goal in this area is to steadily reduce our ecological footprint. Relevant activities to reach this goal involve energy consumption and emissions. The efficient use of water and correct waste management are also important issues for UBM and are internally managed and reported.\n\n#### *Fewer standing assets*\n\nThe strategic focus of UBM's business activities involves the development and sale of properties. Accordingly, the number of standing assets has been steadily reduced since 2015. UBM also takes action to support sustainability in these properties – here, the key issue is whether the properties are rented and UBM therefore only has an indirect influence on energy consumption and emissions, for example through the use of energy-saving lighting or efficient heating and cooling solutions.\n\nFurther information on environmental concerns can be found in UBM's ESG Report 2023.\n\n#### Employees\n\nThe average number of employees in the UBM Group equalled 268 in 2023 (2022: 292).\n\nResponsible management is in no way limited to environmental aspects. It also covers a company's social accountability, in other words the impact of its actions on society.\n\nThis also includes fair interaction with our employees in our direct sphere of influence. The women and men who work for UBM are an important factor for our long-term success and essential for the positive development of our company. In this connection, we have defined the following focus areas:\n\n- Attractive employer and training & education\n- Diversity and equal opportunities\n- Health and occupational safety\n\nAt Management Board level, the COO is responsible for personnel-related issues which are centrally combined under human resources. The head of human resources meets regularly with the COO to discuss developments in this area. Targets, measures and the strategic focus are defined together with the Management Board and communicated to the organisation. The human resources team also includes an HR business partner who implements human resources measures together with local management in agreement with the HR strategy.\n\nWith our values – competent. consequent. transparent. – we create a working climate in which each person feels included, authorised and called upon to make a personal contribution. We encourage our employees to be proactive through short decision paths and flat hierarchies.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe design of our working environment reflects our strict compliance with the national and international rules and requirements in the markets where we are active. We also base our actions on agreements that include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Guidelines and the international labour standards set by the International Labour Organisation. Our activities exceed minimum standards. This commitment is anchored in our codes of conduct (ethics code and code of conduct for business partners).\n\nSpecially planned training and continuing education programmes are a fixed part of human resources development at UBM. The basis is formed by an annual appraisal meeting, which includes an agreement on focus topics and specific training measures together with the responsible supervisor. UBM actively offers numerous educational opportunities ranging from internal workshops and idea competitions to external training programmes, but also encourages and supports the independent development of its employees.\n\nFurther information on employee concerns can be found in UBM's ESG Report 2023.\n\n#### **Corporate Governance Report**\n\nThis report is part of the annual report and can be downloaded under www.ubm-development.com, submenu investor relations/financial reports or corporate governance.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Research and development** The company has no research or development activities.\n\nVienna, 2 April 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\n\\$\\frac{}{\\frac{}{}}\\$\n\n**Thomas G.

|\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n# **1. General information**\n\nThe UBM Group comprises UBM Development AG (UBM) and its subsidiaries. UBM is a public limited company under Austrian law which maintains its registered headquarters at 1100 Vienna, Austria, Laaer-Berg-Strasse 43. It is registered with the commercial court of Vienna under reference number FN 100059x. The business activities of the Group are focused primarily on the development, sale and management of real estate.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Section 245a of the Austrian Commercial Code (\"Unternehmensgesetzbuch\") and in agreement with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European Union as well as the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).\n\nThe reporting currency is the euro, which is also the functional currency of UBM. The functional currency of the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements is the respective national currency. Amounts are reported in thousands of euros (T€) and rounded using the compensated summation method. The reporting year corresponds to the calendar year and ends on 31 December 2023.\n\n# **2. Scope of consolidation**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include UBM as well as 51 (2022: 57) domestic subsidiaries and 73 (2022: 75) foreign subsidiaries. One company was initially included in UBM's consolidated financial statements during the reporting year following its founding and another company was included following its acquisition (see note 2.1.).\n\nOne company was sold and nine were deconsolidated following their liquidation. The sale price of T€10,908 was paid in cash. Assets in the amount of T€7,981 were disposed of.\n\nIn addition, 23 (2022: 27) domestic and 20 (2022: 21) foreign associated companies and joint ventures were accounted for at equity. Three companies were deconsolidated following their liquidation and two companies were sold in 2023.\n\nUBM is entitled to the majority of voting rights in 19 (2022: 21) subsidiaries but does not exercise control over these companies because of specific rules defined by the respective partnership agreements. These companies are accounted for as joint ventures.\n\n### **2.1. Initial consolidations**\n\nThe following companies were initially included through full consolidation in 2023 (see the list of investments for the capital share):\n\n| Due to new foundations                      | Date of initial consolidation |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Polecki Infrastructure sp. z o.o.           | 10.2.2023                     |\n| Due to acquisitions                         | Date of initial consolidation |\n| Timber Marina Tower Immobilien GmbH & Co KG | 4.7.2023                      |\n\nThe purchase of 100% of the project company Timber Marina Tower Immobilien GmbH & Co KG resulted in the addition of assets of T€24,500 and liabilities of T€8,000. The purchase price of T€16,636 was paid in cash.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3. Significant accounting policies**\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for based on the acquisition method. This method requires the measurement of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Any difference between the acquisition cost and the attributable proportion of the acquired net assets at fair value is recognised as goodwill. This goodwill is not written off or reduced through scheduled amortisation but is tested for impairment at least once each year.\n\nAll accounts receivable and payable between consolidated companies are eliminated during the consolidation of liabilities. Intragroup income and expenses are offset during the consolidation of income and expenses. Interim profits or losses from intragroup deliveries are eliminated if the related amounts are material and the respective assets are still included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nShares in the net assets of fully consolidated subsidiaries which are not attributable to UBM are reported separately as part of equity under \"non-controlling interests\".\n\n# **4. Accounting and valuation methods**\n\n#### **Measurement principles**\n\nThe annual financial statements of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared according to standardised accounting and measurement methods. The measurement methods were applied consistently, apart from the newly applied standards.\n\n#### **Currency translation**\n\nThe companies included in the consolidated financial statements prepare their annual financial statements in their respective functional currencies, whereby the functional currency represents the relevant currency for each company's business activities.\n\nThe items in the consolidated statement of financial position are translated at the average exchange rate at the end of the financial year, while income statement items are translated at the average annual exchange rate for the financial year (as an arithmetic mean of all end-of-month quotations). Differences resulting from currency translation are recognised directly in equity and transferred to profit or loss when the business operations are derecognised.\n\nThe following key exchange rates were used for the inclusion and translation of foreign subsidiaries:\n\n|     | Mean exchange rate as of 31 Dec 2023 | Average annual exchange rate |\n|-----|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| PLN | 4.3395                               | 4.5428                       |\n| CZK | 24.7240                              | 24.0009                      |\n|     | Mean exchange rate as of 31 Dec 2022 | Average annual exchange rate |\n| PLN | 4.6808                               | 4.6842                       |\n| CZK | 24.1160                              | 24.5620                      |\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of companies, any adjustments to the carrying amounts of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities to reflect fair value as of the acquisition date or, respectively, goodwill, are treated as assets or liabilities of the acquired subsidiary and are therefore subject to currency translation.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nExchange rate gains or losses on transactions by consolidated companies in a currency other than the functional currency are recognised in profit or loss. Monetary items not denominated in the functional currency of the consolidated companies are translated at the average exchange rate in effect at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIntangible assets are capitalised at their acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life. The amortisation rates range from 10.00% to 50.00% (2022: 10.00% to 50.00%).\n\nThe identification of impairment leads to the write-down of the involved intangible asset to its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of fair value less selling costs or the value in use. If the reasons for impairment cease to exist, the impairment loss is reversed at an amount equal to the increase in value, but up to a maximum of the carrying amount which would have resulted from the application of scheduled amortisation to the original acquisition or production cost.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at their acquisition cost, including any ancillary expenses less reductions in this cost, or at production cost. The carrying amount reflects the deduction of accumulated depreciation and the straight-line depreciation recorded for the reporting year. The following depreciation rates are applied:\n\n|                                                 | 2023          | 2022          |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Buildings                                       | 1.50 to 33.33 | 1.50 to 33.33 |\n| Technical equipment and machinery               | 4.00 to 50.00 | 4.00 to 50.00 |\n| Other facilities, fixtures and office equipment | 4.00 to 50.00 | 4.00 to 50.00 |\n\nThe identification of impairment leads to the write-down of the involved item of property, plant or equipment to its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of fair value less selling costs or the value in use. If the reasons for impairment cease to exist, the impairment loss is reversed at an amount equal to the increase in value, but up to a maximum of the carrying amount which would have resulted from the application of scheduled depreciation to the original acquisition or production cost. Major renovation is capitalised, while ongoing maintenance, repairs and minor renovation are expensed as incurred.\n\nRights of use to property, plant and equipment acquired through leases are capitalised at the present value of future lease payments and amortised over the term of the lease or at the indicated amortisation rates on a straight-line basis.\n\nLow-value assets are written off in full in the year of purchase because they are immaterial for the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAssets under construction, including buildings which are to be used for operational purposes or whose use has not yet been established, are accounted for at acquisition or manufacturing cost less any applicable impairment losses.\n\nThe borrowing costs for qualifying assets are included in acquisition or production cost. For investment properties sold through forward deals, the capitalisation of borrowing costs ends on the date of the related agreement. Depreciation on these assets begins with their completion or the attainment of operational status. Interest totalling T€6,449 was capitalised for properties in 2023 (2022: T€1,946). Information on the rate for financing costs is provided in note 36.\n\nInvestment property is real estate that is held to generate rental income and/or for value appreciation. It includes office and commercial buildings that are not used for the company's own business purposes as well as residential buildings and undeveloped land. These assets are carried at their fair value, and any gains or losses from changes in this fair value are recognised in profit or loss of the applicable period. Buildings under construction are accounted for at acquisition or production cost if fair value cannot be reliably determined or at fair value as generally determined by the residual value method.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fair value of investment property is based on appraisals by independent experts, on the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of the property, or on the amounts realised in comparable transactions.\n\nThe rights of use to investment property acquired through leases are capitalised at the present value of the future lease payments and measured at fair value in subsequent periods.\n\nThe sales comparison approach or cost approach was used to establish the fair value of properties carried as real estate inventories, which are intended for sale immediately after completion and whose market value can be determined based on comparable transactions.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale represent properties that are available for immediate sale in their current condition and whose sale is considered highly probable. These properties are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and net realisable value. Investment property is carried at fair value. The probability of sale is evaluated quarterly, and the resulting reclassifications are reported in the notes under the development of property, plant and equipment and investment property.\n\nInvestments in companies accounted for at equity are recognised at acquisition cost, which is allocated between the proportional share of the acquired net assets at fair value and any applicable goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually by the proportional share of annual profit or loss, dividends received and other changes to equity. Goodwill is not subject to scheduled amortisation but is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 once each year or when circumstances point to a possible decline in value. If the recoverable amount falls below the carrying amount, the difference is written off.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised to reflect temporary differences between the values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, on the one hand, and the values for tax purposes, on the other hand, at the amount of the expected future tax expense or tax relief. In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for future asset benefits arising from tax loss carryforwards if realisation is sufficiently certain.\n\nThe calculation of deferred taxes is based on the applicable income tax rate in the respective country. The Austrian eco-social tax reform which was enacted in 2022 provides for a gradual reduction in the corporate tax rate from 25.00% to 23.00% (2023: 24.00%, beginning in 2024: 23.00%). The calculation for UBM Development AG and the Austrian subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements for the reporting year was therefore based on a tax rate of 23% instead of 24%.\n\nThe provisions for severance payments, pensions and anniversary bonuses were calculated in accordance with IAS 19 based on the projected unit credit method with the application of the AVÖ 2018-P Generation Life Table, whereby an actuarial valuation is performed as of every reporting date. The calculation parameters included an interest rate of 3.50% (2022: 3%) for Austria as well as salary increases of 3.37% and 3.70% (2022: 3.37% and 3.70%) per year in Austria. The calculation of the provisions for severance payments in Austria did not include any deductions for employee turnover. For anniversary bonuses in Austria, the calculation included deductions for employee turnover based on statistical data within a range of 0.00% to 13.20% (2022: 0.00% to 13.20%). The retirement age assumed for employees in the Austrian companies represents the earliest possible retirement age permitted by law following the 2004 pension reform (corridor pension), also taking all transitional arrangements into account. The calculation of the provisions for Austria is based on the AVÖ 2018-P – Pagler & Pagler Mortality Table, while the 2018 G Mortality Table Guidelines issued by Klaus Heubeck are used for Germany.\n\nActuarial gains and losses on severance payments and pensions are recognised in full in other comprehensive income, while the actuarial gains and losses on anniversary bonuses are included in profit or loss for the period. Service costs are reported as part of personnel expenses, and interest expense is recorded under financial costs.\n\nOther provisions cover all identifiable risks and uncertain obligations. They are recognised at the amount that will presumably be required to settle the underlying obligation.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of future lease payments, whereby discounting is based on the interest rate underlying the lease. If this rate cannot be determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate for the applicable term is used.\n\n#### **Financial instruments**\n\nFinancial instruments that fall under the scope of application of IFRS 9 are assigned to valuation categories based on the underlying business model and the characteristics of the contractually agreed cash flows. Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value, depending on the valuation category.\n\nFor financial instruments carried at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), the loss allowance is based on the expected credit loss model. This procedure involves the creation of a risk provision equal to the 12-month expected credit loss (Level 1) on the initial recognition date. In the event of a significant deterioration in the credit risk, the lifetime expected loss is calculated (Level 2). Objective evidence of impairment results in reclassification to Level 3.\n\nUBM applies the simplified approach provided by IFRS 9.5.5.15 to trade receivables, contractual assets and leasing receivables and measures the loss allowance in line with the lifetime expected loss. All available information is used to evaluate the expected credit loss, including historical data as well as forward-looking information. In general, external credit ratings are not available for financial instruments. The expected credit loss equals the product of the expected net claim to the financial instrument, the period-based probability of default and the loss on actual default.\n\nThe general impairment model is applied to project financing. Due to the absence of external credit evaluations, credit risk is monitored according to the development of key indicators, e.g. the loan-to-value ratio or collection period.\n\nTrade receivables, project financing and other financial assets were recognised at amortised cost. No allowances for expected credit losses were recognised in 2023 because neither the historical nor the forecast data indicated any loss rates.\n\nThe investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other investments reported under other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), which is generally determined with valuation procedures like the discounted cash flow method.\n\nSecurities are classified as FVTPL and measured at fair value. If these securities represent debt instruments and consist solely of interest and principal payments, they are carried at amortised cost. Liabilities are carried at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest method. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n#### **Revenue from contracts with customers**\n\nRevenue is reported after the deduction of value added taxes, rebates and other sales-based taxes. The recognition of revenue is based on the transaction type as follows:\n\nThe revenue from investment properties that are sold after completion is recognised at a point in time after the material risks and rewards are transferred. The revenue from investment properties is recognised over time when the sale takes place through a forward deal during construction and the company has a legal entitlement to payment for previously provided performance as well as no alternative use for the asset. Revenue from the sale of apartments is recognised over time for units that are sold before completion and for which the company has a legal entitlement to payment for previously provided performance as well as no alternative use for the assets. Revenue from the sale of completed apartments is recognised at a point in time. The rental income and income from hotel operations is recognised over time. The income from invoiced construction services is also recognised over time.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe recognition of revenue over time is based on the progress of construction (percentage of completion, POC method). The percentage of completion represents the previously provided performance as a per cent of the total contract performance. For revenue from real estate, this indicator is calculated as the investment costs incurred to date in relation to the total investment costs for the respective project. The identified performance is recognised, after the deduction of prepayments by customers, as a contract asset under trade receivables or, if the prepayments exceed the previously provided performance, as a contract liability under other liabilities. If the total costs for a contract are expected to exceed the related revenue, the expected loss is recognised in full and immediately at an amount equal to the costs required to fulfil the contract. The costs for contract extensions are capitalised and amortised over the project term unless they represent costs which would not have been incurred if the contract had not been received.\n\nInterest income and expenses are accrued in line with the outstanding balance of the respective loan and the applicable interest rate.\n\nDividend income from financial investments is recognised when a legal entitlement arises.\n\nA lease represents an agreement under which the lessor provides the lessee with a contractual right to control an identified asset for a defined period in return for consideration. The UBM Group acts as a lessee, above all, in connection with office properties and one property which is sublet. There are numerous individual contracts with comparatively low annual rental payments, fixed and open-ended terms, and agreed termination rights. Leases are presented on the statement of financial position as rights of use and corresponding lease liabilities. The lease payments are allocated between an interest and a principal component. The finance costs are recognised to profit or loss over the lease term to produce a periodic cost of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The rights of use are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life and the lease term. Lease payments are measured by applying a country-specific incremental borrowing rate, i.e. the interest rate which the Group would have to pay to borrow funds to purchase an asset of comparable value under comparable conditions in a similar economic environment. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed as incurred. Short-term leases are defined as leases with a term of up to 12 months. The UBM Group also serves as a lessor to a limited extent. These leases usually involve office space, and the related contracts qualify for classification as operating leases. The rental income from these leases is reported under other operating income.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **5. Discretionary judgment and major sources of estimation uncertainty**\n\nThe preparation of annual financial statements invariably involves the use of estimates and assumptions by management for the amount and recognition of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses and the disclosures on contingent liabilities. The major assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty as defined in IAS 1.125 ff are related to the following:\n\nDetermining the fair value of real estate: Fair value generally equals the present value of the realisable rental income. Any change in the estimated future realisable rental income or the expected return on alternative investments will also lead to a change in the fair value of the involved property. The capitalisation rate (2023: 2.96% to 7.50%; 2022: 2.75% to 7.00%) represents the average market rate of return on the property. One criterion for the selection of the capitalisation rate is the general and specific risk for the return on the property.\n\nMost of the investment property was valued in accordance with internationally recognised earnings methodology in 2023, in particular the Term and Reversion approach (see note 20 for additional details on the valuation method and the value of investment property).\n\nThe residual value method was used to value the real estate under development (assets under construction – IAS 40). Under this method, the future income is estimated by the appraisers – provided there has been no pre-letting activity – in consultation with the project developers. The budgeted completion costs, including an appropriate developer margin, are deducted from this income. The remainder represents the fair value of the properties under development.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of changes in key parameters on the fair value of investment property:\n\n# in T€\n\n| Portfolio property  |                              |                                   |         |                              |                                   |         |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|\n|                     |                              | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2023 | 166,172 |                              | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2022 | 175,520 |\n|                     | Adjustment to long-term rent |                                   |         | Adjustment to long-term rent |                                   |         |\n|                     | 0.00%                        | 10.00%                            | -10.00% | 0.00%                        | 10.00%                            | -10.00% |\n| Adjustment to yield |                              |                                   |         |                              |                                   |         |\n| 0.00%               | -                            | 13,271                            | -7,204  | -                            | 16,198                            | -13,805 |\n| 0.50%               | -2,082                       | 4,833                             | -8,738  | -9,112                       | -4,396                            | -20,177 |\n| -0.50%              | 8,438                        | 21,333                            | 733     | 13,478                       | 26,692                            | -9,604  |\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nin T€\n\n#### Development projects\n\n|                                  | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2023 |         | Carrying amount as of 31 Dec 2022 |         |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Developer profit                 | -5.00%                            | 5.00%   | -5.00%                            | 5.00%   |\n|                                  | 31,264                            | -35,036 | 23,806                            | -22,054 |\n| Adjustment to yield              | -0.50%                            | 0.50%   | -0.50%                            | 0.50%   |\n|                                  | 56,034                            | -52,266 | 46,236                            | -38,054 |\n| Adjustment to construction costs | 10.00%                            | -10.00% | 10.00%                            | -10.00% |\n|                                  | -48,156                           | 41,384  | -27,474                           | 28,826  |\n| Adjustment to rental income      | -10.00%                           | 10.00%  | -10.00%                           | 10.00%  |\n|                                  | -66,061                           | 63,801  | -32,105                           | 38,051  |\n\nThe classification as investment property (IAS 40) or inventories (IAS 2) is based on the following considerations: Projects that are held to generate rental income or for value appreciation are classified as investment property. Inventories comprise real estate that, in advance, is intended for resale. Properties which are sold before completion and for which UBM has no alternative use as well as a legal entitlement to payment for previous performance are accounted for as contract assets in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\nProperties (inventories) held for sale: The sales comparison approach or cost approach was used to determine the fair value of properties for which comparable market transactions were available. This applies primarily to real estate held as current assets (residential buildings) that is intended for immediate sale after completion. In accordance with accounting standards, the carrying amount is only adjusted to reflect a lower fair value. The external appraisers define the parameters together with the local project developers based on the size, age and condition of the buildings as well as country-specific considerations. Information on the carrying amounts and the potential impact of impairment is provided in note 24.\n\nProvisions: The valuation of the provisions for severance payments, pension and anniversary bonus provisions is based on parameters that include discount factors, salary increases and/or employee turnover. Changes in these parameters can lead to higher or lower provisions, personnel expenses and interest costs. Other provisions are based on estimates for the likelihood of an event occurring and the probability of an outflow of funds. Changes in these estimates or the occurrence of an event previously considered unlikely can have a significant impact on the Group's financial performance.\n\nSensitivity analysis of provisions for pensions: The following actuarial assumptions were considered relevant and the following margins were applied: Discount rate +/-0.25%, pension trend +/-0.25%, life expectancy +/-1 year.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of life expectancy was based on a shift in the average life expectancy for all candidates in the respective plan.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the differences to the recorded amounts as a relative deviation:\n\n|             | Interest +0.25%         | Interest -0.25%         |\n|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|             | liquid                  | liquid                  |\n| Pension DBO | -2.20%                  | 2.30%                   |\n|             | Pension trend +0.25%    | Pension trend -0.25%    |\n|             | liquid                  | liquid                  |\n| Pension DBO | 2.30%                   | -2.20%                  |\n|             | Life expectancy +1 year | Life expectancy -1 year |\n|             | liquid                  | liquid                  |\n| Pension DBO | 4.80%                   | -4.80%                  |\n\n■ Energy efficiency, renewable energies and CO2 emisSensitivity analysis of the provision for severance payments: The following actuarial assumptions were considered material and the following margins were applied: Discount rate +/-0.25%, salary trend +/-0.25%, employee turnover +/-0.50% up to 25th year of service, life expectancy +/-1 year.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of life expectancy was based on a shift in the average life expectancy for all candidates in the respective plan.\n\nThe following table shows the differences to the recorded amounts as a relative deviation:\n\n|                        | Interest +0.25%                                  | Interest -0.25%                                  | Salary trend +0.25%     | Salary trend -0.25%     |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Severance payments DBO | -1.59%                                           | 1.63%                                            | 1.62%                   | -1.59%                  |\n|                        | Fluctuation +0.50% until<br>25th year of service | Fluctuation -0.50% until<br>25th year of service | Life expectancy +1 year | Life expectancy -1 year |\n| Severance payments DBO | -0.10%                                           | 0.10%                                            | 0.02%                   | -0.03%                  |\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nProject financing: UBM, as the parent company, grants loans to its equity-accounted entities and subsidiaries. These loans serve as financing for the equity share of real estate projects. They are subject to interest at normal market rates and are payable after the project is sold.\n\nThe actual amounts realised in the future could differ from the estimates and assumptions depending on the success of the individual projects.

Effects of the risks arising from the war in Ukraine and the Near East conflict as well as climate-related risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Risks connected with the war in Ukraine and the Near East conflict**\n\nEven though UBM is not directly engaged in the countries involved in the war (the commitment in Russia ended in 2021), this military conflict can have a future influence on the countries bordering Ukraine. The geographical and cultural proximity to its Ukrainian neighbour creates a risk that the Polish market – where UBM acts as both a real estate developer and hotel operator – will suffer from the current crisis. This risk has, however, not materialised to date. Direct financial support for Ukraine by the countries where UBM is active and increased household spending for defence have led, in total, to strained government budgets.\n\nIn addition to discussions on tax increases, this has had, and could further have, an influence on subsidies for the real estate sector. A functioning real estate business also requires the ability to obtain property mortgages and a regular inflow of capital. The rising number of insolvencies, also by larger real estate developers, in the second half of 2023 has reduced the risk appetite of financing banks. The lower valuations caused by the decline in selling prices and increase in yields have also led to a reduction in lending limits. This translates, in turn, into significantly higher equity requirements for property developers and investors. Lower LTVs also lead to higher equity requirements for potential buyers. The capital market climate for the issue of bonds and other debt instruments by non-rated (real estate) companies is expected to remain difficult. This will add to the already high volatility and instability on the capital market. However, a flat repayment profile for 2024 and comparatively good liquidity will help UBM to sit out this instable climate. The successful issue of UBM's first green bond in 2023 has also shown that a stronger focus on sustainability is positively received by (bond) investors.\n\nInflation in the EU is currently declining and, consequently, further interest rate hikes by the ECB are not expected in the near future. Forecasts point to the downward adjustment of interest rates by the ECB, as can be seen in the recent inverse interest rate curve. This could trigger a decline in expected yields on the investor side over the medium term and, based on rising rent levels, could produce a new market equilibrium. The risk of an EU-wide recession failed to materialise in 2023, but the economic outlook remains clouded over the short and medium term due to the high interest levels.\n\nThese risks have been incorporated into both current planning and the risk assessment. With its sound liquidity and equity base together with a pipeline that is focused on EU Taxonomy-aligned properties, UBM is solidly positioned to remain active in this difficult environment.\n\nHotel operations: The Near East conflict and the war in Ukraine are expected to disrupt travel, especially by international guests. This has slowed the expected recovery in hotel overnight stays, and 2023 was not the hoped-for normalised year after the Covid-19 pandemic. High inflation has also increased the costs of hotel operations. These costs have been passed on in part to customers through higher room prices, but the profitability of the hotel business model remains under pressure.\n\n#### **Climate crisis**\n\nEnvironmental risks and their impact are becoming increasingly important for the planning and realisation of development projects. One of the greatest challenges for real estate developers is to prevent or minimise the negative effects of their activities on the environment.\n\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energies and the reduction of CO2 emissions are central drivers for UBM's long-term success and, consequently, represent an elementary part of the *green. smart. and more.* corporate strategy. Given the substantial share of worldwide energy-related CO2 emissions, regulations to limit CO2 emissions by the construction and real estate sector can be expected to increase.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nUBM became an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2021. The TCFD recommends the voluntary disclosure of climate-related risks based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The TCFD recommendations for the reporting of climate-related risks were applied for the first time in 2021 and are gradually being implemented. UBM's ESG report provides additional information on this subject.\n\nAn agreement reached in trialogue by the EU Parliament, the Member States and the Commission at the end of 2023 established the most important points of the EU's Building Directive. It deals with the energy efficiency of buildings and the use of renewable energies. Starting in 2030, all new buildings must be built as zero-emissions structures. Climate protection, among others, is also anchored in the EU Taxonomy (e.g. through regulations covering primary energy requirements). That could result in a competitive disadvantage as well as a decline in investor demand for investments that are not classified as sustainable in the sense of the Taxonomy.\n\nThe growing frequency of high temperature periods is also increasing the pressure on energy-intensive equipment for building operations (e.g. cooling systems). Moreover, the CO2 pricing scheme which, for example, was introduced in Austria in October 2022 and is designed to increase annually, will create financial disadvantages for fossil energy carriers. UBM has therefore turned to the carbon-absorbing raw material timber, renewable energies like geothermal power and photovoltaics, and green building certification as part of its *green.* strategy. Intelligent buildings and solutions for efficient building operations are anchored in this strategy with *smart.* \n\nUBM adapted its risk management in 2023 to reflect the relevance of this issue and to fully integrate ESG. The risk catalogue was modified and expanded to include ESG-relevant risks and opportunities. ESG risks are evaluated in line with and integrated in the existing risk measurement system.\n\nThe ESG-relevant individual risks in this catalogue are classified under the following categories:\n\n- Acute physical climate risks (heatwaves, cold spells, storms, drought, heavy rain, flooding, etc.)\n- Chronic physical climate risks (changes in temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.)\n- Non-climate-related environmental risks (impairment of critical infrastructure)\n- Transitory climate risks (GHG taxation, reporting requirements, change in preferences, etc.)\n- Social risks (human error, employee turnover, reputation risk, heat stress)\n- Governance risks (diversity on the Management and Supervisory Boards, legal and compliance risks, etc.)\n\nESG-relevant opportunities include the following:\n\n- Products and services: the development of buildings in timber (hybrid) construction, green buildings\n- Resource efficiency: in the construction and development of buildings with low resource consumption\n- Energy sources: use of renewable and low-emission energy\n- Markets: access to new investor groups; green finance\n- Resilience: development of resilient buildings\n\nAs a pure play developer with a limited portfolio of standing assets, the most relevant risks for UBM are selected chronic physical climate risks, non-climate-related environmental risks, transitory climate risks, social and governance risks.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **8.

An internal valuation team establishes the fair value of properties which are not appraised externally. Discussions concerning the parameters used to determine fair value (Level 3) include the participation of operational project developers, the Management Board and the valuation team.\n\nThe fair values of all properties with a carrying amount over T€1,000 – including the properties held by non-controlling interests which flow into the consolidated financial statements – were established by external appraisers in 2023. These external appraisals covered investment property with a total carrying amount of T€371,416 (2022: T€376,702).\n\nFair value was generally determined by capital earnings methods in 2023 and 2022. The most frequently used method was the term and reversion approach, an internationally recognised real estate valuation technique. The term and reversion approach separates the expected future cash flows into two distinct, independent areas. This separation is necessary for rented properties because the calculations required for the period up to the expiration of the rental agreements in effect on the valuation date – the so-called \"term\" – differ from the calculations for the period after the end of these rental agreements – the so-called \"reversion\" (subsequent rentals).\n\nTerm (contract term): The present value of the net income generated during the contract term is calculated. This present value is not a perpetual yield, but merely a temporary yield which ends with the expiration of the rental agreement.\n\nReversion (adjustment period): The net income for the reversion (market rent beginning with the subsequent rental agreement), including a vacancy period, is capitalised with a normal market interest rate as a perpetual yield. The resulting amount is not discounted separately but included in the selection of the capitalisation rate. Any structural vacancies are reflected in a separate reduction.\n\nThe selection of the capitalisation rate for the term and reversion method reflects current market conditions. In accordance with this estimate, an investor expects a certain return on the respective property. This forms the basis for the selection of an appropriate capitalisation rate for the property in the term and the reversion.\n\nThe selection of the interest rate includes factors like the market potential, vacancy rate and other risks connected with the property.\n\nReal estate under development (assets under construction – IAS 40) was measured according to the residual value method. Under this method, the related income is estimated by the appraisers – provided there has been no pre-letting activity – in consultation with the project developers. The budgeted costs for completion, including an appropriate developer margin, are deducted from this income, and the remainder represents the fair value of the properties under development.\n\nThe following table shows the allocation under the fair value hierarchy, the valuation method and quantitative information for the non-observable inputs used in valuation. The various levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\n- Quoted (non-adjusted prices) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)\n- Input factors that differ from the quoted market prices in Level 1, which are either indirectly observable (i.e. as a price) or directly observable (i.e. derived from the price) (Level 2)\n- Input factors that are based on unobservable market data for the assets or liabilities (Level 3)\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Property type:<br>Investment<br>property | Segment       | Fair

Authorisation of the Management Board to determine the issue price, terms and conditions, the subscription ratio and all other details in agreement with the Supervisory Board (authorised capital 2022). Resolution to amend Section 4 Para. 4 of the Statutes accordingly and authorisation of the Supervisory Board to approve changes to the Statutes resulting from the issue of shares from authorised capital 2022, whereby the subscription right for greenshoe options connected with the issue of shares in exchange for cash contributions is excluded.\n\nResolution concerning a conditional capital increase in accordance with Section 159 Para. 2 (1) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act of up to €5,230,526.00 through the issue of up to 747,218 new ordinary zero par value bearer shares, under the exclusion of subscription rights, for issue to the holders of convertible bonds and determination of the requirements pursuant to Section 160 Para. 2 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. Authorisation of the Management Board to determine the remaining details for the conditional capital increase and its implementation, in particular the details of the issue and conversion procedure for the convertible bonds, the possibility of mandatory conversion, the amount of the issue and the exchange or conversion ratio. Resolutions on the amendment of the Statutes through the addition of a new Para. 5b under Section 4, and authorisation of the Supervisory Board to approve amendments to the Statutes arising from the issue of shares from conditional capital.\n\nResolution in accordance with Section 174 Para. 2 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act authorising the Management Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to issue convertible bonds, also in several tranches, which carry an exchange or subscription right to the purchase of up to 747,218 new bearer shares with a proportional share of up to €5,230,526.00 in share capital. Authorisation of the Management Board to determine all other conditions for the issue and conversion procedure of the convertible bonds as well as the issue amount and the exchange or conversion ratio. The subscription rights of shareholders are excluded. The issue terms can include a provision for mandatory conversion at the end of the term or at another point in time in addition to or in place of a subscription or exchange right. The exchange or subscription right can be serviced by conditional capital or by treasury shares or by a combination of conditional capital and treasury shares. The price of the convertible bonds is to be determined by recognised financial methods through a recognised price-finding procedure.\n\nThe following resolution, among others, was passed at the 142nd Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2023:\n\nResolution a) revoking the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2021 (i) which authorised the Management Board to purchase treasury shares in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1 (4) and (8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and Para. 1a and 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, and (ii) authorisation of the Management Board in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to sell treasury shares; as well as b) a new authorisation of the Management Board to purchase treasury shares in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1 (4) and (8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act and Para. 1a and 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act over the stock exchange or over the counter at an amount equalling up to 10% of share capital, also under the exclusion of the proportional subscription rights of shareholders which can accompany this type of purchase (reverse exclusion of subscription rights); and c) a new authorisation of the Management Board in accordance with Section 65 Para. 1b of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to sell treasury shares in another manner than over the stock exchange or through a public offering and under the exclusion of any general purchase opportunity (exclusion of subscription rights) of shareholders; and d) authorisation of the Management Board to withdraw treasury shares.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **32. Reserves**\n\nThe capital reserves resulted from the capital increases and capital adjustments carried out in previous years as well as timebarred claims to dividends. These reserves include T€98,954 (2022: T€98,954) which are appropriated and may only be released, to the extent free reserves are not available for coverage, to offset an accumulated loss which would otherwise be reported in UBM's annual financial statements.\n\nOther reserves comprise the following: the reserve from the translation of subsidiaries' foreign currency financial statements (currency translation reserve), the reserve for the remeasurement of defined benefit obligations, UBM's retained earnings including the statutory reserve and the untaxed reserves after the deduction of deferred taxes, the retained earnings of subsidiaries since their acquisition and the effects from the adjustment of the annual financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements to the accounting and measurement methods applied to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNo net profit is available for distribution to UBM's shareholders. Voluntary reserves totalling T€37,798 as of 31 December 2023 (2022: T€37,798) can be released in following periods. The total balance of T€9,409 (2022: T€46,054) includes T€2,220 (2022: T€2,178) from the recognition of deferred tax assets, which are blocked from distribution.\n\nDividends totalling €8,219,398, or €1.10 per share, were distributed to UBM's shareholders in 2023 from net profit for the 2022 financial year. No dividend recommendation will be made for the 2023 financial year as there is no distributable net profit.\n\nEquity interests that are not held by UBM or a Group company are reported under non-controlling interests.\n\n# **33. Hybrid bond**\n\nUBM repaid the outstanding €52.9m from the hybrid bond 2018, a deeply subordinated bond, prematurely after five years on 24 February 2023.\n\nOn 18 June 2021, UBM issued a deeply subordinated sustainability-linked bond (hybrid bond) with a total volume of €100m and an annual coupon of 5.50%. The interest rate is tied to a specific ESG rating. The bond had an unlimited term with an early repayment option for the issuer after five years.\n\nThe hybrid bond is classified as an equity instrument because the payments – interest as well as principal – must only be made under certain conditions whose occurrence can be caused or prevented by UBM and the Group can therefore permanently prevent payments. Interest payments, less any tax effects, and profit distributions are recorded directly in equity as a deduction.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **34.

The category \"Other\" includes provisions for impending losses and outstanding obligations from the acquisition of undeveloped land. The provisions for rental guarantees and impending losses are based on estimates for the settlement of claims in one to two years.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Pension plans**\n\n#### **Defined benefit plans**\n\nProvisions for severance compensation were recognised for salaried and wage employees who have claims to severance payments pursuant to the Austrian Salaried Employee Act, the Austrian Wage Employees Severance Payment Act or individual company agreements. Salaried employees whose employment is subject to Austrian law are entitled to severance compensation if employment began prior to 1 January 2003 and has continued for a specific period and, in any event, if the employment relationship is terminated because the employee reaches the statutory retirement age. The amount of the severance payment depends on the remuneration at the time of termination and the length of employment. These employee claims are therefore accounted for as claims under defined benefit pension plans but are not covered by plan assets.\n\nThe provisions for severance payments developed as follows:\n\n| in T€                                                               | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Present value of severance obligations (DBO) as of 1 Jan            | 1,498 | 1,806 |\n| Currency adjustments                                                | 3     | -1    |\n| Current service cost                                                | 52    | 69    |\n| Interest expense                                                    | 39    | 17    |\n| Severance payments                                                  | -287  | -203  |\n| Actuarial gains(-)/losses(+)                                        | -81   | -190  |\n| of which demographic gains/losses                                   |       | 38    |\n| of which financial gains/losses                                     | -41   | -70   |\n| of which gains/losses from experience-based adjustments             | -40   | -158  |\n| Present value of severance obligations (DBO) as of 31 Dec           | 1,224 | 1,498 |\n| in T€                                                               | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Current service cost (entitlements)                                 | 52    | 69    |\n| Interest expense                                                    | 39    | 17    |\n| Severance costs (recognised in profit and loss for the period)      | 91    | 86    |\n| Severance costs (recognised in comprehensive income for the period) | -81   | -190  |\n\nUBM concluded a group insurance contract to finance these severance payment claims.

Financing normally takes place at the individual project level, and each company is responsible for the respective debt service. Various types of security are available to the lenders as collateral for loans and borrowings, which can be drawn on to satisfy any loans or borrowings that are called. The pledges can involve the following collateral:\n\n- Mortgages on properties\n- Pledges of shares in the project company\n- Pledges of rents receivable\n\nThe conditions, type and scope of the securities are agreed individually (for each project company) and are tied to the project volume and the amount and term of the loans and borrowings.\n\nInformation on pledges of investment property is provided in note 20, while information on pledges of real estate inventories is provided in note 24.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **42. Notes on segment reporting**\n\nSegment reporting is based on geographical regions in accordance with the internal organisational structure of the UBM Group. The individual development companies in a segment are combined into groups for the purpose of segment reporting. Each of these groups constitutes a business area for the UBM Group. The reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities involves, in particular, the elimination of intragroup receivables and liabilities.\n\nInternal reporting is based on the IFRS amounts, which are generally adjusted for intragroup sales. UBM generates substantial revenue through the sale of real estate projects as part of its business activities but is not dependent on individual customers.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                  | Germany |          | Austria

Notes to the cash flow statement**\n\nThe cash flow statement reports cash flows classified by operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flow from operating activities is derived according to the indirect method. The components of cash and cash equivalents consist entirely of cash on hand and at banks over which the Group has free disposal and correspond to cash and cash equivalents as reported on the statement of financial position.\n\nCash flow from operating activities includes interest and dividends received as well as interest paid. In contrast, dividends paid are included under cash flow from financing activities.\n\nThe reconciliation of changes in cash flow from financing activities is as follows:\n\n| in T€                           | Financial liabilities | Leasenobligations | Bonds and<br>promissory note loans | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2022       | 376,463               | 21,876            | 446,702                            | 845,041 |\n| Cash flows (cash changes)       | 13,237                | –1,859            | –70,803                            | –59,425 |\n| Non-cash changes                |                       |                   |                                    |         |\n| Sales/Acquisitions of companies | –4,000                | -                 | -                                  | –4,000  |\n| Additions                       | -                     | 2,477             | -                                  | 2,477   |\n| Exchange rate effects           | -                     | 27                | -                                  | 27      |\n| Accrued interest                | -                     | –41               | 167                                | 126     |\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2023       | 385,700               | 22,480            | 376,066                            | 784,246 |\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n| in T€                           | Financial<br>liabilities | Lease<br>obligations | Derivates | Bonds and<br>promissory note loans | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2021       | 277,834                  | 21,774               | -         | 526,498                            | 826,106 |\n| Cash flows (cash changes)       | 98,629                   | -1,855               | -         | -81,103                            | 15,671  |\n| Non-cash changes                |                          |                      |           |                                    |         |\n| Sales/Acquisitions of companies | -                        | -675                 | -         | -                                  | -675    |\n| Additions                       | -                        | 2,642                | -         | -                                  | 2,642   |\n| Exchange rate effects           | -                        | -10                  | -         | -                                  | -10     |\n| Accrued interest                | -                        | -                    | -         | 1,307                              | 1,307   |\n| Balance as of 31 Dec 2022       | 376,463                  | 21,876               | -         | 446,702                            | 845,041 |\n\nThe \"total\" column in the above table represents the total amount of current and non-current financial liabilities\n\n# **45. Notes on financial instruments**\n\n#### **Capital risk management**\n\nThe goal of capital management in the UBM Group is to maximise the return on investments by optimising the ratio of equity and debt.\n\nEquity totalled €379.7m as of 31 December 2023 and was below the level at year-end 2022 (€501.4m). This decline resulted primarily from necessary valuation adjustments to properties. Equity was also reduced by the repayment of the profit participation rights recorded under equity. The dividend of €8.2m was paid on 30 May 2023. The equity ratio equalled 30.3% at the end of December 2023 and remained within the target range of 30–35% (31 December 2022: 34.5%).\n\n#### **Gearing**\n\nThe capital structure is monitored regularly by the Group's risk management.\n\nGearing at year-end 2023 and 2022 is calculated as follows:\n\n| in T€                     | 31.12.2023     | 31.12.2022     |\n|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Debt1                     | 761,766        | 823,165        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | -151,520       | -322,929       |\n| <b>Net debt</b>           | <b>610,246</b> | <b>500,236</b> |\n| <b>Equity</b>             | <b>379,722</b> | <b>501,449</b> |\n| Net debt to equity        | 160.71%        | 99.76%         |\n\n1 Debt is defined as the sum of non-current and current bonds and non-current and current financial liabilities excl. lease obligations\n\nNet debt totalled €610.2m as of 31 December 2023 (2022: €500.2m), which represents an increase of 21.99%.\n\nThe overriding strategic objective is to protect UBM's long-term financing capacity through promissory note loans and bonds.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Goals and methods of financial risk management**\n\nPrimary financial assets consist, above all, of investments in companies accounted for at equity, project financing and other financial assets, and trade receivables. Primary financial liabilities include bonds and other financial liabilities as well as trade payables.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nInterest rate risk is defined as the risk of an increase in interest expense or a reduction in interest income. For UBM, this risk arises almost exclusively from a potential increase in the interest rates on variable interest financial liabilities, especially in the long-term range. The underlying transactions for the interest rate swaps represent the financing for three project companies. All interest rate swaps involve the exchange for variable interest flows for fixed interest flows. As of 31 December 2023, the fair value measurement of these interest rate swaps equalled T€96 (2022: T€-4).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the UBM Group held the following derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk:\n\n| Derivative         | start      | end        | Reference value<br>in T€ (as of<br>31.12.2023) | Fixed interest<br>rate/cap rate<br>in % | Reference<br>interest rate | Market<br>value T€<br>31.12.2023 | Market<br>value T€<br>31.12.2022 |\n|--------------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Interest rate swap | 30.9.2022  | 30.6.2027  | 4,826                                          | 3.15%                                   | 3 month<br>Euribor         | -103                             | -2                               |\n| Interest rate swap | 30.9.2022  | 30.6.2027  | 4,865                                          | 3.15%                                   | 3 month<br>Euribor         | -103                             | -2                               |\n| Interest rate cap  | 30.12.2022 | 30.12.2025 | 42,900                                         | 2.95%                                   | 3 month<br>Euribor         | 303                              | -                                |\n\nAn analysis of the floating interest rate position, which equalled T€-259,330 as of 31 December 2023 (2022: T€-117,824) shows the following sensitivities under scenarios with an increase of 0.01 BP in interest rates. The extent of the increase in interest rates was derived from the average daily change in interest rates for the 3-month and 6-month EURIBOR in 2023. The interest rate range equalled 1 BP based on a probability of 67.00% and 2 BP based on a probability of 99.00%. The simulated impact on the interest rate positions is as follows:\n\n| in T€                          | Interest balance for the year 2024 | Interest balance (p. a.)<br>with straight-line extrapolation from 2025 |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At interest rate rise of 50 BP | 883                                | 1315                                                                   |\n\nThe receivables from project financing are compounded at a rate that reflects the refinancing rate for the UBM Group. A change of 50 BP would increase interest income for 2024 by T€718 (2022: 50 BP, T€904).\n\n#### **Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk represents the risk of losses caused by the default of a business partner who is no longer able to meet contractual payment obligations. It comprises default and country risks as well as any deterioration in the borrowers' credit standing. The credit risk for the real estate business arises from rental obligations. The default of a tenant and the resulting loss of rental payments reduce the present value of the respective real estate project. This risk is taken into account at project level through expert opinions.\n\nThe risk related to receivables from customers can be classified as marginal due to the broad diversification and ongoing credit assessments. With regard to project financing, the following table on page 211 provides information on the related accumulated impairment losses.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe risk of default on the other primary financial instruments reported under assets in the statement of financial position is also considered low because the contract parties are financial institutions and other debtors with excellent credit ratings. The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum risk of default. The identification of default risks on financial assets is reflected in the recognition of appropriate valuation allowances. No such allowances were recorded in 2023.\n\n#### **Foreign exchange risk**\n\nInterest and foreign currency risks are evaluated regularly by risk management. Market analyses and forecasts by well-known financial service providers are analysed and management is informed by regular reports.\n\nThe foreign exchange risk in the UBM Group is treated as transaction-oriented and results from property development financing.\n\nThe foreign currency risks resulting from intragroup financing transactions and/or from loan financing for project companies were simulated as of 31 December 2023 to estimate the possible risks from changes in foreign exchange rates:\n\n| FX position in T€ | Local currency | FX position in local currency<br>in thousands | VAR1 in T€ |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| -68,943           | CZK            | 276,649                                       | 1,452      |\n| -130,268          | PLN            | 122,274                                       | 3,587      |\n\n1 VAR = Value At Risk at a one-sided 99% confidence interval; this corresponds to a standard deviation of 2.3 over a time period of ten days. Any correlations between currency pairs are not included.\n\nThe simulated loss at a probability of 99.00% over a period of ten days equals a maximum of €5m (2022: €7.4m).\n\n### **Hedging of foreign currency risks**\n\nThe UBM Group held currency futures of CZK88.9m as of 31 December 2023 (2022: CZK7.3m) which were concluded to hedge loans financed in CZK.\n\nChanges in the fair value of currency futures led to the recognition of a T€144 loss to the income statement in 2023 (2022: gain of T€6).\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\n| 2023 in T€                                                         | Undiscounted payment flows |         |           |           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                    | Average interest rate      | 2024    | 2025–2028 | from 2029 |\n| Bonds and promissory note loans at fixed<br>interest rates         | 2.58%                      | 18,635  | 516,096   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at variable interest rates | 6.28%                      | 166,611 | 254,736   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at fixed interest rates    | 4.16%                      | 26,935  | 23,545    | -         |\n| Payables to other lenders at fixed interest rates                  | 1.00%                      | -       | -         | 1,196     |\n| Lease obligations at variable interest rates                       | 4.10%                      | 2,763   | 7,942     | 25,226    |\n| Trade payables                                                     | interest-free              | 25,653  | -         | -         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                        | interest-free              | 26,502  | 856       | 548       |\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2022 in T€                                                         | Average interest rate | Undiscounted payment flows |           |           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                    |                       | 2023                       | 2024–2027 | from 2028 |\n| Bonds and promissory note loans at fixed<br>interest rates         | 3.00%                 | 208,767                    | 469,670   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at variable interest rates | 4.14%                 | 139,647                    | 202,332   | -         |\n| Borrowings and overdrafts from banks<br>at fixed interest rates    | 3.93%                 | 1,948                      | 50,480    | -         |\n| Payables to other lenders at fixed interest rates                  | 2.23%                 | 1,163                      | 4,398     | 9,730     |\n| Lease obligations at variable interest rates                       | 3.93%                 | 2,710                      | 7,942     | 24,380    |\n| Trade payables                                                     | interest-free         | 46,947                     | -         | -         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                        | interest-free         | 23,657                     | 895       | 950       |\n\nLiquidity risk represents the risk of being able to access funds at any time to settle existing liabilities. UBM defines precise financial forecasts as a key instrument for managing liquidity risk. These forecasts are prepared by every operating company and consolidated centrally. They are used to determine the requirements for financing and bank credit lines.\n\nCredit financing is primarily related to real estate projects in progress whose development is not at risk from the current point of view.\n\nWorking capital financing is managed by UBM's corporate treasury unit. Companies with surplus funds make these funds available to companies that need liquidity. This reduces the volume of third-party financing and optimises net interest. It also minimises the risk that sufficient liquidity reserves may not be available to settle financial obligations on time.\n\nIn addition to previously contracted project financing, UBM had available credit lines of T€7,000 at its disposal as of 31 December 2023 (2022: T€7,000). Liquidity risk, in total, is therefore considered to be minimal.\n\n### **Other price risks**\n\nThe risk of price changes consists primarily of fluctuations in the market interest rate and market prices as well as changes in exchange rates.\n\nUBM minimises the price risk related to rental income by generally indexing its rental agreements. All other service contracts are also indexed. The remaining price risk for the UBM Group is immaterial.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Carrying amounts, valuation and fair value**\n\n|                                                               |                                     |                                         |                     | Measurement in acc. with IFRS 9                   |                                           |                         |                                    | in T€                                                         | Measurement<br>category<br>(IFRS 9) | Carrying<br>amount as of<br>31 Dec 2022 | (Amortised)<br>cost | Fair value<br>(other<br>comprehen-<br>sive income) | Fair value<br>(through<br>profit or loss) | Fair value<br>hierarchy | Fair value<br>as of<br>31 Dec 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| in T€                                                         | Measurement<br>category<br>(IFRS 9) | Carrying<br>amount as of<br>31 Dec 2023 | (Amortised)<br>cost | Fair value<br>(other<br>comprehen<br>sive income) | Fair value<br>(through<br>profit or loss) | Fair value<br>hierarchy | Fair value<br>as of<br>31 Dec 2023 | Assets                                                        |                                     |                                         |                     |                                                    |                                           |                         |                                    |\n| Assets                                                        |                                     |                                         |                     |                                                   |                                           |                         |                                    | Project financing<br>at variable interest rates               | Amortised<br>Cost                   | 180,885                                 | 180,885             | -

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### **Key audit matters**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n1. Valuation of real estate assets\n\n2. Valuation of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing\n\n#### **1. Valuation of real estate assets**\n\n#### Situation and reference to further information\n\nThe majority of assets of the Group is invested in real estate in the balance sheet items property plant and equipment, investment property, inventories as well as trade receivables. These balance sheet items total a real estate value amounting to approximately €717m, which sums up to 57% of the balance sheet total. The valuations mostly depend on the fair value of the real estate on the reporting date. For investment property according to IAS 40 is used, whereas other assets in accordance with IAS 2 and IAS 16 use the fair value as a comparative amount for necessary adjustments of carrying amounts. Real estate assets, which are presented as contract assets within trade receivables for which revenue is recognised over time according to IFRS 15, are accounted for based on the transaction price and the percentage of completion which is derived from the planning calculation.\n\nDue to the lack of available prices in active markets, the fair value is determined by using valuation methods, particularly the Term and Reversion approach. For real estate under development, in general the residual value method is used. The result of valuation depends to a large degree on estimations of material inputs that affect the value such as interest rates, expected rent and capital flows as well as completion costs and developer profits.\n\nThe risk for the consolidated financial statements is primarily the estimation of future cash flows and interest rates which are influenced by future market and economic developments. The valuation of real estate assets and the resulting gains and losses in the income statement are therefore subject to uncertainty. With respect to the real estate accounted for under IFRS \n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n15, the risk to the consolidated financial statements is essentially that the assumptions and estimates required to determine the stage of completion of the total investment cost are uncertain.\n\n#### *Reference to further information*\n\nInformation on accounting and measurement methods for real estate assets can be found in chapter 4 (accounting and measurement methods) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Chapter 5 (discretionary judgment and major sources of estimation uncertainty) contains information on substantial estimation uncertainty. Furthermore, concerning investments properties and inventories the chapter refers to chapters 20 and 24 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nChapter 20 (investment property) contains a breakdown and movement schedule of investment property divided into asset classes as well as a table with significant inputs for the fair value determination. The section on inventories (24) includes information on carrying amounts of real estate carried at fair value and impairments. Performed appreciations and depreciations are reported in the income statement or in chapter 12 (other operating expenses) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Chapter 25 (Trade receivables) contains information on contract assets and recognised profits set in this context. Inflation and interest rate risks resulting from macroeconomic developments and their effects are explained in section 7. of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Audit response\n\nThe fair value is determined primarily by external appraisers, and partly also by internal valuations. As of 31 December 2023, real estate classified as investment property, inventory and property plant and equipment with a total carrying amount of €440m was valued by external appraisers. In addition, purchase agreements and planning calculations were available for the properties reported under trade receivables amounting to around €35m.\n\nInvestment properties are generally determined by external appraisers when a threshold value is exceeded, whereas real estate classified as inventory and property plant and equipment are externally valuated when there are indicators for impairment. In the course of the audit, we have assessed the appropriateness of the criteria and critically evaluated the selection of external valuation.\n\nWe chose our sample of tested valuations based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, in which we especially paid attention to real estate with material appreciation or depreciation of the fair value. For these properties we performed detailed audit procedures. Other material qualitative criteria were the geographic location and the asset class of the property as well as properties with specific risk and uncertainty factors.\n\nReal estate disposals and the resulting gains and losses were compared to the respective purchase contracts and values according to the latest financial statements. Moreover, purchase contracts containing earn—out clauses or similar were subject to a critical assessment.\n\nFor real estate presented according to IFRS 15 in trade receivables, the existing purchase contracts were verified to substantiate the transaction price. The assumptions with regard to the total investment costs, which are used to measure the stage of completion, were discussed with the management and critically assessed.\n\nFor our sample of tested valuations, our real estate experts performed the following audit procedures:\n\n- Evaluation of the objectivity, independence and expertise of the external appraisers.\n- Evaluation of the used valuation method and assessment whether it is in accordance with internationally accepted standards. For the residual value method of projects under development, we paid particular attention to the applicability of the material assumptions regarding expected development costs and expected real estate utilisation and whether these could be assessed with sufficient certainty and plausibility.\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Critical assessment of the discount rates and their change over time. The discount rates and yields were compared to transactions and valuations of similar asset classes and locations. Within the observed bandwidths, it was assessed whether changes in discount rates were justified due to market conditions or property-specific characteristics and whether they were consistently applied.\n- Our real estate experts tested the plausibility of other material inputs such as rental income, occupancy rates and repair and maintenance costs by comparing them to similar market and experience rates. In addition, the data used was reconciled to underlying data of specific properties, such as, for example, the current lease status or lease payments, this was performed on a sampling basis. In the case of real estate in development, the expected construction costs used in the appraisals were compared to construction costs until completion of comparable objects. The developer profit used for the valuation was assessed through comparison with similar properties.\n- In addition, the expectations, changes and conspicuities with respect to material inputs and the performance of individual properties were discussed with the management and the internal valuation team. These discussions were held both in advance of the assessment and after the assessment results were obtained. We challenged the valuations based on comparable transactions and knowledge of the market. Particular attention was paid to changes that differed from our preliminary expectations.\n\n#### **2. Valuation of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing**\n\nSituation and reference to further information\n\nApart from real estate property in fully consolidated Group companies, the book values of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and therein bound project financing in associated companies and joint ventures form a major part of the Group assets. In total these assets account for about €294m as of 31 December 2023, which amounts to 24% of total assets.\n\nThese are mainly Austrian and foreign real estate project entities, which use the provided funding by UBM for real estate acquisition and investment purposes. The measurement and recoverability of shares in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing are mainly based on the fair value of real estate held by the project entities. Investment property held by companies accounted for under the equity method have to be recorded at fair value and the gains and losses thereof are carried forward in the Group share. Whereas for other real estate classes and project financing, the fair value is used as a comparative amount for the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amount. Real estate assets for which revenue is recognised over time according to IFRS 15 are accounted for based on the transaction price and the percentage of completion which is derived from the planning calculation.\n\nIn the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, the fair value of the properties held in the joint ventures and associated companies is determined. The fair value is determined primarily by means of the discounted cash flow model, in particular through the Term and Reversion method. In general, the residual value method is applied for real estate development.\n\nThe results of the valuations are highly dependent on the estimation of the main inputs influencing the value of interest such as interest rates, expected rental and capital flows, construction costs up to completion and developer profits.\n\nThe risk for the consolidated financial statements is primarily the estimation of the future cash flows and interest rates, which are influenced by future market and economic developments. The valuation of shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing and the resulting gains and losses in the income statement are therefore subject to uncertainty. With respect to the real estate accounted for under IFRS 15, the risk to the consolidated financial statements is essentially that the assumptions and estimates required to determine the stage of completion of the total investment cost are uncertain.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Reference to further information*\n\nChapter 4 (accounting and measurement methods) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides information on the accounting and measurement methods for shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method and project financing. In chapter 21 (investments in companies accounted for at-equity) the carrying values and the comprehensive income originating from associated companies and joint ventures is disclosed as well as further information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the significant entities. Chapters 22 and 44 contain information regarding the carrying values, impairment and their development of project financing. Inflation and interest rate risks resulting from macroeconomic developments and their effects are explained in section 7. of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Audit response\n\nThe fair value of the real estate held in joint ventures and associated companies is determined in the same manner as the valuation of the real estate that is directly held by the group. It is therefore primarily carried out by assigning external appraisers, whereby external valuations are generally carried out when a certain threshold is exceeded or if there are indications for an impairment. In the course of the audit, we examined the appropriateness of the criteria and the actual selection of the external appraisals.\n\nSimilar to the audit procedures performed on real estate held directly by the Group, we selected a sample for the review of the valuations. This sample was selected based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. For this sample, our real estate appraisal specialists carried out auditing procedures similar to the auditing procedures for real estate held directly by the Group. For real estate accounted for under IFRS 15 the existing purchase contracts were verified to substantiate the transaction price. The assumptions with regard to the total investment costs, which are used to measure the stage of completion, were discussed with the management and critically assessed.\n\nIn addition, we have tested the gains and losses resulting from the fair value movement of investment properties and the evaluation of the net equity of the project companies and the resulting impairment and reversal of impairment of shareholdings and project financing by comparison with the carrying amounts.\n\n#### **Other information**\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information.

With the exception of the corporate governance report already available to us, the annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, as soon as it is available, and, in doing so, to consider whether – based on our knowledge obtained in the audit – the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of Management and of Audit Committee for the consolidated financial statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU and with requirements stated in par. 245a UGB, for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n#### **Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n#### **Reports on other and regulatory requirements**\n\n#### **Comments on the Management Report for the Group**\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Group management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether it was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the Group's management report in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and other legal or regulatory requirements.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing for the audit of the Group's management report.\n\n#### Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the group was prepared in accordance with the valid legal requirements and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the thus obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the Group's management report came to our attention.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Additional information in accordance with article 10 of the EU regulation**\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the ordinary general meeting on 19 May 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on 19 May 2023. We are auditors without cease since 2002.\n\nWe confirm that the audit opinion in the section \"Report on the consolidated financial statements\" is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in article 11 of the EU regulation.\n\nWe declare that no prohibited non-audit services (article 5 par. 1 of the EU regulation) were provided by us and that we remained independent of the audited company in conducting the audit.\n\nWe did not perform additional services for the audited company or entities controlled by it that were not disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Responsible Austrian Certified Public Accountant**\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Mr. Markus Trettnak, Certified Public Accountant.\n\nVienna, 2 April 2024\n\n#### **BDO Assurance GmbH**\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\n**Mag.

Gerhard Fremgen** Auditor\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the English translation of this long-form audit report according to Section 273 of the Austrian Company Code (UGB) is presented for the convenience of the reader only and that the German wording is the only legally binding version.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Use of profits\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023 do not report any net profit for 2023 available for distribution.\n\nNo dividend will therefore be paid out to shareholders for the 2023 business year.\n\nVienna, 2 April 2024\n\nThe Management Board\n\nT\n\n**Thomas G.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by words like \"expectation\", \"goal\" or similar terms and expressions. Forward-looking statements on future business performance, by definition, include risks and uncertainties. The forecasts concerning the future development of the company represent estimates which are based on the information available to UBM Development AG at the time the annual report was prepared. If the assumptions underlying these forecasts do not materialise or if unexpected risks occur at an amount not quantified or quantifiable, the actual future (business) development and actual future results can differ from these estimates, assumptions and forecasts.\n\nSignificant factors for these types of deviations can include, for example, changes in the general economic environment or the political, legal and regulatory framework in Austria, the EU and other relevant economic areas as well as changes in the real estate sector. UBM Development AG will not guarantee or assume any liability for the agreement of future (business) development and future results with the estimates and assumptions made in this annual report.
