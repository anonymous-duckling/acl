In addition, there are collaborations with the Hessian Agency for Nature Conservation, Environment and Geology (HLNUG) and Gemeinnützige Umwelthaus GmbH (Umwelt- und Nachbarschaftshaus, UNH) in Kelsterbach to study so-called ultra-fine particulates (UFP). UFP are solid or liquid air-borne particles with a diameter smaller than 100 nm. Unlike conventional, limit-controlled air pollutants, airports have proven to be a major source of UFP. Due to their small size, UFP are classified as potentially harmful to health, however, no reliable database exists to determine a dose-response relationship.\n\nThe HLNUG measurements have shown in the last few years that Frankfurt Airport clearly contributes to the UFP burden. At all UFP measuring sites, the UFP concentration increases when the wind blows from the direction of the airport area during flight operations. Although the UFP concentration decreases exponentially the further away the measuring sites are from the airport, the airport's influence still visibly stands out from the baseline concentration. In January 2023, scientists at the Goethe University Frankfurt in collaboration with the HLNUG published new findings. An analysis of the chemical composition of the measured UFP in Frankfurt-Schwanheim was carried out in this study. The investigations showed that the UFP partly consist of synthetic turbine lubrication oils and therefore the formation of ultra-fine particulates on engines is not limited to the combustion of jet fuel.\n\nFurthermore, in August 2023 the HLNUG published a short report on the measurements completed after two and a half years in the Municipality of Flörsheim located directly to the west of the airport. As already known from the previous UFP reports, the measured particle number concentration at the Flörsheim site is also clearly dependent on the wind direction. If the wind blows from the direction of the airport during flight operations, the particle number concentration clearly increases. Furthermore, the latest evaluations by the HLNUG show that even at night outside of the airport operating times (between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.) an increased particle number concentration resulted in the event of wind from an easterly direction, which points toward further sources of UFP in this direction outside of flight operations. The analyses also showed that short-term peaks in the particle number concentration occurred both at times with overflights over Flörsheim and also at times outside of flight operations and when the Runway Northwest was closed (from December 16, 2020 to May 31, 2021). Therefore, no clear causal connection can be derived between the individual direct overflights over Flörsheim in landing approaches to the Runway Northwest and the concentration peaks.\n\nIn order to gain further knowledge, the Forum Flughafen und Region (Forum Airport and Region, FFR) has taken up the subject area in its work program at the request of the Hessian state government and will carry out a comprehensive study on ultra-fine particulates. A **\"UFP\" working group** has been set up at UNH, in which Fraport AG is also involved. Due to the complexity of the topic and building on the measurement results of the HLNUG and the findings of a previous hearing of experts in August 2019, the FFR has decided to commission the study to assess the exposure of the Rhine-Main region to UFP and its health effects in two main parts: a pollution study and an impact study. The contracting entity of the studies is UNH, which acts as an office of the FFR. The \"SOURCE FFR (Study On Ultrafine particles Frankfurt airport Region) – measurement & modelling\" UFP pollution study commissioned by UNH began in April 2023. The pollution study is being conducted by a consortium under the leadership of the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS). Fraport AG is supporting the study project by conducting the measurements on the airport site and providing a variety of operating and activity data for emissions modeling of sources related to the airport.\n\nThe pollution study is expected to be completed in 2026. The results should form the basis for the impact study on the possible health effects of UFP, to be carried out at a later date. A design to develop an impact study is being developed in parallel to the pollution study. Information regarding the way in which questions concerning the survey and the effect of UFP in the region around the airport will be handled and how the issue will be addressed by the FFR is published on the UNH web pages and can be viewed at https://www.ultrafeinstaub-studie.de/en.\n\nFraport is continuously working to record the air pollutant emissions of all relevant emitters through airport operations at the Frankfurt site on an annual basis in order to achieve a systematic inventory of air pollutant emissions. The selection of the pollutants to be observed depends on their relevance. They are especially important if they are regulated by a threshold value and are recognized in a noticeable amount at Frankfurt Airport. Drawing on an extensive database, potentials for reduction measures can be identified and control procedures can be developed. The data collected also serve as a basis for calculating the airport's proportion of immissions in the surrounding area.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nShareholders\n\n**ombined Management Report**\n\nTo Our Shareholders *Combined Management Report* Consolidated Financials Statements Group Notes Further Information\n\nes Further Informa\n\nAs an airport operator, Fraport can only indirectly influence emissions from aircraft. In order to motivate airlines to use low-emission aircraft, Fraport collects airport charges on nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon at the Frankfurt site. Airlines pay the **emissionsbased fee** per kilogram of nitrogen oxide equivalent emitted by an aircraft during takeoff and landing (\"landing and take-off cycle\", LTO). Charges are levied per landing and per takeoff. The necessary information on aircraft and engine types is determined by way of a recognized fleet database.\n\nAircraft turbines mainly emit carbon dioxide (about 7%) and water vapor (approximately 3%) in addition to mixed air (about 90%). The additional resulting pollutants of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons, and soot account for less than one percent overall. The emission spectrum of aircraft turbines corresponds to that of road traffic. Fraport publishes the quantities of these pollutants emitted by the aircraft at the Frankfurt site in its annual environmental statement.\n\nIn addition to flight operations, air pollutants at airports also arise from the apron and vehicle traffic as well as the operation of heaters run on oil or gas. As a way of reducing pollutants, Fraport has gradually upgraded its fleet of vehicles at Frankfurt Airport to include low-emission and electric motors. Currently, around 570 vehicles (previous year: 540) of the Fraport vehicles in Ground Services at Frankfurt Airport already have electric engines. This corresponds to approximately 27% of the vehicles (previous year: around 27%). By 2026, a further 600 passenger cars, small vans, buses, and specific ground handling vehicles with electric transmission will be put into operation.\n\nThe international Group airports follow the respective requirements in their national laws. Air quality is also monitored at the Greek regional airports Thessaloniki, Corfu, and Rhodes.\n\n*Performance indicator –* Fraport strives to extensively measure the air pollutant emissions by material sources. A key performance indicator in the strict sense is not defined in the air quality category.\n\n# **Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation**\n\n### **Background Information**\n\nAs part of the European Green Deal to achieve climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050, the EU Taxonomy Regulation was adopted as an instrument for classifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is a key element of the European Commission's action plan to redirect capital toward a more sustainable economy. Through the Regulation, pre-defined economic activities are uniformly assessed with regard to their contribution to the European Commission's six environmental objectives – climate change mitigation (CCM), climate change adaptation (CCA), water (WTR), circular economy (CE), pollution prevention and control (PPC), and biodiversity (BIO) – with the aim of achieving better comparability of companies.\n\nThis section presents the share of Group revenue, capital expenditure (Capex), and operating expenditure (Opex) for the 2023 reporting period related to the six environmental objectives of the European Commission that are taxonomy-eligible or taxonomyaligned in accordance with Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and Article 10 (2) of the delegated act. At Fraport the taxonomyeligible or taxonomy-aligned economic activities contribute to the environmental objectives **climate change mitigation** and **the transition to a circular economy**.\n\n#### **Definitions**\n\nA **taxonomy-eligible** economic activity means an economic activity that is described in the current delegated acts on the six environmental objectives, irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid out in those delegated acts. Conversely, all economic activities not described in the delegated acts are considered as taxonomy non-eligible.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nA **taxonomy-aligned** economic activity means a taxonomy-eligible economic activity that meets the following requirements:\n\n- The economic activity contributes clearly to one or more of the environmental objectives.\n- It does not significantly harm any of the other environmental objectives (DNSH).\n- It is performed in keeping with the minimum safeguards.\n\n### **Revenue KPI**\n\nThe share of **taxonomy-eligible Group revenue** was calculated as the portion of the net revenue from products and services related to taxonomy-eligible economic activities (numerator), divided by net revenue (denominator; the denominator corresponds to the Group revenue; see also Group Notes, note 5).\n\nFraport generates revenue from products and services associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the area of renting. This concerns the activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". Revenue from the renting of buildings is mainly reflected in the revenue in the Retail & Real Estate and International Activities & Services segments. Furthermore, Fraport obtains taxonomy-eligible revenue by providing the passenger transport system. This comes under the economic activity 6.3 \"Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\". The related costs are passed on to airlines within the airport charges of the Aviation segment. To determine the taxonomy-eligible portion, a distribution formula was applied based on the cost basis to ensure appropriate allocation to the charges. The economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" was newly introduced into the Regulation by the European Commission in 2023. Fraport obtains taxonomy-eligible revenue here, both at the Frankfurt site and at foreign airports.\n\nRevenue in connection with the renting of buildings are taxonomy-aligned at the Greek Group airports at Fraport Greece in eight terminals. With their environmental certificates for the relevant buildings, these meet the technical screening criteria. The buildings rented there belong to the best 15% of national Greek buildings in terms of energy efficiency and can therefore be classified as taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned revenue of the passenger transport system increased to €37.09 million, mainly contingent on the higher passenger volume (previous year: €25.10 million). In addition, taxonomy-aligned revenue from rental income at Fraport Greece of €58.15 million is recognized for the first time (previous year: €0.0 million).\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible revenue described in the following does not contain any taxonomy-aligned portions. With regard to the renting of buildings, an increase in the taxonomy-eligible revenue to €650.08 million is recorded (previous year: €605.40 million). In the reporting year, new taxonomy-eligible revenue from the economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" of €752.54 million were added. Frankfurt had the substantial portion with €656.62 million, followed by Lima with €59.39 million.\n\n#### **Capital expenditure (Capex) KPI**\n\nThe Capex KPI, which indicates the proportion of **taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure**, is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure eligible under the EU Taxonomy Regulation (numerator) divided by the total capital expenditure (denominator).\n\nTotal capital expenditure includes additions to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets during the fiscal year. This includes the additions to property, plant, and equipment (IAS 16), intangible assets (IAS 38), rights of use (IFRS 16), and investment property (IAS 40; see also section \"Additions to non-current assets\" and Group Notes, note 20).\n\nAt Fraport the numerator consists of the following categories for taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure:\n\n• Capital expenditure relating to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities (letter a) of Annex I to the delegated act pursuant to Article 8) plus\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n- \n- Capital expenditure relating to individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions (letter c) of Annex I to the delegated act pursuant to Article 8)\n\nCapital expenditure related to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities (letter a) are to be allocated in particular to the economic activity 6.3 \"Local and urban passenger transport, passenger road transport\". Given that the economic activity and the operation of the passenger transport system cannot be carried out without the corresponding rail infrastructure or stations, Fraport considers the related capital expenditure to be connected with the economic activity 6.3. The economic activity 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\" was newly included in the Regulation by the EU Commission in 2023.\n\nIn total, the following **taxonomy-eligible** economic activities were identified in the Fraport Group in the **climate change mitigation** environmental objective:\n\n- 4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n- 6.3 Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\n- 6.17 Low carbon airport infrastructure\n- 7.1 Construction of new buildings\n- 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings\n- 7.3 Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficiency equipment\n- 7.4 Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\n- 7.5 Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\n- 6.20 Air transport ground handling operations\n\nFor the environmental objective **transition to a circular economy,** the following **taxonomy-eligible** economic activities were identified:\n\n• 3.4 Maintenance of roads and motorways\n\nIn order to avoid double counting when calculating the Capex ratio, economic activities were allocated either the letter a) or c).\n\nAfter examining the technical screening criteria, DNSH criteria, and minimum protection requirements, **taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure** remains under the following economic activities:\n\n- 4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n- 6.3 Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\n- 6.17 Low carbon airport infrastructure\n- 7.4 Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\n- 7.5 Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\n\nAll taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned additions are to be attributed to investments in infrastructure and terminal buildings. The taxonomy-aligned additions for the passenger transport system fell slightly compared to the previous year to €97.71 million (previous year: €103.10 million). Another taxonomy-aligned addition concerns economic activity 7.5 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices\" with €27.51 million (previous year: €39.22 million). This includes, for example, the installation of facades with a solar control function and the technical centers in Terminal 3.\n\nThe additions described in the following do not contain any taxonomy-aligned portions. A substantial taxonomy-eligible addition to economic activity 7.1 \"Construction of new buildings\" of €396.31 million also comes from Lima with the construction of the new passenger terminal. A total of €928.59 million arose here (previous year: €623.14 million). The construction of Terminal 3 in Frankfurt contributed to this with a volume of €491.70 million. The new economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" shows taxonomy-eligible additions of €38.06 million, a large portion of which relates to the baggage transfer system in Terminal 3. The economic activity 7.2 contributes €35.33 million to the taxonomy-eligible Capex.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Operating expenditure (Opex) KPI**\n\nTo determine the ratio of operating expenditure (Opex KPI), the **taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure** (numerator) according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation is set in relation to the operating expenditure (denominator).\n\nThe operating expenditure in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation includes direct non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leasing, and maintenance and repair. Any other direct expenditure relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant, and equipment by the undertaking or third parties is also included here.\n\nThus, the definition of operating expenditure in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation clearly differs from the definition of operating expenses used in the rest of the combined management report (see chapter \"Glossary\"). For example, no expenses for utility services, such as energy expenditure, are included in the definition according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The ratio for operating expenditure (denominator) is calculated in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation based on the income statement and mainly includes maintenance expenses and other operating expenditure for rents and leasing. The taxonomy-eligible share in fiscal year 2023 results from maintenance expenses for the passenger transport system as well as maintenance expenses for rented buildings. The maintenance expenses for rented buildings are determined using a formula, which should guarantee an appropriate distribution involving the segment results. As with revenue, in 2023 the economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" is added, and the expenses related to this concern, in particular, maintaining the baggage transfer system. A formula was applied here, which guarantees an appropriate distribution of maintenance expenses based on the segment distribution. The economic activity 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\" is also new; a component of this is the maintenance of the runways.\n\nIn the same way as the revenue, the maintenance expenses for the passenger transport system are **taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure**. The maintenance expenses at the Greece site for the buildings that belong to the top 15% of national buildings with regard to energy efficiency are also aligned.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned Opex consists of the economic activity 6.3 \"Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\" with the maintenance of the passenger transport system of €9.15 million (previous year: €7.10 million), and the economic activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" with the aligned portion at Fraport Greece of €5.95 million.\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible amounts described in the following section do not contain any taxonomy-aligned portions. A taxonomyeligible amount of €11.03 million resulted from the new economic activity 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\"; this includes, for example, the renovation of Runway Northwest at the Frankfurt site. In addition, the economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" contributes a total of €9.67 million. The expenses are determined using a formula as described above. The economic activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" contributes €33.20 million (previous year: €28.40 million), a significant part comes from Fraport AG with a total amount of €19.85 million.\n\n#### **Assessment of Taxonomy Alignment**\n\n#### **Substantial contribution to the climate protection environmental objective**\n\nThe following explains the extent to which the economic activities mentioned meet the criteria for the substantial contribution.\n\n- The **photovoltaic installation** belongs to the economic activity 4.1 \"Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\", as the installation is freestanding at Runway West at the Frankfurt site, and in contrast to 7.6 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficiency equipment\" is not connected to an existing building.\n- The **passenger transport system** comes under the economic activity 6.3 \"Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\". The substantial contribution is met by criterion (a), as the passenger transport system does not cause any direct CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. The same applies to investments in the passenger transport system in connection with the expansion of Terminal 3.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n- \n- Under economic activity 6.17 \"Low carbon airport infrastructure\", supplying aircraft with ground power falls under (b) **400 Hz installations**. Because ground power supply and preconditioned air supply are usually provided by two different facilities, Fraport assigns the facilities that serve ground power supply, such as 400 Hz installations, to economic activity 6.17.\n- The **charging stations** for the expansion of electromobility come under economic activity 7.4 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\". As the substantial contribution is defined by the \"Installation, maintenance, or repair of charging stations for electric vehicles\", it is seen to have been met here.\n- The exchange and **modernization of technical centers** (mainly in the existing Terminals 1 and 2 in Frankfurt) comes under the economic activity 7.5 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\". The substantial contribution is met by individual measure (b) \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of building automation and control systems, building energy management systems (BEMS), lighting control systems and energy management systems (EMS)\". The installation of smart meters also falls under economic activity 7.5 under (c) and the installation of facade and roofing elements with a solar shading or solar control function under (d).\n- The **operation of the eight terminal buildings** of Fraport Greece comes under the economic activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". The substantial contribution is met as the terminal buildings under consideration count toward the top 15% of the national buildings in Greece in their energy efficiency classes.\n\nThe substantial contribution could not be proven for the taxonomy-eligible economic activities 7.1 \"Construction of new buildings\" and 7.2 \"Renovation of existing buildings\". For the economic activities 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" and 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\", which were newly added to the Regulation, only the taxonomy eligibility must be checked in this year due to a relief provision.\n\n#### **No significant harm to the other environmental objectives – DNSH criteria**\n\nAvoiding significant harm to the environmental objective 2) **Climate change adaptation** is taken into consideration for all relevant economic activities through a climate risk and vulnerability assessment in accordance with Appendix A of Annex I on climate protection, in which the criteria for and scope of this type of analysis are defined. Various chronic and acute climate risks, which must be assessed for the sites where taxonomy-eligible activities are performed, are also specified.\n\nIn order to assess the climate risks, these were first checked with regard to the possibility of their occurrence. For the remaining risks, Fraport relies on the Munich Re \"Location Risk Intelligence Platform\". The platform analyzes a site or portfolio with regard to various climate risks. In this year, the potentially taxonomy-aligned economic activities are limited to Fraport AG and Fraport Greece, therefore the assessment is concentrated on these two sites. In order to illustrate the possible effects of climate change, the various climate projection scenarios (RCP scenarios) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 were assessed for the projection years 2030, 2050, and 2100. These are necessary for economic activities with a lifetime of over ten years. As the best and worst case scenario is covered by scenarios 2.6 and 8.5, and the remaining RCP scenarios lie within their bandwidth, they were not explicitly reanalyzed. For every risk identified, a risk assessment was made in the form of a score on the basis of the underlying scenarios. The overall risk score is divided into four levels from low to extreme. The report shows that the overall climate risk for the Frankfurt site is at level 2 in the \"medium range\". This means that no climate risk was identified for the Frankfurt site that would clearly affect taxonomy-compliant economic activities. For Fraport Greece the overall climate risk for the sites is at level 3 to 4, in the high to extreme range.\n\nIn the current version of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, it has not been defined how often the analysis needs to be updated. No annual update is carried out as time periods up to 2100 are covered in the projection scenarios. If extraordinary circumstances or substantial innovations should occur, an ad-hoc update will be executed. Irrespective of the updating of the assessment, the contents of the analyses are revised in every set of annual financial statements, for example to add new aligned economic activities and adaptation measures.\n\nThe criteria for determining whether the environmental objectives 3) **Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources** and 6) **Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems,** are impacted are particularly relevant for the photovoltaic and 400 Hz installations. The criteria primarily reference environmental impact assessments or comparable assessments that have already been examined as a prerequisite for obtaining permits for the construction and operation of the facilities. No further measures were therefore required for compliance.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe criteria for environmental objective 4) **Transition to a circular economy** are also relevant in the context of the passenger transport system in addition to the photovoltaic and 400 Hz installations. Fraport AG is already obliged to comply with the criteria under the regulations of European and German waste legislation, in particular Section 6 of the German Waste Management Act and the associated waste hierarchy. Furthermore, environmental objective 5) **Pollution prevention and control** is also relevant for the passenger transport system and the 400 Hz installations. The criteria are insubstantial for the passenger transport system as this exclusively relates to class M road vehicles. The passenger transport system does not fall under class M. Fraport is already obliged to comply with the criteria for the 400 Hz installations by German legislation, such as the Noise and Vibration Occupational Health and Safety Regulation and other general occupational health and safety ordinances.\n\nFor the economic activities under 7.4 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\", 7.5 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\" and 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\", no DNSH criteria are defined for the other environmental objectives 3) to 6).\n\n#### **Fulfillment of minimum protection measures**\n\nAs part of the minimum protection, various requirements are made regarding the implementation of procedures, which are based, among other things, on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as well as other regulatory initiatives. The fulfillment of the required minimum protection is a prerequisite for classifying an economic activity as ecologically sustainable and thus taxonomy-aligned. To implement and ensure minimum protection, Fraport has aligned itself with the Final Report on Minimum Safeguards from the Platform on Sustainable Finance of October 11, 2022. The main focus of this report was on human rights, corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition.\n\nIn assessing compliance with the minimum protection, we evaluated whether adequate processes were implemented for each of the above topics to avoid negative impacts. Furthermore, the results of the respective measures taken are examined on an ongoing basis to determine whether the measures taken are effective in preventing negative impacts.\n\nFor the measures that Fraport has implemented in the thematic fields of human rights, and corruption and bribery, reference is made to explanations within this non-financial statement under \"Business model-specific consideration of the supply chain and procurement\", \"Respect for human rights\", and \"Tackling corruption and bribery\".\n\nIn the thematic field of \"Taxation\", Fraport is subject to the country-specific tax laws and regulations, the implementation of and compliance with which is monitored and ensured by the Tax department and external and internal audits. Regular compliance risk analyses and employee training are carried out in the areas of antitrust and competition law.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Templates turnover**\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            |                     |                                               | Substantial contribution criteria<br>Substantial contribution criteria |                                                                    |                                          |                          |                                  |                                     |              |  |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|--|--|\n| Economic activities<br>Economic activities                                                                                                                                                                                     | Code(s)    | Code(s)<br>Turnover | Turnover<br>Proportion<br>of turnover<br>2023 | Proportion<br>Climate<br>of turnover<br>change<br>mitigation<br>2023   | Climate<br>Climate<br>change<br>change<br>mitigation<br>adaptation | Climate<br>Water<br>change<br>adaptation | Water<br>Pollution       | Pollution<br>Circular<br>Economy | Biodiversity<br>Circular<br>Economy | Biodiversity |  |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            |                     |                                               |                                                                        |                                                                    |                                          |                          |                                  |                                     |              |  |  |\n| (1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | (1)<br>(2) | (2)<br>(3)          | (3)<br>(4)                                    | (4)<br>(5)                                                             | (5)<br>(6)                                                         | (6)<br>(7)                               | (7)<br>(8)               | (8)<br>(9)                       | (9)<br>(10)                         | (10)         |  |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            | € mil.              | € mil.<br>%                                   | Y; N; N/EL<br>%                                                        | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL                                           | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL                 | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL         | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL            | Y; N; N/EL   |  |  |\n| A.

The most important financial performance indicators used for managing Fraport AG and other important financial and non-financial key figures are described in the \"Control System\" section. The development of the non-financial key figures is reported in the \"Control System\", \"Employees\", \"Non-financial performance indicators\", and \"Combined Non-Financial Statement\" sections.\n\nThe explanatory notes below are based on the annual financial statements of Fraport AG, drawn up in accordance with the German Commercial Code (\"HGB\") and the German Stock Corporation Act (\"AktG\"). This results in differences in accounting policies compared to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, mainly related to non-current assets and provisions.\n\n# **Economic development of Fraport AG**\n\n#### **Results of operations**\n\nFor the explanatory notes on changes in the results of operations, please refer to the presentation of the Aviation, Retail & Real Estate and Ground Handling segments, which essentially covers the business activities of Fraport AG (see \"Results of operations by segment\").\n\nCompared to the previous year, **revenue** of Fraport AG increased by €536.9 million to €2,313.1 million. The increase mainly results from higher revenue from airport charges (+€196.0 million) as well as higher revenue from infrastructure charges (+€76.4 million) and ground services (+€57.6 million) based on traffic volumes and prices. Retail and parking revenue also increased by €51.8 million based on traffic volume. Due to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved for the first time in the reporting period. With the take-over of the management of the aviation security checks, its operational execution it is no longer carried out by Fraport AG but by security firms engaged by Fraport AG. Based on this, revenue from security services achieved until that time is no longer generated (previous year: €69.4 million).\n\nAs in previous years, Fraport AG earned a major portion of its revenue (more than one third) in the past fiscal year with one customer at the Frankfurt site.\n\n**Other operating income** of €57.2 million is almost unchanged compared to the previous year (€58.7 million) In the current fiscal year, this includes in particular income from foreign currency translations (€35.8 million). In the previous year, this related in particular to income from the release of provisions (€33.5 million).\n\n**Total revenue** rose by €543.9 million to €2,407.6 million (+29.2%).\n\n**Personnel expenses** increased in the 2023 fiscal year by €16.2 million to €589.5 million. The increase resulted mainly from the collective bargaining agreements concluded in the current fiscal year. The lower number of employees compared to the previous year had an opposing effect.\n\n**Non-staff costs** (cost of materials and other operating expenses) increased by €268.7 million to €1,168.7 million. The increase is due in particular to increased expenses for external services, primarily in connection with taking over the management of aviation security checks (+€188.3 million). In addition, the purchase of external services increased by €83.9 million in the fiscal year mainly due to traffic and prices.\n\nAt €649.4 million in the fiscal year, the **EBITDA** of Fraport AG was €259.0 million above the level in the same period of the previous year. After depreciation and amortization of €333.4 million, **EBIT** amounted to €316.0 million (previous year: €82.0 million).\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\nbined Management Report\n\n# **Other matter – use of the Auditor's Report**\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report as well as with the audited ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report converted into the ESEF format – including the versions to be submitted for inclusion in the Company Register – are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take their place.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have deemed necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial reporting that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent non-financial reporting) or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon contain wording and terminology that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted thereon in the section \"Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial reporting. They are responsible for the justifiability of this interpretation. The legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently.\n\nThe preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the non-financial reporting is subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as from assumptions made.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Independence and Quality Assurance of the German Public Audit Firm**\n\nWe have observed German professional regulations regarding independence as well as further professional rules of conduct.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national statutory rules and professional announcements particularly of the \"Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors\" (BS WP/vBP) and of the quality management standards promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) and therefore maintains a comprehensive quality management system comprising documented regulations and measures in respect of compliance with professional rules of conduct, professional standards, as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n# **Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the non-financial reporting based on our work performed within our limited assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\", issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention to cause us to believe that the non-financial reporting – with the exception of the remuneration report referenced and of external sources of documentation and any websites mentioned therein, including their contents – has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section \"Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial reporting.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner's professional judgement.\n\nWithin the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which was mainly performed from October 2023 to March 2024, we conducted, amongst others, the following procedures and other activities:\n\n- Gaining an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organisation and stakeholder engagement,\n- Interviews with relevant employees involved in the preparation process on the preparation process including precautions and measures taken to prepare the non-financial reporting as well as regarding the disclosures included in the nonfinancial reporting,\n- Identification of probable risks of material misstatements in the non-financial reporting,\n- Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the non-financial reporting,\n- Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and combined management report,\n- Evaluation of the presentation of the non-financial reporting,\n- Evaluation of the process used to identify taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and of the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial reporting.\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. The legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently.\n\n# **Practitioner's conclusion**\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial reporting for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 does not comply, in all material respects, with Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the executive directors' interpretation presented in the section \"Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial reporting.\n\nOur assurance engagement did neither cover the remuneration report referenced in the non-financial reporting, nor did it not cover the external sources of documentation and websites including their content referenced in the non-financial reporting.\n\n# **Restriction of Use**\n\nWe issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company (including the \"General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüfer und Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]\" dated 1 January 2017 of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, this report is not intended to be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision.\n\nWe are solely responsible to the Company. However, we do not accept or assume liability to third parties. Our conclusion is not modified in this respect.\n\nFrankfurt/ Germany 12 March 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nSigned: Signed: Kirsten Gräbner-Vogel Daniel Oehlmann

Fraport Group EBITDA exceeded the 2019 figure for the first time in the 3rd quarter, despite lower passenger volume at the Frankfurt site. With growth rates above the 2019 level, Fraport Greece remained at the top of the Group sites. The number of passengers in Antalya was also above the pre-crisis sommerreisewelle level.\n\n*Online version:*  [wwww.annual-report.fraport.com](http://www.annual-report.fraport.com)\n\n# 1st QUARTER\n\n- Positive traffic development\n- Two strike days in Frankfurt only slightly dampened development\n- Intensive preparations for the summer travel wave\n\n## *Lima Airport: Takeover of apron control*  with German Air Traffic Control\n\nThe operation of apron control at Lima Airport was awarded to the subsidiary of Deutsche Flugsicherung DFS Aviation Services (DFS). Following the commissioning of the new terminal at the end of 2024, apron control will be managed using state-of-the-art camera technology for the first time in South America. This is an important milestone on the way to turning the Peruvian capital´s airport into one of the most modern hubs on the continent.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/14 description: The image shows an airport control tower. The tower is tall and cylindrical, with a large, glass-enclosed control room at the top. The control room has a green frame and is surrounded by a metal railing. The tower is located on an airport runway, and there are several buildings in the background. The sky is a light orange color, suggesting that the photo was taken at sunset or sunrise. The image is framed in a circle with a light purple background.\n\n2nd QUARTER\n\n# *Further Power Purchase Agreement concluded*\n\nA new Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the European energy provider Centrica Energy Trading A/S supplies the Frankfurt Airport hub with additional wind energy. The contract provides for the supply of a total annual wind power volume of around 63 gigawatt hours. This corresponds to an output of 22 megawatts. The energy comes from newly constructed onshore turbines near Bremerhaven. From July, four wind turbines will be operating there just for Fraport´s needs. The contract is set initially for five years.\n\n# New baggage drop-off machines *in Terminal 1*\n\nLufthansa Group passengers in Frankfurt can now use 21 state-of-the-art check-in counters inside the Terminal 1. With the automated bag drop function passengers can check in their baggage themselves. The new check-in counters provide passengers with a comfortable, modern and efficient travel experience. The use of state-of-theart technology optimizes the processes during baggage check-in.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/20 description: The photograph shows a building under construction. The building has multiple floors and large windows. The exterior of the building is made of concrete and steel. There is construction equipment visible in the foreground. The sky is blue and clear.\n\n# *Half-time for airport expansion in Antalya*\n\nTogether with the joint venture partner TAV, Fraport is expanding the terminal areas at Antalya Airport with the long-term goal to double capacity. In addition the apron areas are being expanded and new parking spaces for several thousand vehicles are created. At the beginning of 2025, Fraport will take the first construction phase into operation.\n\n4th QUARTER\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/1 description: The image shows a close-up of a document with some text and a green check mark. The text is blurry and difficult to read, but it appears to be some kind of form or survey. The check mark is next to one of the options, indicating that it has been selected.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/2 description: The image shows an airport security checkpoint with several people in line. There are two women and one man in the foreground. The woman on the left is wearing a black jacket and standing behind a counter. The woman in the middle is wearing a gray shirt and blue jeans. The man on the right is wearing a black shirt and blue jeans. The security checkpoint has a white counter and a gray floor. The ceiling is white and has several lights.\n\n# *Takeover of aviation security*\n\nAt the turn of the year, Fraport took over control of the management of the aviation security checks at Frankfurt Airport. In addition to the takeover of the existing infrastructure of the Federal Police new control infrastructure was procured at the same time. This includes new CT scanners, which facilitate and speed up the passenger process.\n\n# *Rethinking the world of work*  at Fraport: Start for HRneo\n\nHRneo is the largest development program in Human resources in recent years. Its aim is to modernize the HR department and further increase Fraport´s attractiveness as an employer.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/7 description: The image shows five figures. The first figure is wearing a yellow vest and headphones and holding two orange batons. The second figure is standing behind a desk with a computer monitor on it. The third figure is standing. The fourth figure is wearing a yellow vest and holding a black briefcase. The fifth figure is wearing a baseball cap.\n\n- Start of the summer travel wave\n- For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic again more than 200,000 passengers in one day in Frankfurt\n- Regular operations in the first half of the year\n- Greek airports still clearly above traffic volume of 2019\n\n## *Second runway in Lima opened*\n\nWith the take-off of the first commercial flight on April 3, the new runway at Lima´s international airport \"Jorge Chávez\" International Airport in Lima and the new airport control tower were inaugurated. This makes Fraport´s airport the first in Peru to have two runways. The utilization of the new runway and the tower will be successively increased until they are fully operational with the completion of the new Terminal at the end of 2024.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/14 description: In a medium shot, a man in a neon yellow vest is standing on a tarmac, watching a Star Peru airplane take off. The man is facing away from the camera, and his head is turned to the right, as if he is watching the plane. The plane is white with red and blue accents, and it is taking off from a runway. The background is a clear blue sky.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/15 description: In the image, a man and a woman are at an airport, checking in their luggage. The man is wearing a pink shirt and black pants, and he is putting his black suitcase on the conveyor belt. The woman is wearing a blue jacket and a long skirt, and she is putting her black suitcase on the conveyor belt as well. There are signs above the conveyor belts that say \"Lufthansa\".\n\n# 3rd QUARTER • Sustained high passenger demand\n\n- \n- Frankfurt at 82 percent of pre-crisis level\n- Thanks to the use of additional CT scanners improved waiting times for security\n- Antalya exceeds the 2019 level\n\n- Traffic volume in Frankfurt at around 14 million and thus only ten percent below pre-crisis level\n- International airports partly above pre-crisis level\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/23 description: An indoor shot shows a large American flag hanging in an airport. The airport has a high ceiling with gold-colored beams and a wall of windows.

This also includes the procurement of the checkpoint infrastructure as well as testing new technology and optimizing processes in cooperation with the German Federal Police.\n\nAlso since the beginning of the year, state-of-the-art computer tomography scanners (CT scanners) have been in use at selected aviation security lanes. More of these devices are gradually being put into operation. For passengers, the process of going through the security checkpoint will be considerably simplified. At the new security checkpoints, liquids, smartphones and other electronic devices can remain in hand luggage. In addition, different materials and objects are reliably and quickly differentiated. This efficient technology significantly reduces waiting times at the checkpoints. Successes were already evident during the summer travel wave, with over 200,000 passengers per day.\n\nAn dieser neuen Kontrollspur können Sie\nalle elektronischen Geräte und Flüssigkeiten\nim Gepäck lassen.\n\nAt this new control lane you can leave all\nelectronic devices and liquids in your luggage.\n\n# *To Our Shareholders*\n\n- *07* [Letter from the CEO](#page-6-0)\n- *10* [The Fraport Executive Board](#page-9-0)\n- *12* [Report of the Supervisory Board](#page-11-0)\n- *19* [Joint Statement on Corporate](#page-18-0)  Governance\n- *34* [Share and Investor Relations](#page-33-0)\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>Fraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\n# *Letter from the CEO*\n\n*Letter from the CEO*\n\nDear Marcelobos,\n\nI am pleased to present our Annual Report for 2023.\n\nA challenging yet good fiscal year lies behind us.

With **ReFuelEU Aviation**, the European Union has adopted a new legal act that will make the European aviation market \"cleaner\" in the long term. The core concept of ReFuelEU Aviation is to enforce binding minimum thresholds for the use of sustainable aviation fuels, which will gradually increase from 2025 onwards.\n\nAt company level, we have rolled out our **decarbonization master plan** to our significant, fully consolidated company sites and have now created a Group-wide program of measures to achieve carbon freedom by 2045. In Frankfurt, I am delighted to report that you will see another \"visible\" sign of our sustainability activities by the end of the year: Runway West will have a 2.8-kilometerlong photovoltaic system running along it, which we submitted an application to build last year.\n\nYour company is celebrating another special event this year too: **100 years of air transport in Frankfurt**. Starting out as Südwestdeutsche Luftverkehrs-AG at the \"airfield\" in Rebstock, the Fraport you know today has grown into one of the world's leading international air traffic groups. You can track this evolution in our new photo book \"100 Jahre Flughafen-Geschichte in Frankfurt\" (100 Years of Airport History in Frankfurt), which was published at the start of the year. It is precisely this DNA that makes us unique and that we need more than ever today: \"develop together,\" \"don't stand still,\" or simply \"shape the future together.\" With our strategy **Fraport.2030**, we are rising to our challenges and focusing our responses on the strategic priorities of \"growth and sustainability,\" \"efficiency and innovation,\" and \"employer of choice\" – with the firm conviction that we will only achieve success in these areas if we work together. We believe that the various changes and challenges we are facing – take for example the catchwords **demographic change** and **artificial intelligence** – also offer exciting opportunities that we want to actively seize for the benefit of your company.\n\nWe are in a good position to achieve this: With the projects we have initiated such as Terminal 3, the modernization of Terminals 1 and 2 in Frankfurt, a multitude of development projects outside Germany, and **HRneo**, not to mention numerous innovation projects, we believe that we have taken the right steps to position your company successfully in the competitive market. Our new slogan **\"Connecting the world with tomorrow\"** clearly expresses our corporate mission: Fraport creates connections. We connect passengers and business models, we foster Group-wide and therefore international collaboration within our workforce, and we consistently focus on the future.\n\nThanks to this strategically attractive setup, the expected traffic growth, the projects being implemented, and the great dedication of our employees, we are confident that we will achieve the financial targets we have set with **Fraport.2030** too: **EBITDA of 2 billion Euros** and **free cash flow** of *Fraport creates connections.* **1 billion Euros in 2030**.\n\nWe are already taking steps in this direction in the current year: With EBITDA of between approximately 1.26 and 1.36 billion Euros, we expect to achieve a new **record result**. The Group result is also set to rise strongly to around 435 to 530 million Euros. In operational terms, we predict that Frankfurt will see passenger numbers grow to between around 61 and 65 million passengers. With the completion of the first phase of the Lima terminal construction, we are also getting closer to concluding our major expansion activities. The sizeable investment measures that are still ongoing, however, mean that we expect further significant negative free cash flow for 2024 until the investment volume declines from 2025 onwards.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nAs Fraport is particularly affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the same time continues to invest heavily in the expansion of its capacities, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board have **decided against proposing a dividend** for the past fiscal year to the 2024 Annual General Meeting and plan to allocate the profit earmarked for distribution to revenue reserves instead.\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 3\n\nDear shareholders, your company is in an excellent position to cope with changing market conditions. We are pleased to have finally left the coronavirus pandemic behind after three years. For this reason, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board have decided to hold this year's **Annual General Meeting in person again**. I therefore look forward to welcoming you personally to the Sheraton Hotel at Frankfurt Airport on May 28, 2024. You will receive an official invitation in April.\n\nThank you for your confidence in us, I am looking forward to the future of your company.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nStefan Scholz\n\nStefan Schulte\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>*The Fraport Executive Board*\n\n*\"People's desire to travel is unbroken, the airport is and remains a fascination.

In individual appropriate cases and in accordance with law, decision-making powers of the Supervisory Board were granted to the committees. The chairpersons of the committees provided regular reports at the next Supervisory Board meeting to the plenum of the Supervisory Board on the work of the committees. The composition and responsibilities of the individual committees can be found in the \"Combined Statement on Corporate Governance\" as well as on the Group's website at www.fraport.com/en/investors/corporate-governance.html.\n\nUnless otherwise noted in the following, the meetings of the committees took place in-person with the option of virtual participation for individual members.\n\nThe **finance and audit committee** met six times during the reporting period, with two meetings held as virtual meetings, and discussed substantial business transactions, the annual and consolidated financial statements, and the management reports. Representatives of the auditor participated in the meetings on individual agenda items. The finance and audit committee prepared the determination of the focal points of the 2023 fiscal year audit of accounts for the Supervisory Board. The interim report and the interim releases were discussed in detail prior to their publication.

As in previous years, the quality of the audit of accounts was monitored and the remuneration of the same discussed.

Due to the required regular change of auditor, a proposal was made to the meeting to propose to the Annual General Meeting to appoint Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main as the auditor and group auditor for the 2023 fiscal year. Furthermore, with regard to the review of CSR reporting, the recommendation of the Supervisory Board was in favor of this auditing company.\n\nFurther focal points of the discussions were asset and liability management as well as the regular supplementary reports to the consolidated financial statements and/or the consolidated interim reports in accordance with Section 90 AktG. In addition, the committee discussed risk management and the internal control, internal audit, and compliance management systems in detail and ensured that the Supervisory Board was appropriately informed.\n\nThe discussions at the five meetings of the **investment and capital expenditure committee** during the 2023 fiscal year focused on the respective status of the stake in the operating company of Pulkovo Airport, St. Petersburg, which was also discussed at a special meeting, the economic development of the investment business, and the expansion measures in Germany and at foreign Group companies.\n\nA particular focus was on the expansion in the southern part of Frankfurt Airport, which was intensively discussed at all committee meetings in the presence of the management of the responsible Group company Fraport Ausbau Süd GmbH, also with a view to the discussions by the Supervisory Board. The committee also dealt with the expansion of the airport in Lima.

The audit mandate was issued by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and by the Chairwoman of the finance and audit committee in accordance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 23, 2023.\n\nThe separate financial statements and the combined management report were prepared in accordance with the regulations of the HGB applicable to large capital companies and the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable in the EU. Furthermore, the German legal regulations to be applied in addition to Section 315e(1) of the HGB in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report were applied. The separate financial statements, consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report were audited by the auditor. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report meet the conditions for exemption from the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with German commercial law. According to the auditor, there is an early risk warning system in place that meets the legal requirements and which makes it possible to identify developments that could jeopardize the company as a going concern at an early stage.\n\nThe documents mentioned above and the proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of profit earmarked for distribution were sent to the Supervisory Board by the Executive Board without delay. The finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board examined these documents extensively and the Supervisory Board also reviewed them personally. The audit reports of Deloitte and the financial statements were available to all members of the Supervisory Board and were comprehensively dealt with in the accounting meeting of the Supervisory Board on March 15, 2024 in the presence of the auditor, who reported on the significant results of its audit and was available to respond to additional questions and provide further information. In the meeting, the chairwoman of the finance and audit committee provided a comprehensive report on the treatment of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements in the finance and audit committee. A focal point of this reporting were the key audit matters described in the auditor's report. The Supervisory Board approved the results of the annual audit. After the completion of the audit by the finance and audit committee and its own review, the Supervisory Board did not raise any objections. The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements prepared by the Executive Board; the annual financial statements were thus adopted.\n\nThe profit earmarked for distribution of Fraport AG amounted to €164,6 million in the past fiscal year. Considering the ongoing late impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on Fraport and the continued high capital expenditure, the Executive Board of Fraport AG proposed again to waive the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 fiscal year. After an in-depth assessment and, in particular, taking into account the interests of the Company and the shareholders, the Supervisory Board has endorsed this proposal.\n\nThe report prepared by the Executive Board on the relationships of Fraport AG with affiliated companies pursuant to Section 312 of the AktG (dependency report) for the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 was submitted to the Supervisory Board. The report concludes with the following statement of the Executive Board, which is also included in the combined management report:\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n\"The Executive Board declares that under the circumstances known to us at the time, Fraport AG received fair and adequate compensation for each and every legal transaction conducted. During the reporting year, measures were neither taken nor omitted at the request of or in the interests of the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt am Main and their affiliated companies.\"\n\nThe auditor reviewed the report on the relationships with affiliated companies and issued the following auditor's report:\n\n\"Based on our mandatory audit and the conclusions reached, we confirm that\n\n1. the effective disclosures made in the report are correct,\n\n2. the consideration paid by the company for the legal transactions referred to in the report was not unreasonably high.\"\n\nThe auditor participated in the discussions with the Supervisory Board on March 15, 2024 on the report regarding the relationships with affiliated companies and was available to the Supervisory Board to provide additional information. After the final result of the audit of the dependency report, no objections were made to the declaration of the Executive Board at the end of the report, which was also included in the combined management report. The outcome of the audit of the dependency report by the auditor was approved.\n\nDeloitte was also commissioned to review the content of the Remuneration Report of Fraport AG as at December 31, 2023 as prepared by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In addition to the formal examination required by law in accordance with Section 162(1) and (2) AktG, the content of the Remuneration Report was also reviewed. Based on the substantive audit, the auditor was able to form an opinion on this with reasonable assurance and confirmed in the context of the audit report that the Remuneration Report complies with the provisions of Section 162 AktG in all material respects. The audit report is attached to the Remuneration Report.\n\n#### **Audit of the non-financial statement**\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also responsible for auditing the content of the combined non-financial statement. As part of the preparation for this audit, the auditor Deloitte was commissioned to prepare a voluntary audit of the combined non-financial statement with limited assurance. The finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board examined the combined non-financial statement extensively and it was also reviewed by the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt the accounting meeting of the Supervisory Board on March 15, 2024, the auditor, in addition to the results of its audit of the financial reporting, also reported on the significant results of its audit of the combined non-financial statement and, in this regard, was available for additional questions and information.\n\nUltimately, it was determined that the combined non-financial statement is correct and complies with the requirements under German commercial law.\n\n#### **Personnel particulars**\n\nThe term of office of the current members of the Supervisory Board ended with the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on May 23, 2023. The following persons were elected at the Annual General Meeting\n\na) as representatives of the shareholders:\n\nFormer Minister Michael Boddenberg,\n\nDr. Bastian Bergerhoff,\n\nMs. Kathrin Dahnke,\n\n- Dr. Margarete Haase,\n- Mr. Harry Hohmeister,\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n- Mr. Lord Mayor Mike Josef,\n- Mr. Frank-Peter Kaufmann,\n- Mr. Lothar Klemm,\n- Ms. Sonja Wärntges,\n- Prof. Dr.-Ing.

The other Supervisory Board members were elected for the regular term of office of around five years until the 2028 Annual General Meeting.\n\nAfter the election of a representative of the employees was rendered invalid due to a violation of the gender ratio in accordance with Section 18a MitbestG, the District Court of Frankfurt am Main, by means of a resolution passed on August 4, 2023, appointed Ms. Ines Born as a (replacement) representative of the employees in the Supervisory Board until the beginning of the next regular period of office for the elected representatives of the employees.\n\nFrankfurt am Main, March 15, 2024\n\nVh. 13000\n\nFormer Minister Michael Boddenberg (Chairman of the Supervisory Board)\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>*Combined Statement on Corporate Governance*\n\nThe Fraport AG Executive Board reports – in the name of the Supervisory Board – on the contents subject to the reporting requirements pursuant to Section 289f of the German Commercial Code (HGB) for Fraport AG as well as for the Fraport Group (Fraport AG and fully consolidated Group companies, hereinafter referred to as \"Fraport\") as part of a combined statement on corporate governance pursuant to Sections 315d and 289f HGB in conjunction with Section 289f HGB, in order to enable a general statement on the Group's corporate governance principles. In this context, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board report in accordance with Principle 23 of the German Corporate Governance Code in its amended version from April 28, 2022 as published on June 27, 2022 (hereinafter: GCGC) on the corporate governance of the company.\n\nThe term \"corporate governance\" at Fraport means responsible corporate management and monitoring. The objectives of corporate governance at Fraport are long-term economic enhancement and creating as well as strengthening confidence among investors, customers, employees, and the public. Good corporate governance therefore has top priority at Fraport. In this context, efficient collaboration between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is as important as protecting shareholders' interests and maintaining open and transparent corporate communications. Fraport monitors the national and international developments in this area and regularly reviews its own corporate practices in connection with new legal regulations and revised national and international standards, and modifies it to meet these as required.\n\nIn accordance with Section 317(2) sentence 6 of the HGB, the following information pursuant to Sections 289f(2) and (5) and 315d of the HGB has been included by the auditor in the audit of the annual financial statements only to the extent that the auditor verified whether the information was actually given.\n\n# **Statement of compliance pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)**\n\nAs a publicly listed corporation headquartered in Germany, corporate governance at Fraport AG primarily orients itself to German stock corporation law, capital market law, and the suggestions and recommendations of the GCGC as amended. The GCGC is a major legal regulation for the management and supervision of German publicly listed companies and contains internationally and nationally recognized standards of good and responsible corporate governance in the form of recommendations and suggestions. There is no obligation to implement the suggestions and recommendations of the GCGC. However, under Section 161 of the AktG, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are obliged to issue an annual statement of compliance and to report and justify any deviations from the recommendations of the GCGC.\n\n# **Statement of compliance of December 14, 2023**\n\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board last issued the following statement of compliance under Section 161 of the AktG on December 14, 2023:\n\n\"Since the last presentation of the statement of compliance on December 15, 2022, Fraport AG has complied with and will continue to comply with all recommendations announced on June 27, 2022 by the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the amended version of April 28, 2022 (GCGC 2022).\"\n\nThe statement of compliance was promptly made permanently available to the shareholders on the company's website at www.fraport.com/en/investors/corporate-governance.html.\n\n# **GCGC recommendations**\n\nFraport AG also voluntarily complies with the recommendations of the GCGC.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Disclosures on other corporate management practices**\n\nBeyond the statutory provisions, Fraport applies the following corporate management practices:\n\n#### **Compliance**\n\nEnsuring the integrity of all employees worldwide is of great importance to Fraport. Compliance is a key prerequisite for the future viability of the company. In order to ensure compliance with the rules, guidelines are applied within Fraport that employees must comply with.\n\nThe Code of Conduct for Employees that applies worldwide to the Fraport Group reflects the culture of values practiced at Fraport and stipulates the requirement to act responsibly and appropriately when dealing with the economic, legal, and moral challenges of everyday business. The Code of Conduct is reviewed regularly and updated when necessary.\n\nThere are several ways for employees and customers around the world to report potential compliance breaches securely and in confidence. The information received is carefully and conscientiously evaluated and examined. Compliance breaches are systematically penalized, and any grievances are remedied.\n\nFraport employees are regularly informed on the topic of compliance through various internal channels and undergo training courses. The Code of Conduct for Employees and other compliance guidelines in place at the Fraport Group are available to employees on the corresponding information platforms.\n\nIn its Supplier Code of Conduct, Fraport describes the requirements and principles for cooperation with contractors, suppliers, and service providers. The contractually agreed Supplier Code of Conduct obliges them to comply with the applicable national laws and the relevant internationally recognized standards, guidelines, and principles, as also stipulated in the Code of Conduct for Employees.\n\nThe Compliance Management System (CMS) at Fraport is a systematic tool for ensuring legal and compliant behavior within the Group. The objective of the CMS is to ensure corporate management based on values and with integrity that goes beyond the mere fulfillment of standards.\n\nThe CMS of Fraport AG is based on and starts with a rolling compliance risk analysis (CRA), which includes the fight against corruption as one focus area.\n\nThe compliance system in place within the Fraport Group must differentiate between central and local levels. Every member of the Executive Board of Fraport AG is also responsible for the organization of compliance within the Fraport Group. It has assigned the Head of the Legal Affairs and Compliance central unit, who also serves as Chief Compliance Officer, to develop, organize, and operate the CMS of Fraport AG. The Group companies are obliged to set up a local CMS in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the relevant Group guidelines. Responsibility for the individual CMS within the Group lies with the local management of the respective Group company. The central CMS organization is responsible for the Group's requirements with regard to the minimum standards for the design of the local CMS and monitoring of compliance with those requirements. The finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board is informed at least once per year of the status of the CMS within Fraport AG and the Group by the Executive Board.\n\n#### **Responsible corporate governance**\n\nFraport is a community and partnership-oriented group. Fraport aims to remain competitive at all sites and in all operational units and thereby secure jobs with fair and just working conditions. Fraport offers good working conditions based on collective bargaining agreements, professional and personal development pathways, and a highly developed corporate ethic. The long-held objective of Fraport to offer all employees a high level of workplace security is a significant factor for the appeal of Fraport as an employer, especially in the current conditions of the labor market. Comprehensive, integrated occupational health and safety is also an important component of overall corporate responsibility at Fraport. Comprehensive protective measures have been taken at both the Frankfurt site and the Group airports.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Fraport Group is also committed to maintaining a sustainable, conserving, and preventive approach to natural resources and the environment. The topic of sustainability has been of particular significance for Fraport in recent years. The stated goal for Fraport AG and the Fraport Group is to be carbon-free by 2045 within scopes 1 (direct emissions) and 2 (indirect emissions). Ambitious milestones for CO<sup>2</sup> reductions on the path toward climate neutrality by 2045 were agreed for both Fraport AG and the Fraport Group with a view to achieving this goal. In 2022, a \"decarbonization master plan\" was adopted to enable Fraport to meet its sustainability goals. Starting with Fraport AG, the \"decarbonization master plan\" was successfully rolled out to all areas of the Fraport Group in the course of fiscal year 2023. Under the plan, the foreign equity holdings have defined measures for a carbon reduction path similar to the process at the Frankfurt site. A Decarbonization Board was created to ensure continuous monitoring of the implementation of the \"decarbonization master plan,\" which regularly reports to the Executive Board on the implementation status of the measures. Examples of the numerous concrete measures taken to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions include the establishment of a ground-mounted photovoltaic system next to the runway North-West, the increasing purchase of green electricity, and the expansion of the infrastructure for alternative drive systems of vehicles at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe Executive Board ensures that it takes account of sustainability-related goals in its resolutions concerning key corporate decisions. In addition to financial goals, the corporate strategy also includes ecological and social goals and reflects the basic understanding of Fraport of balanced corporate management. \"Growth and Sustainability\" is one of the three priorities of our company strategy (in addition to \"Efficiency and Innovation\" and \"Employer of choice\"). Using non-financial indicators, such as CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, which are measured as at December 31 and June 30, and employee satisfaction, which is determined every two years, the company measures the degree of target achievement. Corporate planning includes projects and measures aimed at achieving the financial and sustainability-related goals.\n\nLastly, Fraport AG is involved in community, cultural, and social initiatives by sponsoring associations and supporting volunteer activities.\n\nFurther corporate governance practices are publicly available on the Company's website at www.fraport.com.\n\n#### **Structure and functioning of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board**\n\nFor Fraport, a responsible and transparent corporate governance and monitoring framework is the cornerstone for creating value and trust. In accordance with the statutory provisions, Fraport AG is subject to a \"dual governance system,\" which is achieved by the strict separation of personnel in the management and monitoring bodies (two-tier board). The Executive Board manages Fraport AG, and the Supervisory Board monitors the Executive Board. The members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board work closely together in the interests of the company.\n\n#### **Executive Board**\n\nThe Executive Board of Fraport AG is comprised of the following five members: Dr. Stefan Schulte (Chair), Anke Giesen, Julia Kranenberg, Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm, and Prof. Dr. Matthias Zieschang.\n\nAs the management body, the Executive Board conducts the business of the company. It is bound by the company's interests and corporate sociopolitical principles within the framework of stock corporation law. In addition, its work is based on the \"Executive Board rules of procedure\", which have been approved by the Supervisory Board. The schedule of responsibilities for the Executive Board, which governs the allocation of responsibilities, is also attached to these rules of procedure as an annex.\n\nOn this basis, the Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board on all relevant matters of business development, corporate strategy, and possible risks in a regular, timely, and comprehensive manner. In addition, the Executive Board must have the prior approval of the Supervisory Board for certain material matters, particularly for capital expenditure and equity investment measures above a value of €10 million, to the extent that this is not provided for in a business plan approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe length of the appointment of the Executive Board members is geared toward the long term and has thus far been five years as standard. In deviation from this standard, the Supervisory Board in 2021 extended the appointment of Prof. Dr. Zieschang as a member of the Executive Board for a further three years and ten months until January 31, 2026, and in 2022 extended the appointment of Ms. Giesen for a further three years with effect from January 1, 2023. Ms. Kranenberg was appointed as a member of the Executive Board for a term of three years when she was first appointed in 2022 in accordance with recommendation B.3 of the GCGC. Furthermore, in its meeting on September 15, 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to extend the appointment of Dr. Schulte as a member of the Executive Board with effect from September 1, 2024 for an additional three years until \n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nAugust 31, 2027. Dr. Schulte's appointment would have ended on August 31, 2024. In the same meeting, the Supervisory Board decided to extend the appointment of Dr. Prümm as Executive Board member with effect from July 1, 2024 for a period of five further years until June 30, 2029. Dr. Prümm's appointment would have ended on June 30, 2024. In compliance with recommendation B.4 of the GCGC, the reappointments of Dr. Schulte and Dr. Prümm did not take place before one year of their current appointments had passed.\n\nThe age limit for members of the Executive Board has, in principle, been set at 65 by the Supervisory Board. In the case of Dr. Schulte, the Supervisory Board dealt in-depth with the age limit in its meeting on September 15, 2023 and decided, as an exception, to deviate from the fundamentally set age limit of 65 years in the (re)appointment of Dr. Schulte until August 31, 2027. Reasons for the (re)appointment of Dr. Schulte until August 31, 2027 and the deviation from the fundamentally set age limit of 65 years as an exception were the continuing expansions in Frankfurt, Lima, and Antalya for which the Supervisory Board regarded continuity in the office of the Chair of the Supervisory Board due to Dr. Schulte's many years of experience and his many years of departmental responsibility for these projects until 2027 as important and in the interests of the company.\n\nRemuneration of the Executive Board comprises fixed and performance-related components. The Remuneration Report for the 2023 fiscal year, the auditor's report as per Section 162 AktG, and the applicable remuneration system for the Executive Board are published at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/publications-events.html.\n\nThe Executive Board usually meets every week and constitutes a quorum if at least half of its members participate in the meeting. Resolutions are adopted by a simple majority of all the participating members of the Executive Board. In the case of a tied vote, the chair holds the casting vote.\n\nFurther information on the members of the Executive Board as well as their memberships to be disclosed in accordance with Section 285 (10) HGB and information on the respective areas of responsibility can be found in note 55 of the Group Notes as part of the 2023 Annual Report. CVs of the members of the Executive Board are available on the company's website under https://www.fraport.com/en/our-group/about-us/executive-board.html\n\n#### **Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Fraport AG supervises the activities of the Executive Board. It is composed of an equal number of shareholder and employee representatives and comprises 20 members as provided for in the company statutes. The ten shareholder representatives are elected by the Annual General Meeting, and the ten employee representatives are elected by the employees in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (MitbestG) for five years. The Supervisory Board has created rules of procedure, under which it has a quorum if \">– on the basis of a proper notice of meeting – at least half of its members participate in the voting in person or through submission of written votes. Resolutions are adopted with a simple majority unless otherwise mandated by law. In the event of a tied vote, the Chair of the Supervisory Board, who must be a shareholder representative, shall be entitled to a second vote. Beyond this, the rules of procedure provide for, in particular, the creation and powers of committees of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs a rule, the Supervisory Board meets four times a year. In 2023, the Supervisory Board held six meetings, one of which was a strategy meeting. The Supervisory Board meetings in 2023 were all held in-person, while individual members had the option of participating virtually.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly carries out a self-assessment of the effectiveness of its activities and the activities of its committees. The efficiency review is usually carried out alternately in a structured process with the help of external consultants (as in 2022) and by means of a self-assessment. In 2023, a self-assessment of the Supervisory Board was carried out using a questionnaire, which was discussed in detail at the Supervisory Board meeting on December 14, 2023. The focus of the discussion was on issues relating to the company strategy, the collaboration within the Supervisory Board, the committees, and with the Executive Board, the preparation and conduct of Supervisory Board meetings, the reporting and information system, and the topic of digitalization.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews its activities in the past fiscal year on an annual basis in the Supervisory Board report. The Supervisory Board report for the 2023 fiscal year can be found under \"To Our Shareholders\" in the 2023 Fraport Annual Report. The Remuneration Report for the 2023 fiscal year, the auditor's report as per Section 162 AktG, the applicable remuneration system for the Executive Board, and the most recent remuneration resolution as per Section 113(3) AktG are published at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/publications-events.html.\n\nIn 2023, elections were held for the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board.

|\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Nomination Committee did not meet in person in 2023 but passed its resolutions in two written circulation procedures.\n\n# **Shareholders and Annual General Meeting**\n\nThe shareholders of Fraport AG exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting where they exercise their right to a voice and a vote. The shareholders are informed of business developments in the past year and the company's forecasts included in the combined management report with sufficient time prior to the meeting. During the year, the shareholders are provided with comprehensive and timely information about current business developments through interim reports and other company publications on the company website.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting is held within the first eight months of every fiscal year and makes decisions concerning the tasks assigned to it by law, such as the appropriation of profits, election and approval of the actions of the members of the Supervisory Board and approval of the actions of the Executive Board, the selection of the auditor, amendments to the company statutes, Supervisory Board remuneration, approval of the remuneration system for Executive Board members, and other tasks. The shareholders can either exercise their right to vote in person or can authorize third parties to exercise their right to vote. Each share entitles its holder to one vote in the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with the company statutes, the Executive Board is authorized to provide for\n\n- the Annual General Meeting to be held without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies at the venue of the Annual General Meeting (virtual Annual General Meeting) – this authorization is limited in time and applies to Annual General Meetings held within three years of the commercial register entry made in June 2023 of this new provision in the company statutes created by the Annual General Meeting 2023 and can be extended or renewed (also several times) by a corresponding resolution of the Annual General Meeting;\n- shareholders to cast their votes in writing or by means of electronic communication (postal vote);\n- shareholders to participate in an Annual General Meeting that is not a virtual Annual General Meeting within the meaning of the company statutes without being present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise all or some of their rights in whole or in part by means of electronic communication (online participation).\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2023 was held as a virtual Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 118a AktG without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies, thereby making use of the (transitional) provisions of Section 26n (1) of the Introductory Act to the German Stock Corporation Act (Einführungsgesetz zum Aktiengesetz). Duly registered shareholders and their proxies were able to follow the entire 2023 Annual General Meeting by video and audio transmission via the passwordprotected AGM portal accessible on the Internet and to exercise their voting rights and other shareholder rights via the AGM portal. This meant that duly registered shareholders and their proxies were able to exercise their right to speak and obtain information at the 2023 Annual General Meeting via video communication for the first time. The virtual Annual General Meeting 2023 was thus largely aligned with the format of an in-person Annual General Meeting in terms of content and the protection of shareholder rights. In addition, shareholders who duly registered for the 2023 Annual General Meeting or their authorized representatives had the opportunity to submit statements in advance in text form or as a video message.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Defining targets for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board, Executive Board, and the two levels below the Executive Board**\n\nAccording to the German Stock Corporation Act, Fraport AG, as a listed company to which the German Co-Determination Act applies and whose Executive Board consists of more than three persons, must have at least one woman and at least one man as a member of the Executive Board (minimum participation requirement). Fraport AG complied with this requirement during the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nThe targets for the proportion of women at the two management levels below the Executive Board as well as the deadlines for reaching these targets must be determined based on this law.\n\nIt is not necessary to set targets for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board at Fraport AG because that board is already subject to a fixed gender quota in accordance with Section 96(2) of the AktG.\n\n#### **Targets for the Executive Board**\n\nIf the above-mentioned minimum participation requirement applies to the Executive Board, the obligation to set a target figure for the participation of women on the Executive Board is waived in accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Supervisory Board set a target of 25% of women on the Fraport AG Executive Board at its meeting of September 18, 2015, and this target remained even after the obligation to set targets for the Executive Board had been eliminated. Since Julia Kranenberg's joining the Executive Board of Fraport AG on November 1, 2022, the percentage of women on the Executive Board of Fraport AG is 40%.\n\n#### **Targets for the first and second management levels below the Executive Board**\n\nThe Executive Board sets the targets for the proportion of women at the two levels below the Executive Board in accordance with Section 76(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act and Principle 3 of the GCGC.\n\nThe Executive Board set a target for Fraport AG of 31.8% of women in the first management level below the Executive Board (\"direct reports\" to the Executive Board) and a target of 30.9% of women in the subordinate management level (\"direct reports\" to the first management level under the Executive Board) for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026. Regarding the Group as a whole, the Executive Board also set a target of 30.8% of women in the first management level below the Executive Board (\"direct reports\" to the Executive Board) and a target of 30.2% of women in the subordinate management level (\"direct reports\" to the first management level under the Executive Board) for the same period.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, the actual proportion of women in the first management level at Fraport AG was 23.8%, and 31.8% in the second management level. As at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, the actual proportion of women in the first management level within the Group was 24.4%, and 33.9% in the second management level.\n\n#### **Gender ratio on the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn accordance with Section 96 (2) AktG (Principle 11 of the GCGC), where members are newly elected and posted to the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG, the statutory gender ratio must be met, with a minimum of 30% women and 30% men on the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has decided that these ratios are to be met separately by the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. This requirement was met as part of the new elections of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting on May 23, 2023. The election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board in 2023 was based on corresponding resolutions by the nomination committee.\n\nIn the election of employee representatives by the delegates' assembly in May 2023, only two people were elected to the Supervisory Board as female employee representatives, which means that the minimum percentage of 30% women on the employee representative side, which must be met separately, was not met. As provided for in the German Co-Determination Act, in order to meet the gender ratio, the election of the male candidate on the employee representative side who received the lowest maximum number of votes in the respective ballot according to the order of the maximum numbers of candidates was therefore declared invalid. On the application of the Fraport AG Executive Board, the district court Frankfurt am Main subsequently appointed Ms. Ines Born (from the ver.di trade union) to the Supervisory Board of the company as employee representative until the beginning of the next regular period of office for the elected representatives of the employees by means of a resolution passed on August 4, 2023.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board; diversity concept for the Supervisory Board and Executive Board as well as the succession planning for the Executive Board**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, the Supervisory Board adopted a new requirements profile for the members of the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG, which stipulates, among other things, that the Supervisory Board as a whole should have adequate expertise with regard to sustainability issues of importance to Fraport, as well as sustainability reporting.\n\nThe targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board and the competence profile for the overall board (including the diversity concept) are as follows:\n\n\"The objective is that the Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that it ensures the competent control and support of the company's Executive Board by the Supervisory Board. It should be taken into account that the Supervisory Board as a collective body has the overall knowledge, skills, and professional experience required to properly perform its tasks. It cannot be expected that each individual member of the Supervisory Board possesses the required knowledge and experience to the fullest extent; however, there should be at least one competent member of the Board for each aspect of the Supervisory Board's activities to ensure that the Board's members together represent a comprehensive range of knowledge and experience. This should include an understanding of the relevant market environment, financial, and commercial experience, and a strong regional connection.\n\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board should be expected to have a certain level of essential general knowledge and experience that is appropriate to the nature, extent and complexity of the business activities, and the risk structure of an internationally operating company such as Fraport AG.\n\nIn order to comply with the standard age limit set by the Supervisory Board of 72 years at the time of election or re-election, which may be deviated from in justified individual cases provided there are no doubts as to the suitability of the persons proposed and their election appears expedient in the interests of the Company despite exceeding the age limit and the targets set by the Supervisory Board of a proportion of generally at least 30% of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board being no more than 62 years old at the time of their election, candidates should be proposed who, by virtue of their integrity, willingness to perform, availability, and personality, are able to perform the duties of a Supervisory Board member in an internationally operating company and to maintain the public image of Fraport AG. The principles of diversity and the proportion of women and men based on the statutory provisions should be taken into account when nominating candidates for the Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board should have at least three independent members.\"\n\nThe previous strict age limit of 72 years at the time of (re)election was therefore made more flexible by amending the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 13, 2023. Accordingly, the maximum age limit for Supervisory Board members is generally 72 years at the time of election or reelection. This age limit may be deviated from in justified individual cases, provided there are no doubts about the suitability of the proposed persons. The requirements profile for Supervisory Board members, which was revised in 2023, also stipulates that the Supervisory Board must have at least three independent members. To ensure a balanced mix of experience and new talent on the Supervisory Board, at least 30% of the shareholder representatives should not be older than 62 at the time of election or reelection.\n\nIn the election of shareholder representatives by the Annual General Meeting 2023, Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann were older than 72 years at the time of reelection. The Supervisory Board discussed this fact at its meeting on March 13, 2023 and proposed the election of Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann for a term of two years with the required majority, while a term of five years was proposed to the Annual General Meeting for the other candidates. The reasons given for the deviation from the standard age limit as an exception in the cases of Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann were that Mr. Klemm, as the Chair of the investment and capital expenditure committee, should assist with the construction of Terminal 3 and the expansion of the airport in Lima and Antalya as important infrastructure projects in this critical phase for another two years due to his many years of experience, and that Mr. Kaufmann is highly committed to advancing the important issues of climate protection and decarbonization. The 2023 Annual General Meeting agreed to the election proposal and reelected Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann to the Supervisory Board for a two-year term of office as an exception to the general age limit of 72 years at the time of reelection. As the term of office of two members of the Supervisory Board therefore differs from that of the other Supervisory Board members, this also paves the way for the gradual formation of a Supervisory Board with staggered terms of office for Supervisory Board members (\"staggered board\") for the future.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs regards the statutory gender ratio of at least 30% women and at least 30% men on the Supervisory Board, most recently in 2022, the Supervisory Board decided that this ratio is to be met separately for the members representing the shareholders and those representing the employees. In line with this objective, the Supervisory Board consists of four female and six male shareholder representatives as well as three female and seven male employee representatives (see above under \"Gender ratio on the Supervisory Board\").\n\nAccording to Section 100(5) AktG, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have accounting expertise and at least one further member must have expertise in the auditing of accounts. According to recommendation D.3 of the GCGC, the expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of account auditing shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Recommendation D.3 of the GCGC goes on to state that accounting and account auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance. The Chair of the audit committee shall have appropriate expertise in at least one of these two areas.\n\nWith Supervisory Board members Dr. Margarete Haase, who is Chair of the finance and audit committee, and Ms. Sonja Wärntges, two members of the Supervisory Board and the finance and audit committee possess the expertise in accounting and account auditing required by Section 100(5) of the AktG. In addition, Ms. Dahnke also has expert knowledge in the area of accounting as defined in Section 100 (5) AktG and in the area of auditing as defined in Section 100 (5) AktG.\n\nDr. Haase has completed a degree in business administration at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, where she also obtained her doctorate. She has also completed the Executive Education Program at Harvard Business School in Boston. During her professional career, Dr. Haase has been responsible for numerous roles, which marks her as an expert in the fields of accounting and account auditing. She has held positions that include Head of Controlling, Division Manager for Group Planning and Control, Commercial Director and Director Corporate Audit, and was also a member of the Executive Board for companies belonging to the Daimler Group. Dr. Haase was a member of the Executive Board for Corporate Finance, Human Resources and Investor Relations at Deutz AG, Cologne until April 2018. Since February 2016, Dr. Haase has been a member of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nMs. Wärntges completed degrees in economics at the Technical University of Braunschweig and the University of Hanover, from where she obtained a master's degree in business economics. Ms. Wärntges worked for several years at leading auditing and tax consulting companies and has been Chief Financial Officer of BRANICKS GROUP AG (formerly DIC Asset AG) since 2013, additionally assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer in 2017. In this role, Ms. Wärntges' areas of responsibility include Environmental, Social and Governance and sustainability issues, as well as the sustainability report, which BRANICKS GROUP AG (formerly DIC Asset AG) has been issuing since 2011.\n\nMs. Dahnke holds a degree in business administration of the Georg August University in Göttingen. She headed the finance department at Beiersdorf AG, held the position of Director of Finance and member of the Management Board for Finance and Controlling at DMG Mori Seiki Aktiengesellschaft (formerly GILDEMEISTER AG) and was CFO at both OSRAM Licht AG and Ottobock SE & Co KGaA.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Fraport AG thus meets the requirements of stock corporation law with regard to the requirement of Supervisory Board members with expertise in the areas of accounting and account auditing.\n\nFor shareholders, the Supervisory Board should include what they consider to be an appropriate number of independent members; the ownership structure should be taken into account (see Recommendation C.6 of the GCGC). The Supervisory Board decided that the board should include at least three independent shareholder representatives.\n\nThe above-mentioned objectives and recommendations were and are met in that, with Dr. Margarete Haase, Ms. Kathrin Dahnke, Prof. Dr. Ing. Katja Windt and Ms. Sonja Wärntges, the Supervisory Board consisted of four shareholder representatives who were independent of the company, its Executive Board, and the controlling shareholders (the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt) in the reporting year. In the election of the shareholder representatives, five – and therefore in line with the requirements profile for members of the Supervisory Board, more than 30% of the candidates standing for election on the shareholder side – were not older than 62 years of age.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, Fraport AG also complies with recommendations C.7 and C.9 of the GCGC, according to which more than half of the shareholder representatives must be independent of the company and the Executive Board and at least two of the shareholder representatives must be independent of the controlling shareholder. According to recommendation C.7 of the GCGC, when assessing the independence of Supervisory Board members by the company and the Executive Board, it should be taken into account, among other things, whether the Supervisory Board member has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years.\n\nIn the view of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, despite having been a member of the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG for more than 12 years (member since January 1, 2011), Dr. Haase is regarded as independent of the company and the Executive Board. Due to her personality, her integrity, and her professionalism, combined with many years of various professional activities with management responsibility outside of Fraport, there are no doubts with regard to her independence in respect of Fraport AG and the Executive Board. Through her work as a member of the Supervisory Board and Chair of the finance and audit committee, Dr. Haase demonstrates that she has the necessary critical distance from the company and its Executive Board when carrying out her work on the Supervisory Board at Fraport AG. Due to her stature and independence, she openly holds discussions with the Executive Board and understands how to critically scrutinize proposals. Furthermore, Dr. Haase is also a member of the Supervisory Board of Marquard & Bahls AG and Chair of the Supervisory Board of ams OSRAM AG, which emphasizes her independence of Fraport AG and its Executive Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has no former members of the Executive Board of Fraport AG.\n\nThe Supervisory Board, along with the Executive Board and based on the preparatory work by the executive committee, ensures the long-term succession planning of the Executive Board. In addition to the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the GCGC, long-term succession planning takes into account the target set by the Supervisory Board for the proportion of women on the Executive Board as well as other diversity criteria. Taking into account the specific qualification requirements, the structure of the Executive Board, including the division of portfolios, and the aforementioned personnel criteria, the executive committee develops an ideal profile on the basis of which it draws up a shortlist of eligible candidates. Structured discussions are held with these candidates. A recommendation for a resolution is then submitted to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also takes diversity into account regarding the composition of the Executive Board (Recommendation B.1 of the GCGC). Given the identified qualifications of its members, the Supervisory Board does not yet pursue a diversity concept for the Executive Board.\n\nThe status of the implementation of the requirements profile for members of the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG is outlined in the following qualification matrix. The general requirements for members of the Supervisory Board of Fraport are met by all members of the Supervisory Board. These include a general understanding of the aviation industry, in particular the market environment of an airport operator, the individual business fields, customer requirements, the regions in which Fraport AG operates, and the strategic orientation of the company and the Group as a whole. All of the members of the Supervisory Board are therefore familiar with the sector in which Fraport AG operates.\n\nThe following table contains further details on the current members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Qualification matrix: Shareholder representatives**\n\n|

remuneration system as well as the disclosures on the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the 2023 fiscal year can be found in the Remuneration Report. The Remuneration Report was subject to a formal and substantive audit by the auditor Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. The Remuneration Report is published as a separate document at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/publications-events.html.\n\n#### **Acquisition or disposal of company shares (directors' dealings)**\n\nPursuant to Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), board members and other managers (directors) and persons closely related thereto are legally obliged to disclose the acquisition or disposal of shares of Fraport AG or any financial instruments related thereto, if the value of the transactions undertaken exceeds the sum of €20,000 within one calendar year. The notifications in this respect are immediately disclosed by Fraport AG.\n\n#### **Shareholdings of the bodies**\n\nThe total shareholdings of all members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board amount to less than 1% of the total number of shares issued by Fraport AG.\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity management**\n\nFor Fraport, corporate governance also means handling corporate risks and opportunities responsibly. For this reason, Fraport has introduced a comprehensive Group-wide risk and opportunity management system. The structure of the risk and opportunity management system and a report on key risks and corporate opportunities are presented in detail by the Executive Board in the combined management report for the fiscal year. Depending on their importance for the company, changes to key risks or significant opportunities opening up during the year are published either in an ad hoc disclosure or as part of the financial reporting during the year.\n\nThe Internal Audit System (IAS) and the Risk Management System (RMS) are implemented by means of guidelines within the Fraport Group. The measures required in order to meet the sustainability-related corporate goals are also subjected to an (ongoing) deviation analysis within the Risk Management System.\n\nThe processes, risks and audits within the IAS are reviewed and updated annually by way of adequacy checks. The effectiveness of the IAS is checked by means of an annual control self-assessment performed by the control officer and approved by the process owner (dual verification principle). The results of the control self-assessment are presented annually in the finance and audit committee. The IAS and the further development of the RMS are audited by the internal audit team.\n\nThe early risk recognition system is also part of the auditor's annual audit. The effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system, the internal auditing system, and the audit of accounts is monitored by the Supervisory Board. At Fraport, the finance and audit committee of the Fraport AG Supervisory Board performs this task in accordance with Section 107(3) of the AktG.\n\n#### **Accounting and audit of accounts**\n\nFraport prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union, and the additional applicable requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e(1) of the HGB. A combined management report is prepared in accordance with Section 315(5) of the HGB. The annual financial statements of Fraport AG are prepared in accordance with the HGB. Further information on the accounting principles is available in the notes to the respective financial statements. The annual and consolidated financial statements are published within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report of Fraport are audited by an auditor in accordance with Section 316 of the HGB. On the basis of the AGM's resolution, in the 2023 fiscal year this was Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main (hereinafter referred to as Deloitte), who audited Fraport for the first time after the change of auditor in the 2023 fiscal year. Prior to the submission of the nomination, the Supervisory Board and its audit committee obtained a declaration of independence from Deloitte. The audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report was carried out in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014,\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nhereinafter referred to as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). It was agreed with the auditor that the latter would immediately inform the Fraport AG Supervisory Board of any possible grounds for disqualification or bias arising during the audit, provided that these were not remedied immediately. The auditor shall also immediately report on all findings and incidents arising during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report which are significant for the tasks of the Supervisory Board. In addition, the auditor must inform the Supervisory Board and record in the audit report if it finds facts that reveal an inaccuracy in the statement of compliance submitted by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 161 of the AktG while performing the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report.\n\nDuring the year, the auditor also participated in meetings with the finance and audit committee regarding the Group interim financial statements, and meetings with the Fraport AG Supervisory Board regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements. In accordance with Recommendation D.10 of the GCGC, the finance and audit committee discussed with the auditor the audit risk assessment, the audit strategy and audit planning, and the audit results. The Chair of the audit committee, Dr. Haase, regularly discussed the progress of the audit with the auditor and reported to the committee on this. The finance and audit committee consults with the external auditors on a regular basis also without the Executive Board.\n\n#### **Disclosure of the joint statement on corporate governance and corporate governance report**\n\nThe Executive Board published the combined statement on corporate governance on March 15, 2024 at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/corporate-governance.html.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>*Share and Investor Relations*\n\n# **Share performance 2023**\n\nThe key topics of the 2023 trading year were global inflation development, along with key interest rate decisions and expectations about how interest rates will develop in the future. Continuing geopolitical crises, such as the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, and new crises such as an escalation in the war between Israel and Islamist Hamas have also affected the stock exchanges. In the first quarter, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States, and the necessary rescue of Credit Suisse Bank by UBS Bank led to additional stock market volatility.\n\nIn this environment characterized by uncertainty, the German leading share index DAX rose by 20.3%, offsetting the losses of the previous year. At 16,752 points, the index closed close to its record high, which was reached in December 2023 at 16,794 points. The index for medium-sized stocks MDAX also grew last year. With growth of 8.0% to around 27,137 points, the MDAX could not completely make up the losses of the previous year however and remained clearly below its record high from 2021.\n\nAfter the noticeable losses in the 2022 fiscal year, the Fraport share recovered noticeably in 2023 and achieved clear growth of 43.9% with a year-end closing price of €54.76. The Fraport share already recorded a clear increase in the first quarter of the year. Buoyed by the prospect of possible key interest rate cuts, the share developed rapidly in January and achieved an increase of more than 36% at the end of the month compared to the closing price of the previous year. However, the Fraport shares lost some of their performance in March in connection with the regional banking crisis in the United States, triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Nevertheless, the shares ended the first quarter with a clear gain (+21.7%) at a price of €46.31. With growth of 5.5% to €48.86 and a further increase to €50.24 (+2.8%), the Fraport share also reported share price developments that were overall positive in quarters two and three of the fiscal year. The escalation in the war between Israel and Islamist Hamas led to a considerable price setback at the start of the fourth quarter. On October 20, at €44.64 the Fraport share recorded a reduction of more than 11% compared to the closing price of the third quarter. The hope of possible key interest rate cuts subsequently led to clear price gains. At €56.80, the shares reached their highest price of the year on December 14, before closing the trading year not much lower at a price of €54.76. The fourth quarter thus saw an increase of 13.1%.\n\nThe market capitalization of Fraport shares, including strategic shareholders not included in the free float, amounted to around €5.1 billion at the end of the year (previous year: €3.5 billion). After deducting the strategic shareholdings of the State of Hesse, the City of Frankfurt, Deutsche Lufthansa, and the treasury shares, the index-relevant market capitalization amounted to almost €2.0 billion (previous year: €1.4 billion). The share was thus, based on market capitalization, the 31st largest stock among the 50 MDAX shares. With an average of 149,982 shares traded daily, the trading volume in 2023 was much lower than the previous year's volume of 202,994.\n\n#### **Fraport share**\n\n|                                                             | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2016    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Opening price in €                                          | 38.05   | 59.18   | 49.36   | 75.78   | 62.46   | 91.86   | 56.17   | 58.94   |\n| Closing price in €                                          | 54.76   | 38.05   | 59.18   | 49.36   | 75.78   | 62.46   | 91.86   | 56.17   |\n| Change in €                                                 | +16.71  | -21.13  | +9.82   | -26.42  | +13.32  | -29.40  | +35.69  | -2.77   |\n| Change in %                                                 | +43.9   | -35.7   | +19.9   | -34.9   | +21.3   | -32.0   | +63.5   | -4.7    |\n| Highest price in € (daily closing price)                    | 56.80   | 67.62   | 68.30   | 75.50   | 78.68   | 96.94   | 91.86   | 58.94   |\n| Lowest price in € (daily closing price)                     | 38.05   | 36.20   | 43.12   | 30.01   | 61.44   | 61.56   | 55.26   | 45.25   |\n| Average price in € (daily closing prices)                   | 49.10   | 48.08   | 55.58   | 44.52   | 73.20   | 79.18   | 74.12   | 51.77   |\n| Average trading volume per day (number)                     | 149,680 | 202,994 | 256,728 | 398,143 | 128,953 | 160,367 | 173,015 | 173,666 |\n| Market capitalization in € million (year-end closing price) | 5,064   | 3,518   | 5,472   | 4,564   | 7,007   | 5,776   | 8,494   | 5,192   |\n\nThe shares of other listed European airports performed as follows in 2023:\n\nAENA +39.9 %, Aéroports de Paris -6.4 %, Flughafen Wien +57.3 % and Flughafen Zürich +22.7 %.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Report\n\n*[To Our Shareholders](#page-5-0)* Fraport Annual Report 2023 [Combined Management Report](#page-39-0) [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) Combined M[anagement Report](#page-144-0) / S[ituation of the Group](#page-236-0) Group Notes Further Information 27\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **2023 development of the Fraport share compared to the market and European competitors**\n\nImage /page/34/Figure/6 description: This line graph compares the 2023 development of the Fraport share to the market and European competitors.

Shares below 3% are classified under \"free float.\"\n\nThe majority of the approximately 92.5 million shares were held by German regional and local authorities (52.23%). With a share of 31.31%, the State of Hesse was the largest shareholder in the company, while the City of Frankfurt/Main held 20.92% of the shares. The voting rights owned by the City of Frankfurt are held indirectly via the Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH subsidiary. Deutsche Lufthansa AG held a share of 8.44%, or over 7.8 million no-par-value shares, making it the third largest individual shareholder of Fraport AG. Other shareholders that exceeded the statutory threshold of 3% of the outstanding Fraport shares were First Maven Pty (3.10%) and ATLAS Infrastructure Partners (UK) Ltd., whose respective portfolios are managed in Australia.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nImage /page/36/Figure/5 description: This image is a pie chart showing the allocation of free float in percentage.

Before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, this was a dividend of approximately 40 % to 60 % of the profit attributable to shareholders of Fraport AG. In addition, a second principle of the Executive Board regarding the dividend per share was to keep the dividend at least stable compared to the previous year.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Investor Relations (IR)**\n\nConsistent, timely, and transparent communication with investors and analysts is a top priority for IR work at Fraport AG. The IR team maintains face-to-face and virtual contact with existing and potential investors as part of roadshows, capital market conferences, or regular meetings, including at the company headquarters at Frankfurt Airport. Over the past fiscal year, targeted individual and Group meetings again took place as well as presentations with the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe central themes of the meetings in 2023 were passenger development and forecasts at the Group airports, the impact of rising interest rates, and the progress in construction of the substantial capital expenditure in Frankfurt and Lima. In this context, the medium-term development of the free cash flow was also a returning point of discussion. Focus was also put on the strategy of the international business as well as possible expansions or reductions in the portfolio.\n\nThroughout the year, the IR team was available by phone (+49 69 690-74840) or by email (investor.relations@fraport.de) for direct dialog. The telephone conferences for analysts on the financial publications, the virtual AGM in May 2023, and the provision of up-to-date information on the IR website at <www.meet-ir.com> rounded off the range of IR services in the past fiscal year.\n\n#### **Data relevant to the capital market**\n\n|                                                     |                 | 2023       | 2022       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                     |                 |            |            |\n| Share capital Fraport AG1)                          | € million       | 924.7      | 924.7      |\n| Total number of shares as at December 31            | Number          | 92,468,704 | 92,468,704 |\n| Number of floating shares as at December 312)       | Number          | 92,391,339 | 92,391,339 |\n| Number of floating shares (weighted annual average) | Number          | 92,391,339 | 92,391,339 |\n| Absolute share of capital stock                     | per share, in € | 10.00      | 10.00      |\n| Annual performance (including dividend)             | in %            | +43.9      | –35.7      |\n| Beta relative to the MDAX                           |                 | 1.03       | 0.99       |\n| Earnings per share (basic)                          | in €            | 4.26       | 1.43       |\n| Earnings per share (diluted)                        | in €            | 4.26       | 1.43       |\n| Price-earnings ratio                                |                 | 12.9       | 26.6       |\n| Dividend per share3)                                | in €            | 0.00       | 0.00       |\n| Profit earmarked for distribution                   | € million       | 0.00       | 0.00       |\n| Dividend yield as at December 313)                  | in %            | –          | –          |\n\n| ISIN                                 | DE 000 577 330 3                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Security identification number (WKN) | 577 330                                                 |\n| Reuters ticker code                  | FRAG.DE                                                 |\n| Bloomberg ticker code                | FRA GF                                                  |\n| Selected indexes                     | MDAX, FTSE4Good Index, Deutschland Ethik 30 Aktienindex |\n\n1) Including treasury shares.\n\n2) Total number of shares as at the balance sheet date, less treasury shares.\n\n3) In relation to the proposed dividend (2023).\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Report\n\n*[To Our Shareholders](#page-5-0)* [Combined Management Report](#page-39-0) [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) [Group Notes](#page-144-0) [Further Information](#page-236-0)\n\nFurther Information\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>*HR neo*\n\nHRneo is the largest development program in HR in recent years.

The main site of the Group is Frankfurt Airport, one of the most important passenger and cargo airports in the world, in respect of which the Group's parent company, Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (abbreviated: Fraport AG), has an operating permit with no time limit. Beyond the Frankfurt site, the Group operates on four continents, mainly on the basis of concession agreements at international airports. The main sites outside Frankfurt, which are designated as \"investments in airport operating projects,\" include 14 airports in Greece, Lima Airport in Peru, and two airports in Brazil – Porto Alegre and Fortaleza, as well as Antalya Airport in Turkey (see also the \"Key sites\" chapter).\n\nAs an airport operator, Fraport provides a wide range of operational and administrative services for airport and terminal operations. Within the framework of the concession agreements, the scope of the services offered varies from contractually binding construction and expansion activities, administration and control of airport processes, to the management of retail areas. In addition to the services provided, the concession models differ in terms of their term and the structure of the concession fees to be paid. The Fraport Group also offers planning and consulting services as well as IT services and facility management. Fraport aims to ensure that customers are the focus of all its company services. This applies both at the home site in Frankfurt and at the international Group sites. Fraport considers itself to be a learning organization that uses its know-how in a targeted and profitable way worldwide.\n\nThe Group generates the majority of its revenue and earnings from the passenger and freight business at each of its sites. Apart from passengers, its main customers include airlines, tenants of office and retail space, authorities and freight forwarders. Fraport primarily levies charges for the use of the airport infrastructure, generates income from the development of commercial areas, and offers additional operational services. Fraport reports the main revenue streams resulting from this as \"airport charges,\" \"infrastructure charges,\" \"ground services\" and \"security services,\" \"retail,\" \"real estate\" and \"parking.\" In the area of airport concessions, revenue from \"construction and expansion services in accordance with IFRIC 12\" are also reported. In its reporting, Fraport distinguishes between the following four segments:\n\n- **Aviation** holistic management of the terminal facilities and passenger processes at Frankfurt Airport.\n- **Retail & Real Estate** development and renting of space at the airport and in the area near the airport in Frankfurt. This primarily includes the retail business, building and space leasing as well as parking management.\n- **Ground Handling** ground services such as loading, baggage and passenger services as well as the operation of the central infrastructure and baggage transfer system at Frankfurt Airport.\n- **International Activities & Services** international marketing of the Group's expertise and airport operations as well as bundling central services in Frankfurt.\n\nFraport's business model creates value by participating in the international demand for air travel and flows of goods. Fraport is pursuing a clear growth strategy that also takes into consideration environmental and social concerns (see also the \"Strategy\" chapter). In addition to the broad portfolio of airport investments, which focuses on both business travel demand and local tourism offerings, the employees form the basis of the company's success. Together with its partners, Fraport is consistently developing the Group sites and achieving a broad revenue and earnings base.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/41/Figure/0 description: The image shows a diagram of Fraport's value generation chain. The diagram is divided into three main sections: Input, Output, and Value Generation. The Input section lists the resources that Fraport uses to generate value, such as airport infrastructure, financial resources, know-how, human resources, services and performance, and environmental resources. The Output section lists the benefits that Fraport provides to its stakeholders, such as connectivity, mobility, growth driver for the region, airport as a workplace, airport infrastructure, satisfied customers, know-how & innovation, profitability & dividends, and climate protection. The Value Generation section shows the activities that Fraport performs to transform its inputs into outputs, such as airport security, strategy, IT & Digitalization, supporting functions, purchasing, finance, parking, advertising, real estate management, concessions for retail & food & beverage, terminal operations, security checks, passenger & freight handling, airside operations, international airport management & consulting, governance and compliance, infrastructure development, facility management, communications, and human resources.\n\n### **External influences**\n\nThe main external factors influencing the business model of Fraport include disruptive events, such as extreme weather conditions or pandemics, in addition to economic, (socio-)political, and regulatory factors. The influencing factors can both positively and negatively affect passenger and freight demand as well as the range of aircraft movements and passenger capacity at Group airports. At the same time, they can influence the purchasing behavior of passengers and thus the economic situation of the Fraport Group as a whole (see also the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter).\n\n**Economic growth** and **globalization** generally favor the demand for air travel and freight transport. At the same time, economic prosperity and a globally growing middle class tend to lead to a higher number of air journeys. High **inflation rates** potentially reduce disposable income and can have a negative impact on business development. **Exchange rates** also affect the appeal of tourist destinations, travel and freight flows, and passengers' booking behavior as well as their buying behavior in the retail area. Exchange rates also play an important role in the financial contribution of individual foreign Group companies, whose functional currencies are converted into the currency of the Group, the euro.\n\n**Price fluctuations on commodity markets**, especially for crude oil and therefore jet fuel, also have an influence on air traffic and can have both a positive and negative impact on air traffic demand.\n\n**Politics** affect air traffic at the regional, national, and international levels. Operating restrictions, such as night flight bans and noise control measures, as well as travel restrictions and taxes, can have a negative impact on airline offerings. This may also affect passenger and cargo volume at the affected sites and may contribute to the development of other airports. **Environmental policy** in particular can affect air traffic. A further political influencing factor is the possible **liberalization of air traffic rights**. This\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nmay result in the opening of new markets for air traffic or the expansion of already existing markets. By contrast, sanctions or tightly specified air traffic agreements lead to the closure of markets.\n\n**Geopolitical crises** are leading to increasing global political and economic instability. They can influence air traffic development in many ways.\n\nFraport monitors various early warning indicators to identify trends in travel or freight flows at an early stage, and to derive appropriate countermeasures if necessary.\n\n# **Structure**\n\n#### **No material changes compared with the previous year**\n\nAfter FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fraport AG, transferred 26% of the shares in FraSec Aviation Security GmbH, formerly FraSec Luftsicherheit GmbH, to the Dr. Sasse Group in the 2022 fiscal year, FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH transferred a further 25% of the capital shares as at January 1, 2023. As a result of the transfer, FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH now holds 49% of the capital shares in FraSec Aviation Security GmbH, which has since been included as a joint venture in the Fraport Group.\n\nAs part of a transfer agreement, the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community (BMI) has transferred responsibility for the organization, financing, control and implementation of aviation security checks at Frankfurt Airport to Fraport AG effective January 1, 2023. Fraport also assumes responsibility for procuring security equipment at Frankfurt Airport and for calculating and levying aviation security charges from the airlines. In future, the aviation security checks will be carried out at the Frankfurt site by specialist personnel on behalf of Fraport AG, under the supervision of the German Federal Police.\n\nIn September 2023, the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG decided to extend the contract with Dr. Stefan Schulte, Chairman of the Executive Board of Fraport AG, for an additional three years until August 31, 2027 with effect as of September 1, 2024. In addition, the Supervisory Board extended the contract with Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm, Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Aviation and Infrastructure, for an additional five years until July 31, 2029 with effect as of August 1, 2024.\n\nBeyond that, no fundamental changes were made to the legal and organizational Group structure in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### **Legal structure of the Group**\n\nAs the parent company of the Fraport Group, Fraport AG directly or indirectly holds the shares in the other Group companies and has its registered office in Frankfurt am Main. As at December 31, 2023 there were 56 consolidated companies excluding companies accounted for using the equity method, and 78 companies including companies accounted for using the equity method (in the previous year: 55 and 76 companies, respectively). For a detailed overview of the shareholdings within the Group, please see Group notes, note 57.\n\n#### **Organizational Group structure**\n\nAs a management body, the Executive Board bears the strategic and operational responsibility for the Group. At the time of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board consisted of the five members Dr. Stefan Schulte (Chair), Anke Giesen (Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Retail & Real Estate), Julia Kranenberg (Labor Relations Director), Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm (Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Aviation and Infrastructure), and Prof. Matthias Zieschang (Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Controlling and Finance).\n\nFor the purpose of managing the Group, the Executive Board has divided the business activities into four segments: \"Aviation\", \"Retail & Real Estate\", \"Ground Handling\", which are largely active at the Frankfurt site, as well as \"International Activities & Services\", which primarily includes the Group companies outside of Frankfurt. The segments encompass the strategic business units and service units of Fraport AG and include the Group companies involved in each of these business processes. The central units of Fraport AG in Frankfurt are responsible for Group-wide administrative services, among other things.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/4 description: The image shows a blue airplane icon inside a white square. The airplane is facing to the right.\n\nThe **Aviation segment** mainly operates the land and airside infrastructure at the Frankfurt site. It therefore includes both the area of airport charges, which is legally regulated in Germany, and relevant security services. The regulated airport charges consist of passenger, landing, and takeoff fees, security fees, and parking fees. The Aviation segment is responsible for ensuring safe, efficient, and customer-oriented processes in the flight operating areas and terminals as well as\n\nthe implementation of airport and air safety tasks in compliance with legal requirements.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/7 description: The image shows a blue square containing a house, a shirt, and a gift. The house is at the top, the shirt is on the left, and the gift is at the bottom.\n\nThe **Retail & Real Estate segment** is responsible in particular for the commercial development of the Frankfurt site, including the retail activities as well as real estate and land. Its activities extend from the management of buildings and facilities through to the management and development of the parking and retail areas and the renting of advertising\n\nspace. In addition to the stationary business at Frankfurt Airport, the focus is, among other things, on greater use of online retail offers and sales channels.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/10 description: The image shows a blue square with a white border. Inside the square is a blue briefcase with a handle on top. Below the briefcase are seven blue dots in a horizontal line.\n\nThe **Ground Handling segment** consists of loading, baggage, and passenger services, airmail and luggage transport, and freight handling at Frankfurt Airport. The segment is primarily responsible for the quality of Frankfurt Airport's role as a hub, characterized by transfer processes. The provision of the central infrastructure, in particular the baggage\n\ntransfer system, is also allocated to this segment.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/13 description: The image shows a blue logo inside a white square. The logo consists of a globe with an airplane flying over it. The airplane is positioned above the globe, with its wings spread out. The globe is represented by intersecting lines, creating a grid-like pattern. The entire logo is in a dark blue color.\n\nThe **International Activities & Services segment** includes in particular the acquisition, operation, development, and expansion of airports abroad. Consulting services, including in the \"Operational Readiness and Airport Transfer\" (ORAT) section, are additionally provided. The segment also includes Fraport AG service units that provide central services for\n\nthe Fraport Group.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the organizational structure of the Fraport Group was as follows:\n\n|  |  | Fraport Group structure |\n|--|--|-------------------------|\n|--|--|-------------------------|\n\n|                                                | Dr. Stefan Schulte

Regionally, there is competition for passengers and air freight with airports in the original catchment area. Internationally, Frankfurt Airport competes for domestic and international transfer passengers and transshipment freight on the basis of its function as an international transfer airport. The main customer at the Frankfurt site remains the Lufthansa Group, which maintained its share of more than 60% of passengers in Frankfurt in the 2023 fiscal year. The largest competitors for transfer passengers are primarily the hub airports London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Istanbul, and Munich, which are in particular influenced by the global route networks of their resident main customers British Airways, Air France-KLM, Turkish Airlines, and Lufthansa Group. Due to the dynamic development of many airlines and airports from the Middle East, the Frankfurt site is also in intercontinental competition with these airports.\n\nIn particular, the expansion and modernization programs contribute to maintaining and improving the international competitive position. For example, the northward relocation of the security checks in Terminal 1 should lead to a much improved transfer process. Terminal 3 (\"Expansion South\") should also ensure the long-term landside capacities required to give the site a successful future-oriented competitive edge. The construction of Terminal 3 with Piers H and J, the road infrastructure, and parking garage are already well advanced. The roof of the main terminal building, for example, is fully installed, and the façade work, including glazing, is largely complete. Numerous technical installations are running inside the terminal. Pier G of Terminal 3 has been completed except for the installations that are only required for the start of operations. The opening of the new terminal is planned for the start of summer flight schedule in 2026.\n\nThe ranking of the top 10 airports in Europe, which has changed due to the crisis, is slowly returning to the pre-crisis structure (ranking according to ACI Europe; as of: February 2023). With 48.9 million passengers, Frankfurt Airport ranked sixth among the leading airports in terms of passengers in the reporting year. The Group airport Antalya (31.2 million passengers) ranked tenth. In Germany, Frankfurt Airport was the largest passenger airport, ahead of Munich with 31.6 million passengers in the same period. Based on its air freight turnover of approximately 1.9 million metric tons, Frankfurt has remained Europe's leading airport in the same period, ahead of Paris Charles de Gaulle. In Germany, Leipzig/Halle Airport was the next largest competitor, with 1.5 million metric tons of freight.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Competetive position in Europe**\n\n| Rank1) | 2023 | 2022 | 2019 | Airport         | Passengers | delta % | Rank1) | 2023 | 2022 | 2019 | Airport         | Air freight | delta % |\n|--------|------|------|------|-----------------|------------|---------|--------|------|------|------|-----------------|-------------|---------|\n|        | 1.   | 2.   | 1.   | LHR - London    | 79,183,190 | 28.5    |        | 1.   | 1.   | 1.   | FRA - Frankfurt | 1,828,091   | -5.0    |\n|        | 2.   | 1.   | 5.   | IST - Istanbul  | 75,899,236 | 18.1    |        | 2.   | 2.   | 2.   | CDG - Paris     | 1,814,952   | -1.8    |\n|        | 3.   | 3.   | 2.   | CDG - Paris     | 67,424,082 | 17.3    |        | 3.   | 5.   | 5.   | IST - Istanbul  | 1,516,396   | 6.3     |\n|        | 4.   | 4.   | 3.   | AMS - Amsterdam | 61,889,586 | 17.9    |        | 4.   | 6.   | 3.   | LHR - London    | 1,387,059   | 2.7     |\n|        | 5.   | 5.   | 6.   | MAD - Madrid    | 60,181,604 | 18.9    |        | 5.   | 4.   | 4.   | AMS - Amsterdam | 1,378,041   | -4.2    |\n|        | 6.   | 6.   | 4.   | FRA - Frankfurt | 59,355,389 | 21.3    |        | 6.   | 10.  | 11.  | MXP - Milan     | 665,655     | -7.0    |\n|        | 7.   | 7.   | 7.   | BCN - Barcelona | 49,883,928 | 19.9    |        | 7.   | 12.  | 10.  | MAD - Madrid    | 643,534     | 13.0    |\n|        | 8.   | 8.   | 10.  | LGW - London    | 40,902,076 | 24.5    |        | 8.   | 11.  | 12.  | BRU - Brussels  | 579,549     | -5.9    |\n|        | 9.   | 12.  | 11.  | FCO - Rome      | 40,494,654 | 38.0    |        | 9.   | 16.  | 15.  | MUC - Munich    | 277,200     | 7.3     |\n|        | 10.  | 11.  | 13.  | SAW - Istanbul  | 37,097,582 | 20.5    |        | 10.  | 15.  | 16.  | ZRH - Zurich    | 268,164     | -0.2    |\n\n1) Ranking according to ACI Europe (February 2024).\n\n#### **Competitive Position Outside the Frankfurt Site**\n\nImage /page/45/Figure/8 description: This image is a world map showing the locations of various cities.

As an originating airport, Ljubljana is in particular in competition with airports in its catchment area, such as Zagreb Airport near the border. Compared to the previous year, the airport recorded a clear recovery in traffic. This is mainly due to improved connectivity and the resumption of flight connections that were temporarily suspended due to the bankruptcy of Adria Airways in the fall of 2019 and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Alongside a large number of connections to European capitals and business sites, an increasing number of charter flight connections to tourist regions continued to contribute to the appeal of the site and the airport.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nPassenger numbers at the two Brazilian airports **Porto Alegre** and **Fortaleza** are strongly influenced by domestic originating traffic. The share of domestic passenger numbers was around 95% in both Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. The three major airlines LATAM Brazil, GOL and Azul continue to dominate the Brazilian market and accordingly offer numerous connections from Porto Alegre and Fortaleza. Porto Alegre benefits from its geographical proximity to the economic center of Brazil. Fortaleza Airport is highly tourist-oriented and is conveniently located for flights to Europe and North America. However, during the year the airport was affected by the weak development of the economy and a decline in tourist numbers. In addition, GOL has moved part of its fleet to other Brazilian sites. Freight volumes at both airports developed positively.\n\nThe Jorge Chávez Airport in **Lima** is Peru's leading airport, and one of the largest airports in South America. The site profits from its geographical position, which makes the airport an attractive transfer point for traffic between South and North America. LATAM Airlines Group has the largest share of aircraft movements and passengers at Lima Airport. The largest low-cost airlines at the site, SKY Airline and Jetsmart, continue to pursue a growth strategy and contribute to positive traffic growth. The expansion project at the Jorge Chávez Airport includes the construction of a new passenger terminal, a new runway, including aprons and taxiways, as well as other peripheral infrastructure. This will ensure that sufficient capacity is available for further growth in the South American aviation market in the future. The second runway and the air traffic control tower started operations in April 2023. The construction of the new passenger terminal continues to progress. It is scheduled to open at the end of 2024.\n\nThe traffic and business developments at the strongly tourist-oriented Greek sites, at Varna and Burgas, as well as in Antalya are substantially affected by charter traffic of tourist carriers. There is generally no substantial concentration of individual airlines. In addition to the economic development in each respective country where the traffic originates, the sites depend particularly on the appeal of the respective regions with regard to safety, quality, price level, and entry requirements.\n\n**Fraport Greece** operates 14 Greek regional airports. These are the airports in Kerkyra (Corfu), Chania (Crete), Kefalonia, Kavala, Aktio/Preveza, Thessaloniki, Zakynthos, Mykonos, Skiathos, Santorini (Thira), Kos, Mytilene (Lesbos), Rhodes, and Samos. The development at the Greek Group airports is mainly characterized by tourist traffic. Greece's appeal as a tourism destination and the associated potential for a further increase in demand should continue in the coming years. Despite isolated natural events, such as the forest fires on Rhodes and Corfu, traffic figures continued to increase and reached a new peak in 2023.\n\nThe Black Sea airports in **Burgas** and **Varna** are the second- and third-largest passenger airports in Bulgaria after Sofia. The flight schedule included 64 destinations in Varna and 75 destinations in Burgas in 2023. In addition to charter services, low-cost transport promises further growth potential. Wizz Air provided the largest share of passengers by far, at around 26%. In 2023, the airline stationed three aircraft in Varna, two since October 2023. The modular expansion of the terminals at both sites offer sufficient capacity to be able to meet the regional growth expected in the medium term.\n\n**Antalya** was the second-largest passenger airport in Turkey in the past fiscal year, behind Istanbul Airport, and remains one of the most important tourist airports in the Mediterranean region. The demand for holiday travel to the region is essential for the further development of traffic at Antalya Airport. This depends on the political and economic situation in the countries of origin of the main passenger groups as well as Turkey. At the end of 2021, a consortium made up of Fraport and its Turkish partner TAV was awarded the tender for the new operating concession at Antalya Airport. The operational period of the new concession will start at the beginning of 2027 after the current concession expires, and will run until the end of 2051. As part of the new concession, necessary expansion measures at the terminals and other areas at the airport began in the first quarter of 2022. The completion of the main infrastructure measures is expected until January 2025. This will ensure Antalya Airport will remain highly competitive in the segment of tourist airports in the Mediterranean region in the long term.\n\nAdditional information about business development in the past fiscal year can be found in the \"Economic Report\" chapter.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Strategy**\n\n#### **Long-term market development remains positive despite short-term volatility**\n\nFollowing the worldwide traffic decline caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the volume of traffic is recovering globally. In the long term, stable growth of the aviation market is expected to continue. Fraport aligns its strategy to the long-term forecasted development of the global aviation market and its trends. In particular, projected global economic growth and stable world trade will have a positive impact on the development. The world's growing population, combined with the expanding middle class, which tends to consume more, are the main factors driving tourism demand. Disproportionate growth is still expected from and in the economic emerging markets.\n\n#### Long-term market development\n\nImage /page/47/Figure/8 description: The image shows a forecast for the long-term development of global air traffic. The forecast is underpinned by growth prospects. The image shows that growing global gross domestic product and increasing global trade will promote the development of air traffic. Globalization and a pronounced trend towards private travel are contributing positively to this development. The source of the forecast is Airbus. The term of the forecast is 2019-2042. The reference is passenger kilometers sold. The average annual growth is +3.6%.\n\n| Airbus  | 2019 – 2042 | Passenger kilometers sold | +3.6% |\n|---------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|\n| Boeing  | 2019 – 2042 | Passenger kilometers sold | +3.7% |\n| Embraer | 2019 – 2042 | Passenger kilometers sold | +3.2% |\n| ACI     | 2019 – 2041 | Number of passengers      | +3.5% |\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Strategic objectives**\n\nThe vision of the Fraport Group, with its five strategic objectives, serves to implement the mission and remains unchanged despite short-term volatility:\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/6 description: The image shows the vision and values of an organization, likely an airport operator. The vision statement reads, \"Our vision: We are Europe's best airport operator and set standards worldwide.\" The values are represented by icons and short descriptions within blue squares. These include: Growth in Frankfurt and internationally (airplane icon with bar graph), Service-oriented airport operator (person with briefcase icon), Economically successful through optimal cooperation (currency icons with graph), Learning organization & digitalization (people with @ symbol icon), and Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors (hand holding people icon).\n\nA description as well as target values and time horizons for the most important financial and important non-financial key figures can be found in the \"Control system\" chapter, and the development during the past fiscal year can be found in the \"Economic Report\" chapter. The forecast values for the key financial performance indicators for the 2024 fiscal year are included in the \"Outlook Report\" chapter. Substantial risks and opportunities can be found in the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter.\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/8 description: The image is a square icon with a white background and a blue border. Inside the square, there is a blue silhouette of an airplane flying diagonally upwards from left to right. Below the airplane, there is a blue bar graph with several vertical bars of varying heights.\n\n#### **Growth in Frankfurt and internationally**\n\nThe expected market development indicates that air traffic will remain a growth market. Against this background, Fraport is aligning the company to ensure competitiveness and to participate sustainably in this growth – both at the Frankfurt site and internationally.\n\nBased on this, it is expected that traffic volume at Group airports will follow the general market trend, the aviation value added will increase, and sustainable EBITDA growth will be achieved in the non-aviation segment. The international business is also expected to continue to grow and contribute to the Group EBITDA and result.\n\nAt the Frankfurt site, the construction of Terminal 3 will secure the infrastructure required for growth in the long term. Construction is progressing according to plan, and the new terminal will open for the 2026 summer flight schedule. The resulting additional capacity of around 20 million passengers will make it possible to gradually modernize older terminal infrastructure. In particular, Terminal 2 will be temporarily closed and modernized.\n\nThe role of Frankfurt Airport as one of the leading cargo hubs in Europe will also be strengthened, and freight will be developed as a business field. Infrastructural expansion areas at Frankfurt Airport, the e-commerce segment, and the forecasted overall economic upswing are expected to contribute to growth in freight in the coming years.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nFraport is continuing the expansion measures required to meet capacity that it has begun at international sites. In Peru, expansion measures are well advanced. The new terminal will be opened at the end of 2024 following the inauguration of the runway and air traffic control tower. Compared to 23.6 million passengers carried in 2019, the airport's capacity will be increasing to around 40 million passengers. The terminal at Varna Airport in Bulgaria is also to be expanded in the next few years.\n\nFraport particularly uses the passenger numbers at Frankfurt Airport as well as at the Group airports as an indicator for the Groupwide growth in traffic. Fraport measures Group-wide growth in the result and controls this, among other things, by monitoring the development of Group EBITDA and the Group result, the ROFRA (Return on Fraport Assets), net financial debt to EBITDA ratio, and free cash flow. In view of the dynamic economic environment, Fraport is also focusing on securing Group liquidity in the long term.\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/7 description: The image is a square sign with a blue border. Inside the square, there is a blue figure of a person walking with a briefcase in their left hand. To the right of the person, there is a white circle with a simple smiley face inside. The background of the sign is white.\n\n#### **Service-oriented airport operator**\n\nMotivated employees, efficient processes and infrastructure that meets current needs ensure that Group airports reach a leading position in their respective aviation market and underpin the claim of Fraport of having a strong customer and service orientation at all sites.\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, Fraport is responsible for the organization, control, and implementation of aviation security checks at Frankfurt Airport. This is a substantial milestone in optimizing control of the travel process. In combination with the gradual rollout of new computer tomography (CT) scanners, queues at security checkpoints will be reduced. Customer experience will improve as a result.\n\nIn order to further strengthen the hub function of the Frankfurt site, the security checkpoint in Terminal 1 B will be relocated over the next few years. This will increase capacity for checks and create easier transfer processes as well as a new airside shopping area.\n\nIn addition to the passengers, airport business partners including airlines, retailers, and logistics specialists are of key importance to Fraport. Fraport aims to provide its partners Group-wide with a good commercial basis. Processes and interfaces are technologically supported and are intended to be improved continuously. This simplifies and accelerates processes. With the founding of FraAlliance GmbH, Fraport and Lufthansa have strengthened their strategic and operational cooperation at the Frankfurt site. The main focus in the reporting period was on improving the gastronomic and retail offerings.\n\nCustomer and service orientation will also be continually improved at the other Group airports. Understanding customer needs and obtaining feedback is essential for this. This is why customer surveys are regularly conducted in Frankfurt and at the Group airports. The global passenger satisfaction reflects the effectiveness and success of the passenger-oriented processes and service offers. Also, baggage connectivity is an essential measure for performance of the Frankfurt hub airport. The punctuality rate is another quality indicator for Frankfurt as a hub airport.\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/14 description: The image is a square icon with a white background and a blue border. Inside the border, there is a blue rectangle containing a line graph, a euro symbol, a dollar sign, and the letters \"RS\" inside a circle.\n\n#### **Economically successful through optimal cooperation**\n\nFraport aims to ensure that Group companies, business fields and services perform with quality and cost structures that can compete with specialized aviation service providers. Optimized collaboration enables the operating cost to be reduced further and made more flexible.\n\nIn order to support the restart of air traffic and ensure the long-term success of Fraport, the focus is on adapting the organization and its processes. Among other things, a bundling of ground services in Frankfurt within the framework of a joint operation is planned. This should improve the quality and profitability of the business model.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/5 description: The image shows a blue and white icon. The icon depicts four stylized figures, arranged in a group, with an \"@\" symbol above them. The figures are simple, with round heads and no facial features. They are positioned as if they are sitting around a table or gathered together. The \"@\" symbol is located in the upper right corner of the icon, suggesting a connection to communication or networking.\n\n#### **Learning organization & digitalization**\n\nFlexible and fast response is part of everyday operations for Fraport. The intention is for risks and opportunities to be recognized at an early stage, and changes in the market anticipated. Learning takes place every day and everywhere, both in terms of leadership and in the area of expertise. This also includes the regular exchange of technical experts within the Group on specific airport management issues. One example of this is the \"Sustainability X-Change,\" in which sustainability experts and managing directors of the international Group companies and Fraport AG regularly exchange ideas and drive forward joint projects. The main focus in 2023 was to extend the decarbonization master plan to the Group level.\n\nThe volatile business environment in which Fraport operates requires a high level of adaptability from the organization and its staff. Fraport is increasingly building on digital solutions with collaborative value creation and is thus consistently implementing its digitalization and innovation strategy. The partnership with Microsoft established as part of the AI@FRA initiative is primarily used to improve the handling process in flight operations. The first concrete use cases for artificial intelligence are also being worked on in the administrative area. The basis for this work is, among other things, appropriate data quality. The Data Literacy training program aims to consistently prepare employees for more data-based work. Fraport considers digitalization and innovation to be a lever to improve customer satisfaction and financial performance indicators. All the projects listed above aim to open up earnings potential or reduce costs, and thus increase competitiveness.\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/9 description: The image is a blue square containing a white background. In the foreground is a blue hand with the palm facing upwards. On the hand is a house, a tree, and a family of three people. The family consists of a man, a woman, and a child.\n\n#### **Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors**\n\nOne focus of the Fraport Group's sustainability activities is to treat partners, neighbors, and natural resources respectfully throughout the Group.\n\nBeing a good neighbor means communal, cultural, and social engagement in the respective regions. At the Group sites, the regions close to the airport benefit from the economic performance of the airports. Donations or sponsoring activities are carried out independently by the Group companies.\n\nActive and passive noise abatement serves to reduce the negative effects of aviation traffic on its environment. Emission-related airport charges at the Frankfurt site provide financial incentives for airlines to use aircraft with low pollutant and noise emissions. Noise protection measures in accordance with national and local noise protection regulations have been applied and monitoring systems implemented at Group airports as well.\n\nIn addition, Fraport feels responsible for meeting ecological requirements. In the field of climate protection, Fraport is pursuing the goal of reducing Group-wide CO<sup>2</sup> emissions to a maximum of 95,000 metric tons by 2030. Fraport aims to be carbon-free by 2045. No emissions will be compensated. In 2022, the \"Decarbonization Master Plan\" for Fraport AG was developed as a policy paper for decarbonization. It derives an overall concept for reducing CO₂ emissions from the scientific and legal framework conditions as well as the technical possibilities and provides a comprehensive view and structuring of the measures to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. In the 2023 fiscal year, the master plan was also rolled out to the relevant Group companies. Key components include packages of measures to increase energy efficiency, the conversion of the vehicle fleet to electric drives and the procurement of energy from renewable sources.\n\nWith regard to social sustainability aspects, Fraport also retains qualified and motivated employees as an attractive and responsible employer, among other things with systematic further development offers and talent management programs. For this purpose, the HRneo strategic program was launched in 2023. It comprehensively addresses the requirements of the personnel market and aims to position Fraport as a top employer. In this way, Fraport aims to secure its own long-term competitiveness in an increasingly tight labor market. HRneo takes a holistic view of HR work and will also revise the current understanding of leadership.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nComprehensive, integrated occupational health and safety is also an important component of the Fraport Group's understanding of sustainability.\n\nFraport respects and promotes personal diversity and attaches great importance to ensuring that this is reflected in the way employees interact with each other. The Group agreement \"Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace\" forms the platform for principles such as freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities. Fraport places particular emphasis on development measures aimed at increasing the proportion of women in management positions. This applies to management positions at levels 1 and 2 below the Executive Board, as well as the respective management boards and the management level below them at the German Group companies.\n\nFraport uses the key indicators of employee satisfaction, the proportion of women in management positions, the sickness rate, and level of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions to monitor its sustainability activities.\n\n# **Research and Development**\n\nFraport does not conduct research and development in the narrowest sense. Nevertheless, the company is eager to ensure necessary developments are made and to integrate market proven solutions in a timely manner. The focus therefore lies on continuously observing markets and technologies in order to identify and implement promising developments at an early stage.\n\n# **Legal Disclosures**\n\nAs a listed corporation headquartered in Germany, Fraport AG is subject to a number of statutory disclosure requirements. Important reporting obligations that apply to this combined management report as a result of these requirements are shown in the following.\n\n#### **Takeover-related disclosures**\n\nThe capital stock of Fraport AG is €924,687,040. It is divided into 92,468,704 no-par-value bearer shares. The company holds treasury shares (77,365 shares), which are offset from capital stock on the balance sheet. The issued capital stated in the commercial balance sheet as at December 31, 2023 and reduced by treasury shares is €923,913,390 (92,391,339 no-par-value shares). There are no differing classes of shares. Additional information regarding treasury shares in accordance with Section 160 (1) no. 2 of the AktG can be found in the Group notes, note 31, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 28.\n\nThe shares of Fraport AG are not subject to any restrictions on voting rights under the company statutes or the law. None of the shares issued by Fraport AG certify any rights that confer special supervisory powers on the holders. In the event of a change of control following a takeover bid, there are no compensation agreements with members of the Executive Board or employees.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of Executive Board members is carried out in compliance with the relevant provisions of AktG (Sections 84 and 85). Pursuant to Section 179 (1) sentence 2 AktG in conjunction with Section 11 (3) of the company statutes, the Supervisory Board is entitled to amend the company statutes only with respect to the wording. Other amendments to the company statutes require a resolution of the Annual General Meeting, which, according to Section 18 (1) of the company statutes, must be passed in general by a simple majority of the votes cast and, provided that a capital majority is required, by a simple majority of the capital stock represented at the time of the resolution. If, by way of exception, the law requires a higher capital majority (e.g., when changing the purpose of the company as stated in the company statutes, Section 179 (2) sentence 1 AktG; or when creating contingent capital, Section 193 (1) sentence 1 AktG), the resolution of the Annual General Meeting has to be passed by a three-quarter majority of the represented capital stock.\n\nThe Executive Board is entitled, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock on one or more occasions by up to a total of €458,843,520.00 until May 31, 2026 by issuing up to 45,884,352 new no-par value bearer shares in return for cash (\"Authorized Capital II\"). In principle, the shareholders are to be granted a subscription right. The new shares may also be acquired by a credit institution to be determined by the Executive Board or a company (financial institution) acting in accordance with the first sentence of Section 53(1) of the German Banking Act (KWG) or the first sentence of Section 53b(1) or Section 53b(7)\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nKWG or a consortium of such credit or financial institutions with the obligation to offer them to the company's shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription right). The new shares will participate in the net income from the beginning of the fiscal year of their issue. To the extent legally permissible, the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and in deviation from Section 60 (2) AktG, can determine that the new shares will participate in net income from the beginning of a fiscal year that has already expired and for which no resolution has yet been passed by the Annual General Meeting on the appropriation of the profit earmarked for distribution at the time of their issue. The Executive Board is further authorized, also with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders one or more occasions, insofar as this is necessary to compensate for residual amounts. The Executive Board is authorized to determine, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, the further details of the capital increase, the further content of the share rights and the terms and conditions of the issue of shares. The Supervisory Board is authorized to adjust the wording of Section 4 of the company statutes in accordance with the respective utilization of Authorized Capital II and after the expiration of the authorization period.\n\nThe capital stock is conditionally increased by up to €120,209,310.00 through the issue of up to 12,020,931 new no-par value bearer shares (Contingent Capital). The contingent capital serves exclusively to grant shares to the holders or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants or a combination of all these instruments, which are issued by the company in accordance with the authorization up to May 31, 2026 resolved by the Annual General Meeting on June 1, 2021 under agenda item 7 a) and grant a conversion or option right to new no-par value bearer shares in the company or determine a conversion or option obligation or a right to tender and insofar as the issue takes place in return for cash. The new shares are issued at the conversion or option price to be determined according to the previously mentioned authorization resolution. The contingent capital increase is only to be carried out to the extent that conversion or option rights are exercised, or the conversion/option obligation is satisfied, or shares are tendered, and no other forms of fulfillment are used. The new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created by exercising conversion or option rights or through the fulfillment of corresponding obligations (fiscal year of origin); in deviation from this, the new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created if the Annual General Meeting has not yet passed a resolution on the utilization of the profit earmarked for distribution from the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created. The Executive Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the implementation of conditional capital increases.\n\nAs part of the annual employee stock program, 35,625 shares of Fraport AG were issued in the reporting period, which are subject to a one-year lock-up period. In addition, each member of the Executive Board is obliged to acquire shares of Fraport AG in the amount of at least one annual gross base remuneration within a five-year establishment phase in annual installments, and to hold them permanently during their membership on the Executive Board.\n\nFurthermore, there are loans with contractually agreed credit clauses. These clauses relate, among other things, to changes in the shareholder structure, and control of the company. If these changes have a proven negative effect on the credit rating of Fraport AG, the creditors have, above a certain threshold, the right to call the loans due ahead of time on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOn the basis of the consortium agreement concluded between the State of Hesse and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH dated April 18/23, 2001 with a supplement as at December 2, 2014, the total voting rights in Fraport AG held by both shareholders, calculated in accordance with Section 34 (2) of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG), amounted to 52.23% as at December 31, 2023. Of this, the State of Hesse held 31.31% and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH 20.92%. The voting rights in Fraport AG owned by the City of Frankfurt/Main are held indirectly via the Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH subsidiary.\n\n#### **Report on the relationships with affiliated companies**\n\nDue to the shares of 31.31% (previous year: 31.31%) held by the State of Hesse and 20.92% (previous year: 20.92%) held by Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, as well as the consortium agreement concluded between these shareholders on April 18/23, 2001 with a supplement as at December 2, 2014, Fraport AG is a publicly controlled enterprise. There are no control or profit transfer agreements.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Executive Board of Fraport AG therefore compiles a report on the relationships with affiliated companies in accordance with Section 312 of the AktG. At the end of the report, the Executive Board made the following statement: \"The Executive Board declares that under the circumstances known to us at the time, Fraport AG received fair and adequate compensation for each and every legal transaction conducted. During the reporting year, measures were neither taken nor omitted at the request of or in the interests of the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt am Main and their affiliated companies.\"\n\n#### **Combined Statement on Corporate Governance**\n\nThe Fraport AG Executive Board reports – in the name of the Supervisory Board as well – on the contents subject to the reporting requirements pursuant to Section 289f of the German Commercial Code (HGB) for Fraport AG as well as for the Fraport Group as part of a combined statement on corporate governance pursuant to Section 289f HGB and Section 315d HGB read in conjunction with Section 289f HGB, in order to enable a general statement on the Group's corporate governance principles. The combined statement on corporate governance is published in the \"To our shareholders\" chapter and on the corporate website at www.fraport.com/en/investors/corporate-governance.html.\n\n#### **Information in accordance with the German Energy Economics Act (EnWG)**\n\nFraport AG operates its own energy supply network and in mid-2011 applied for the status of \"closed distribution network\", which is associated with considerable benefits compared to general supply networks. In accordance with the requirements of Section 6b of the EnWG (German Energy Industry Act), Fraport AG is obliged to prepare separate business statements. The regulations were applied in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Network Agency in the 2023 annual financial statements.\n\n#### **Annual General Meeting (AGM)**\n\nAt the past virtual AGM on May 23, 2023, Fraport received a clear majority from its shareholders on all agenda items. Of the capital entitled to vote, 73,253,707 no-par-value shares and the same number of voting rights (79.22% of capital) were exercised. The AGM for the 2023 fiscal year will be held on May 28, 2024 as an in person meeting.\n\n# **Control system**\n\nThe \"Control system\" chapter explains the key indicators used by the Executive Board to make the corporate measures taken as part of the Group strategy measurable and to evaluate them\n\n#### **Changes compared with the previous year**\n\nThe following changes were made to the Group's control system in the 2023 fiscal year. The \"Non-financial performance indicators\" section is part of the \"Combined non-financial statement.\" As in the previous year, the non-financial performance indicators are still presented in this chapter. The Executive Board dealt with the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). In preparation for the implementation, the control system was determined and checked to ensure it was up to date. The first step was to analyze and define the non-financial performance indicators. A comprehensive revision of the control system, along with the adoption of the materiality matrix and the further development of the Fraport.2030 Group strategy, is planned for 2024 (see also the \"Business outlook\" chapter). The relevance of the key financial performance indicators to control activities was confirmed for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nAs planned, the employee satisfaction indicator was not measured during the reporting period. The focus is on the development and implementation of measures derived from the last survey in 2022.\n\nBeginning with the reporting for the 2023 fiscal year, the Executive Board will focus on the following financial and non-financial performance indicators, the developments of which are presented in the \"Group results of operations,\" \"Asset and financial position,\" \"Value management,\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters. Corresponding forecasts for the key financial performance indicators have been stated in the \"Business outlook\" chapter.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Financial performance indicators**\n\n### **Overview financial key performance indicators**\n\n| Topic                                               | Target                                                               | Key figure                      | Scope      | Term      | Target level                                                   | Value 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Earnings position/<br>Assets and financial position | We generate<br>long-term earnings<br>growth and maintain             | EBITDA<br>(€ million)           | Group      | 2024      | Between roughly<br>€1,260 million and<br>around €1,360 million | 1,204.0    |\n|                                                     | financial strength at a<br>high level despite<br>future investments. | Group result<br>(€ million)     | Group      | 2024      | Between around<br>€435 million and<br>roughly €530 million     | 430.5      |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Free Cash Flow<br>(€ million)   | Group      | 2024      | Negative mid<br>three-digit<br>million € amount                | -656.4     |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Group liquidity<br>(€ million)  | Group      | Long term | ≥ €1 billion,<br>temporarily<br>clearly higher                 | 4,041.3    |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Net financial<br>debt to EBITDA | Group      | Long term | Max. 5x                                                        | 6.4        |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | ROFRA (%)                       | Group      | Long term | >WACC (2023: 7.6 %)                                            | 6.6        |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Net profit<br>(€ million)       | Fraport AG | Long term | Between around<br>€300 million and<br>roughly €350 million     | 329.1      |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Liquidity<br>(€ million)        | Fraport AG | Long term | ≥ €1 billion,<br>temporarily<br>clearly higher                 | 3,285.6    |\n\nFor Fraport, the growth-oriented development of financial performance indicators is critical for the long-term success of the company. The overriding importance of these indicators is reflected in the Group strategy as a set of criteria for the Group objectives \"Growth in Frankfurt and internationally\" and \"Economically successful through optimal cooperation\". Control, derived from the Group strategy, is carried out primarily at the Group level, and segment-specific key figures are used to support this.\n\nFraport uses key figures relating to the consolidated results of operations and to the Group asset and financial position, as well as key figures that link the results of operations with the asset and financial position (value management), as key financial performance indicators. In accordance with the long-term oriented Group strategy, the Executive Board manages and evaluates the development of financial performance indicators while also taking account of long-term forecasted market developments. In this context, strategic measures – such as the implementation of larger capital expenditure projects or the expansion of international business – can also lead to a short- to medium-term burden on the financial performance indicators.\n\nThe key financial performance indicators and their significance for Fraport are described in the following. The description of their development during the past fiscal year can be found in the \"The Group's results of operations\", \"Asset and financial position\", and \"Value management\" chapters. The associated forecasted figures for the 2024 fiscal year can be found in the \"Business outlook\" chapter. Definitions for calculating the financial key figures can be found in the \"Glossary\" chapter.\n\n## **Results of operations key figures**\n\nThe results of operations include the presentation and explanation of significant earnings components and key figures. While the results of operations in the context of regular reporting provide information about the past business development and are forecasted in the business outlook, earnings forecasts are also regularly drawn up over long-term periods for internal planning purposes. The information resulting from this is relevant for the Executive Board in relation to the company's long-term management.\n\nThe most important financial performance indicators for Fraport are **EBITDA** and the **Group result**.\n\nEBITDA and, indirectly, the Group result through the earnings per share (EPS) are a component of the Executive Board remuneration and underline the relevance of these financial key figures as a control element.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Asset and financial position key figures**\n\nAs well as in the results of operations, the result of the strategically adopted measures and operating activities of Fraport is also reflected in the Group's asset and financial position. For Fraport, in particular the development of the net financial debt to EBITDA ratio and the free cash flow are significant. Also, under the influence of the coronavirus pandemic Group liquidity was introduced as a control parameter.\n\nThe net financial debt to EBITDA ratio and the free cash flow in particular serve as key financial indicators to the Executive Board to assess financial strength. The **net financial debt to EBITDA** ratio provides information on the financial stability of the company and how many years are required to service the net financial debt via EBITDA. Net financial debt consists of long-term and shortterm financial liabilities less Group liquidity. The Executive Board has decided on a ratio of a maximum of 5 for this performance indicator and is resolved to reach this target value again in the medium term after the effects of the coronavirus pandemic are overcome.\n\n**Free cash flow** is the result of the cash flow from operating activities less the effects resulting from the application of IFRS 16, investments in airport operating projects, capital expenditure for other intangible assets, capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment, investments for \"investment property\" and capital expenditure in companies accounted for using the equity method, plus dividends from companies accounted for using the equity method. The free cash flow provides information about the financial funds available to the Group from the operating activities of a period after deducting operating capital expenditure activities. These free funds can be retained in order to increase the company's liquidity and to be available as a financial reserve for future capital expenditure or to reduce the leverage (the gearing ratio) and/or can be distributed among shareholders as dividends. Due to the ongoing capital expenditure for expansion activities in Frankfurt and internationally, as well as the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the operating activities of Fraport, the free cash flow continues to be extraordinarily burdened and temporarily negative. In the medium term, the aim is to achieve a clear increase in free cash flow in positive territory.\n\n**Group liquidity** includes cash and cash equivalents (as at the statement of financial position) plus short-term realizable items in \"other financial assets\" and \"other receivables and financial assets.\" This key figure provides information on the financial stability of the Fraport Group, even over a long period of time. The Executive Board also aims for liquidity of at least €1 billion in the long term. Against the backdrop of the current macroeconomic volatilities and the high level of debt related to the pandemic, a temporarily significantly higher level of liquidity is being maintained.\n\n#### **Links between the results of operations and the asset and financial position (value management)**\n\nTo increase the Group's value in the long term, the Executive Board specifically draws parallels between the development of the results of operations and the asset and financial position. In this context, the Executive Board plans and manages the Group's development according to the principles of value management.\n\nAt Fraport, the most important measurement and steering figure of this approach is the **\"Return on Fraport assets\"**, in short: **ROFRA**, which makes the different-sized segments of the Fraport Group comparable in terms of economic enhancement. Compared to the current WACC, the ROFRA shows whether the business units created value (ROFRA > WACC) or not (ROFRA < WACC).\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders [Fraport Annual Report](#page-5-0) 2023 *[Combined Management Report](#page-39-0)* [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) Combined M[anagement Report](#page-144-0) / S[ituation of the Group](#page-236-0) Group Notes Further Information 47\n\nFurther Information\n\nImage /page/56/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram that defines ROFRA as Adjusted EBIT divided by Fraport-Assets. Adjusted EBIT is calculated as EBIT plus Pre-tax result of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method. Fraport-Assets is calculated as Goodwill plus Other intangible assets at cost/2 plus Investments in airport operating projects at cost/2 plus Construction in progress and lands at cost plus Other property, plant, and equipment at cost/2 plus Carrying amounts of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method and other investments plus Inventories plus Trade accounts receivable minus Current trade accounts payable.\n\nThe ROFRA is calculated on the basis of the EBIT extended by the results before taxes of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method divided by the Fraport assets. The Fraport assets are defined as the average of the Group's or segments' fixed interest-bearing capital required for operations including the carrying amounts of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method. To avoid economic enhancement coming solely from depreciation and amortization of assets, the Executive Board recognizes regularly depreciable or amortizable assets within Fraport assets at half of their historical acquisition/manufacturing costs (at cost/2), and not at residual carrying amounts. Goodwill and investments in Group companies accounted for using the equity method and other assets not included in depreciation and amortization, in particular assets in construction, are recognized in full at cost because they are not subject to regular depreciation and amortization. Within the scope of the initial implementation of IFRS 16, other property, plant, and equipment also includes the rights to use resulting from leasing contracts. They are included in the calculation as half at costs.\n\nROFRA is also an element of the Executive Board remuneration and underlines the long-term goal of Group-wide business activities that create value.\n\n#### **Other important key indicators for the results of operations**\n\nThe **passenger numbers** at the Group sites are of particular importance for the financial development of Fraport. Closely related to this, **revenue** is an important key indicator for measuring the performance of the Group. Details on this can be found in the Group notes, note 5, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 5. In order to limit fluctuations in connection with the recognition of expansion obligations in the balance sheet and thus show organic growth, revenue is adjusted for effects from the application of IFRIC 12 \"Service Concession Agreements\" and reported separately as the key figure **Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12**. **EBIT** – the operating result before interest and taxes \">– is also an important indicator for measuring the operating result in the Group.\n\nAt Fraport AG level, **net income** is a key figure of great importance for the development of shareholders' equity and profit earmarked for distribution. The **liquidity** of Fraport AG is also relevant for management. Against the background of the capitalintensive expansion at the Frankfurt site and the international business as well as the temporarily high net financial debt, the Executive Board is aiming for minimum liquidity that is well above the long-term target of €1 billion.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Value added**\n\nIn addition to the ROFRA, Fraport uses the value added as a measure of economic enhancement. The value added is annually consolidated and recorded at Group and at segment level. It is calculated from the \"adjusted\" EBIT, which also includes the results before taxes of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method, minus the Fraport assets multiplied by the WACC.\n\nImage /page/57/Figure/6 description: The image shows a calculation of the value added. The formula is: Adjusted EBIT - Fraport-Assets x WACC. Each of the terms in the formula is enclosed in a gray box.\n\nThe goal is to generate value added of zero for the regulated Aviation segment, and generate clearly positive values added for the other segments.\n\nFraport calculates the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the capital asset pricing model and uses this regulatory specific WACC to calculate its airport charges. Given the continuously changing economic environment, interest rate levels, and/or Fraport's risk and financing structure, Fraport regularly reviews, and, if needed, adjusts its WACC. The WACC is also used for the value management of the Fraport Group. The WACC for the fiscal year increased compared to the previous year to 7.6% (before taxes, 2022: 7.3%). For details on the use and calculation of the cost of capital in the context of impairment tests, please refer to note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe regulatory WACC is composed as follows:\n\n**Cost of equity**\n\nEquity cost rate\nbefore taxes 14.2%\n\nShareholders' equity ratio 48%\n(based on market value)\n\n**Cost of debt**\n\nDebt cost rate\nbefore taxes 2.1%\n\nDebt ratio 52%\n(interest-bearing 39% /\nnon interest-bearing 13%)\n\nWACC before taxes 7.6%\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 Combined

The clear objective is to raise the company’s own quality and customer satisfaction to a high level. Fraport uses performance indicators for the purposes of measurement and control. The key indicators include the **global satisfaction** of passengers and **baggage connectivity**.\n\n**Global satisfaction** describes passengers' satisfaction with the services and processes offered and the service at Fraport air-\n\nThe target value for global satisfaction of 80% for Frankfurt Airport remained unchanged for fiscal year 2023. This target value is to be maintained at least until the inauguration of Terminal 3. The target value for Group global satisfaction also remained\n\n**Baggage connectivity** provides information about the percentage of baggage at Frankfurt Airport that is loaded on time in relation to the total departing baggage. Baggage connectivity measures, among other things, the performance of the airport in its role as a hub with a transfer share of about 50%, and thus a high proportion of transfer baggage. A high and stable connectivity proves a good quality of baggage processes. The objective remains the achievement of a long-term baggage connectivity of more than\n\nFor Fraport, appeal and responsibility as an employer is, like customer satisfaction and product quality, a key factor to ensure the long-term success of the business. Fraport understands appeal to mean the creation of good working conditions in order to gain and retain committed and qualified employees. To measure and control its appeal and responsibility as an employer, Fraport uses\n\n**Employee satisfaction** is a central instrument for measuring employee mood. Fraport is convinced that satisfied employees achieve higher customer loyalty and improved performance. As of the 2022 reporting year, the key figure is measured every two years on the basis of an extensive survey of the employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies. All labor-intensive Group companies in Frankfurt and in Greece, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Peru, Brazil and the USA participate in the survey.

Diversity is a key goal for Fraport, which is systematically addressed within the framework of diversity management. Fraport AG places particular focus on promoting **women in management positions** at the two levels directly below the Executive Board as well as at the first level directly below the respective management levels at the German Group companies. This is also in line with the objective of the \"Act to Supplement and Amend the Regulations for the Equal Participation of Women in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sector\" (FüPoG II). For reporting purposes, executives who report directly to the Executive Board are categorized as level 1. Executives who report to this first level of management are categorized as level 2. Regarding the Group companies in Germany, the levels of management are categorized based on comparable positions at Fraport AG. The goal is to increase the proportion of women in management positions in the Group in Germany, at the first management level below the Executive Board to 30.8% and at the management level below that to 30.2% by the end of 2026. For Fraport AG, the proportion of women in management positions is to be increased accordingly to 31.8% at the first management level and 30.9% at the lower management level.

Fraport uses performance indicators for the purposes of measurement and control. The key indicators\n\n50 Group Management Report / Situation of the Group Fraport Annual Report 2023\n\nThe target value for global satisfaction of 80% for Frankfurt Airport remained unchanged for fiscal year 2023. This target value is to be maintained at least until the inauguration of Terminal 3. The target value for Group global satisfaction also remained unchanged at 80% after the survey was resumed in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n**Baggage connectivity** provides information about the percentage of baggage at Frankfurt Airport that is loaded on time in relation to the total departing baggage. Baggage connectivity measures, among other things, the performance of the airport in its role as a hub with a transfer share of about 50%, and thus a high proportion of transfer baggage. A high and stable connectivity proves a good quality of baggage processes. The objective remains the achievement of a long-term baggage connectivity of more than 98.5%.\n\n#### **Attractive and responsible employer**\n\nFor Fraport, appeal and responsibility as an employer is, like customer satisfaction and product quality, a key factor to ensure the long-term success of the business. Fraport understands appeal to mean the creation of good working conditions in order to gain and retain committed and qualified employees. To measure and control its appeal and responsibility as an employer, Fraport uses various performance indicators, such as **employee satisfaction** and the ratio of **women in management positions**.\n\n**Employee satisfaction** is a central instrument for measuring employee mood. Fraport is convinced that satisfied employees achieve higher customer loyalty and improved performance. As of the 2022 reporting year, the key figure is measured every two years on the basis of an extensive survey of the employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies. All labor-intensive Group companies in Frankfurt and in Greece, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Peru, Brazil and the USA participate in the survey. The results obtained from this provide the basis for long-term goal setting. The goal is to continuously improve employee satisfaction. By the end of 2026, employee satisfaction at Fraport AG should therefore increase to at least 4.8. If this figure is already reached in 2024, the aim is to improve the 2026 survey result by at least 0.1. The Group is to achieve at least a value of 4.9. Here, too, the value should be at least 0.1 higher than in 2024.\n\nAs a responsible employer, Fraport respects and promotes personal diversity and attaches great importance to ensuring that this is reflected in the way employees interact with each other.

Fraport respects local circumstances and therefore does not impose any quotas based on German law on the foreign Group companies.\n\n#### **Occupational health and safety**\n\nAs a responsible employer, Fraport contributes to increasing and maintaining employees' performance and preventing work-related health hazards through targeted preventative measures in occupational health and safety. Fraport evaluates the effectiveness of the measures for health management using, among other things, the **sickness rate**. The calculation excluding illness-related absences beyond sick pay (extended sick leave) reflects the development of short- and medium-term illnesses. The effects of demographic change in the Group and the corresponding increase in the average age of employees contribute, among other things, to a linear increase in the number of long-term illnesses. The focus is on limiting or reversing the sickness rate, which is increasing due to seasonal and age-related absences, among other things. Beginning with the reporting for 2019,\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders\n\nthe Executive Board has limited the Group sickness rate to the German Group companies. Due to different regional legal regulations, but also due to the personnel structures that differ in the German Group companies, the sickness rate in the international Group companies plays a more subordinate role for local management. The objective, for both the Fraport Group in Germany as well as for Fraport AG, is a maximum rate of 7.2% by 2025.\n\n#### **Climate protection**\n\nThe operation of an airport and air traffic have various effects on the environment. Fraport is committed to the due and proper consideration of the environmental requirements associated with this. Fraport's environmental policy places importance on the sustainable and careful use of natural resources. The Executive Board has determined Scope 1 and 2 **CO<sup>2</sup> emissions** as the most important key figure for measuring environmental impact. In 2022, Fraport adopted the decarbonization master plan. It describes the strategic principles and defines the framework for the implementation of the measures and thus represents a policy document for decarbonization. The continuous implementation of this master plan for Fraport AG started back in 2022, and it was rolled out within the Group in 2023. The aim is to reduce the CO<sup>2</sup> emissions for which Fraport AG, the fully consolidated Group airports managing airport operations worldwide, and the climate-relevant subsidiaries at the Frankfurt site are directly responsible, to 95,000 metric tons by 2030. If necessary, the objective will be adjusted to any changes in Fraport's airport portfolio. Fraport AG seeks to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions at Frankfurt Airport to 50,000 metric tons by 2030. Fraport aims to be completely CO2-free in Scope 1 and 2 CO<sup>2</sup> emissions by 2045, and does not include offsets in the achievement of the targets. Along the way, Fraport has set interim goals for itself. By 2040, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions are to be reduced to 40,000 metric tons in the Group and to 25,000 metric tons at Fraport AG. Compensation is excluded when targets are achieved (\"Net Zero Carbon\" according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Information on CO<sup>2</sup> emissions is based in part on estimates, assumptions and projections and in part comes from external energy service providers.\n\n#### **Finance Management**\n\nThe core objectives of finance management of Fraport AG are **securing liquidity**, **limiting financial risks**, achieving an appropriate level of **profitability**, and ensuring **flexibility**. The highest priority is to secure liquidity. Based on the Group's solid shareholders' equity base, this is generally secured through both internal financing via operating cash flow and external financing in the form of debt. Simple and transparent financing concepts are being pursued in connection with how financing is structured at Fraport AG as well as in the international business activities. Financial risks caused, among other things, by foreign currencies are met first and foremost by financing in the respective currency to the extent possible (natural hedging). The following section shows how finance management is implemented at Fraport AG.\n\nTo secure liquidity, Fraport AG aims to achieve balanced financing composed of bilateral loans, private placements/bonds (capital market), loan financing from public loan institutions, and promissory note loans. In addition, Fraport AG has a strategic liquidity reserve to secure its independence from financing sources. The significant financing measures at Fraport AG are related mainly to refinancing existing financial maturities, and from the capital requirement, particularly for capital expenditure in Terminal 3 at the Frankfurt site and for the international Group companies. Appropriate financing instruments are selected based on the situation, depending on the attractiveness of the price as well as the volume of the financing, and complying with a balanced financing mix. In keeping with the long-term nature of capital expenditure, the financing of these projects is mostly long term as well. In line with the company's finance policy, loans can be borrowed both at a fixed and at a floating interest rate. To reduce interest rate risks from borrowing with floating interest rates, interest rate hedging transactions can be concluded as a rule.\n\nThe majority of the fully consolidated Group companies in Germany are integrated into the Fraport AG cash pool. The liquidity in these Group companies is guaranteed – via access to their own liquidity at any time as well as, within the scope of the agreements also concluded in some cases, to the financial resources of Fraport AG – so that external financing is not necessary. At the same time, the close connection of these Group companies to Fraport AG should also ensure that attention is paid to further strategic objectives of financial management within the Group.\n\nFor the fully consolidated foreign Group companies and the Group companies included using the equity method, liquidity is provided depending on the relevant company shareholding and the market environment, either by concluding project financing, bilateral loans, or by internal provision of funding via a Group loan or shareholders' equity.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>*Economic Report*\n\n# **Information about Reporting**\n\nThis report summarizes the management reports of the Fraport Group and Fraport AG (Combined Management Report). The comments on the Fraport Group also apply to Fraport AG. Developments in the asset, financial, and earnings position of Fraport AG can be found in the chapter \"Supplementary Management Report on the Separate Financial Statements of Fraport AG\".\n\nThe non-financial report complies with the commercial law requirements and was prepared in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e the German Commercial Code (HGB), Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework for facilitating sustainable investment and amending the Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder. It is integrated in the combined management report and can be found in the chapter \"Combined Non-Financial Statement\".\n\nThe section \"Non-financial performance indicators\" is shown as part of the \"Combined Non-Financial Statement\" in the 2023 fiscal year. As in the previous year, the section is presented in the Economic Report.\n\nGroup accounting takes account of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in force on the reporting date (December 31, 2023) and the interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted in the European Union (EU). In addition, Fraport reports the information pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n\nTo better represent the operating development compared with the previous year, revenue is also reported in the combined management report for order revenue from construction and expansion services in accordance with IFRIC 12 (referred to below as: Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12). These relate to the capacitive capital expenditure in connection with service concession agreements at international Group airports (see also Group Notes, note 4 and note 49).\n\nThe Executive Board prepared the combined management report as of December 31, 2023, at its meeting on March 12, 2024, presented the prepared consolidated financial statements to the audit committee and the Supervisory Board for review and approval and released them for publication on March 19,2024.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# **General Statement by the Executive Board**\n\nIn the past fiscal year, most of the Group airports recorded an increase in passenger numbers compared to the previous year. Accordingly, Group revenue amounted to €4,005.5 million, an increase of €806.1 million over the previous year (+25.2%). Adjusted for contract revenue from construction and expansion services based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €621.8 million to €3,485.1 million (+21.7%).\n\nDue to high one-off effects in the previous year, other operating income decreased to €59.0 million in the reporting period, down €80.3 million on the previous year.\n\nOperating expenses (personnel expenses and cost of materials as well as other operating expenses) increased by €562.2 million to €2,906.0 million. Adjusted for expenses related to the application of IFRIC 12, operating expenses stood at €2,390.6 million (+€377.9 million). Group EBITDA was €174.2 million higher than in the previous year at €1,204.0 million thanks to the positive operating development. The financial result improved to –€148.9 million (previous year: –€330.6 million) and resulted in a Group result of €430.5 million (previous year: €166.6 million).\n\nAs a result of the increase in operating result, cash flow from operating activities increased to €863.2 million (previous year: €787.3 million). The free cash flow improved to –€656.4 million (previous year: –€741.0 million). Group liquidity increased by €174.4 million to €4,041.3 million.\n\nThe operational challenges at Frankfurt Airport had a negative effect on the development of non-financial performance indicators such as global satisfaction of passengers and baggage connectivity. In contrast, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions came down despite the higher passenger numbers compared to the previous year.\n\nGiven the macroeconomic developments, the Executive Board continues to describe the traffic and, in turn, financial development in the reporting period as positive.\n\n# **Economic environment**\n\n#### **Development of the macroeconomic conditions**\n\nThe **global economy** lost momentum during the course of the 2023. The global industrial economy was in a weak phase due to sluggish demand globally, and world trade was thus also subdued. Even the trend of decreasing inflation did not provide consumption impulses, and the interest rate hikes of many central banks put a damper on the willingness to invest. The geopolitical crises worldwide provided uncertainty.\n\nConsumer demand from private households was weaker in the **Eurozone** given the less favorable trend in real wages. In addition, the energy price shock from the previous year continues to burden the industrial economy, in particular in Central Europe.\n\nThe export-oriented **German economy** suffered under the global economic weakness and slipped into a recession. The loss of purchasing power and the continued consumer uncertainty slowed down private consumption. Besides industry, value creation in construction and trade also declined. On the whole, the German economy performed weaker than the European average.\n\nIn the **US**, the economy proved to be robust, contrary to expectations. Despite the restrictive monetary policy, consumer sentiment remained positive. Inflationary pressure in **emerging markets** declined noticeably during the course of the year. The development within this group was mixed. In China, the economy was negatively affected in particular by the downturn in the real estate market and the debt overhang, despite government support measures.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Gross domestic product (GDP)/world trade1)**\n\n| Real changes compared to the previous year in % | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| World                                           | +3.1 | +3.5 |\n| Eurozone                                        | +0.5 | +3.4 |\n| Germany                                         | -0.3 | +1.8 |\n| USA                                             | +2.5 | +1.5 |\n| Latin America (incl.

Measured against the traffic volume of pre-crisis year 2019, this was equivalent to a recovery of around 84%. In addition to the dominating holiday travel volume, business travel gained momentum during the course of the year. Western European and intercontinental destinations benefited from this in particular. However, **domestic travel** also increasingly recovered primarily due to the feeder traffic function, it remained around 30% below the pre-crisis level however. **European traffic** gained around 16% compared to 2022. **Intercontinental traffic** increased by 28.1% compared to the previous year. This was mainly due to the North America traffic that was almost at the pre-COVID level. Far East traffic grew dynamically by +76.8% compared to the previous year, in particular due to recovery in the China traffic.\n\n**Cargo volume** declined by 5.0% to around 1.9 million metric tons compared to 2022. Compared to 2019, this meant a reduction in tonnage of 10.6%. Demand in the overall economy remained weak. Increasing interest rates had a negative impact on capital expenditure in the industry and persistently high inflation curbed demand.\n\nWith 430,436 **aircraft movements**, growth of just under 13%, or almost, 50,000 flights, compared to the previous year was achieved. This was equivalent to a level of 84% measured against the pre-crisis year 2019. With 394,869 flights, passenger flights in 2023 recovered by a share of around 82% compared to 2019. The occupancy rate for passenger flights achieved new highs almost every month, which resulted in the highest occupancy rates in the history of the airport for 2023 as a whole. The seat load factor of around 81% was approximately three percentage points above the previous year's figure. The quotient **passengers per passenger aircraft movement** increased by around 5% to a high of 150.3. **Maximum take-off weights** increased compared to the previous year by 11.4% to 27.0 million metric tons, thus reaching 85% of the year 2019.\n\n#### **Development outside the Frankfurt site**\n\nThe passenger volume at **Ljubljana** Airport grew by 30.9% to around 1.3 million passengers compared to the previous year. This positive development is primarily due to the resumption of flight connections, which had been suspended due to the temporary insolvency of Adria Airways in autumn 2019 and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPassenger numbers at the Brazilian airports **Fortaleza** and **Porto Alegre** developed in opposite directions due to differing circumstances during the course of the year. In Fortaleza, the decrease in domestic tourist travel and the pullout of some GOL connections were the main reasons for the reduction in domestic passenger numbers. In contrast, Porto Alegre recorded an increase in domestic passenger numbers due to its geographical proximity to important Brazilian aviation hubs in São Paulo and its relevance as an industrial location in southern Brazil. The development of international traffic was positive at both airports. The frequencies and routes on international lines rose successively in particular in South America. On the whole, both airports recorded passenger numbers of 13.1 million passengers. This corresponds to growth of +5.4% compared to 2022. Fortaleza welcomed 5.3 million domestic passengers (–4.5%) and around 0.3 million international passengers (+26.0%) in the year as a whole. Porto Alegre recorded 7.1 million domestic passengers (+10.9%) and around 0.4 million international passengers (+53.0%).\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith around 21.2 million passengers in 2023, **Lima** Airport recorded an increase in traffic compared to the previous year (+14.1%) despite the effects of the political situation in the first half of the year domestic passenger operations recorded around 13.1 million passengers (+11.7%). In the international segment, the airport recorded growth in particular with the connections to North America and Europe. International traffic therefore also made a positive contribution to growth with 8.1 million passengers (+18.2%).\n\nWith around 33.9 million passengers, **Fraport Greece** recorded an increase of around 11.8% in the 2023 reporting period compared to the adjusted previous year's figure of around 30.3 million passengers (adjusted value in the 2022 Annual Report: 31.2 million passengers). Passenger numbers were already above the respective previous year's figures at the beginning of the year. This trend continued during the important main tourist season and the entire year. Overall, domestic traffic was 17.0% above the previous year's level, while international traffic grew by 6.5%. The largest number of foreign passengers in terms of total passengers came from Great Britain (around 20%), followed by Germany (around 14%), and Italy (around 6%).\n\nAt the Bulgarian airports in **Varna** and **Burgas** operated by Fraport Twin Star, the number of passengers in 2023 increased to approximately 3.7 million, 17.9% above the previous year's figure. The overall recovery in traffic after the pandemic was weaker than at other tourist airports in Europe in 2023. In particular, the charter business in Burgas developed below expectations. From the end of February, the war in Ukraine and Israel resulted in a shortfall of Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian and Israeli passengers, which was partly offset by higher demand from Central and Eastern European countries. In addition, more traffic in the off-season in the first half of the year was recorded. For the year as a whole, this led to an increase in both domestic (+6%) and international passenger numbers (+19%) compared to the previous year. Most of the passengers came from Germany (around 20%), Poland (around 17%), and Great Britain (around 15%).\n\nPassenger numbers at **Antalya** Airport in the 2023 fiscal year were around 35.7 million passengers (previous year: 31.1 million). This surpassed the previous record passenger numbers from 2019. International passenger traffic showed a growth rate of +17.1%, while domestic traffic grew by +5.9%. Compared to the previous year, almost all relevant international passenger groups achieved double-digit growth rates. The passenger numbers from Poland, Romania and Germany had particularly strong growth. Due to the war, no passengers were recorded for Ukraine. The largest passenger groups were travelers from Germany (approximately 28%), Russia (approximately 22%), and Great Britain (approximately 10%).\n\n|                   | Share in % | Passengers1) |               | Cargo (air freight + air mail in m. t.) |               | Movements |               |\n|-------------------|------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|\n|                   |            | 2023         | Change in %2) | 2023                                    | Change in %2) | 2023      | Change in %2) |\n|                   |            |              |               |                                         |               |           |               |\n| Frankfurt         | 100        | 59,355,389   | +21.3         | 1,869,090                               | – 5.0         | 430,436   | +12.6         |\n| Ljubljana         | 100        | 1,270,382    | +30.9         | 11,443                                  | – 8.3         | 22,749    | +5.5          |\n| Fortaleza         | 100        | 5,589,563    | – 3.3         | 45,911                                  | +9.9          | 53,199    | – 2.0         |\n| Porto Alegre      | 100        | 7,492,866    | +12.7         | 40,422                                  | +4.9          | 72,634    | +9.4          |\n| Lima              | 80.01      | 21,246,660   | +14.1         | 213,775                                 | – 2.2         | 170,515   | +13.7         |\n| Fraport Greece    | 65         | 33,870,682   | +11.8         | 5,927                                   | +4.8          | 264,744   | +4.9          |\n| Fraport Twin Star | 60         | 3,686,997    | +17.9         | 2,618                                   | – 58.8        | 27,024    | +14.0         |\n| Antalya           | 51/503)    | 35,735,407   | +15.0         | n.a.                                    | n.a.          | 222,235   | +14.8         |\n|                   |            |              |               |                                         |               |           |               |\n\n#### **Traffic development at the signifikant Group sites**\n\n1) Commercial traffic only, in + out + transit.\n\n2) As a result of late submissions, there may be changes to the figures reported for the previous year.\n\n3) Share of voting rights: 51 %, dividend share: 50 %.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Comparison with the forecasted passenger development**\n\n|                   |  | 2023 Adjustments during the year Interim Report Q2/6M 2023  | Forecast 2022                                                   | 20221)     | 2019       |\n|-------------------|--|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Frankfurt         |  | 59,355,389 Middle of the given forecast                     | Passenger growth of over 80% to<br>around 90% of the 2019 level | 48,918,482 | 70,556,072 |\n| Ljubljana         |  | 1,270,382 –                                                 | Approximately 75% of the passenger<br>volume in 2019            | 970,152    | 1,721,355  |\n| Fortaleza         |  | 5,589,563 –                                                 | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 5,778,038  | 7,218,697  |\n| Porto Alegre      |  | 7,492,866 –                                                 | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 6,654,062  | 8,298,205  |\n| Lima              |  | 21,246,660 –                                                | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 18,619,536 | 23,578,600 |\n| Fraport Greece    |  | 33,870,682 Passenger numbers above previous<br>year's level | Approximately at previous yeahr high<br>level                   | 31,193,278 | 30,152,728 |\n| Fraport Twin Star |  | 3,686,997 –                                                 | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 3,127,767  | 4,970,095  |\n| Antalya           |  | 35,735,407 –                                                | Further recovery towards pre-crisis level                       | 31,077,452 | 35,483,190 |\n\n1) As a result of late submissions, there may be changes to the figures reported for the previous year.\n\nPassenger traffic at the Group airports predominantly developed within the forecasts provided in the 2022 Annual Report and adjusted in the second quarter/half-yearly report 2023. Due to the lower number of domestic passengers, the forecast for Fortaleza Airport could not be achieved.\n\n# **Group's Results of Operations**\n\n#### **Revenue**\n\nAt €4,000.5 million, revenue in the Fraport Group in the 2023 fiscal year was above the previous year's figure by €806.1 million. Adjusted for contract revenue from construction and expansion services based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €621.8 million to €3,485.1 million.\n\nThe increase at the Frankfurt site mainly resulted from higher revenue from airport charges (+€196.0 million) as well as higher revenue from infrastructure charges (+€76.4 million) and ground services (+€51.6 million) based on traffic volumes and prices. The retail and parking revenue also increased by +€33.1 million and +€22.7 million respectively based on traffic volume. Due to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved for the first time in the reporting period. In contrast, revenue from security services decreased by €155.3 million compared to the previous year as a result of the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023.\n\nAmong the international Group airports, contributions to adjusted revenue growth came, in particular, from Fraport Greece (+€74.8 million) and the Group company Lima (+€48.5 million) based on the positive traffic developments.\n\n#### **Other operating income**\n\nAt €59.0 million, other operating income was below the previous year by €80.3 million.\n\nIn the reporting period, the two Brazilian Group companies reached a further agreement regarding compensation for the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The reimbursement claims realized amounted to a total of €18.6 million. Furthermore, other operating income was positively impacted by a total of €11.1 million due to the pro-rata disposal and the associated deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023, as well as the recognition of the remaining shares (49%) at fair value. Moreover, income of €11.0 million resulted from the settlement of a legal dispute at the Group company Fraport USA in connection with the early termination of the retail concession agreement in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn contrast, other operating income in the prior year period was impacted positively impacted by the disposal of shares in the Group companies Xi'an (€53.7 million), which is accounted for using the equity method, and D-Port Logistik GmbH (€18.6 million). In addition, other operating income in the previous year included reimbursement claims for Fraport Greece (€23.6 million) and the Brazilian Group companies (€18.5 million).\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Expenses**\n\nPersonnel expenses in the Group increased in the 2023 fiscal year by €39.3 million to €1,076.0 million. Despite a lower average number of employees, the increase is primarily due to increases in the collective bargaining agreement at the Frankfurt site. Non-staff costs (cost of materials and other operating expenses) were €1,830.0 million (+€522.9 million). Adjusted for expenses related to the application of IFRIC 12, non-staff expenses were €1,314.6 million (+€338.6 million). The increase is mainly attributable to higher external services costs (+€224.7 million), primarily in connection with taking over the management of security checks at Frankfurt Airport. In addition, based on traffic volume, higher variable concession charges at the International Group companies (+€69.4 million) and higher expenses for maintenance (+€33.0 million) as well as utility services (+€14.5 million) contributed to the increase in the cost of materials.\n\n#### **EBITDA and EBIT**\n\nAt €1,204.0 million, Group EBITDA was €174.2 million above the level in the same period of the previous year. Greater depreciation and amortization of €501.2 million (+€35.9 million) resulted in Group EBIT of €702.8 million (+€138.3 million).\n\n#### **Financial result**\n\nThe financial result in the reporting period amounted to –€148.9 million (previous year: –€330.6 million). The change compared to the same period of the previous year is essentially due to the other financial result. This was negatively impacted in the previous year by the full write-off of a loan made to Thalita Trading Ltd. in the amount of €163.3 million in connection with the investment in St. Petersburg Airport.\n\nInterest income increased by €47.9 million in the 2023 fiscal year compared to the previous year, primarily due to higher interest from call and time deposits. The interest expenses of –€317.9 million in the reporting period were €4.4 million below the previous year (previous year: –€315.5 million). This was, in particular, a result from higher financing costs at Fraport AG. This was offset by one-off effects in the previous year amounting to –€19.3 million in connection with the refinancing in Greece.\n\nThe result from companies accounted for using the equity method increased by €7.5 million to €84.5 million. This is in particular due to be increase in earnings of the operating company in Antalya (+€22.0 million). The positive one-off effect in the previous year in connection with the write-up of the shares in the Group company Xi'an due to the sale in the amount of €20.0 million was clearly overcompensated by this.\n\n#### **EBT, Group result, and EPS**\n\nEBT in the reporting period amounted to €553.9 million (previous year: €233.9 million). With a consolidated tax rate of 22.3%, the income tax expense amounted to €123.4 million (previous year: €67.3 million). The Group result was €430.5 million (previous year: €166.6 million). This resulted in basic earnings per share of €4.26 (previous year: €1.43).\n\n#### **Development of the Group's financial figures**\n\n| € million                             | 2023    | 2022    | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|\n|                                       |         |         |        |             |\n| Revenue                               | 4,000.5 | 3,194.4 | +806.1 | +25.2       |\n| Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12         | 3,485.1 | 2,863.3 | +621.8 | +21.7       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 1,076.0 | 1,036.7 | +39.3  | +3.8        |\n| Cost of materials                     | 1,637.3 | 1,101.6 | +535.7 | +48.6       |\n| EBITDA                                | 1,204.0 | 1,029.8 | +174.2 | +16.9       |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 501.2   | 465.3   | +35.9  | +7.7        |\n| EBIT                                  | 702.8   | 564.5   | +138.3 | +24.5       |\n| Group result                          | 430.5   | 166.6   | +263.9 | > 100       |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 18,057  | 19,211  | –1,154 | –6.0        |\n| Average number of employees           | 17,840  | 18,850  | –1,010 | –5.4        |\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated Financials Statements\n\n| Comparison with the forecasted development |                                                               |                                                                          |          |        |             |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-------------|\n| € million                                  | 2023 Adjustments during the year<br>Interim Report Q2/6M 2023 | Forecast 2022                                                            | 2022     | Change | Change in % |\n| EBITDA                                     | 1,204.0 In the upper range of the forecasts                   | Between approximately €1,040 million and approximately<br>€1,200 million | +1,029.8 | +174.2 | +16.        |\n| Group result                               | 430.5 In the upper range of the forecasts                     | Between about €300 million and<br>up to about €420 million               | +166.6   | +263.9 | > 10        |\n| Dividend per share in €                    | 0.00 –                                                        | No distribution                                                          | 0.0      | 0.0    | –           |\n\nThe key figures EBITDA and the Group result trended at the upper end or slightly above the forecast provided in the 2022 Annual Report.\n\n# **Results of Operations for Segments**\n\nRevenue in the 2023 fiscal year in the **Aviation** segment increased by €270.7 million to €1,098.8 million (+32.7%). Higher revenue from airport charges (+€196.0 million) based on the higher traffic volume and positive price effects primarily contributed to revenue growth. Due to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved in the reporting period. In contrast, revenue from security services decreased by €155.3 million as a result of the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023. Other operating income of €11.1 million resulted from the recognition of the remaining shares of FraSec Aviation Security GmbH at fair value and the realization of the equity disposal. Personnel expenses also decreased to €244.0 million (-€81.6 million) due to reduced headcount as part of the deconsolidation with a countervailing price effect. On the other hand, the cost of materials increased by €203.8 million compared to the same period of the previous year to €255.9 million. This was particularly related to increased expenses for external services in the course of taking over the management of aviation security checks. Due to the positive operating performance, the segment's EBITDA amounted to €308.3 million (previous year: €175.4 million). With higher depreciation and amortization (+€21.7 million), EBIT amounted to €151.8 million (previous year: €40.6 million).\n\n#### **Aviation**\n\n| € million                             | 2023    | 2022  | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Revenue                               | 1,098.8 | 828.1 | +270.7 | +32.7       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 244.0   | 325.6 | -81.6  | -25.2       |\n| Cost of materials                     | 255.9   | 52.1  | +203.8 | > 100       |\n| EBITDA                                | 308.3   | 175.4 | +132.9 | +75.8       |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 156.5   | 134.8 | +21.7  | +16.2       |\n| EBIT                                  | 151.8   | 40.6  | +111.2 | > 100       |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 3,496   | 5,624 | -2,128 | -37.8       |\n| Average number of employees           | 3,447   | 5,569 | -2,122 | -38.2       |\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/4 description: The image is a square icon with a white background and a blue border. Inside the square are three blue objects: a house, a shirt, and a gift. The house is in the upper right corner, the shirt is in the upper left corner, and the gift is in the lower center.\n\nThe positive traffic development was also reflected in the **Retail & Real Estate** segment's revenue of €498.8 million (+€52.4 million). The reason for this was higher retail and parking revenue (+€33.1 million and +€22.7 million respectively) Net retail revenue per passenger was €3.30 (previous year: €3.33). Other operating income decreased to\n\n€16.5 million (previous year: €30.7 million). The reason for the decline was high one-off income from the sale of shares in the Group company D-Port Logistik GmbH, which is accounted for using the equity method, in 2022. Personnel expenses increased in particular as a result of increases in the collective bargaining agreement (+€5.7 million). The cost of materials increased by €12.1 million. The reason was mainly price increases in utility services. Despite the higher personnel expenses and cost of materials, the EBITDA segment amounted to €369.9 million (+€27.0 million). With higher depreciation and amortization (+€9.3 million), segment EBIT stood at €274.0 million (+€17.7 million).\n\n#### **Retail & Real Estate**\n\n| € million                             | 2023  | 2022  | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Revenue                               | 498.8 | 446.4 | +52.4  | +11.7       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 54.6  | 48.9  | +5.7   | +11.7       |\n| Cost of materials                     | 158.6 | 146.5 | +12.1  | +8.3        |\n| EBITDA                                | 369.9 | 342.9 | +27.0  | +7.9        |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 95.9  | 86.6  | +9.3   | +10.2       |\n| EBIT                                  | 274.0 | 256.3 | +17.7  | +6.9        |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 600   | 573   | +27    | +4.7        |\n| Average number of employees           | 594   | 576   | +18    | +3.3        |\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/9 description: The image shows a blue square with a white border.

The strong traffic development at Frankfurt Airport and price increases led to higher revenue from infrastructure charges (+€76.4 million) and ground services (+€51.6 million). Staff number and price effects led to an increase in personnel expenses by €69.5 million. Cost of materials increased by €20.5 million to €108.9 million. This was mainly due to the increased use of employees from personnel service provider agencies due to the traffic volume, in particular at the Group company Fraport Ground Services GmbH (formerly FraGround Fraport Ground Handling Professionals GmbH). Segment EBITDA was –€34.1 million (previous year: –€73.9 million). Segment EBIT improved to –€74.0 million\n\n(previous year: –€111.6 million).\n\n#### **Ground Handling**\n\n| € million                             | 2023  | 2022   | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Revenue                               | 676.8 | 550.1  | +126.7 | +23.1       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 451.7 | 382.2  | +69.5  | +18.1       |\n| Cost of materials                     | 108.9 | 88.4   | +20.5  | +23.1       |\n| EBITDA                                | -34.1 | -73.9  | +39.8  | +53.5       |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 39.9  | 37.7   | +2.2   | +5.8        |\n| EBIT                                  | -74.0 | -111.6 | +37.6  | +33.7       |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 8,010 | 7,404  | +606   | +8.2        |\n| Average number of employees           | 7,716 | 7,035  | +681   | +9.7        |\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/70/Picture/4 description: The image shows a blue logo with a globe and an airplane.

Adjusted for contract revenue from construction and expansion services based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue grew to €1,210.7 million (+€172.0 million) due to the Group-wide positive traffic development. Other\n\noperating income in the segment was €34.8 million. Other operating income in the previous year was mainly impacted positively by the disposal of shares in the Group company Xi'an, which was accounted for using the equity method, in the amount of €53.7 million. Personnel expenses increased by €45.7 million to €325.7 million primarily due to the increased traffic volume. Cost of materials in the segment increased by €299.3 million to 1,113.9 million (+36.7%) compared to the same period of the previous year. Adjusted for the expenses relating to the application of IFRIC 12, the cost of materials increased by €115.0 million to €598.5 million (+23.8%). This was caused, in particular, by higher variable concession charges. Segment EBITDA decreased to €559.8 million (–€25.6 million) due to lower other income. With depreciation and amortization virtually unchanged, segment EBIT stood at €350.9 million (–€28.3 million).\n\n#### **International Activities & Services**\n\n| € million                               | 2023    | 2022    | Change | Change in % |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|\n|                                         |         |         |        |             |\n| Revenue                                 | 1,726.1 | 1,369.8 | +356.3 | +26.0       |\n| Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12           | 1,210.7 | 1,038.7 | +172.0 | +16.6       |\n| Personnel expenses                      | 325.7   | 280.0   | +45.7  | +16.3       |\n| Cost of materials                       | 1,113.9 | 814.6   | +299.3 | +36.7       |\n| Cost of materials adjusted for IFRIC 12 | 598.5   | 483.5   | +115.0 | +23.8       |\n| EBITDA                                  | 559.8   | 585.4   | -25.6  | -4.4        |\n| Depreciation and amortization           | 208.9   | 206.2   | +2.7   | +1.3        |\n| EBIT                                    | 350.9   | 379.2   | -28.3  | -7.5        |\n| Number of employees as of December 31   | 5,951   | 5,610   | +341   | +6.2        |\n| Average number of employees             | 6,083   | 5,670   | +413   | +7.3        |\n\n#### **Development of the key Group companies outside of Frankfurt (IFRS values before consolidation)**\n\n| € million                  | Share in % | Revenue1) |       |       | EBITDA |       |       | EBIT  |       |       | Result |       |       |\n|----------------------------|------------|-----------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|\n|                            |            | 2023      | 2022  | Δ %   | 2023   | 2022  | Δ %   | 2023  | 2022  | Δ %   | 2023   | 2022  | Δ %   |\n|                            |            |           |       |       |        |       |       |       |       |       |        |       |       |\n| Fraport USA                | 100        | 115.7     | 103.4 | +11.9 | 61.6   | 49.6  | +24.2 | 29.0  | 4.8   | > 100 | 16.4   | -1.8  | –     |\n| Fraport Slovenija          | 100        | 43.4      | 33.9  | +28.0 | 12.8   | 7.6   | +68.4 | 2.4   | -2.7  | –     | 1.8    | -2.6  | –     |\n| Fortaleza + Porto Alegre2) | 100        | 108.3     | 90.0  | +20.3 | 66.4   | 60.1  | +10.5 | 31.0  | 28.8  | +7.6  | 2.4    | -3.5  | –     |\n| Lima                       | 80.01      | 792.0     | 590.1 | +34.2 | 109.2  | 100.2 | +9.0  | 80.3  | 83.4  | -3.7  | 32.1   | 37.2  | -13.7 |\n| Fraport Greece3)           | 65         | 545.2     | 443.8 | +22.8 | 271.3  | 271.7 | -0.1  | 206.3 | 208.5 | -1.1  | 79.1   | 69.9  | +13.2 |\n| Twin Star                  | 60         | 51.2      | 43.5  | +17.7 | 20.6   | 19.3  | +6.7  | 10.9  | 8.6   | +26.7 | 5.8    | 4.2   | +38.1 |\n| Antalya                    | 51/504)    | 467.7     | 396.6 | +17.9 | 371.6  | 323.0 | +15.0 | 255.3 | 208.3 | +22.6 | 163.7  | 119.6 | +36.9 |\n\n1) Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12: Lima 2023: €326,4 million (2022: €277,9 million); Fraport Greece 2023: €508,3 million (2022: €433,5 million);\n\nFortaleza + Porto Alegre: 2023: €95,4 million (2022: €81,3 million); Antalya 2023: €463,2 million (2022: €388,8 million).\n\n2) Sum of the Group companies Fortaleza and Porto Alegre.\n\n3) The Group companies Fraport Regional Airports of Greece A and Fraport Regional Airports of Greece B as well as the Fraport Regional Airports of Greece Management Company are collectively referred to as \"Fraport Greece\".\n\n4) Share of voting rights: 51%, dividend share: 50 %.\n\nThe recovery in passenger numbers in the 2023 fiscal year resulted in an increase in revenue at **Fraport USA** to €115.7 million (previous year: €103.4 million). Other operating income was primarily driven by the settlement of a legal dispute at the Group company Fraport USA in connection with the early termination of the retail concession in Pittsburgh (€11.0 million). Operating expenses increased by €8.2 million to €65.2 million, mainly due to the increased variable concession charges in connection with the positive traffic development. At €61.6 million, EBITDA was higher than in the same period the previous year of €49.6 million. With lower depreciation and amortization costs (–€12.2 million) due to an unscheduled depreciation in the previous year, EBIT amounted to €29.0 million (previous year: €4.8 million). Despite negative currency effects, the result increased slightly by €18.2 million to €16.4 million (previous year: –€1.8 million).\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe increased demand for travel in 2023 was reflected in higher revenue of €43.4 million (+€9.4 million) at the Group company **Fraport Slovenia**. Operating expenses increased by €4.6 million to €31.1 million due to the increased traffic volume. Compared to the previous year, EBITDA improved by €5.2 million to €12.8 million (previous year €7.6 million). Constant depreciation and amortization led to an EBIT of €2.4 million (previous year: –€2.7 million). The result improved to €1.8 million (previous year: –€2.6 million).\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the overall positive traffic development at the Brazilian Group companies **Fortaleza** and **Porto Alegre** was reflected in higher revenue of €108.3 million (+€18.3 million). Adjusted for the revenue relating to capacitive capital expenditure based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €14.1 million (+17.3%). In addition to higher passenger numbers, the growth in revenue also benefited from exchange rate effects. At €20.4 million, other operating income was again positive due to compensation for the effects from the coronavirus pandemic but was still below the previous year's figure (previous year: €24.5 million). The cost of materials increased by €6.3 million to €39.2 million (+18.8%) in particular due to capacitive capital expenditure based on the application of IFRIC 12. Adjusted for the expenses in connection with capacitive capital expenditure, cost of materials increased by €2.0 million to €26.4 million (+8.7%). Correspondingly, EBITDA increased to €66.4 million (previous year: €60.1 million). EBIT amounted to €31.0 million (previous year: €28.8 million), and the result was €2.4 million (previous year: -€3.5 million).\n\nThe ongoing recovery in traffic had a positive effect on the financial development of the Group company in **Lima**. Despite slightly negative currency effects, revenue recorded a significant increase to €792.0 million (+€201.9 million). Adjusted for the revenue relating to capacitive capital expenditure based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue was €326.4 million (+€48.5 million). The cost of materials increased year-on-year by €185.8 million to €651.9 million. Adjusted for expenses resulting from the application of IFRIC 12, cost of materials increased by €32.3 million to €186.2 million. This was a result of higher concession charges based on the traffic volume as well as higher cost of materials due to the progressing expansion measures. Personnel expenses also increased to €19.1 million (+16.6%). At €109.2 million, EBITDA was €9.0 million higher than in the same period of the previous year (€100.2 million). The inauguration of the new runway resulted in higher depreciation and amortization (+€12.2 million) As a result, EBIT increased year-on-year to €80.3 million (-€3.1 million). With a lower financial result, the result amounted to €32.1 million (–€5.1 million).\n\nIn 2023, **Fraport Greece** recorded revenue of €545.2 million (+€101.4 million). Adjusted for contract revenue from capital expenditure relating to the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €74.8 million to €508.3 million. This is primarily due to higher airport charges based on prices and traffic volume, and retail revenue. Operating expenses increased by €78.1 million to €274.1 million. Adjusted for expenses resulting from the application of IFRIC 12, operating expenses increased by €51.4 million to €237.1 million due to higher concession charges. At €271.3 million and €206.3 million respectively, EBITDA and EBIT were almost at the previous year's level (previous year: €271.7 million and €208.5 million respectively). Lower concession payments were made in the previous year. In addition, the previous year's figure was increased by other operating income/compensation claims. The financial result improved slightly, leading to a result of €79.1 million (previous year: €69.9 million).\n\nRevenue also increased to €51.2 million (€7.7 million) at the Group company **Twin Star** due to the improved development of traffic. Driven by volume and price effects, operating expenses during the reporting period amounted to €31.5 million (+€7.2 million). Correspondingly, EBITDA increased slightly to €20.6 million (+€1.3 million). EBIT amounted to €10.9 million, and the result was €5.8 million.\n\nThe Group company **Antalya**, which is accounted for using the equity method, generated revenue of €467.7 million in the reporting period, an increase of €71.1 million due to traffic volumes. EBITDA increased accordingly by €48.6 million to €371.6 million. EBIT was €255.3 million (previous year: €208.3 million), and the result was €163.7 million (previous year: €119.6 million).\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Comparison with the forecasted development**\n\n| EBITDA<br>in € million              |  | 2023  | Forecast 2022                                        | 2022  | Change | Change in % |\n|-------------------------------------|--|-------|------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Aviation                            |  | 308.3 | Above 2019 level<br>of €273.3 million                | 175.4 | +132.9 | +75.8       |\n| Retail & Real Estate                |  | 369.9 | Improvement in<br>EBITDA towards<br>pre-crisis level | 342.9 | +27.0  | +7.9        |\n| Ground Handling                     |  | -34.1 | Negative territory                                   | -73.9 | +39.8  | +53.9       |\n| International Activities & Services |  | 559.8 | Significant decline -<br>still above 2019 level      | 585.4 | -25.6  | -4.4        |\n\nThe key figures developed in line with the forecasts.\n\n# **Asset and Financial Position**\n\n#### **Asset and capital structure**\n\nAt €18,890.9 million, **total assets** as at December 31, 2023 were €1,283.3 million (+7.3%) above the previous year.\n\n**Non-current assets** increased by €687.0 million to €15,053.1 million. This is primarily attributable to the increase in property, plant, and equipment (+€579.7 million) in connection with capital expenditure at the Frankfurt site. Investments in airport operating projects increased by €377.7 million as a result of the ongoing expansion at the Group company in Lima. Other financial assets decreased by €220.3 million due to reclassifications based on maturity, which were offset by lower additions to securities as well as investments in promissory note loans.\n\nAt €3,837.7 million, **current assets** were €607.6 million above the comparable value as at December 31, 2022. The increase resulted in particular from higher current financial assets (+€579.5 million). The above mentioned reclassifications based on maturity and other additions to securities were offset by lower scheduled disposals. Furthermore, higher trade accounts receivable (+€94.4 million) due to traffic volumes and higher financial (+€57.0 million) and non-financial receivables and assets (+€39.7 million) due to the balance sheet date contributed to the increase in current assets. Cash and cash equivalents, on the other hand, decreased by €174.7 million.\n\nAt €4,592.3 million, **shareholders' equity** as at the balance sheet date 2023 was €460.4 million higher than as at December 31, 2022. The increase resulted, in particular, from the positive Group result of €430.5 million. The **shareholders' equity ratio** increased to 22.9% compared to previous year (December 31, 2022: 22.2%).\n\n**Non-current liabilities** increased by €485.7 million to €11,718.3 million (+4.3%), in particular due to long-term financial liabilities (+€516.5 million). The borrowings in connection with the project financing in Lima, which was completed in December 2022, as well as other long-term financing measures at Fraport AG, were offset by scheduled reclassifications. In addition, **current liabilities** rose in the reporting period by €349.3 million to €2,580.3 million (+15.7%). Reclassifications based on maturity were offset by the repayment of the bridge financing at the Lima Group company and other current financial liabilities of Fraport AG.\n\n**Gross financial debt** as at December 31, 2023 was €11,753.9 million, up €828.3 million from €10,925.6 million as at December 31, 2022. **Group liquidity** also increased by €174.4 million to €4,041.3 million. Correspondingly, **net financial debt** increased by €653.9 million to €7,712.6 million (December 31, 2022: €7,058.7 million). The **gearing ratio** reached a level of 178.6% (value as at December 31, 2022: 180.6%). The **net financial debt to EBITDA** ratio reached a level of 6.4 (previous year: 6.9).\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Structure of the consolidated financial position as at December 31**\n\nImage /page/73/Figure/2 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the assets, liabilities, and equity in 2022 and 2023 in millions of Euros. In 2023, the assets are divided into non-current assets (15,053.1), current assets (3,837.7), and non-current assets held for sale (0.1), totaling 18,890.9. The liabilities and equity are divided into shareholders' equity (4,592.3), non-current liabilities (11,718.3), current liabilities (2,580.3), and liabilities related to assets held for sale (0.0). In 2022, the assets are divided into non-current assets (14,366.1), current assets (3,230.1), and non-current assets held for sale (11.4), totaling 17,607.6. The liabilities and equity are divided into shareholders' equity (4,131.9), non-current liabilities (11,232.6), current liabilities (2,231.0), and liabilities related to assets held for sale (12.1).\n\n### **Additions to non-current assets**\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the additions to non-current assets of the Fraport Group totaled €1,501.7 million, €343.0 million more than the previous year (previous year: €1,158.7 million). They related to €955.8 million in property, plant and equipment (previous year: €779.8 million) and €536.9 million (previous year: €374.1 million) in investments in \"airport operating projects\". The item \"Other intangible assets\" accounted for €7.7 million (previous year: €4.7 million), and €1.3 million to \"investment property\" (previous year: €0.1 million). The capitalization of interest expenses relating to construction work amounted to €71.0 million (previous year: €43.9 million).\n\nAt Fraport AG, the additions to non-current assets amounted to €935.6 million (previous year: €764.6 million). Capital expenditure was mostly attributed to the Expansion South project at the Frankfurt site – mainly relating to Terminal 3 and the passenger transport system – as well as modernization and maintenance measures for existing infrastructure.\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, additions to assets will also be primarily characterized by multi-year capital expenditure for the capacity expansion in Frankfurt and Lima.\n\nThe additions to non-current assets are attributed to the individual segments as follows:\n\nImage /page/73/Figure/8 description: The image is a donut chart showing additions per segment in millions of euros. The segments are International Activities & Services, Aviation, Ground Handling, and Retail & Real Estate. For International Activities & Services, the additions in 2023 are 590.1 and in 2022 are 409.1. For Aviation, the additions in 2023 are 553.4 and in 2022 are 426.0. For Ground Handling, the additions in 2023 are 116.1 and in 2022 are 92.9. For Retail & Real Estate, the additions in 2023 are 242.1 and in 2022 are 230.7.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nCapital expenditure in the **Aviation** segment amounting to €553.4 million (previous year: €426.0 million) primarily concerned the ongoing construction work in connection with the Frankfurt Airport Expansion South project. Most of this amount related to Terminal 3 and the passenger transport system.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the **Retail & Real Estate** segment recorded additions to assets in the amount of €242.1 million (previous year: €230.7 million). The measures also concerned, in particular, the Expansion South project.\n\nThe **Ground Handling** segment recorded additions amounting to €116.1 million (previous year: €92.9 million). These mainly included the modernization measures for existing facilities as well as capital expenditure in connection with the Expansion South project.\n\nIn the **International Activities & Services** segment, additions to non-current assets amounted to €590.1 million (previous year: €409.1 million). The additions related mainly to the Group company Lima in connection with the infrastructure expansion.\n\n### **Statement of cash flows**\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, **cash flow from operating activities (operating cash flow)** of €863.2 million (2022: €787.3 million) was generated. The improvement of €75.9 million resulted in particular from an increase in the operating result.\n\n**Cash flow used in investing activities without investments in cash deposits and securities** amounted to €1,482.6 million in the past fiscal year, an increase of €176.8 million year-on-year. The increase was primarily the result of higher investments in airport operating projects, particularly in Lima, as well as increased cash outflows for expansion measures at the Frankfurt site. In the previous year, the cash outflow was mainly impacted by capital contributions of –€375.3 million to the new joint venture that was established in connection with the operating concession at Antalya Airport and, on the other hand, by the proceeds from the disposal of the shares in the associated company Xi'an of +€152.2 million. Considering investments in and revenue from securities, promissory note loans, and time deposits, the overall **cash flow used in investing activities** was €1,818.9 million (2022: €1,216.0 million).\n\nCompared to the previous year, **cash flow used in financing activities** decreased slightly by €86.9 million to €795.4 million. The raising of funds from the project financing concluded in December 2022 at the Group company Lima and the associated repayment of the short-term bridge loan had an effect of €675.1 million on the payments of non-current financial liabilities and –€302.4 million on the change in current financial liabilities. The capital increases \"Non-controlling interests\" relate to capital contributions to the minority shareholders of the company Lima. In the previous year, the sale of capital and loan shares to a co-shareholder of the Greek companies was reported under \"transactions with non-controlling interests\". Taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and other changes, the Fraport Group reported cash and cash equivalents based on the consolidated statement of cash flows of €670.3 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: €826.2 million).\n\n**Free cash flow** amounted to –€656.4 million (2022: –€741.0 million).\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation to cash and cash equivalents as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### **Reconciliation to the cash and cash equivalents as at the consolidated statement of financial position**\n\n**in € million December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022** Bank and cash balances 180.1 579.6 Time deposits with a remaining term of less than three months 490.2 246.6 **Cash and cash equivalents as at the consolidated statement of cash flows 670.3 826.2** Time deposits with a remaining term of more than three months 1,614.0 1,619.7 Restricted cash 126.2 139.3 **Cash and cash equivalents as at the consolidated statement of financial position 2,410.5 2,585.2**\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Summary of the statement of cash flows and reconciliation to the Group's liquidity**\n\nImage /page/75/Figure/5 description: This image is a bar chart showing the group's liquidity as at December 31, 2023, in millions of euros. The first bar shows cash and cash equivalents as at January 1, 2023, which is 826.2. The second bar shows cash flow from operating activities, which is 863.2. The third bar shows cash flow used in investing activities excluding cash deposits and securities, which is -1,482.6. The fourth bar shows cash flow used in investing activities in cash deposits and securities, which is -336.3. The fifth bar shows cash flow from financing activities, which is 795.4. The sixth bar shows foreign currency translation effects and other changes on cash and cash equivalents, which is 4.4. The seventh bar shows cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2023, which is 670.3. The eighth bar shows short-term realizable assets, which is 3,371.0. The ninth bar shows the group's liquidity as at December 31, 2023, which is 4,041.3.\n\n#### **Financing analysis**\n\nIn 2023, the finance management of the Fraport Group continued to pursue balanced funding via a diversified debt financing base with a balanced maturity profile. As at the balance sheet date, there was a balanced mix of financing, consisting of promissory note loans (20.9%), corporate bonds (17.9%), bilateral loans (43.4%), and project financing (17.8%).\n\nTo reduce interest rate risks from borrowing with floating interest rates, in the past interest rate hedging transactions were concluded in some cases. In the course of a project financing in Lima, new interest rate hedging derivatives were concluded in 2023 in order to reduce the interest rate risk from project financing. The related nominal volume amounted to €530.7 million as at yearend (previous year: €0.0 million). Overall, the financial liabilities had an average remaining term of 6.2 years with an average interest maturity of approximately 5.1 years after hedging measures. Taking into account interest rate hedging transactions, the floating rate portion of the gross debt of the Fraport Group was approximately 17%, and the fixed portion approximately 83%. The cost of debt after hedging measures was 2.9%.\n\nFully consolidated Group companies in Germany are mostly integrated into the Fraport AG cash pool, so that acquiring separate external funding was not necessary. Funding for fully consolidated foreign Group companies was primarily obtained through previously concluded project financing agreements in the 2023 fiscal year. No analysis or calculation of the financial debt structure and liquidity at segment level is carried out.\n\nThe key features of the Group financing instruments with regard to type, maturity, and interest rate structures are presented in the following table:\n\n#### **Financial debt structure**\n\n| Financing type                                                    | Year of origin | Nominal volume in € million | Maturity    | Repayment structure                   | Interest          | Interest rate                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Promissory note loans                                             | 2012 – 2023    | 2,455.0                     | 2024 – 2034 | End of term                           | Fixed<br>Floating | 0.548 % – 5.774 % p. a.<br>6M-Euribor + Margin |\n| Corporate bond                                                    | 2009 – 2021    | 2,100.0                     | 2024 – 2029 | End of term                           | Fixed             | 1.034 % – 5.875 % p.a.                         |\n| Bilateral loans                                                   | 1999 – 2023    | 5,075.4                     | 2024 – 2032 | Mainly end of term                    | Mainly fixed      | 0.28 % – 5.76 % p. a.                          |\n| Project financing (fully consolidated<br>foreign Group companies) | 2017 – 2023    | 2,088.5                     | 2024 – 2045 | Ongoing repayments during<br>the term | Mainly fixed      | 4.49 % – 10.33 % p. a.                         |\n\nThe contractual agreements for the financial liabilities of Fraport AG include two customary non-financial covenants consisting of a negative pledge and a pari passu clause. Only the bilateral loans forming part of the special-purpose loans of Fraport AG entail further obligations typical for this type of financing.\n\nIndependent project financing agreements of fully consolidated foreign Group companies, in particular in Lima, Greece and Brazil, contain a series of credit clauses typical for this type of financing. These clauses include regulations under which certain debt service coverage ratios and control indicators for leverage and credit terms must be complied with. Failure to comply with the\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nagreed credit clauses may lead to restrictions on the distribution of dividends and/or to the early redemption of loans or to the additional payment of shareholders' equity.\n\nThe maturity profile of the Fraport Group's financial debt showed a largely balanced repayment structure as at the balance sheet date (financial debt in foreign currencies translated as at the balance sheet date rate).\n\nImage /page/76/Figure/7 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Maturity profile as at 31 December 2023 in € million\". The x-axis represents different categories: Liquidity, Gross debt, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033, and 2034 ++. The y-axis represents the values in € million. For Liquidity, there are two bars: one for Carrying amounts at 4,041.2 and another for Credit Lines at 958,6. For Gross debt, there is one bar for Carrying amounts at 11,753.9. For the years 2024 to 2034 ++, there are bars representing Nominal values with the following values: 2024 (1,455.1), 2025 (1,039.8), 2026 (1,185.1), 2027 (1,196.4), 2028 (1,364.7), 2029 (1,972.2), 2030 (947.4), 2031 (828.1), 2032 (549.9), 2033 (332.5), and 2034 ++ (847.7). Additionally, there are values for Carrying amounts: 4,999.8 for Liquidity, and 11,753.9 for Gross debt.\n\n## Liquidity in the fully consolidated Group companies was €780.7 million (previous year: €945.3 million). As it is partly subject to drawing restrictions arising from the conditions stipulated in the project financing agreements, it is not part of the asset management at Fraport AG.\n\n# **Liquidity analysis**\n\nThe strategy of broad diversification of investments in corporate bonds was continued in the 2023 fiscal year. The key characteristics of Fraport AG's investment instruments in terms of type, remaining term, and interest rate structure are presented in the following table:\n\n### **Asset structure of Fraport

management are presented in the following diagram.\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/4 description: This bar chart titled \"Rating structure of assets in %\" shows the percentage of assets in different rating categories. The x-axis represents the percentage, ranging from 0 to 60. The y-axis represents the rating categories: AAA (9.9%), AA (21.8%), A (54.8%), BBB (13.4%), BB (0.0%), and Not rated (0.1%).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the portfolio was comprised almost exclusively of rated assets (rated: 99.9%, unrated: 0.1%).\n\nThe cost of carry, which is calculated using a (tiered statement) maturity-matching principle, was -0.7% (-€22.4 million) as at December 31, 2023.\n\nAs at the 2023 balance sheet date, the Fraport Group had credit lines amounting to €958.6 million (previous year: €736.3 million) available, of which €469.4 million were, however, earmarked for future capital expenditure on infrastructure.

However, at –€125.4 million, it remained in the negative range (previous year: –€153.6 million)\n\nThe positive development of traffic in the Group primarily contributed to an improvement of €145.5 million in adjusted EBIT to €822.9 million (previous year: €677.4 million). The higher capital expenditure, particularly in the development projects in Frankfurt and Lima, as well as the increase in WACC from 7.3% to 7.6% which resulted in higher capital costs, had an opposite effect.\n\nDue to the positive operating result, the **ROFRA** of the Fraport Group increased by 0.6 percentage points to 6.6% (previous year: 6.0%).\n\nThe value added of the **Aviation** segment improved from –€262.4 million to –€199.2 million due to the positive operational development. This was offset by progressing construction activities in the context of the Airport Expansion South project and the increase in capital costs. Segment ROFRA improved from 1.0% to 3.3%.\n\nIn the **Retail & Real Estate** segment, higher Fraport assets in the course of the expansion project in Frankfurt resulted in a decrease in the value added from €63.8 million to €53.4 million (–€10.4 million) and of ROFRA to 9.4% (previous year: 9.7%).\n\nThe value added in the **Ground Handling** segment improved to –€146.2 million (previous year: –€164.3 million) due to the higher operational result, despite the increase in capital costs. ROFRA of the segment was thus at –7.7% (previous year: –12.0%).\n\nThe value added of the **International Activities & Services** segment decreased from €209.3 million to €166.7 million (-€42.6 million). The reason for this was a lower operating result due to special effects in the previous year. Furthermore, the increase in capital costs for the expansion at Lima Airport had a negative effect. In line with the value added, segment ROFRA decreased from 12.9% to 11.8%.\n\n#### **Comparison with the forecasted development**\n\n|                 | 2023 Forecast 2022               | 2022 | Change  | Change in % |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|------|---------|-------------|\n| Group ROFRA (%) | 6.6 Roughly at the level of 2022 | 6.0  | +0.6 PP | -           |\n\nGroup ROFRA of 6.6% was above the forecast provided in 2022 due to the positive operational results.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n70 Group Management Report / Economic Report Fraport Annual Report 2023\n\n# **Non-financial Performance Indicators<sup>12</sup> Customer satisfaction and product quality**\n\n#### **Global satisfaction of passengers**\n\nAt 67%, global satisfaction of passengers was below the previous year' value (–7 percentage points).

This was offset by an increase in particular in the Group companies Fraport Ground Services (formerly FraGround Fraport Ground Handling Professionals GmbH) (+691 employees) and the FraSec Group (+72 employees) due to the volume-based higher demand for personnel. Outside of Germany, employee numbers increased in particular in the Group companies in Peru (+99 employees), Slovenia (+32 employees), Greece (+38 employees), and Brazil (+18 employees).\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Development in personnel structure**\n\nFraport values the diversity of its employees. This diversity helps the Group to better understand the concerns of its customers, develop innovative solutions, and remain competitive in a globalized economy. Diversity management is therefore a central component of its human resources strategy. It is based on a Group agreement that includes the establishment of principles of anti-discrimination, advancement of women into management positions, and diversity. These principles form part of recruitment decisions and training measures.\n\nWith regard to permanent employees excluding seasonal staff as at the balance sheet date, the **Group staff turnover rate** of 12.6% in the reporting year was slightly higher than the value of the previous year (adjusted value for 2022 due to late reportings: 12.1%; reported value 2022: 15.0%). The **Group's percentage of women**, in relation to the total number of employees (including temporary staff, apprentices, and employees on leave) as at December 31, 2023 was 23.8%, clearly below the previous year's level of 26.6%. This was due to the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023. The **average age** of the Group's workforce increased slightly to 45.4 years (previous year: 45.3 years). The **percentage of persons with major disabilities** relative to the total number of employees excluding apprentices and temporary staff was 7.1% on a Group-wide basis (adjusted value for 2022 due to late reportings: 7.6%; reported value 2022: 5.8%).\n\nAt **Fraport AG**, the proportion of female employees as at the balance sheet date 2023 was 19.7% (previous year: 19.4%). The proportion of employees with major disabilities remained unchanged year-on-year at 12.4%. The average number of apprentices decreased to 227 (previous year: 246). The staff turnover rate at Fraport AG improved to 2.7% (previous year: 3.5%).\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-83-0\"></span>*Combined non-financial Statement*\n\n# **About this combined statement**\n\nThe combined non-financial statement complies with the commercial law requirements and was prepared in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e the German Commercial Code (HGB), Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework for facilitating sustainable investment and amending the Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder. Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has subjected the content of this combined non-financial statement to a limited assurance review in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised) as part of a separate engagement.\n\nTo avoid duplicates within the combined management report, further information in other chapters is referred to at relevant points. The \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters describe the important non-financial performance indicators and their development during the reporting period. The respective concepts and measures are presented in this combined non-financial statement. The target values set for the Fraport Group and Fraport AG can also be found in the chapters, which are part of this combined non-financial statement. The forecast figures for fiscal year 2024 can be found in the \"Business Outlook\" chapter. The Fraport business model, competitive position, and organizational structure can be found in the \"Situation of the Group\" chapter. Fraport takes risks related to the non-financial aspects into account in the Group-wide risk management system (see the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter). References to information beyond the scope of the combined management report and consolidated financial statements are additional information and do not form part of this combined non-financial statement, therefore they are not audited.\n\n#### **Use of frameworks**\n\nFor a structured presentation of the contents in accordance with Section 289c of the HGB in the combined non-financial statement, Fraport applies the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative 2021 (GRI). The concepts on the aspects are based on \"GRI 3-3 Management of material topics\". This concerns the explanations relating to \"Anti-corruption and bribery matters\", \"Respect for human rights\", \"Customer satisfaction and security\", \"Employee-related matters\", \"Social matters\", and \"Environmental matters\". In addition, the ESG Factbook, available at www.fraport.com/publications, provides a detailed overview of the relevant GRI indicators in the Fraport Group.\n\n#### **Correlations with the financial statements**\n\nThe reportable correlations with the combined management report, the consolidated financial statements, and the Fraport AG annual financial statements are explained at the end of each respective non-financial aspect.\n\n#### **Derivation of materiality**\n\nThe Fraport mission statement continues to form the basis of the Group's strategy. It encompasses the Group goals \"Growth in Frankfurt and internationally\", \"Service-oriented airport provider\", \"Economically successful through optimal cooperation\", \"Learning organization and digitalization\", and \"Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors\". The vision of establishing Fraport as Europe's top airport operator and of setting global standards forms the basis for this.\n\nBased on these Group goals, the Executive Board has defined the six most important non-financial performance indicators in accordance with Section 315 (3) of the HGB in conjunction with Section 289 (3) of the HGB. Global passenger satisfaction, baggage connectivity, satisfaction of employees, women in management positions, sickness rate, and CO2 emissions. As explained in the \"Control System\" chapter, the employee satisfaction survey is carried out every two years and is therefore not recorded quantitatively in the reporting period.\n\nThe basis for the aspects reported in this combined non-financial statement is the materiality matrix. Key aspects are those that, according to Section 289c (3) of the HGB, are relevant to the business development, business result, as well as the effects of the business activities of Fraport on non-financial aspects. The materiality matrix is the result of a systematic exchange with internal and external stakeholders. Fraport management and representatives of the most important stakeholders (analysts, shareholders, employee representatives, banks, employees, airlines, residents living near airports, business partners, media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), passengers, politicians and authorities, economic associations, and science) confirmed the relevance of the current topics. Both groups also prioritize the topics. The materiality matrix shows the impact of direct and indirect business\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nactivities on the corresponding aspect, its relevance for stakeholders, and for the long-term business activities of Fraport. The last comprehensive materiality analysis was performed in 2018. On the basis of this, the topics are regularly checked to ensure they are up to date. The Executive Board has confirmed the relevance of the topics for 2023.\n\nImage /page/84/Figure/6 description: This image is a materiality matrix with \"Impact of business activities\" on the x-axis and \"Relevance for stakeholders\" on the y-axis. The matrix contains several data points, each represented by a circle, with the size of the circle indicating the relevance for long-term business activities (High or Medium). The data points are labeled as follows: \"Data protection\", \"Innovation and Digitalization\", \"Air quality\", \"Noise abatement\", \"Climate protection\", \"Protection of environment and nature\", \"Corporate governance and compliance\", \"Occupational health and safety\", \"Value generation and engagement in the regions\", \"IT security and airport safety and security\", \"Attractive and responsible employer\", \"Customer satisfaction and product quality\", \"Profitability\", and \"Growth and development in the Group\". The data points are colored to represent different categories: Corporate management, Economic enhancement, Employees, Community, and Environment.\n\n1. 116\n\nThe key aspects identified have been attributed to the non-financial aspects in accordance with Section 289c (2) of the HGB. Beyond these reportable non-financial aspects, Fraport has also identified \"Customer satisfaction and security\" as an additional aspect. The distribution of the aspects among the non-financial aspects can be found in the table below. The crossover aspect \"Supply and subcontracting chain\" is not an individual aspect but deals with the information in connection with the non-financial aspects in a separate chapter. Fraport does not engage in research and development in the strict sense in the \"Innovation and Digitalization\" section (see \"Research and Development\" chapter). The measures derived from the Group strategy aim to increase customer satisfaction and product quality. Reporting on this can be found in the \"Customer Satisfaction and Security\" chapter.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Allocation of material topics to non-financial aspects**\n\n| Non-financial aspect                                            | Topics                                    |                                      |                             |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--|\n| Respect for human rights<br>Anti-corruption and bribery matters | Corporate Governance                      | Compliance                           |                             |  |\n| Customer satisfaction and security                              | Customer satisfaction and product quality | IT security and data protection      | Airport safety and security |  |\n| Employee-related matters                                        | Attractive and responsible employer       | Occupational health and safety       |                             |  |\n| Social matters                                                  | Engangement in the Regions                | Noise abatement                      |                             |  |\n| Environmental matters                                           | Climate protection                        | Protection of environment and nature | Air quality                 |  |\n\nThe Executive Board remuneration system also includes non-financial elements in addition to the financial objectives for the longterm performance-based remuneration. The expansion of the master plan and package of measures on reducing CO<sup>2</sup> in the Group, concept development for alternative drive systems at the Frankfurt site, and the increase in process efficiency in procurement and staffing requirements were determined as non-financial components for the 2023 fiscal year (see also the Remuneration Report at www.fraport.com/publications).\n\n#### **Identification of risks**\n\nFraport defines risks as future developments or events that may negatively affect the non-financial aspects. The risk evaluation is conservative, which means that it reflects the worst-case scenario for Fraport. A distinction is made between a gross risk and net risk. The gross risk is the greatest possible negative impact of the risk prior to countermeasures. The net risk includes the remaining expected impact after countermeasures have been initiated or implemented. The risk assessment in this non-financial statement reflects the net risk.\n\nThe risk management system described in the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter in the combined management report contains the analysis of the risks that may have potential negative effects on the non-financial aspects.\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, there were no additional reportable risks for Fraport which are very likely to have or will have a substantial negative impact on the reportable aspects in accordance with Section 289c (3) sentence 1, Nos. 3 and 4 HGB, beyond the material risks already listed in the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter as part of risk management.\n\n#### **Consideration of the supply and subcontracting chain specific to the business model**\n\nThe crossover topic \"Supply chain and subcontracting\" is not an individual aspect but deals with the information on the supply chain and subcontracting in connection with the non-financial aspects in this separate chapter. Unlike manufacturing companies, Fraport management does not focus on the supply chain. Instead, the focus is placed on the quality of the services offered and the functionality of the infrastructure required for this purpose. It is crucial, however, that business partners and suppliers are selected carefully.\n\nFraport compels business partners and suppliers to comply with its **Supplier Code of Conduct**, (which can be viewed at www.fraport.com/en/compliance) as part of its General Terms and Conditions (GTC), depending on the local conditions. It details how to deal with employees and respect human rights as well as environmental and climate protection, integrity during business, and the prohibition of corruption and bribery. A violation of this supplier code of conduct may result in the termination of the business relationship. Business partners and suppliers must also undertake to demand and ensure that these principles are adhered to when dealing with their own suppliers.\n\nAll suppliers and service providers of Fraport AG are audited daily regarding the relevant sanction lists of the EU and the United States. Sanction lists are official lists of people, groups, or organizations subject to economic or legal restrictions. If there are irregularities, further checks are planned which may result in the withdrawal of an order.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fully consolidated Group companies each have their own procurement management and are required to comply with the Group Compliance Management System (CMS). An important part of the Group policy is the **Code of Conduct for Employees** (which can be viewed at www.fraport.com/en/compliance), which is obligatory in the Fraport Group. The policy also includes instructions to make the Supplier Code of Conduct part of the General Terms and Conditions insofar as this is possible for the Group companies pursuant to national applicable law.\n\nThe Group company Fraport Ausbau Süd defined a separate procurement process for the Expansion South project, in particular for Terminal 3 at Frankfurt Airport, due to the size and complexity of the project. When submitting an offer in this procurement process, construction companies are obliged to comply with all requirements in the German Posted Workers Act (AEntG) and the German Minimum Wage Act (MiLoG). In addition, they must make contributions to the collective bargaining parties' joint facilities (e.g., wage compensation and vacation pay), and only engage subcontractors or other third parties that meet these requirements.\n\nIn the past fiscal year, Fraport AG has implemented the due diligence obligations resulting from the German Supply Chain Act (LkSG), which entered into force on January 1, 2023. After existing structures had been expanded and new processes created, the statutory obligations were transferred into the line organization. In addition to the policy statement on the human rights strategy, core elements of the implementation include expanding the risk analysis, updating the complaints procedure, and establishing suitable preventive and corrective measures.\n\n# **Anti-corruption and bribery matters and respect for human rights**\n\n### **Anti-corruption and bribery matters**\n\n*Objective –* Conduct in compliance with laws and regulations has the highest priority at Fraport. Fraport does not tolerate any form of corruption or other unfair business practices. In addition, Fraport is committed to internationally recognized standards, guidelines, and principles, in particular the principles of the UN Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organization, as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* Within the scope of its management responsibilities, the Executive Board determines the values and codes of conduct of the Fraport Group and draws up the framework conditions for the legally compliant and ethical behavior of its executives and employees. Combating corruption is a key component of the **Fraport Code of Conduct**, which has been rolled out globally. The Executive Board is expressly committed to the fundamental values set out in the Code of Conduct and takes a clear stand with a \"zero tolerance principle\".\n\nThe Group-wide **Compliance Management System (CMS)** contains various measures for combating corruption for which Groupwide minimum standards apply. The minimum requirements need the Group companies to have comprehensive regulations for the handling of gifts and invitations, conflicts of interest, and the compliance audit of business partners. In addition, uniform specifications for the processing of information about compliance violations are prescribed. The responsibility for the CMS of each respective Group company lies with its local management. In the role of Chief Compliance Officer, the head of the \"Legal Affairs and Compliance\" central unit is responsible for the content, organization, upkeep, and further development of the CMS of Fraport AG. This officer reports directly to the Executive Director of Retail and Real Estate.\n\nThe CMS of Fraport AG is based on and starts with a **compliance risk analysis**, which is carried out regularly – most recently in 2022 – and whose main areas of focus include the fight against corruption. With its Compliance Helpdesk, the Compliance department of Fraport AG supports and advises employees of all positions and hierarchy levels.\n\nThe Compliance department of Fraport AG informs the Executive Board in a semi-annual **report** on the status of the anti-corruption measures. The Executive Board receives information on material compliance violations immediately after they become known.\n\nThe **Compliance Board** of Fraport AG supports and promotes the cooperation between the Compliance Management (CMS), Risk Management (RMS), Internal Control System (ICS), and audit subsystems. It is the central body that brings together topics specific to the departments and interfaces, and further develops the CMS on an ongoing basis.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders\n\nGuidelines on receiving invitations and gifts have been defined for the employees of Fraport AG in a separate **policy**. This regulates, among other things, the electronic documentation of the approval of received gifts and invitations. An internal policy on how to deal with conflicts of interest also exists. The employees of Fraport AG are obliged to report any situations, in which they find themselves, where personal interests could contradict Fraport's business interests. This allows reportable facts to be disclosed electronically, and the required measures to then be initiated. The electronic processes support employees in complying with existing laws and internal regulations.\n\nExamining adherence to the Fraport Group's compliance regulations falls under the remit of Internal Auditing. This department provides independent and objective audit as well as consulting services in all major business units of Fraport AG, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, and Group companies. The department also carries out **compliance audits**. A standardized and risk-oriented planning process is the foundation for the focus points of the audit.\n\nMeasures to battle corruption, along with information and instructions on how individual employees can contribute to this, are regularly communicated to the employees of the Fraport Group. Employees must complete training on anti-corruption matters. In addition to a clear presentation of why compliance is important in everyday working life, the e-learning program for Fraport AG employees contains the Fraport Code of Conduct, dealing with gifts and invitations, and conflicts of interest. In addition, the central reporting channels for compliance violations are detailed. In 2023, a new e-learning course, Compliance Basic Knowledge for Executives at Fraport AG, has been additionally rolled out. regularly communicated to the employees of the Fraport Group. Employees must complete training on anti-corruption matters. In employees contains the Fraport Code of Conduct, dealing with gifts and invitations, and conflicts of interest. In addition, the central\n\nA key instrument for preventing and discovering compliance violations is the **whistleblower system** (see <www.fraport.com/en/compliance>) as an internal reporting authority. Information about irregularities in all Group companies can be submitted anonymously via this online system. It is available 24 hours a day worldwide. The factual content of each report is thoroughly reviewed, and sanctions are initiated, if necessary. The requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act (Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz) are complied with. Furthermore, Fraport AG has an **ombudswoman**, an external, independent lawyer, at its disposal. Employees at the Frankfurt site can also contact an **internal confidant**.\n\nA risk-based **compliance due diligence** conducted by the “Acquisitions and Investments” strategic business unit is in place to examine the integrity of Fraport AG business partners' activities in foreign-related investment projects – material compliance risks of a potential business partner are considered accordingly as part of a standard process.\n\nThe **Group companies** implement their own targeted measures to combat corruption and bribery based on the Group-wide CMS requirements. The implementation of the requirements of the German Supply Chain Act and the German Whistleblower Protection Act was the focus at the Group companies in fiscal year 2023.\n\n*Performance indicator –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n# **Respect for human rights**\n\n*Objective* – Fraport aims to comply with the international codes of conduct that it endorses. These are especially the principles of the UN Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results* – The \"Corporate Development and Sustainability\" central unit of Fraport AG deals with, among other things, coordinating Group-wide respect of human rights. Violations can be reported anonymously via the **whistleblower system** that is freely accessible worldwide via www.fraport.com/en/compliance. In the context of implementing the due diligence obligations from the LKSG, the electronic whistleblower system was expanded by the categories \"Human Rights Violations\" and \"Environmental Crimes\" as of January 1, 2023. In addition, employees in Germany can contact the Compliance department of Fraport AG if required. **blower system** that is freely accessible worldwide via <www.fraport.com/en/compliance>. In the context of implementing the due diligence obligations from the LKSG, the electronic whistleblower system was expanded by the categories \"Human Rights Violations\" and \"Environmental Crimes\" as of January 1, 2023. In addition, employees in Germany can contact the Compliance department of Fraport AG if required.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nRespect for human rights is anchored in the Group-wide binding Fraport **Code of Conduct for Employees**: Fraport undertakes to respect the fundamental right to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining that governs the general working conditions within the Group.\n\nAs an international oriented company, Fraport encourages **diversity in its workforce** and pursues the objective of rejecting any form of discrimination. Fraport undertakes not to distinguish, exclude, or favor people based on their ethnic, national and social origin, skin color, gender, age, religion, or belief system. Fraport also prohibits any discrimination based on political activity, membership in a union organization, disability, or sexual orientation. The principle of mutual appreciation and respect is an essential part of the Fraport value culture: Fraport stands for fair, respectful, and cooperative relationships.\n\nFraport has the same expectations regarding respect for human rights toward its business partners – these requirements are set out in the **Supplier Code of Conduct**. In this code, Fraport business partners are obliged to work toward ensuring that all other companies, such as subcontractors, involved in the provision of services, consistently comply with these standards.\n\nThe **Group companies** implement their own specific measures to ensure respect for human rights.\n\n*Performance indicators –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n# **Customer satisfaction and security**\n\n#### **Customer satisfaction and product quality**\n\n*Objective –* The customer comes first at Fraport, both in Frankfurt as well as at all international Group airports. The objective is therefore to continuously improve the focus on customers and service at Group airports. **Global passenger satisfaction** and **baggage connectivity** are considered the most important criteria for service quality (see the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters). Protecting the health of employees and customers is also a top priority.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* To increase the service quality and sense of cleanliness in the sanitary facilities, additional contactless Smiley Boxes were installed at the Frankfurt Airport to collect feedback. As part of the modernization of the security inspection process, 20 check lanes with new computer tomography technology were introduced in Terminal A at Frankfurt Airport in the reporting year. The benefits for passengers is a faster, more efficient process because liquids and electronic devices can remain in hand baggage. The PaxZ system was expanded in order to enable optimum measurement of waiting times at security checks and check-in areas and thus guarantee better forecasts of process times for passengers.\n\nFraport AG is expanding the digital and contactless travel experience for passengers at Frankfurt Airport together with its system partners. Biometric methods play a central role here. Automatic face recognition replaces passengers presenting documents, provides a fast and convenient service, and increases customer satisfaction. Further biometric touchpoints were put into operation in Pier A/Z, B, and Terminal 2 in 2023.\n\nIn order to guarantee service quality and to meet passengers' and airlines' requirements, Fraport conducted extensive modernization measures at the Group airports. Several measures to improve passenger and business processes such as self bag tag print and replacing the terminal equipment were implemented in Greece. A new software to manage lost baggage was introduced at the Airport in Lima.\n\nIn the context of the permanent passenger survey Fraport-MONITOR, which was conducted at Frankfurt Airport in order to collect information about global satisfaction, self-assessment interviews were carried out on the passenger's own mobile device (smartphone, tablet, laptop) or on a tablet provided on-site by the interviewers. The basic questionnaire from 2022 was broadly adopted for the 2023 reporting year.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the fully consolidated international Group airports, regular surveys to measure passenger satisfaction, which were resumed in 2022, were continued in 2023, albeit with some reduced case numbers compared to pre-crisis levels. As in the previous year, the sample sizes are sufficient to provide a valid figure for global satisfaction in both the international portfolio and the Group for the 2023 reporting year.\n\nThe reliable loading of luggage for departing flights and the fast delivery of luggage to the baggage claim for arriving flights have a major impact on customer satisfaction. Fraport AG measures this performance for departure baggage based on the non-financial performance indicator **Baggage Connectivity** (see also the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters). The recruitment campaign for Ground Handling started in 2022 at the Frankfurt site was continued in the 2023 reporting year. However, the success was limited by strong traffic growth and the associated further increase in demand for personnel. Infrastructure measures were also introduced to improve baggage connectivity. This means that the forwarding of non-transported baggage items is now fully automated for many airlines so that passenger waiting time is shortened. In technical terms, the required X-ray checks of connecting baggage was optimized in order to save valuable time in the transfer process by reducing the malfunctions of the systems.\n\nThe Executive Board is informed about the development of baggage connectivity on a monthly basis. Management receives information on a daily basis so that measures can be taken at any time. Fraport regularly discusses the values with the airlines and ensures improvements are made. For example, Deutsche Lufthansa frequently receives a detailed monitoring report, and optimization measures are managed jointly with Fraport within the scope of regular meetings.\n\n*Performance indicators –* Global passenger satisfaction and baggage connectivity are considered the most important criteria for measuring service quality (see the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters).\n\n#### **Information and airport security**\n\nSecurity is the key requirement for air traffic. This principle applies equally to passenger traffic and air freight. Accordingly, security management has always been a top priority at Fraport.\n\nAll countries in which Fraport is active belong to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and have contractually committed to comply with the organization's safety standards and recommended practices for airports. In contrast to most ICAO member states, German law allocates passenger and baggage checks to government authorities, whereas in other countries this is usually the responsibility of the airports.\n\n#### **Information security**\n\n*Objective –* All important business and operating processes at Fraport are supported by IT systems. Due to the ongoing development of new technologies and the increasing global threat of cyberattacks generally, there is an underlying risk potential for IT systems. The objective is therefore to protect all IT systems and data against failure, manipulation, and unwanted publication.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* Fraport protects its IT systems and data against failure, manipulation, and unwanted publication with active and preventive **IT security management**. These systems are configured redundantly and are housed at separate sites. The risks in the area of IT security are included in the risk management system (see also the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter). The requirements for IT security are specified in the IT security policy and security guidelines that must be followed throughout the Group. Compliance with these requirements is checked regularly by Internal Auditing, IT Security Management, or external advisors. In 2023, Fraport AG once again implemented a variety of projects to adequately respond to the growing risks arising from information technology. In addition, further personnel were hired in this section. The level of IT security is also part of the annual management report for the quality management certification according to ISO 9001 and is therefore regularly audited by external auditors. In addition, potential for improvement identified within the scope of internal audits as well as in the latest KRITIS audit conducted in 2023 according to the German IT Security Act for critical infrastructures (KRITIS) will be processed and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) will be developed further.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nWithin the scope of a **working group** in the German Aviation Association, Fraport AG along with other airport operators, Deutsche Lufthansa, and German Air Traffic Control has developed the security standards of the industry. These are based on the new KRITIS requirements. The aim is to comply with regulatory requirements and establish a high security standard within the aviation industry.\n\nThe Group companies outside of Frankfurt use their own IT infrastructure, which they protect according to the Group's IT security guidelines. As a rule, the IT systems of the Group companies at the Frankfurt site as well as the SAP systems of Fraport Greece and Fraport Slovenija are integrated into the technology of Fraport AG and managed from Frankfurt. Using other IT systems is only possible with the consent of the Executive Board. At Fraport AG, a separate section within the \"Information and Telecommunication\" service unit is responsible for IT security. Its tasks are, among other things, the ongoing identification and implementation of measures to meet high security standards.\n\n*Performance indicator –* The security management system at Fraport receives a variety of performance indicators that measur e the effectiveness of the measures implemented. These indicators cannot be published for security reasons.\n\n#### **Data protection**\n\n*Objective –*The objective is to ensure the handling of personal data in compliance with the data protection laws and to safeguard the rights of data subjects. It is irrelevant whether this involves data from passengers, customers, employees, or external companies.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* Fraport AG has a reporting system for processes that require the company to process personal data. These processes are recorded in a central processing directory. To consolidate the processes and rules at Fraport AG, existing processes were implemented in a **data protection management system** and a data protection policy was established. In the **data protection policy**, the Executive Board has laid out the principles, procedures, and obligations to be observed by all employees when they collect, disclose, transmit, modify, store, or delete personal data such as names, addresses, personnel numbers, or IP addresses in the course of their business activities. Specific data protection topics, such as data subject information or data subject rights, the deletion of data, or the reporting of data protection violations, have been set out in action guidelines with practical information, instructions, process descriptions and reference samples. The guidelines are to be implemented as an annex to the data protection directive for all employees. Extensive **training concepts** such as an e-learning tool and video training have been established, which can be accessed on the Intranet. At Fraport AG, the separation between the audit and control function and the specification function is ensured by filling the roles of data protection officer and data protection manager.\n\nThe **data protection officer** monitors whether all data protection regulations are complied with at the company. This officer reports directly to the Executive Board and is independent in their tasks. Violations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are reported directly to this officer – anonymously if so desired. The **data protection manager** is responsible for the processing directory of Fraport AG and organizes the processes required for this. This manager has authority to issue guidelines and reports to the Executive Board at regular intervals. The fundamental task of the data protection manager is to initiate, plan, implement, and control the data protection management system.\n\nThe majority of the personal data processed by Fraport is due to the issue of airport ID cards and is thus compulsory for security reasons. Fraport AG has implemented both technical and organizational measures to protect data against misuse. Access to this system is allowed to only a limited group of people for a specifically defined task. Fraport AG collects personal data of passengers primarily for the use of parking garages, baggage handling, and specific processes at the terminal. Special regulations were therefore established while implementing biometric passenger processes (biometric eGates at the integrated pre-checks). Travel data is processed exclusively by the airlines. There are clear guidelines for the use of video technology at the Frankfurt site in order to ensure the personal rights of passengers, visitors, and employees. It also regulates the extent to which authorities are allowed to use Fraport video technology.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nGiven the advancing digitalization, the data protection team implemented specific processes in order to meet future requirements within a reasonable period of time. The procedures introduced ensure that data protection law is taken into account from the outset, both for business processes in general and for specific data protection topics, such as the processing of data subject inquiries. Checklists and automated evaluations are essential components here.\n\nThe level of data protection is part of the annual management report for the quality management certification according to ISO 9001. In addition, the data protection officer prepares an activity report. Since 2022, quality management audits will regularly include questions on data protection. Specific core questions are asked about the implementation of data protection. Depending on the answers, the data protection team develops an action plan for the following cycle. In addition, Internal Auditing reviews selected data protection topics annually.\n\nThe Executive Board of Fraport AG works toward ensuring that Group companies in Europe comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation and the timely implementation of the relevant legal requirements. In addition to offering **training** for employees, the Group companies have also created **technical requirements** to always take data protection into account. The Group companies outside the EU comply with the relevant national laws on data protection.\n\n*Performance indicator –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n#### **Airport safety**\n\nThis area encompasses both security and safety: safety refers to the operational safety of the overall airport as well as the safety within the airport site. Security is understood in terms of defending against terrorist threats and protecting civil aviation.\n\n*Objective –* For all operational processes, this focuses on safeguarding the safety and security of everyone at Fraport's airports.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* The measures include **passenger, baggage, and cargo inspections, as well as the access control points** for airport employees and suppliers. Regular weekly or monthly meetings are held with airlines, security service providers, and authorities to exchange current information.\n\nAt the international Group airports, the security requirements of each respective country as well as international standards for **safety and security management** are in effect. It is the responsibility of the local Group companies to implement and comply with these requirements. They include, among other things, a safety management system and access controls when entering the security area.\n\nFraport AG supports the Group companies in planning and implementing security measures. It also provides needs-based training for employees online, for example within the context of **safety and security trainings**. Within the scope of specialist **exchange events**, there is also a regular exchange between the Group companies.\n\n#### **Safety**\n\nBased on European statutory regulations, Fraport AG is obliged to operate a **Safety Management System (SMS)** at Frankfurt Airport. The EASA Safety Manager follows the guidelines of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and has a direct reporting right to the Executive Board.\n\nThe SMS focuses on the safety of airport operations. The SMS takes into account all the risks – technical, organizational, or human – that may affect them. The SMS coordinates security measures in daily operations. It records safety-related events and is able to detect vulnerabilities. The objective is for all parties involved in air travel to implement the requirements contained in the Safety Policy of Fraport AG. Airport employees can submit safety-related reports to the SMS. In addition, anyone with access to the airside areas (apron and runway) must regularly complete safety training.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a central reporting and alarm point for security matters, Fraport AG operates a security control center at Frankfurt Airport, which activates the emergency and crisis management, if required. The airport fire department, medical services, ambulance service, and the security services then coordinate operations on site. A crisis unit commences operation in the \"Emergency Response and Information Center\" (**ERIC**). It coordinates and executes all measures that require a concerted approach at the site beyond any routine damage and risk prevention. If necessary, the Fraport Emergency Team, consisting of volunteer employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies at the Frankfurt site, is deployed, which takes care of passengers, greeters, and relatives on site.\n\nThe contingency plan for Frankfurt Airport \"**FRA Not**\" documents which preparations have been made for various emergency scenarios and defines procedures to minimize the impact. ICAO and EASA prescribe regular exercises to be carried out by the respective airport operating company at the Group airports to train for the handling of emergencies and other security-related scenarios. Such exercises have no impact on flight operations. The results are used for further education and training.\n\n#### **Security**\n\nBoth international and European regulations contain guidelines on the structural design of airport infrastructure to prevent attacks such as sabotage or terrorist activities.\n\nIn Germany, the German Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG) regulates the **passenger and baggage controls as well as personnel and goods checks** for access to the security areas. In addition, the LuftSiG defines **the access and approach controls** to airside areas as being within the direct responsibility of the airport operator. On January 1, 2023, Fraport took over the organization, management, and operation of aviation security services at Frankfurt Airport from the German Federal Police. Personnel and goods checks are carried out by the Group company, FraSec Flughafensicherheit GmbH.\n\nFraport AG develops measures to maintain high security standards independently and in agreement with the competent authorities. In the reporting year, responsibility for performing security services and passenger controls at Frankfurt Airport was transferred. Since then, it has been possible for the airport operator to make greater progress with control and quality management and thus to make processes more flexible and more efficient.\n\n*Performance indicator –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n# **Employee-related Matters**\n\nGroup-wide, Fraport aims to remain competitive so as to provide workplaces with fair and just working conditions and guarantee appropriate salaries and wages.\n\nPursuant to responsible corporate governance, Fraport has made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD guidelines, and the ILO Core Labour Standards. They are published in the Code of Conduct, which obliges employees to comply with these fundamental principles.\n\nImportant non-financial performance indicators in the context of personnel matters are the key figures **employee satisfaction, women in management positions,** and **sickness rate** in Germany. Another indicator used to monitor accident development is **LTIF (Lost Time Injury Frequency)**.\n\n#### **Attractive and responsible employer**\n\n*Objective –* Fraport seeks to create good working conditions and increase employee satisfaction (see also the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters).\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results* – The Group Barometer, which is used to measure **employee satisfaction**, was redesigned in 2022 in terms of content and procedure. One of the goals is to make well-founded statements on employee satisfaction at Group level. This should make it easier to derive target-oriented improvement measures on the basis of the results throughout the Group. The survey is conducted every two years since the 2022 reporting year. Optimizing the derivation and implementation \n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nof measures is a key factor in the decision to switch from an annual to a biennial cycle. This will allow the potential of the measures to be better displayed and the impact of implementation to be reflected in the results of the follow-up survey.\n\nThe Group-wide structure of the survey is the same in terms of content. The questions are assigned to four topics – \"My employer,\" \"My workplace,\" \"My team,\" and \"My manager\" – and rated on a scale of 1 to 7. An average score is calculated for each topic. The average value of the topic scores is the indicator for the survey of a Group company. The average of the indicators for all companies, weighted by the number of participating employees per company, gives the satisfaction level of the Group's employees. Based on the results, improvement measures are then derived Group-wide.\n\nIn the survey performed in 2022, the aspects of remuneration, innovations, and professional development opportunities were rated as below average. Because of this they were the focus of the measures that were developed Group-wide in the reporting year. For the Frankfurt site, the potential for improvement was supplemented by the results from the HRneo strategic program that was started in summer 2023. HRneo has the aim of realigning the HR section and increasing the employer attractiveness of Fraport, positioning it for the future, and strengthening cohesion within the workforce across the Group.\n\nThe **Group works agreement** \"Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace\" forms the basis for principles such as freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities. The company agreement includes explicit definitions of values as well as specific internal regulations and structures. As far back as 2007, Fraport committed itself to the \"Charta der Vielfalt\" (Diversity Charter) – an initiative to promote diversity in companies and institutions. From an organizational perspective, responsibility for diversity is assigned to the Labor Relations Director with corresponding resources.\n\nAs a responsible employer, Fraport respects and promotes personal diversity and attaches great importance to ensuring that this is reflected in the way employees interact with each other. Diversity is a key goal for Fraport, which the Group systematically tackles as part of its **diversity management**. Different cultural backgrounds, experience abroad, gender and inclusion aspects, social origin, sexual orientation, or mix of ages enrich cooperation and promote innovation and creativity. This enables Fraport to flexibly respond to the changing requirements in the international markets and benefit from them. In 2023, Fraport continued its activities to strengthen and utilize diversity in the Group. One focus was on the topic of discrimination. Seminars were offered to employees to raise awareness about prejudices, racism, and discrimination in everyday life. In the past fiscal year, information events and counseling offerings were also held on the topics of career and family as well as career and care.\n\nFraport employs many international workers. These often have different language qualifications. The Fraport Group therefore uses language trainers and explains the safety regulations of the work areas with forms in straightforward language and with many illustrations, thus ensuring continuing language education.\n\nThe measures for strategic **succession planning** and the supervision of top management positions are carried out organizationally by the \"HR Top Executives\" central unit. Executives are supervised at the third and fourth level, and **talent management**, which is primarily concerned with developing potential executives, is assigned within the \"Human Resources\" central unit of Fraport AG. Both organizational units report to the Labor Relations Director.\n\nFraport AG has been pursuing its goal of increasing the **proportion of women in management positions** for many years (see also the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters). In addition to systematic talent management and the Potential Assessment Center, the long-term measures include the Cross Mentoring Program, coaching measures within the context of the continuous development of female executives, and promoting a network of female employees. In addition, there is the option of working part-time.\n\n*Performance indicator –* Employee satisfaction at Fraport AG and in the Group as well as the ratio of women in management positions at Fraport AG and the Fraport Group in Germany (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters).\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Occupational health and safety**\n\n*Objective –* Preventive measures in occupational health and safety in the Fraport Group focus on preserving and strengthening the health, performance, motivation, and thus productivity of employees in the long term. Fraport has therefore set the goal of continuously reducing the number of accidents at work and stabilizing the sickness rate in Germany in the medium term and reducing it in the long term.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* The key principles for Fraport AG and the Group companies can be found in the **Group \"Occupational Health and Safety\" policy**. Drawing on the requirements of ISO 45001, the Group policy ensures accountability. The defined guidelines are to be implemented independently by the Managing Directors and supplemented by company-specific rules in internal regulations. This requirement is valid effective immediately for Fraport AG and German Group companies. Taking into account the national laws, the regulation is also an option for desired action for the international Group companies.\n\nIn accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act (Arbeitssicherheitsgesetz), Fraport AG has implemented an occupational safety unit, an occupational health services unit, and prevention and health management under the Director of Labor Relations, which advise and support corporate departments in the further development of occupational health and safety. Measures to promote occupational health are controlled by the occupational health management. The **Occupational Safety Board** represents the Executive Board's efforts for the effective and efficient organization of preventive health and safety for the Fraport Group. Collaboration and the exchange of experience for all Group companies for which the Group guideline is binding are organized in the **Occupational Health and Safety Management System Board**. The Board meets once per year. Overarching tasks are promoted together in order to work efficiently and conserve resources. In addition, there is a steering committee for prevention and health management, where Group and sector-related health measures are discussed, and decisions are made.\n\nPreventing accidents at work remains an issue of great importance in the Fraport Group. For the LTIF indicator, which is calculated based on the number of accidents at work (from the first day of absence) in relation to the hours worked (in millions), the objective is to reach a value of 22.5 by 2025. The Group LTIF decreased to 20.6 in the 2023 reporting year (previous year: 22.6). A significant focus on accident prevention and avoiding work-related health risks could be seen mainly in the Ground Handling segment. Due to the fast recovery in traffic after the coronavirus pandemic, accident figures have also come back into focus. As part of recruitment measures, above all in the Ground Handling section, the integration of occupational safety measures into training was an essential component. Furthermore, it is also especially important that occupational safety standards are guaranteed when dealing with hazardous substances, in maintenance, in internal transport and traffic, and during infrastructure construction activities. In addition to basic and recurring training programs focusing on various workplaces for all employees and executives, special driver safety training is offered to employees whose work involves driving. Targeted and temporary measures and projects are intended above all to raise employee awareness of safe conduct especially in operational sections.\n\nThe increased requirements that result from the now established hybrid working form were taken into account with numerous **digital health offers**. The Prevention and Health Management department has structured the health measures and focused on the requirements. Provision of licenses for a health app that have been available to interested employees of Fraport AG since 2022 was continued. A quarterly newsletter follows seasonal health topics in a digital format. In addition, in October 2023 there was a dedicated Mental Health Week. Many offers such as screenings, travel vaccination advice, and a health market with campaign stands, presentations, and checkups were also held on-site in Frankfurt.\n\nDifferent programs to promote health in the workplace, and training courses on the issue of occupational safety have been implemented at the international Group companies. Vaccination has also been offered at the airports in Slovenia and Greece. Unannounced inspections were carried out regularly at Lima Airport in addition to the extensive occupational safety training courses to ensure compliance with requirements.\n\n*Performance indicator –* LTIF in the Group, sickness rate in the Group in Germany, and in Fraport AG (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters).\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Social Matters**\n\nFrankfurt Airport is one of the largest local workplaces in Germany. Additional employment effects are also created in enterprises that are contracted by Fraport for the construction and modernization of airport infrastructures.\n\n#### **Engagement in the regions**\n\n*Objective –* The objective is to make a positive contribution to the economic and social development of the region.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* For Fraport, social responsibility has been a corporate principle for many years. Fraport AG's funding concept for its community, cultural, and social engagement is \"**Active for the region**\". It primarily serves to boost clubs and support volunteer work in the region around Frankfurt Airport. All activities are combined into a department within the \"Corporate Communications\" central unit and assigned to the Chairman of the Executive Board. The so-called \"neighborhood framework\" describes the geographical boundary for these support activities. The area is based on district and state borders considering the most important approach and takeoff routes. If this area changes, the neighborhood framework is also adapted. Donation priorities include the promotion of social and charitable institutions, particularly those that encompass measures relating to education, social equality, health, and the integration of marginalized groups in society. Employees can also apply for donations as patrons of their clubs. Sports sponsorship in the Rhine-Main region includes both recreational and professional sports. Wellknown names include the FRAPORT SKYLINERS, which Fraport AG has been supporting for many years. In this regard, Fraport sponsors not only the German national division team but also gives donations to support the \"Basketball macht Schule\" (Basketball Goes to School) project.\n\nIn the areas of **culture and education**, Fraport is involved in longstanding partnerships with the Rheingau Music Festival and the Frankfurt cultural institutions Städel Museum, Schirn Kunsthalle, and Liebieghaus Sculpture Collection.\n\nFraport has financially supported youths' and young adults' integration into working life for many years with the **ProRegion** foundation. In addition to projects for the vocational and social integration of young people who have been forced to flee or migrate, other projects on professional orientation and competence assessment in general education schools continuously receive funding. Since the Foundation merely acts as a funding institution, it relies on close cooperation with proven institutions of youth vocational training. These include the Frankfurt-based Gesellschaft für Jugendbeschäftigung e.V., the Evangelischer Verein für Jugendsozialarbeit, the KUBI Gesellschaft für Kultur und Bildung GmbH, the Berufsbildungswerk Südhessen in Karben, and the \"Pilot\" unit of the Evangelische Kirchenkreis Hanau.\n\nEven at many sites belonging to the international **Group companies**, regions close to the airport also benefit from the economic performance, the donations made, and sponsorship activities undertaken by the Group companies independently. In this regard, the focus is on local projects, such as in the areas of child support, environmental protection, and sports. Earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria have also been supported financially.\n\n*Performance indicator –* As a large portion of the measures had to be suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, the \"Engagement in the regions\" subject area is currently being re-established.\n\n#### **Noise abatement**\n\n*Objective –* With noise reduction and noise abatement measures, Fraport seeks to create a balance between mobility services at the airport and economic success on the one hand and the quality of life around the airport on the other. Keeping aircraft noise pollution as low as possible despite the increase in air traffic is a permanent task. In Frankfurt, the aim is to keep the aircraft noise pollution in the region significantly below the figure of a LOG noise area determined in the 2007 planning decision below a forecasted figure of 22,193 ha.\n\nNational and local regulations about noise protection apply at the Group sites. Violations against these regulations in the reporting year are not known. The Group airports have implemented appropriate noise protection measures and monitoring systems.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* In order to minimize noise pollution, Fraport is constantly working toward pollution reduction measures that go beyond the legal requirements.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe aircraft noise pollution in the area around the airport is continuously monitored. **Aircraft noise monitoring** is also implemented at the Group airports. In Greece, complaints about aircraft noise can also be submitted via the company website. At the Group airport in Lima, a committee has also been set up to combat aircraft noise, involving airlines as well as national and local government agencies.\n\nFraport AG collaborates with the region affected by aircraft noise, representatives of the state government, and other members of the aviation industry in two committees. The **Aircraft Noise Commission** (FLK) is a legally appointed body that advises the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing (HMWEVW), the German Air Traffic Control (Deutsche Flugsicherung, DFS), and the Federal Supervisory Office for Air Traffic Control (BAF) on noise abatement measures due to flights and air pollution resulting from aircraft exhaust gases. Fraport AG regularly reports the evaluations of the aircraft noise measurements and results of simulation calculations on aircraft noise pollution to the supervisory authority and the FLK and publishes its findings on the website ( www.fraport.com).\n\nThe **Airport and Region Forum** (FFR) is a body of the Hessian State Chancellery. The key task of the FFR is to foster dialog between the region and the aviation industry and to discuss the effects of air traffic, with a particular focus on the Rhine-Main region. The FFR includes the \"Active Noise Abatement\" expert group, which advises on measures to reduce aircraft noise.\n\nThe **Fraport Noise Monitoring \"FRA.NoM\"** shows currently measured noise levels at the stationary aircraft noise measurement points of Fraport AG and identifies recognized flight noise from the last three months. It also reports the approaches and takeoffs at Frankfurt Airport as well as their effect on the noise levels in real time. The information system for aircraft noise issues, **FRA.Map**, available online allows interested parties to find information for their location or place of residence on an interactive map. In addition, the system shows the protection zones in the noise protection area, and the area in which rooftop security measures can be claimed to prevent damage caused by wake turbulence.\n\nA basic distinction is made between active and passive noise abatement.\n\n| Active noise abatement<br>Reduces noise directly at the source |                                                      | Passive noise abatement<br>Reduces the noise level at the place of immission |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| emission-based airport<br>charges                              | Noise ceiling                                        | Constructional measures on buildings                                         |\n| Noise-reducing<br>operating concepts                           | Noise-reducing take-off<br>and<br>landing procedures |                                                                              |\n\n### **Active noise abatement**\n\nActive noise abatement directly reduces noise at the source or by implementing **noise-reducing operating concepts and takeoff or landing procedures**. These measures include establishing a \"Ground Based Augmentation System\" (GBAS) navigation system, which enables a steeper angle of approach of 3.2 degrees for all runways in Frankfurt. With the so-called noise abatement model in Frankfurt, in both off-peak periods at night, individual takeoff and landing runways are alternately not used, enabling the local nighttime six-hour quiet period to be increased by one hour.\n\nFraport AG charges noise-related charges for takeoffs and landings. According to the new schedule of charges, which has applied from January 1, 2023, the noise-related airport charges have been further increased. The use of modern, quieter aircraft is rewarded by the Noise Rating Index (NRI). Fraport is thus providing further economic incentives for airlines to take off or land in Frankfurt using quieter aircraft.\n\nThe voluntary alliance for a noise emission ceiling created in 2017 helps to ensure that the noise exposure at Frankfurt Airport during the day does not increase as much as would be permitted under the zoning decision, despite growth in aircraft movements. The traffic volume and traffic structure of the zoning approval for the expansion result in noise contours with continuous \n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders *Combined Management Report* Consolidated Financials Statements Group Notes Further Information\n\nsound levels of 55 dB(A) and 60 dB(A). These contours have been reduced by 1.8 dB(A) across the board. The total areas within the reduced contours define the noise emission ceiling. A flight movement quota applies at night: no more than 133 aircraft movements may be scheduled for each average night of the calendar year between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. If the limit values are exceeded, Fraport AG and airlines must examine how they can reduce the noise level, for example by using quieter aircraft. The calculations in the 2023 monitoring report for 2022 show that the levels did not exceed the noise emission ceiling in 2022. The values of the previous year are always checked.\n\n#### **Passive noise abatement**\n\nPassive noise abatement includes measures that reduce noise from the point of origin (emission site, e.g., aircraft) to the place of impact (place of immission, e.g., apartment). Passive noise abatement measures are intended to reduce the noise level inside buildings by way of structural improvements, such as installing sound-insulating windows. Around Frankfurt Airport, Fraport AG had legal obligations to finance noise abatement measures for around 86,000 households. A noise protection area defined which households were entitled to reimbursement by Fraport for noise abatement measures. The deadline for submitting invoices expired on October 12, 2022, the invoices received on time have largely been approved by Darmstadt Regional Council with a few exceptions and the funds paid out by Fraport.\n\nIn the area of passive noise abatement, the Fraport Group held provisions in the amount of €0.7 million as at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023 (see Group Notes, note 40, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 30).\n\n*Performance indicator* – Compliance with the specified noise ceiling (the area under a Leq 55 dB(A) day (6 a.m.–10 p.m.) should constantly remain below 22,193 ha).\n\n# **Environmental Matters**\n\nAirport operations and air traffic have a major effect on the environment. Fraport is committed to fulfilling the environmental requirements associated with this effect.\n\nIt is particularly important to deal intensively with environmental concerns, especially when planning to expand facilities. The Group's growth targets must be pursued in line with environmental protection. The expansion of both Lima Airport and Frankfurt Airport are subject to environmental requirements. For the financing of Terminal 3 at the Frankfurt site, the European Investment Bank (EIB) requires a project progress report every year that also includes all significant environmental aspects.\n\nFraport is committed to issuing a report each year on its environmental activities and performance (see www.fraport.com/responsibility). To this end, the Group companies complete a comprehensive catalog of standardized environmental indicators once a year. The indicators are combined for reporting (see the \"ESG Fact Book\" at www.fraport.com/publications and the environmental statement at www.fraport.com/environmental-management).\n\n#### **Climate protection**\n\n*Objective –* In order to measure the environmental impact, the Executive Board has identified the scope 1 and 2 CO<sup>2</sup> emissions as the most important indicator. The goal is to reduce this indicator on a Group-wide level to 95,000 metric tons per year by 2030; Fraport seeks to be carbon neutral by 2045 (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters).\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* CO<sup>2</sup> emissions of Fraport AG and the Fraport Group are measured and monitored by the department of Environmental Management within the \"Corporate Development and Sustainability\" central unit. The Executive Board is informed twice a year of the development of Fraport AG and the Group issues as part of the Interim Report Q2/6M. In addition, the scope 1 and 2 CO<sup>2</sup> emissions trend is reported to the Executive Board yearly for each building at Fraport AG.\n\nFraport has used its own monitoring instrument, the **CO**<sup>2</sup> **and energy consumption monitoring system**, to present, analyze, and manage energy consumption at the Frankfurt site. It creates transparency about consumption and consumers, helps to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy costs. It also allows qualified statements to be made in a timely manner with regard to current CO<sup>2</sup> emissions at Fraport AG and allows any undesirable trends with respect to the strategic CO<sup>2</sup> targets to be detected at an early stage. The monthly energy consumption of buildings, plants, and equipment serves as the basis for the data. All energy sources, such as electricity, district cooling, district heating, gas, fuel for vehicles, and other fuels, are taken into account.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe \"Energiezirkel\", which was previously responsible for the monitoring of the ongoing long-term energy saving measures and continuously examining further possible measures, was replaced in 2023 by the **Decarbonization Board**. This Board monitors the implementation of the decarbonization master plan, continuously examines the ongoing and planned measures to cut CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, and reports the results to the Executive Board twice a year. Fraport is gradually switching to **emission-free alternatives** for its vehicles on the apron. In addition, 94 electric vehicles and auxiliary devices were acquired in 2023. To complement this, Fraport is starting to establish a fast-charging infrastructure on the apron, which will be available for use by all those active in this area. In doing so, Fraport benefits from support from the State of Hesse. There is also a continuous expansion of charging points in the parking garages and on landside parking areas, based on the needs of customers and legal requirements. A number of electric vehicles were also procured for the Group companies in 2023, which are used in particular in the operational area, for example as follow-me vehicles. Fraport intends to continue to invest in wind and solar energy. The aim is to use renewable energies to meet our own electricity needs at the Frankfurt site as far as possible. Therefore, the construction of another fence system was authorized in the reporting year. These are systems, which are arranged vertically rather than at an angle, thereby ensuring high electricity yields in spite of their small footprint. At the same time, the vegetation underneath is not substantially affected by the structure as the system neither prevents rainfall reaching it nor provides permanent shading. Depending on the approval, the photovoltaic system in the final expansion stage can extend to a length of 2,800 meters parallel to the runway and generate a photovoltaic output of up to 18 megawatts.\n\nThe variety of individual measures that have already been decided upon and implemented in the last few years represent important steps toward achieving the climate protection objectives of Fraport. A **master plan for decarbonization** up to 2045 was developed to ensure the comprehensive consideration and structuring of further measures for decarbonization. It describes the strategic principles and defines the framework for successful implementation of the measures and thus represents a policy document for decarbonization. In 2023, the master plan for decarbonization was also adopted by the fully consolidated international Group airports and backed up with appropriate measures to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions.\n\nThe participation of Fraport in the **Airport Carbon Accreditation** program of the ACI (Airports Council International) serves as proof of its CO<sup>2</sup> management. It has evolved into the global standard for CO<sup>2</sup> reporting and management at airports. Participation at level 2 (\"reduction\") or higher requires proof of both a CO<sup>2</sup> reduction target and CO<sup>2</sup> management program in accordance with international requirements, and annual emission reductions verified by external auditors. Frankfurt Airport reached level 3 (\"optimization\") back in 2012. Ljubljana Airport reached level 2 in 2015 and is aiming for level 3+ (\"neutrality\") in the medium term. The Varna and Burgas Group airports in Bulgaria are also at level 2. The Greek airports in Kefalonia, Mitilini, Rhodes, Thessaloniki, Chania, and Samos are at level 1 (\"mapping\"), as is Lima Airport. The airport in Antalya is at level 3+ (\"neutrality\"). The other Group airports have yet to participate; however, they are obligated to have their CO<sup>2</sup> footprint assessed by way of an external audit.\n\n*Performance indicator –* CO<sup>2</sup> emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in the Group and Fraport AG (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Nonfinancial Performance Indicators\" chapters).\n\n### **Protection of environment and nature**\n\n*Objective –* Fraport's environmental policy obliges all Group companies to make use of natural resources and the environment in a sustainable, conserving, and preventive manner. This goal is systematically implemented through environmental management. Based on their business activities, Fraport AG and the fully consolidated Group companies have defined the objective of introducing and implementing such an environmental management system that is classified as \"fundamentally climate-relevant\" – which means fully consolidated subsidiaries with substantial energy consumption – according to the relevant ISO Standard 14001 and the European EMAS Regulation. The \"Eco Management and Audit Scheme\" (EMAS) is an environmental management and audit scheme developed by the European Union, which companies can implement voluntarily. This audit is carried out by stateauthorized environmental experts. EMAS is considered to be the world's most demanding environmental management system. Fraport AG has been validated by EMAS for over 20 years.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* **Environmental management systems** serve to systematically organize, manage, and monitor corporate environmental protection within the company. The environmental management systems cover all environmental factors relevant to the company such as energy consumption, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, air pollutant emissions, effects of business activities on nature and biodiversity, water consumption, and waste. The Coordinator for the Environmental Management System at Fraport AG reports to the Chairman of the Executive Board in management reviews. The long-standing experience of Fraport AG employees in the area of environmental management benefits all Group companies, for example in the form of technical support, including on site. Companies that join the Fraport Group and do not yet have an environmental management system are obliged to introduce such a system in the course of the acquisition. At the end of the past fiscal year, 78.4% of fully consolidated, environmentally relevant Group companies, weighted according to revenue, had such a system certified according to ISO 14001 or EMAS.\n\nWherever possible, Fraport AG extends the **green areas** at the Frankfurt site. Fraport AG will upgrade some 2300 hectares of land in the immediate and wider vicinity of the airport from a nature conservation perspective to fulfill a legal requirement under the zoning decision for the airport expansion: deciduous forests, orchards, marshes, and nutrient-poor grassland. Measures to counterbalance the Expansion South project, in particular Terminal 3, are already included in this extensive package of measures.\n\nThe implementation and evaluation of the measures are subject to continuous monitoring. For **ecological compensation measures**, Fraport Group held provisions in the amount of €12.4 million as at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023 (see Group Notes, note 40, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 30).\n\nPromoting biological aviation safety is the responsibility of **Wildlife Hazard Management**. Wildlife Hazard Management at the international Group airports is implemented according to international regulations as well as, where appropriate, based on national and local targets. Corresponding monitoring systems are implemented. Wildlife Hazard Management at Group airports is concerned, among other things, with the monitoring of birds in order to ensure safe operations. In addition to biotope design and standardized animal observations at and around the airport, this also includes aversive conditioning through acoustic and visual stimuli. Maintaining the green spaces is a prerequisite for reducing the number of potential animals on the airport grounds which are relevant to air traffic safety. This is also ensured by Wildlife Hazard Management.\n\n*Performance indicator –* Proportion of fully consolidated, climate-relevant Group companies with certified environmental management systems (EMAS or ISO 14001), weighted according to revenue.\n\n#### **Air quality**\n\n*Objective –* There is no legal obligation for airports to monitor air quality. However, Fraport has set the objective of gaining a deeper understanding of the emission of air pollutants (emissions) by the airport and their effect on people and the environment (immissions). Air quality has been monitored at several sites at Frankfurt Airport since 2002. And it is also regularly monitored at some international airports.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* From an organizational standpoint, the \"Noise and Air Quality\" department of the Aviation strategic business unit is responsible for air quality issues at the Frankfurt site. An annual report informs the Executive Board about the measured annual average and annual indicators of air pollutants on the airport grounds. Fraport AG regularly publishes the results of the measurements on its website in the **\"Air quality annual report\"**. The measurements show that the air quality on the airport site have remained unchanged at an urban level since the first time air pollutant limits were measured.\n\nAt the local level, there is an overlap of limit-controlled air pollutants related to the airport and those not attributed to the airport. The airport's impact on the air quality in the surrounding areas is largely limited to zones within a proximity and to the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions component. Measurements and modeling suggest, however, that external influences, such as road traffic, also play a role in the air quality on airport grounds. In addition, the level of pollutant concentrations depends heavily on the weather.\n\nTo gain information on the proportion of the overall exposure in a region, computational models have been developed that include all the relevant sources of pollution and their emissions for a given zone. The **LASPORT program** takes into account various airport-related emission sources in the lower atmosphere, prepares spread computations, and illustrates the exposures. The Airport Association ADV (Association of German Airports) commissioned the program in 2002. The provider has since expanded the program in close collaboration with Fraport AG and other users.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n€110.4 million higher income from investments was achieved in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe **financial result** amounted to €92.4 million (previous year: –€165.6 million). The change to the previous year of +€258.0 million was mainly due to the previous year's write-off of shares in Fraport Malta Ltd. amounting to €139.1 million and in Thalita Trading Ltd. amounting to €10.0 million in connection with the investment in St. Petersburg Airport. Furthermore,\n\n**EBT** was €408.4 million (previous year: –€83.6 million). Taxes on income amounted to €79.3 million (previous year: €4.8 million). This resulted in a net income of €329.1 million (previous year: net loss of €88.4 million).\n\nAfter transferring €164.5 million to other revenue reserves, profit earmarked for distribution amounts to €164.6 million. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the 2024 Annual General Meeting to transfer the profit earmarked for distribution to other revenue reserves.\n\n#### **Asset and financial position**\n\n#### **Asset and capital structure**\n\n| Assets                                                     |                   |                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                                                  | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Non-current assets                                         | 11,280.6          | 10,754.1          |\n| Current assets                                             | 2,400.7           | 2,090.9           |\n| Prepaid expenses and accrued income                        | 44.3              | 38.9              |\n| Deferred tax assets                                        | 303.1             | 341.9             |\n| Assets arising from the overfunding of pension obligations | 4.6               | 0.0               |\n| Total                                                      | 14,033.3          | 13,225.8          |\n\n#### **Liabilities and equity**\n\n \n\n| € million                                                 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Shareholders' equity                                      | 3,205.1           | 2,876.0           |\n| Special items for investment grants in non-current assets | 7.4               | 7.8               |\n| Provisions                                                | 486.6             | 507.7             |\n| Liabilities                                               | 10,280.9          | 9,786.2           |\n| Accrued income and accrued expenses                       | 31.9              | 33.8              |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                  | 21.4              | 14.3              |\n| Total                                                     | 14,033.3          | 13,225.8          |\n\n#### **Asset and capital structure**\n\nAt the end of the 2023 fiscal year, the **total assets** of Fraport AG amounted to €14,033.3 million, up €807.5 million year-on-year (+6.1%).\n\n**Non-current assets** rose by €526.6 million to €11,280.6 million. This is mainly due to the increase in property, plant, and equipment of €586.4 million – particularly in connection with construction measures as part of the Expansion South project at the Frankfurt site.\n\nAt €2,400.7 million, **current assets** were €309.8 million higher than in the previous year, mainly due to the increase in short-term securities (+€243.9 million).\n\n**Shareholders' equity** as at December 31, 2023 amounted to €3,205.1 million, and rose by €329.1 million as a result of the net income in the current fiscal year.\n\n**Liabilities** increased compared to the previous year by €494.7 million to €10,280.9 million, mainly due to the financing measures undertaken during the fiscal year to secure liquidity.\n\n**Liquidity** as at December 31, 2023, was €3,285.6 million, up from €2,980.9 million in the previous year. **Gross debt** increased in the reporting year to €9,711.3 million (previous year: €9,114.7 million). This led to a considerable increase of €291.9 million in **net financial debt** to €6,425.7 million (previous year: €6,133.8 million).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n<span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>As at the 2023 balance sheet date, the financial debt maturity profile of Fraport AG exhibited the following repayment structure:\n\nImage /page/116/Figure/6 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Maturity profile as at December 31, 2023 in € million\".

The increase resulted in particular from the traffic-related improvement in the operating result.\n\nAt €886.0 million, **cash flow used in investing activities excluding investments in cash deposits and securities** was above the previous year's level (€756.2 million), due to higher cash flow used in expansion measures.\n\nConsidering investments in and revenue from securities and promissory note loans as well as capital expenditure in relation to time deposits, the overall **cash flow used in investing activities** was €1,092.8 million (2022: €1,634.6 million).\n\nCompared to the previous year, **cash flow from financing activities** decreased by €59.4 million to €382.0 million.\n\nThis brought **cash and cash equivalents** to €120.6 million as at the 2023 fiscal year-end.\n\n# *Events after the Balance Sheet Date*\n\nAt the end of January 2024, Fraport Greece reached an agreement with the Greek government on compensation for the negative economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the second half of the 2021 fiscal year. The agreement will have a positive effect on Group EBITDA 2024 of around €28 million.\n\nNo further substantial events occurred after the balance sheet date for the Fraport Group.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>*Risk and Opportunities Report*\n\n# **Risk strategy and objectives**\n\nFraport aims to use a uniform and comprehensive processes to ensure that risks and opportunities are identified at an early stage, assessed uniformly, managed and monitored, and communicated transparently using a systematic reporting procedure. For this, all Fraport Group employees are required to participate actively in risk and opportunity management within the scope of their duties. Finding a proper balance between risks and opportunities begins in the strategic planning process and in the drafting of the long-term business plan. In general, Fraport strives to balance opportunities and risks in order to increase added value for its stakeholders by analyzing and leveraging new market opportunities and potential.\n\n# **Organization of the risk management**\n\n### **Structure and responsibilities of the risk management system**\n\nImage /page/117/Figure/11 description: The image shows an organizational chart. At the top is \"Finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board\", followed by \"Executive Board\". Below that is \"Risk Management committee (RMC)\". Next, there are two boxes: \"Risk Management, Processes, Systems Department (REW-RS)\" and \"Chief Risk Officer\". At the bottom is \"Fraport AG Departments / Group companies\". To the right of \"Risk Management committee (RMC)\" is \"Internal Audit\".\n\nThe Fraport Executive Board bears overall responsibility for an effective risk management system that ensures uniform and comprehensive risk management. In this context, by preparing the development plan, it has also approved the risk strategy and risk objectives for the Group. The Executive Board appoints the Chief Risk Officer and the members of the Risk Management Committee (RMC), approves the rules of procedure for the RMC and the risk management guidelines, and receives the quarterly reports and ad hoc reports in the risk management system.\n\nThe RMC is the highest committee in the risk management system and, following its meetings, releases quarterly risk reports to the Executive Board. The Chief Risk Officer is the spokesperson for the RMC and reports directly to the Executive Board. The Risk Management, Processes, Systems (REW-RS) department is responsible for the organization, maintenance, and further development of the Group-wide risk management and internal control system (ICS), and for regularly updating and implementing the guidelines for risk management system and ICS in the Fraport Group. The Risk Management, Processes, Systems department is also responsible for performing the risk analysis in accordance with the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG).\n\nRisk and opportunity management is a key function of the respective business, service, and central units of Fraport AG and Group companies that are responsible for their business processes; this involves management of material risks and the use of appropriate measures to mitigate and reduce them to an acceptable level, as well as actively grasping opportunities.\n\nProcess-integrated and process-independent monitoring measures form the elements of the internal monitoring systems. The central Group Internal Audit unit is integrated into the internal monitoring system of the Fraport Group with process-independent audit activities.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte) has examined the risk early warning system of Fraport AG during the audit of the annual financial statements for stock corporation law requirements.

Non-financial risks may have a negative impact on the achievement of the environmental, sustainable, and social targets of Fraport. In addition, in accordance with the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), human rights-related and environmental risks are defined as events that could potentially violate the due diligence obligations laid down in the Fraport policy statement in the company's own business and at direct suppliers. Opportunities are regarded as future developments or events that can lead to a positive planning or strategic target deviation.\n\nRisks are identified using various instruments by the operational business, service, and central units of Fraport AG and the group companies and top-down by the REW-RS department, RMC, and Executive Board. The risk identification methods used are for example market and competition analysis, evaluation of customer surveys, information about suppliers and institutions or monitoring risk indicators from the regulatory, economic, and political environment. The heads of the Fraport AG units and the executives of the Group companies are responsible for the accuracy of the information from their units/companies that is processed in the risk management system. They are obligated to constantly monitor and manage risk areas, and report on all risks in their divisions and their company to the REW-RS department on a quarterly basis. Central risk management can use the risk reports to identify risk trends in the Fraport Group. Outside of regular quarterly reporting, newly identified substantial risks must be reported immediately.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains, a risk analysis is performed annually to identify human rights-related and environmental risks in the company's own business and at direct suppliers, as well as on an ad-hoc basis if substantial changes or increases in the risk situation of the supply chain are to be expected.\n\n#### **Risk Evaluation**\n\nThe systematic evaluation of risks determines the impact and probability of occurrence of the identified risks, and makes it possible to estimate the extent to which the individual risks could jeopardize the objectives and strategy of the Fraport Group, or which risks will very likely, due to their nature, jeopardize the company as a going concern. Risk evaluation is always based on a rolling 24-month period. However, this does not mean that risk owners only analyze and evaluate the risks from a short-term perspective; possible infrastructural risks are in particular monitored in accordance with their long-term impact. The evaluation system divides the potential impact (= impact level) into four categories: \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", and \"very high\". It then assesses the impact level based on how the risks affect the relevant detection variable (EBIT, financial result, or liquidity). Furthermore, qualitative factors (media reporting/attention, effect on stakeholders), which could be important for Fraport's reputation and which additionally determine the risks, are also included in the analysis. The probability of occurrence for individual risks is also divided into four categories: \"unlikely\", \"possible\", \"likely\", and \"very likely\". The risk level (\"low,\" \"moderate,\" \"considerable\" and \"substantial\") arises from the combination of impact level and probability of occurrence.\n\nThe risk evaluation is conservative, i.e., it reflects the worst-case scenario for Fraport. A distinction is made between gross and net risk. Gross risk is the worst-case (financial) impact before countermeasures. The net risk represents the expected residual (financial) impact after initiation or implementation of countermeasures. The risk assessment in this report only reflects the net risk.\n\nIn order to assess possible combination effects between individual risks, the REW-RS department annually prepares a risk aggregation as part of the planning process. The impacts of the risks are aggregated by Monte Carlo simulation and applied to the balance sheet and income statement of Fraport AG in the planning horizon, taking account of planning uncertainties. The resulting impacts on the financial performance indicators of Fraport AG are analyzed and reported to the Executive Board as part of the adoption of the plans resulting from the risk-bearing capacity analysis. The requirements of Article 1 of the German Act on the Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Businesses (StaRUG) are taken into account accordingly.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Management of Risks**\n\nRisk owners are tasked with developing and implementing suitable countermeasures to minimize and manage risks. In addition, general strategies must be developed to deal with the identified risks. These strategies include risk avoidance, risk reduction with a view to minimizing the (financial) impact or the probability of occurrence, transfer of risk to a third party (for example in purchasing insurance policies), or risk acceptance. The decision regarding the implementation of the relevant strategy and/or measures also considers the costs in relation to the effectiveness of potential countermeasures. Here, the REW-RS department works closely with the risk owners in order to monitor the progress of countermeasures and to evaluate their effectiveness from a Group perspective.\n\n### **Risk monitoring and reporting**\n\nIntegrated risk management aims to ensure a transparent presentation of the Fraport Group's risk situation. Risks are reported to the Executive Board when they are classified as \"considerable\" or \"substantial\" based on their net risk according to systematic evaluation standards used Group-wide.\n\nIn the event of very significant changes to previously reported risks or newly identified \"substantial\" risks, ad hoc reports are also issued outside of the regular quarterly reporting schedule.\n\nTwice a year, the Executive Board reports the considerable (amber) and substantial (red) risks, including any changes in the same, to the Supervisory Board's Finance and Audit Committee. The figure below shows the recipients of the risk reporting, according to the net risk.\n\nImage /page/120/Figure/11 description: The image is a risk matrix with probability of occurrence on the y-axis and impact level on the x-axis. The y-axis is divided into four categories: unlikely (≤ 20%), possible (>20-50%), likely (>50-80%), and very likely (>80%). The x-axis is divided into four categories: low (≤ 6m €), medium (> 6m-20m €), high (> 20m-40m €), and very high (> 40m €). The matrix is filled with risk levels: low, moderate, considerable, and substantial. A legend at the bottom indicates the risk levels are associated with different offices: RM office, RM office and RMC, RM office, RMC, Executive Board, Finance and audit committee, and RM office, RMC, Executive Board, Finance and audit committee, Risk and Opportunities Report.\n\nThis process ensures the early detection of trends that could jeopardize the Fraport Group as a going concern.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nAn integral component of Fraport's risk management system is also the assessment of financial risks, whereby the presentation in the accounts of financial instruments overall and hedging transactions in particular is monitored and controlled. This process is described in the financial risks section (\"Risk report\" in accordance with section 289 (2) no. 1 HGB and section 315 (2) no. 1 HGB). At Fraport, this process represents a subsection of the accounting-related internal control system.\n\n# **Organization of opportunity management**\n\nThe opportunity management system of the Fraport Group is intended to identify and evaluate opportunities at the earliest possible stage and to initiate appropriate measures to capitalize on them and ensure their commercial success. This includes the assessment of opportunities from existing business, as well as from new business fields.\n\nThe business, service and central units responsible for their business processes and the Group companies identify opportunities throughout the year as part of the operational management of the company and as part of the annually revolving planning process. Opportunities are reviewed regularly as part of the risk reporting process by the REW-RS department.\n\nWhile short-term earnings monitoring focuses on opportunities that mainly affect the current fiscal year, the planning process focuses on opportunities that are of strategic importance for the Group. Within the context of the planning process, Fraport assesses market and competitive analyses, as well as environmental scenarios and deals with the orientation of the product and service portfolio, the cost drivers, and the critical success factors of the industry. Furthermore, Fraport monitors the identifiable trends among competitors and customers – such as airlines, passengers, and tenants – as well as in businesses outside of the industry which have an impact on air traffic in general and airport operations in particular. Fraport aims to further develop and expand the value-creating business fields that are already part of its operations. Moreover, Fraport is investing in business fields and business ideas in which the company can build sufficient competencies in order to create value over the long term.\n\nIn addition to opportunity management by the business, service and central units of Fraport AG and the Group companies, Fraport also draws on the expertise of the entire workforce. Using a variety of tools, such as Group idea management, the Digital Factory, or the Plug and Play LLC network, Fraport aims to identify opportunities that are developed by the employees.\n\n# **Business risks and opportunities**\n\nThe following section explains the risks and opportunities that could have a substantial impact on the business operations or the asset, financial, and earnings position and/or reputation of Fraport, as well as effects on its stakeholders, as at the valuation date of December 31, 2023. The evaluation is generally based on the rolling 24-month period from the valuation date. Potential infrastructural risks are also considered and assessed in accordance with their longer-term impact. Unless specified otherwise, the risks and opportunities described relate to all segments to varying extents (Aviation, Retail & Real Estate, Ground Handling and International Activities & Services). Selected, non-substantial risks are indicated on a voluntary basis in order to provide a comprehensive view of the risk situation.\n\nFraport AG is the parent company of the Fraport Group and comprises all of the described segments above. Therefore, it is also directly or indirectly subject to the risks and opportunities described. The risk evaluation is performed solely to assess risks without taking into account any potential opportunities. There is no offsetting of opportunities and risks.\n\nThe following table describes the substantial and other selected individual risks and opportunities:\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n[To Our Shareholders](#page-5-0) *[Combined Management Report](#page-39-0)* [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) [Group Notes](#page-144-0) [Further Information](#page-236-0)\n\nFurther Information\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023\n\n#### **Business risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Strategic risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Macroeconomic risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Risks**\n\n- Overall, global economic development may cool down more than expected and have a negative influence on passenger and air freight demand.\n- Continuing high inflation rates may reduce the disposable income of private households. The reduced purchasing power, together with uncertainties about the future development of inflation rates, may have a negative impact on flight bookings.\n- Sustained high interest rates intended to curb inflation may have a greater impact than expected on state and corporate refinancing and on global economic development. This would have a negative impact on planned traffic development.\n- As a result of sustained high energy prices, the competitiveness of German industry may suffer and Germany's position as an attractive hub for air traffic could be weakened.\n- In world trade, the trend toward greater national protectionism may adversely impact the export-oriented German economy.\n- Growth may be dampened by the weakening of the EU as a result of diverging interests among the Member States and the actions they take.\n- Current and simmering geopolitical hotspots may put a strain on economic development. In particular, there is a risk of an escalating conflict between China and Taiwan.\n\n#### **Measures**\n\n- Strong geographic diversification and focus on various passenger groups at the Group airports to reduce individual macroeconomic risks.\n- Geopolitical risks, restrictive political interventions, and saturation tendencies in air traffic demand in Western countries can be balanced out from regionally different growth potential among the Group airports.\n\n# **assessment:**  substantial > 20–50%\n\n**Trend ↑ Risk**\n\n> 40 mn €\n\nIncrease in the risk evaluation compared to the previous year due to the escalation in geopolitical conflicts with potential consequences for the business activities of the Fraport Group depending on how these conflicts develop.\n\n#### **Opportunities**\n\n- A clear decline in inflation and the recovery of the economy lead to growth of disposable income and a robust recovery in demand. Business travel and air freight may benefit from the upswing in the economy and, in particular, exports.\n- A quicker end to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, with a sustained relaxation of geopolitical tensions, may stimulate the global economy and support air freight development.\n- The rapid finalization of trade agreements with countries with high air freight potential may boost air freight development in Frankfurt.\n- The further expansion of the e-commerce business may strengthen Frankfurt's position as an air freight hub.\n\n#### **Market, competitive and regulatory risks and opportunities**\n\nvantages for German and European air traffic.\n\nIn addition to demand in and level of attractiveness of its domestic market, the competitive situation and attractive infrastructure, the success of an international airport depends on its airline customer structure and the associated global and dense route net-work, as well as the connectivity between demand

• Wars and geopolitical crises could result in rising energy costs and a sustained reduction in supply and demand, among other things.<br>• Rising crude oil and thus also kerosene prices could result in higher airfares and an associated dip in air travel demand. If competition is intense, rising crude oil prices could pose financial difficulties for less solvent airlines, with a resulting drop in supply.<br>• Further increases in air traffic control and aviation security charges and higher civil aviation tax increase the location risk and result in competitive disadvantages and financial losses. Supply is reduced or not created in Germany in the first place, and may be relocated to other hubs abroad.<br>• The measures planned/implemented in other European countries to reduce short-haul flights may mean a switch to alternative means of transport (rail and car) if implemented in Germany, reducing the demand for air travel. Passengers who cannot or do not want to use alternative transportation could switch to using foreign airports and Frankfurt Airport would subsequently lose such customers.<br>• Broad debates about climate protection could produce a long-term shift in travel behavior and lead to a reduction in air travel.<br>• Stricter travel guidelines and the consolidation of business travel may also result in a decline in air travel demand.<br>• Political and regulatory decisions at the regional, national and European levels will continue to affect the aviation sector. Climate protection and noise reduction requirements and associated taxes and charges could drive up the cost of air travel, and typically involve unilateral action on the market and on competition in international air traffic. Stronger targets under the European Union's Green Deal (Fit for 55) and the associated review of the Emission Trading Directive, as well as the definition of binding SAF quotas, will place an increased burden on European sites compared to other sites.

The situation may also worsen in the long term, given the decline in migration of EU citizens to Germany. Staff shortages in the air transport industry can have a negative impact on operational service delivery and consequently on the expected business development. • Terror attacks and hotspots of unrest could adversely affect demand for specific travel destinations. • Active participation in industryrelated associations\n\n#### **Opportunities**\n\n- Now that the coronavirus pandemic is over, there is continued high demand among consumers for tourist air travel. Recovery in the business travel segment could also be stronger than expected.\n- Previous development cycles in air traffic show that market turbulence only temporarily burdens the upward development of global air traffic. Long-term forecasts continue to assume growing demand in global air traffic.\n- Market exits of airlines lead to a concentration of established airlines at the larger German airports, from which transfer traffic at Frankfurt Airport may benefit.\n- The larger ranges of smaller aircraft provide an opportunity for new decentralized intercontinental routes from Frankfurt.\n- High-quality connections to the Deutsche Bahn rail network at the Frankfurt site ensure demand from transfer traffic within Germany even if air traffic is shifted to rail, and this is a major competitive advantage. Improvements to the intermodal product such as end-to-end ticketing and end-to-end baggage transport can strengthen rail feeder traffic and have a positive impact on Frankfurt Airport's catchment area.\n- Capacity increases at the Group airports are being implemented or have been completed, which will result in improved quality for airlines and greater passenger satisfaction. This may enable Fraport to benefit more than expected from long-term growth in the air traffic market.\n- A liberalization of air traffic rights may open up new markets for air traffic and expand existing markets.\n- International harmonization of regulatory measures that distorted competition in the past may make global competition fairer and reduce the risk of business moving elsewhere. There is a chance that airlines will further expand their intercontinental fleet in Frankfurt due to the excellent existing feeder service, intermodality, and cargo demand, thereby strengthening passenger and cargo traffic.\n- Digitalization and innovations offer new opportunities to improve processes, raise efficiency, and increase customer satisfaction.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Operational risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Risks and opportunities from capital expenditure projects at the Frankfurt Airport**\n\nCapital expenditure on construction at Frankfurt Airport is divided into two separate programs: \"FRA-Nord\" for projects in existing infrastructure and \"Ausbau Süd\" for projects to expand or create capacity.

For the construction of the new passenger terminal, LAP commissioned a construction consortium which, as the general contractor, takes on the EPC services (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) customary in the industry, which include all planning, procurement and construction measures. Project financing for the ongoing infrastructure and expansion measures was concluded in December 2022. Potential risks remain due to the size, complexity, and duration of the expansion project. However, as in the previous year, these are assessed as \"moderate\" as at the balance sheet date.<br><br>At Antalya Airport, interim financing has been secured until March 2024 for the expansion project being carried out by Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş. (FTA 2). FTA 2 has initiated discussions on the conclusion of follow-up financing and on increasing the financing volume, and these are now at an advanced stage. The probability of occurrence of a failure to secure follow-up financing at the planned level is assessed to be low. |  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |                                                                               |\n|       | Personnel risks and opportunities |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |                                                                               |\n| Risks |                                   | • Increased employee turnover due to a more attractive labor market and higher internal workload<br>• More difficult recruitment due to current labor market conditions<br>• Training periods for the recruitment of less qualified workers and thus later availability<br>• Staff shortages in the air transport industry can have a negative impact on operational service delivery and consequently on the expected business development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  | Measures<br>• Reorganizing Human Resources as part of the HRneo strategic program<br>• Improving IT support for HR processes<br>• Realigning recruitment processes and training measures<br>• Temporary granting of labor market allowances for staff recruitment, incentives through above-tariff remuneration schemes<br>• Improving appeal as an employer through modern work formats |  | Trend →<br>Risk assessment:<br>moderate<br><br>> 20 -

For the construction of the new passenger terminal, LAP commissioned a construction consortium which, as the general contractor, takes on the EPC services (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) customary in the industry, which include all planning, procurement and construction measures.

It is based on the framework of the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn terms of the accounting process of Fraport AG, the company regards the internal control and risk management system as a process that is embedded in the company-wide internal control and risk management system. Fraport AG prepares its own separate financial statements in accordance with German commercial and stock market regulations.\n\nThe process of preparing the financial statements of Fraport AG is laid down in a schedule detailing each individual step, including deadlines and responsibilities. Group Accounting monitors the progress and is schedule assisted by a system. In order to ensure standardized procedures, important operational processes of the sub-ledgers (accounts payable, accounts receivable, asset accounting, treasury, accounting of the decentralized departments) and general ledger have been documented in policies, process descriptions, manuals, and guidelines.\n\nFraport AG uses the SAP ECC 6.0 system for its accounting. Accounting-related internal controls are carried out, where possible, in the SAP ECC 6.0 system. Manual application and monitoring controls are carried out during the operational accounting processes in the sub-ledgers. A dual control method is implemented when preparing the financial statements of the general ledger, and subsequent mainly manual monitoring controls are carried out additionally for the purpose of ensuring the completeness and accuracy of items recognized in the sub-ledgers. The tax department calculates and posts taxes on income, and performs manual application and monitoring controls.\n\nSegregation of duties are implemented in the departments involved in the accounting process on a system, personnel, and organizational level. An SAP authorization concept for Fraport AG is used for issuing and administering access authorization for accounting-related systems.\n\nGroup accounting at Fraport is basically organized on a decentralized basis. Reconciliation of the local individual financial statements (commercial balance sheet I) of the parent company and subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated companies to the individual financial statements (commercial balance sheet II) prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies is carried out decentrally by the companies. To ensure uniform Group accounting and measurement Fraport has developed an IFRS Group accounting guideline on the basis of which the companies included in the consolidated financial statements reconcile commercial balance sheet I to commercial balance sheet II. The effectiveness and accuracy of the Group accounting process is confirmed by the companies included in the consolidated financial statements in the context of an internal Group declaration of completeness.\n\nWherever possible, accounting-related internal controls are carried out in SAP BPC. Access authorizations at the level of the consolidated companies are assigned and managed centrally at Fraport AG on the basis of a user authorization concept. Manual application and monitoring controls, particularly with regard to the completeness and quality of the reporting data, are carried out as part of the operational accounting processes in Group accounting. The effectiveness of the internal control system is reviewed annually by performing a control self-assessment.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group Accounting department of Fraport AG. The Group financial statement process is described in detail in a flow chart which contains the individual process steps with dates and responsibilities. The progress of the process as well as reporting deadlines and the completeness of the Group reporting system are monitored by the Group Accounting department.\n\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements are prepared as part of the consolidated financial statement process by the Group Accounting department. Where necessary, the information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is subsequently checked by central or decentralized specialist departments after the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Corporate Finance and Investor Relations department is generally responsible for preparing the combined management report. This department consolidates the information provided by the specialist departments. Subsequent control of the consolidated information is performed by the specialist departments.\n\nKey sub-processes of the accounting process for the Group and Fraport AG, as well as the performed internal controls, are subject to scheduled audit by the Internal Audit department.\n\n# **Information on the central internal control system1**\n\nIn addition to the accounting-related internal control system and the risk management system, the Fraport Group identifies, evaluates, and manages strategic, operational, and compliance process risks as part of the central internal control system. To assess the design and effectiveness of the system, a control self-assessment (CSA) is carried out annually, analogous to the accountingrelated internal control system. The primary objective of the CSA is to review the design and effectiveness of business process controls and to identify and report any control weaknesses in business processes. The knowledge gained is used, among others, for the continuous improvement and further development of the central internal control system.\n\nQuarterly reports on the current group-wide risk and opportunity situation are given at Executive Board meetings, and the result of the CSA of the central internal control system is presented annually. On the basis of these findings and any process-independent audits, the Executive Board annually assesses the design and effectiveness of Fraport AG's risk management and the central internal control system described above.\n\nThe central Group Internal Audit performs process-independent audit activities on the risk management and central internal control system. Audit reviews regularly provide information and findings on the central internal control system, which are to be remedied by measures taken by the REW-RS department together with the departments. Measures for findings from completed audit reviews are currently being processed.\n\nBased on the overall information, the Executive Board has no indication that the risk management system or the central internal control system were not adequate or effective as at December 31, 2023.\n\nSince inherent risks are subject to a probability of detection, a risk management or central internal control system that is judged to be adequate and effective cannot fully ensure complete coverage of all potential risks or exclusion of process violations of any kind.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board is systematically involved in monitoring the design and effectiveness of the risk management and central internal control system. It receives a semi-annual report on the current risk and opportunity situation and is presented with an annual report on the results of the CSA of the central internal control system.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The statements in this section are \"non-management report disclosures\" that are not subject to the external auditor's review of the content of the management report. The reason for this is that these disclosures go beyond the legal obligations.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>*Outlook Report*\n\n# **Note on forecasts**\n\nThe business outlook assumes that the domestic and international economy and air traffic will not be impaired by external shocks such as terror attacks, wars, further pandemics, natural disasters, or substantial turbulence on the financial markets. They are based on the IFRS accounting standards to be applied in the EU at the beginning of the 2024 fiscal year (see also Group notes, note 4). Climate-related aspects are taken into account in the forecasted traffic developments to the extent that these can be predicted.\n\nThe \"Risk and opportunities report\" covers risks and opportunities that are not factored into the business outlook and that may result in significant negative or positive changes to the forecasted development.\n\n# **General statement by the Executive Board**\n\nDespite geopolitical uncertainties, the Executive Board expects an overall positive business development in 2024. The new Group strategy \"Fraport.2030\" lays the foundation for the Group to tackle the strategic challenges both today and in the future.\n\nFor Frankfurt Airport, following passenger numbers of around 59.4 million in the 2023 fiscal year, the Executive Board expects this to increase to between approximately 61 million and 65 million passengers in the 2024 fiscal year. Traffic development in Frankfurt is being driven in part by an increase in traffic to and from China, as well as further recovery in the business travel segment. The Executive Board also forecasts positive traffic development for the international Group airports in 2024.\n\nThe Executive Board assumes that the positive business development will have an increasing effect on the Group's revenue and earnings development in 2024, and expects **Group EBITDA** to increase to between approximately €1,260 million and €1,360 million. The **Group result** is expected to be between approximately €435 million and €530 million, with increasing depreciation and amortization and a deterioration in the financial result. The **ROFRA** is forecasted to be around or slightly above the 2023 level. Due to ongoing expansion measures, the **free cash flow** will again be negative in the mid three-digit million euro range in 2024 and will have an increasing effect on the net financial debt in 2024. Depending on the improvement in the operating result, the ratio of **net financial debt to EBITDA** is expected to be roughly at the level of 2023. Due to the range of the forecasted EBITDA and the free cash flow development, the figure may be slightly above or below that level. Despite extensive financing measures and the further utilization of project financing in Lima, the **Group liquidity** is forecasted to be below the level of 2023, mainly due to the negative free cash flow. However, the long-term target value of €1 billion will continue to be substantially exceeded.\n\nThe Executive Board continues to project a stable financial situation for the Fraport Group over the forecast period.\n\nAt the level of Fraport AG, the Executive Board expects **net income** of between approximately €300 million and €350 million in the 2024 fiscal year. Taking into account the expected negative free cash flow, the Executive Board forecasts a clear decline in the **liquidity** of Fraport AG. However, thanks to the extensive financing measures in place, liquidity will remain substantially above the target value of €1 billion.\n\nAccording to the opinion of the Executive Board, the development of an existential threat by the individual risks described in the \"Risk and Opportunity Report\" chapter or a combination of these seems to be highly unlikely, in view of projections for future developments in the Fraport Group. The forecasted figures do not envisage any acquisitions or disposals of companies, or increases or reductions in shareholdings.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Business outlook**\n\n#### **Forecasted situation of the Group for 2024**\n\n#### **Development of structure**\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2024, Fraport has converted the \"Human Resources\" central unit and the \"HR Top Executives\" unit into a new organization, which now comprises the two central units \"HR Operations\" and \"People & Culture.\" The reorganization does not have any impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nWhen preparing the Outlook Report, the Executive Board did not expect any changes to the Group structure that will have a substantial impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position.\n\n#### **Development of competitive position and future markets**\n\nFraport is continuously developing its business activities and Group sites as part of the strategic objective \"Growth in Frankfurt and internationally\", (see also the \"Strategy\" chapter). Among other things, the inauguration of the new terminal in Lima is planned for 2024, which will strengthen the competitive position of the site in the long term. Fraport continues its aim to market its airport expertise around the world and participate in the appeal of new markets. In this respect, Fraport selectively assesses whether to participate in international tenders.\n\n#### **Development of the strategy and control system**\n\nAt the end of January 2024, the Executive Board introduced the new Group strategy \"Fraport.2030,\" which replaces the previous Group strategy. This new strategy defines the three main priorities of the Group: \"growth and sustainability,\" \"efficiency and innovation,\" and \"employer of choice.\" Through optimal cooperation within the Group (\"working together\"), the Executive Board aims to achieve the overriding goal of \"inspiring customers\" and the financial targets of \"EBITDA of €2 billion\" and \"free cash flow of €1 billion\" by the 2030 fiscal year. The strategic priorities will be rolled out in the individual company units in the 2024 fiscal year, with twelve projects already defined and ready for implementation.\n\nIn this context and on the basis of the new materiality analysis, in accordance with the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the control system will be revised in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nThe strategic focus of finance management is not considered in this context.\n\n#### **Forecasted economic environment 2024**\n\n#### **Development of the macroeconomic conditions**\n\nThe global economic outlook for 2024 is subdued overall and subject to uncertainty. Inflation is expected to ease in many economies, which will in turn see interest rates fall, and is likely to boost investor confidence. The International Monetary Fund expects global growth of approximately 3.1% for the current year. World trade is expected to reach 3.3%.\n\nFor the US economy, the International Monetary Fund expects an increase of 2.1% for 2024. Growth rates in emerging markets are predicted to be higher than the values in industrialized countries, though projected trends within this group vary. Growth of 4.6% is forecasted for the Chinese economy. Overall expectations for the euro area stand at 0.9%. For the German economy, weak growth of 0.5% is expected for the current year in the best-case scenario.\n\nThe following GDP trends are expected in 2024 for countries with Group sites: USA 2.1%, Slovenia 2.2%, Brazil 1.7%, Peru 2.7%, Greece 2.0%, Bulgaria 3.2%, Turkey 3.1%.\n\nSource: IMF (October 2023, January 2024), OECD (December 2023), Deutsche Bank Research (December 2023), Deka Bank (December 2023), Ifo Institute for Economic Research (December 2023).\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Development of the legal environment**\n\nAt the time the consolidated annual financial statements were prepared, the Executive Board saw no changes in the legal environment in the 2024 fiscal year that could have substantial effects on the Fraport Group.\n\n#### **Development of the industry-specific conditions**\n\nBased on the expected development in general economic conditions and considering the financial situation of the airlines, the International Air Transport Association IATA anticipates global passenger growth of 9.8% in 2024 compared to the previous year, based on revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs). This would represent a recovery of around 85% compared to the base year 2019. At the regional level, IATA assumes the following year-on-year growth rates based on RPKs:\n\n#### **Forecasted Increase Revenue Passenger Kilometers 2024 versus 2019 by Region**\n\n| Changes compared to the previous year in % |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Worldwide                                  | +9.0  |\n| Europe                                     | +8.0  |\n| North America                              | +6.0  |\n| Asia-Pacific                               | +10.0 |\n| Latin America                              | +13.0 |\n| Middle East                                | +12.0 |\n| Africa                                     | +9.0  |\n\nThe Airports Council International (ACI) expects a full recovery of passenger traffic in Europe in 2024 with growth of 1% compared to pre-crisis levels. For Germany, the German Aviation Association (Bundesverband der Deutschen Luftverkehrswirtschaft) expects a seat capacity of 89% of the 2019 passenger level. This comparatively low recovery rate is due in part to higher site costs.\n\nSource: IATA Global Outlook for Air Transport (December 2023), ACI Industry Outlook for 2023–2024, BDL press release (February 2024).\n\n#### **Forecasted business development for 2024**\n\nTaking into account the industry-specific conditions, the Executive Board expects traffic development at the Group airports to be positive overall in 2024, but with substantial variation among the sites. **Frankfurt** Airport will benefit from further recovery in traffic. Following passenger numbers of around 59.4 million in fiscal year 2023, the Executive Board expects this to increase to between approximately 61 million and 65 million passengers in the 2024 fiscal year. Traffic development is being driven in part by an increase in traffic to and from China, as well as further recovery in the business travel segment.\n\nPositive traffic development is also expected at the **international Group airports**, as follows:\n\nA further passenger recovery compared to the previous year is expected at **Ljubljana** Airport and at the Brazilian Group airports in **Fortaleza** and **Porto Alegre**. However, the sites are expected to remain substantially below the pre-crisis level of the 2019 fiscal year. At **Lima** Airport, the traffic volume is approaching and may slightly exceed the 2019 level. At the 14 **Greek regional airports**, the passenger numbers are expected to be around or slightly above the high level of the previous year 2023. In **Varna** and **Burgas**, as well as in **Antalya**, some substantial traffic increases are forecasted compared to the previous year.\n\nChanges to the outlook could occur depending on geopolitical developments.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Forecasted results of operations for 2024**\n\nThe expected passenger development will lead to a rise in the Group revenue in fiscal year 2024. The traffic-related growth in revenue will be bolstered by increases in charges at the Frankfurt site and at the Group companies Fraport Brasil, Fraport Greece, and Fraport Twin Star. On the expense side, the Executive Board expects an increase in wage costs at the Frankfurt site in particular. In addition, the increase in traffic volume will lead to higher expenses at the Frankfurt site and a rise in concession charges at the Group companies Fraport Greece and Lima. The largely earnings-neutral management of aviation security controls at the Frankfurt site will also have the effect of increasing revenue and expenses. Exchange rate effects from the conversion of the functional currencies of Group companies in Lima, Fortaleza, and Porto Alegre as well as Fraport USA into the Group currency, the euro, may also have a positive or negative impact on the earnings contribution from Group companies.\n\nGiven the forecasted traffic ranges and the resulting uncertainty regarding income and expense developments, the Executive Board expects a **Group EBITDA** of between approximately €1,260 million and about €1,360 million. The **Group result** is expected to be between approximately €435 million and around €530 million, with increasing depreciation and amortization and a deterioration in the financial result, mainly due to higher interest expenses. The improvement in the result combined with an increase in assets will result in a **ROFRA** of around or slightly above the 2023 level of 6.6%.\n\nDespite the forecasted development of the result, the Executive Board does not intend to propose the distribution of any **dividends**  in the 2024 fiscal year on account of the capital expenditure-related negative free cash flow.\n\nAt the level of **Fraport AG**, the Executive Board expects **net income** of between approximately €300 million and approximately €350 million in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\n#### **Forecasted segment development for 2024**\n\nThe planned traffic developments will have a positive impact on the revenue of the four Fraport segments. The Executive Board expects that the EBITDA in the **Aviation** segment will continue to rise, but remain below €400 million. The Executive Board also expects the EBITDA in the **Retail & Real Estate** segment to improve, and forecasts a figure of around or slightly above €400 million. In the **Ground Handling** segment, the Executive Board expects the EBITDA to be approximately balanced in 2024. Despite higher variable concession charges, particularly at Fraport Greece, and the loss of the positive one-off effects of fiscal year 2023, such as the settlement of a legal dispute at Group company Fraport USA, the Executive Board expects a consistent or slightly positive EBITDA for the **International Activities & Services** segment compared to the previous year. In addition to the positive expected traffic development at Group airports, further positive one-off effects are expected to bolster profit development in 2024.\n\n### **Forecasted asset and financial position for 2024**\n\nDespite the traffic-related improvement in the operating result, the Executive Board expects **free cash flow** to remain negative in 2024 due to ongoing expansion activities at the Frankfurt and Lima sites and to be in the mid negative three-digit million euro range. The negative free cash flow will increase net financial debt in 2024. Cash inflows and outflows in connection with the international Group companies, exchange rate effects, and changes to net current assets will also affect the development of net financial debt. Depending on the improvement in the operating result, the ratio of **net financial debt to EBITDA** is expected to be roughly at the level of 2023. Due to the range of the forecasted EBITDA and the free cash flow development, the figure may be slightly above or below that level. Despite extensive financing measures and the further utilization of project financing in Lima, the **Group liquidity** is forecasted to be below the level of 2023, due in particular to the negative free cash flow. However, the long-term target value of €1 billion will continue to be substantially exceeded.\n\nAt the level of **Fraport AG**, the Executive Board likewise forecasts a clear decline in **liquidity** as a result of the expected negative free cash flow. However, thanks to the extensive financing measures in place, liquidity will remain substantially above the target value of €1 billion.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Medium-term outlook**\n\nOver the medium term, a positive development in the global economy and global passenger numbers is expected. A return to 2019 passenger levels in Frankfurt is expected until approximately 2026. Group airports will also benefit from forecasted mediumto long-term global market growth and show positive traffic development (see also the \"Strategy\" chapter).\n\nRising passenger numbers will have a positive impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group and will contribute to the further growth of Group EBITDA. The inauguration of the terminals in Frankfurt and Lima, on the other hand, will result in higher depreciation and amortization and a loss of the opportunity to capitalize interest expenses. Due to these effects and the expiration of the current Antalya concession at the end of 2026, the Executive Board expects a temporary reduction of earnings during the forecast period.\n\nAs a result of the inauguration of the terminals in Frankfurt and Lima and the associated gradual reduction of the capital expenditure program, the Executive Board expects there to be a substantial recovery in the free cash flow from 2025, with noticeably positive effects on the net financial debt from the 2026 fiscal year. In this context, the net financial debt will also start to decrease from the 2026 fiscal year at the latest. On account of the decline in net financial debt and the expected improvement in the Group EBITDA, the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDA is expected to improve further in the medium term.\n\nFuture capital expenditure obligations may be financed with debt instruments described above and cash flows from operations (see also the \"Finance Management\" and \"Asset and Financial Position\" chapters).\n\nFor the dividend payment, the Executive Board aims to resume a dividend policy in the forecast period. Before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, this was a pay-out ratio of between 40% and 60% of the profit share of the shareholders of Fraport AG as well as with a dividend that was at least stable compared to the previous year. The Executive Board plans to submit a dividend distribution proposal to the AGM again once the net financial debt to EBITDA ratio approaches the target value of 5.\n\nFrankfurt/Main, March 12, 2024\n\nFraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nDr. Stefan Schulte\n\ne Giesen\n\nlia Kranenberg\n\nDr. Pierre Dominique Prümm\n\nDr. Stefan Schulte Anke Giesen Julia Kranenberg Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm Prof Dr. Matthias Zieschang\n\nWhere the statements made in this document relate to the future rather than the past, they are based on a number of assumptions about future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide and which could have the effect that the actual results will differ materially from these statements.

Six of the twelve vehicles of the new Sky Line train have already been delivered. In addition to ample space for luggage, specially designed handrails provide more freedom of movement. Successful test runs have already been carried out.\n\nNew standards are also being set in terms of \"green financing\": Part of the financing for the Sky Line train is being provided in connection with the classification of the EU taxonomy. This makes it the first \"green financing\" of Fraport AG.\n\n# *Consolidated Financials Statements for the 2023 Fiscal Year*\n\n- *138* [Consolidated Income Statement](#page-137-0)\n- *139*

view of a construction site. In the foreground, there is a large, multi-story building under construction, with its steel and concrete framework exposed. The building is surrounded by dirt and construction materials. In the background, there are other buildings, some of which are also under construction. There are also vehicles and equipment scattered throughout the site. The overall impression is one of a busy and active construction zone.\n\n# *Lima expansion project*\n\nIn order to do justice to the importance of Lima Airport as an international hub airport in the future as well, extensive infrastructure and expansion measures are taking place. Numerous airside construction projects, such as a new tower, have already been completed. In April 2023 the second runway was also inaugurated with the first commercial flight on it.\n\nThe first construction phase with a capacity of 30 million passengers is scheduled to be put into operation at the end of 2024. The new terminal is scheduled to serve up to 40 million passengers a year when it becomes fully operational in 2025.\n\nThe new terminal will make an important contribution to the strategic development of Lima Airport.\n\n# *Group Notes for the 2023 Fiscal Year*\n\n- *146* [Consolidated Statement of Changes in](#page-145-0)  Non-current Assets\n- *148* [Segment Reporting](#page-147-0)\n-

Consolidation and Accounting Policies*\n\n# **1 Basis for the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nFraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt/Main (hereinafter: Fraport AG), is a global airport operator and its main business focus is the operation of Frankfurt Main airport, one of Europe's most important air transport hubs. Fraport AG is headquartered at Frankfurt Airport, Germany. Fraport AG is registered in the Frankfurt am Main District Court, Department B, under number 7042.\n\nFraport AG has prepared its consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023 in accordance with the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nWe have applied the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the consolidated financial statements and the interpretations about them issued by the International Financial Reporting Committee (IFRS, IC) as adopted in the European Union (EU), in force on the balance sheet date, completely and without any restriction in accounting, measurement, and disclosure in the 2023 consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), these notes to the financial statements contain the supplementary disclosures according to Sections 313, 314 HGB.\n\nAs a capital market-oriented parent company of the Fraport Group, Fraport AG must prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council dated July 19, 2002 (new version dated April 9, 2008) on the application of international accounting standards.\n\nThe consolidated income statement is prepared according to the nature of expenditure method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros (€).

Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.\n\nCompanies controlled by Fraport AG are considered to be subsidiaries. A company is controlled by Fraport AG if Fraport AG holds decision-making power on the basis of voting or other rights allowing it to determine the significant activities of the affiliated company, participates in positive or negative variable returns from the affiliated company, and is able to affect these returns through its decision-making power.\n\nInclusion in the consolidated financial statements commences on the date when control is obtained.\n\nA joint arrangement applies if the Fraport Group makes joint decisions on operations on the basis of a contractual agreement with third parties. Joint management is exercised if decisions on significant activities require the unanimous agreement of all parties. A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture.\n\nFor all joint arrangements in the Fraport Group, the partners have a share in the net assets of a jointly managed, legally independent company; these are therefore joint ventures.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nAssociated companies are Fraport investments in which Fraport AG is able to exercise major influence on financial and business policies.\n\nThe annual financial statements of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of shared accounting and valuation principles.\n\nThe fiscal year of Fraport AG and all consolidated companies is the calendar year.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Fraport AG are dominated by the parent company.

consolidated in the Fraport consolidated financial statements. The capital shares in the subsidiaries directly held by Fraport AG as a parent company do not differ from the proportion of voting rights held. There are no preferred shares in the subsidiaries.\n\n# **3 Consolidation Principles**\n\nCapital consolidation of all business combinations follows the purchase method.\n\nAll identifiable acquired assets and the acquired liabilities, including contingent liabilities, are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The acquisition costs for company acquisitions correspond to the fair value of the transferred assets and liabilities. Incidental acquisition costs are recorded as expenses as they are incurred. Conditional purchase price payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of a conditional consideration, which is deemed to be an asset or a liability, will be recognized either through profit or loss or as a change in other income. Non-controlling interests are valued at fair value or the corresponding proportion of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company. In the case of step-bystep company acquisitions, the shares already held in the acquired company are revalued through profit or loss at fair value on the date that control is obtained.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is recorded insofar as the sum of the consideration that is transferred, the amount of all non-controlling interests in the acquired company and any equity that was previously held and revalued on the acquisition date is higher than the balance of the acquired and revalued identifiable assets and the revalued acquired liabilities. If the comparison results in a lower amount, a net income on acquisition at a price below the fair value is recorded after the assigned values are reviewed.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. Initial measurements of companies accounted for using the equity method are carried out at fair value at the time of acquisition, similarly to capital consolidation for subsidiaries. Subsequent changes in the shareholders' equity and the updating of the difference from initial valuation change the amount accounted for at equity.\n\nLoans, accounts receivable, and liabilities, contingencies and other contingent liabilities between companies included in the consolidated financial statements, internal expenses, and income, as well as income from Group investments are eliminated.\n\n#### **Currency translation**\n\nAnnual financial statements of companies outside Germany denominated in foreign currencies are translated on the basis of the functional currency concept in accordance with IAS 21. The assets and liabilities of the consolidated companies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and shareholders' equity at the historical exchange rate, whereas, for the purpose of simplification, the expenses and income are translated at average exchange rates, since the companies are financially, economically, and organizationally independent. Foreign currency translation differences are included directly in equity without affecting profit or loss.\n\nThe following material exchange rates were used for the currency translation:\n\n#### **Exchange rates**\n\n| Unit/Currency in €         | Exchange rate<br>December 31, 2023 | Average exchange rate<br>2023 | Exchange rate<br>December 31, 2022 | Average exchange rate<br>2023 |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1 US Dollar (US-\\$)        | 0.9028                             | 0.9248                        | 0.9367                             | 0.9496                        |\n| 1 Turkish New Lira (TRY)   | 0.0305                             | 0.3882                        | 0.0500                             | 0.0574                        |\n| 1 Renminbi Yuan (CNY)      | 0.1268                             | 0.1305                        | 0.1355                             | 0.1413                        |\n| 1 Hong Kong Dollar (HKD)   | 0.1156                             | 0.1181                        | 0.1202                             | 0.1213                        |\n| 1 Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN) | 0.2445                             | 0.2472                        | 0.2473                             | 0.2476                        |\n| 100 Russian Rubles (RUB)   | 1.0003                             | 1.0808                        | 1.3063                             | 1.3469                        |\n| 1 Brazilian Real (BRL)     | 0.1861                             | 0.1852                        | 0.1771                             | 0.1838                        |\n\nBusiness transactions in foreign currencies are accounted at the exchange rate on the date of the business transaction. Measurement of the resulting assets and liabilities that are nominally bound in the foreign currency as at the balance sheet date takes place at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are generally recorded through profit or loss.\n\n# **4 Accounting Principles**\n\n#### **Uniform accounting measurement policies**\n\nThe financial statements of the Fraport Group are based on accounting and measurement policies that are applied consistently throughout the Group.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are drafted on the basis of historic acquisition and production costs. Particular exceptions include financial assets available for sale and derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe following overview contains a summary of the valuation methods for items in the statement of financial position.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Measurement policies by financial position item**\n\n| Financial position item                                | Measurement policy                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assets                                                 |                                                                  |\n| Goodwill                                               | Accumulated impairment (IAS 36)                                  |\n| Investments in airport operating projects              | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Property, plant, and equipment                         | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Investment property                                    | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Other financial assets                                 | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Trade accounts receivable                              | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Other financial receivables and assets                 | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Other non-financial receivables and assets             | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Inventories                                            | Lower of acquisition or production cost and net realizable value |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                              | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Derivative financial instruments                       | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Liabilities                                            |                                                                  |\n| Financial liabilities                                  | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Trade accounts payable                                 | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Other financial liabilities                            | According to IFRS 9 and IFRS 16                                  |\n| Other non-financial liabilities                        | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Provisions for pensions and similar obligations        | Projected unit credit method                                     |\n| Other provisions                                       | Present value or amount required to settle the obligation        |\n| Derivative financial instruments                       | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n\n#### **Recognition of income and expenses**\n\nAccording to IFRS 15, revenue from contracts with customers must be recognized in the amount for which the company has fulfilled its performance obligation and the customer has received the authority to dispose of the agreed goods and services. The timing and amount of the revenue to be recognized is determined according to the following five-step process:\n\n- Identification of the contract/s with a customer,\n- Identification of the independent performance obligations,\n- Determination of the transaction price,\n- Distribution of the transaction price to the individual performance obligations,\n- Revenue recognition upon fulfillment of the performance obligations.\n\nIncome and expenses from the same transactions and/or events are recognized in the same period.\n\nIn the Fraport Group, revenue is divided into the following types:\n\nThe Aviation segment includes, in particular, revenue from airport charges, which are based on a regulation approved by HMWEVW (Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing) (see note 49), as well as from security services at the Frankfurt site. With the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges were also recognized for the first time under security services. The airport charges are for the takeoffs, landings (including noise and emission), and parking of aircraft as well as for the use of passenger facilities. Security services refer to services for passenger, baggage, and cargo inspections on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI). The performance obligations in the Aviation segment are usually fulfilled within one day and recognized accordingly.\n\nIn the Retail & Real Estate segment, revenue is divided into the areas of real estate, retail, and parking. Real estate revenue relates to leasing of buildings at Frankfurt Airport. In addition, Fraport AG offers various services in the area of real estate management for third parties. These range from the development and marketing of real estate management to energy management.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue in the retail sector is divided into the categories of shopping, advertising, and services and primarily results from revenue from the rental of retail and service areas as well as the marketing of advertising space.\n\nThe area of parking includes, in particular, revenue from the leasing of parking spaces at various parking facilities. As a general rule, revenue from leasing and all other services is recognized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or for a fixed term. In contrast, for disposals of real estate inventories, revenue is recognized at the time of transfer of control to the buyer.\n\nIn the Ground Handling segment, revenue is divided into the areas of ground services and charges for infrastructure. The apron services are responsible for carrying out loading and transport services. This includes, among other things, the transportation of passengers, baggage, and cargo as well as the loading and unloading of aircraft. In addition, the handling of freight includes, among other things, the landside processing of air freight and mail as well as freight documentation. The infrastructure charges include, in particular, charges for providing the central infrastructure, such as the central baggage transfer system, at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe performance obligations in the Ground Handling segment are usually fulfilled within one day and recognized accordingly.\n\nThe International Activities & Services segment includes the operation, maintenance, development, and expansion of airports and infrastructure facilities in Germany and abroad. These services also encompass consulting services and customized solutions to the challenges of airport management (so-called ORAT services – operational readiness and airport transfer). The services of the foreign investments essentially correspond to those described for the Aviation, Retail & Real Estate, and Ground Handling segments. In addition, revenue in the segment includes contract revenue from construction and expansion services related to airport operating projects abroad which are being carried out in line with the respective progress in each construction project. The accounting treatment follows IFRIC 12.\n\nIn general, the payment terms are set depending on the type of revenue. The payment terms are typically between 0 and 40 days.\n\nInterest income is recorded using the effective interest rate method.\n\n#### **Goodwill**\n\nAfter the initial recognition of goodwill acquired in the course of a business merger, it is measured at acquisition costs less any cumulative impairment losses.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in the course of a business merger is assigned to the cash-generating units of the Group since the acquisition date. Goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The recoverable amount corresponds to the higher amount of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Essentially, in the Fraport Group the value in use based on a company valuation model (discounted cash flow method) is used to calculate the recoverable amount. All goodwill items are tested for impairment at least once a year in December in accordance with IAS 36.88 – 99. In the event of an impairment, an impairment loss is recognized. Goodwill is not written up when the reasons for impairment are eliminated. Goodwill is not subject to regular depreciation and amortization.\n\n#### **Investments in airport operating projects**\n\nTo allow for better transparency, investments in airport operating projects are presented separately. These consist of concessions for the operation of airports in Greece, Varna and Burgas (Bulgaria), Lima (Peru), and Fortaleza and Porto Alegre (Brazil) acquired within the scope of service concession agreements (see also note 49). The concession agreements for the operation of the airports fall under the application of IFRIC 12.17 and are recognized according to the intangible asset model, since Fraport receives the right in each case to impose a charge on airport users in exchange for the obligation to pay concession fees and provide construction and expansion services. The contractual obligations to pay concession fees that are not variable, but contractually fixed in amount, are recorded as financial liabilities. These liabilities are initially recognized at fair value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Airport operation rights received as consideration are recorded as intangible assets at the same amount and reported under investments in airport operating projects. The rights received as consideration for construction and expansion services are recognized at the cost of production for the period in which the production costs are incurred. Revenue and expenses from construction and expansion services are generally recorded pursuant to IFRIC 12.14 and in accordance with IFRS 15. Borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the costs of acquisition if the requirements (see \"Borrowing costs\") are fulfilled. Costs for ongoing, scheduled maintenance measures in connection with maintaining the operational readiness of the operated infrastructure are recognized as\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\ncurrent expenses for the period. Provisions for corresponding maintenance measures are recognized if the concession agreements contain maintenance obligations that are specified in terms of amount.\n\nThe recognized financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Subsequent measurement of the capitalized rights is at the cost of acquisition or production less cumulative regular depreciation and amortization over the term of the concessions.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in accordance with IAS 36, where necessary.\n\n#### **Other intangible assets**\n\nAcquired intangible assets (IAS 38) are recognized at acquisition cost. Their useful life is limited. They are amortized over their useful lives using straight-line depreciation and amortization. Where necessary, impairment losses are recognized in accordance with IAS 36. If the recoverable amount of the asset later exceeds the carrying amount after an impairment loss has been recognized, the asset is written up to a maximum of the recoverable amount. The write-up through profit or loss is limited to the amortized carrying amount that would have resulted if no impairment losses had been recognized in the past.\n\nDevelopment costs for internally generated intangible assets are capitalized at manufacturing cost when it is probable that the manufacture of these assets will generate future economic benefits for the company and the costs can be measured reliably. The manufacturing costs cover all costs directly attributable to the manufacturing process. If the conditions for capitalization are not met, the expenses are recognized in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. Internally generated intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives using the straight-line method.\n\nBorrowing costs of other intangible assets that constitute qualifying assets are recognized (see \"Borrowing costs\").\n\n#### **Property, plant, and equipment**\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment (IAS 16) are recognized at the cost of acquisition or production less straight-line depreciation and amortization and any impairment losses pursuant to IAS 36, where applicable. If the recoverable amount of the asset later exceeds the carrying amount after an impairment loss has been recognized pursuant to IAS 36, the asset is written up to a maximum of the recoverable amount. The write-up through profit or loss is limited to the amortized carrying amount that would have resulted if no impairment loss had been recognized in the past. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Production costs essentially include all direct costs including appropriate overheads. Borrowing costs of property, plant, and equipment that constitute qualifying assets are recognized (see \"Borrowing costs\").\n\nEach part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with an acquisition cost that is significant in relation to the total value of the item is measured and depreciated separately with regard to its useful life and the appropriate depreciation method.\n\nGovernment grants and third-party grants related to assets are included in liabilities and are released straight-line over the useful life of the asset for which the grant has been given. Grants related to income are included as other operating income through profit or loss (IAS 20).\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Investment property**\n\nInvestment property (IAS 40) includes property held to earn long-term lease revenue or capital appreciation, which is not owneroccupied; it also consists of land held for a currently undetermined future use.\n\nIf land as yet held for an undetermined use is now defined as being held for sale and development has begun, it is transferred to inventories; if it is intended for own use, it is transferred to property, plant, and equipment.\n\nInvestment property is measured initially at the cost of acquisition or production. Subsequent measurement is at the cost of acquisition or production less regular straight-line depreciation and amortization and impairment losses according to IAS 36 where applicable. Borrowing costs of investment properties that constitute qualifying assets are capitalized (see \"Borrowing costs\").\n\n#### **Borrowing costs**\n\nBorrowing costs (IAS 23) that relate to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset are required to be capitalized as part of the acquisition/production cost of such assets. At Fraport AG, the planned investment measures form the basis for determining the qualifying assets. If the volume of the planned measures at Fraport AG exceeds €25 million and if the construction period is more than one year, all assets produced as part of the measure are recognized as qualifying assets. Each Group company defines its own individual criteria for what constitutes the presence of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs include interest, ancillary costs associated with debt capital and currency differences.\n\n#### **Regular depreciation and amortization**\n\nRegular depreciation and amortization is carried out on the basis of estimated useful technical and economic life. It takes place fundamentally on a Group-wide basis according to the straight-line method. The data on expected useful life also includes the useful lifespans of individual components.\n\nThe following useful lifespans are taken as a basis:\n\n#### **Regular depreciation and amortization**\n\n| In years                                         |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n|                                                  |         |\n| Investments in airport operating projects        | 25 – 50 |\n| Other concession and operator rights             | 34 – 39 |\n| Software and other intangible assets             | 1 – 30  |\n| Buildings (structural sections)                  | 5 – 80  |\n| Technical buildings                              | 20 – 40 |\n| Building equipment                               | 12 – 38 |\n| Ground equipment                                 | 5 – 99  |\n| Flight operating areas                           |         |\n| Takeoff/landing runways                          | 7 – 99  |\n| Aprons                                           | 20 – 99 |\n| Taxiway bridges                                  | 80      |\n| Taxiways                                         | 20 – 99 |\n| Other technical equipment and machinery          | 3 – 33  |\n| Vehicles (including special vehicles)            | 1 – 20  |\n| Other equipment, operating, and office equipment | 1 – 25  |\n\nThe expected useful life of investment property corresponds to the expected useful life of the property, which is part of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Impairment losses pursuant to IAS 36**\n\nImpairment losses on assets are recognized pursuant to IAS 36. Assets are tested for impairment if there are indications of an impairment loss. An impairment test is carried out annually for existing goodwill. Impairment losses are recorded if the recoverable amount of the asset has fallen below its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash inflows and outflows from the use and subsequent disposal of the asset.\n\nSince it is not generally possible in the Fraport Group to allocate cash flows to individual assets, cash-generating units are formed and the existing goodwill is allocated to them. A cash-generating unit is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates separate cash inflows and outflows.\n\nRegardless of indicators for possible impairment losses, assets are subject to an annual impairment test pursuant to IAS 36.\n\nGenerally, the value in use is calculated as the recoverable amount. The value in use is determined by the entity through application of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nDetermination of the future cash flows of the cash-generating units is based on the planning figures. The value in use is generally determined based on the future cash flows estimated on the basis of the current planning figures for the years between 2024 to 2028 as approved by the Executive Board and in effect at the time the impairment tests are made (in December of the year under review), and on the basis of the current long-term plans up to 2035 or over the respective contractual periods in the case of investments in airport operating projects and other concession and operator rights. These forecasts are based on past experience and the expected market performance, which is based on external studies and internal forecasts. A growth rate of 1.2% (previous year: 1.2%) based on the planning assumptions is taken into account in the perpetual annuity. The adequacy of the growth rate is checked using external forecasts on future traffic developments. The discount factor was a country-specific, weighted average cost of capital (WACC) before taxes of between 9.0% and 15.2% (previous year: 8.3% to 20.4%).\n\nThe forecasts presented in the \"Business Outlook\" chapter of the management report are in line with the base scenario of the planning and included in the impairment test calculations. The underlying planning also takes into account the costs of reducing carbon emissions as outlined in the \"decarbonization master plan\" in the \"Climate protection\" chapter and the costs of implementing the further climate protection measures presented. The passenger forecasts used in the planning take into account potential effects of the climate policy. Therefore, due to the consequently increased expected CO2 price, higher ticket prices of 10% until 2035 and a resulting reduction in demand of 5% is assumed.\n\nThe overall economic development continues to be characterized by the geopolitical crises the economic consequences of which, in particular the current inflation trend, are resulting in greater planning uncertainty. In order to account for these planning uncertainties, sensitivity analyses were carried out for all cash-generating units. As a general rule, the impairment of all units was assessed at a WACC higher by 0.5 percentage points and with a reduction in the revenue by 0.5 percentage points over the entire planning period. For the Slovenia cash-generating units, the increase in WACC results in an impairment requirement in the low millions range. The impairment of the cash-generating units within the framework of the revenue scenarios can be further confirmed.\n\nAdditional sensitivity analyses were also carried out for the cash-generating unit airport operations of Fraport AG. Scenarios for the underlying cash flows were developed by adjusting the planned increases in charges and the forecast traffic figures. One of the sensitivity analyses highlights the effects of a more drastic climate policy, which could lead to an increase of up to 16% in ticket prices. This scenario takes into account a reduction in passenger demand of up to 8% compared to the base scenario due to the higher prices.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe individual cash flow scenarios were then discounted with different capital cost rates after taxes ranging from 5.6% to 6.6%. The results of the sensitivity analysis allow the conclusion that there is no structural overestimation of the infrastructure. The scenarios show a range of the company value, ranging from overfunding in the low single-digit billions to underfunding in the low single-digit billions in the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario describes the scenario of a more drastic climate policy with a decline in passengers of up to 8% compared to the current forecast at unchanged planned fee increases. An adjustment in the fee increase in accordance with the German Air Traffic Law (LuftVG), in turn results in there no longer being an impairment requirement.\n\nAnother significant influence on the company's value is the value added of the perpetual pension. Therefore, the impairment in the base scenario was verified to ensure it applies even with a reduced growth rate of the perpetual annuity of 0.5%. The adjustment in the growth rate does not result in an impairment requirement.\n\n#### **Leases**\n\nThe Fraport Group has recognized right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases in which the Fraport Group is the lessee in the amount of the present value of the payment obligations entered into. Right-of-use assets are recognized if the leasing contract entitles the user to control the use of an identified asset against payment of a fee for a certain period of time. The right-of-use assets are shown under property, plant and equipment. The lease liabilities are shown under other liabilities. Lease liabilities include fixed lease payments less lease incentives to be provided by the lessor, variable payments that are linked to an index or interest rate, expected residual value payments from residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the exercise was deemed to be reasonably certain, and contractual penalties for those termination of the lease if it is considered in the term that a termination option will be used. Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate that the lease is implicitly based on, if the lessor provided that interest rate. Otherwise, discounting is carried out using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. This is derived from country-specific, risk-free debt financing interest rates with matching currencies and maturities. The right-ofuse assets are measured at acquisition costs, which consist of the present value of the lease liability and initial direct costs as well as dismantling obligations and leasing payments received before or upon provision, less leasing incentives received. The subsequent measurement is carried out at amortized cost. Right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. If leasing agreements contain extension or termination options, all facts and circumstances are taken into account for the determination of the contract term that offer an economic incentive to exercise extension options or not to exercise such options. The term will only be adjusted if the exercise or non-exercise of such options is reasonably certain.\n\nTaking into account the principle of materiality (IAS 1 in conjunction with IFRS 16.BC86), right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are accounted for exclusively for substantial real estate leasing contracts. Payments from leasing contracts, operating and office equipment, technical systems and machines, and properties with a contractual volume of less than €0.1 million are recorded as expenses in the same way as previous operating lease contracts. Furthermore, the regulations of IFRS 16 are not applied to intangible assets. The future minimum lease payments arising from the existing lease contracts for operating and office equipment and technical systems and machines are specified in note 46.\n\nIf an entity of the Fraport Group acts as a lessor and the contract will be classified as an operating lease, the leased property is shown in property, plant and equipment at amortized cost. Rental income is generally recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nIf an entity of the Fraport Group acts as a lessor and the contract will be classified as finance lease, Fraport recognizes the receivable in the amount of the net investment of the lease.\n\n#### **Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method**\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associated companies are recognized at the pro rata share of equity, including goodwill. Impairment losses are recorded if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. The investments are tested for impairment annually.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Other financial assets**\n\nOther financial assets include securities, loans and other investments. Other financial assets are recognized at fair value on the settlement date, i.e. at the time the asset is created or transferred, plus transaction costs. Other financial assets with a remaining term of up to one year are reported as current. The recognition and subsequent valuation is based on the cash flow characteristics and of the business models according to which they are managed.\n\nA classification at amortized acquisition costs occurs when both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and\n- The contractual terms and conditions lead to cash flows that only represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe loans are valued at amortized acquisition costs using the effective interest method.\n\nThe valuation as fair value other comprehensive income with recycling (FVOCI with recycling) is applied if the following conditions are met:\n\n- The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to achieved by both holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and\n- The contractual terms and conditions lead to cash flows that only represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nFVOCI with Recycling applied to securities. Changes in value are recognized in other comprehensive income; interest income, remeasurements of currency translation gains and losses and impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss; if there is a premature sale, gains or losses are recycled from equity to profit or loss.\n\nFor other investments, the FVOCI option is exercised for strategic reasons. The fair value changes are recorded under other result. The profit and loss recorded in other result are not recycled with an effect on the income statement and no impairment losses are recognized in the income statement (FVOCI without recycling).\n\nWhen deciding whether a contractual amendment leads to a disposal of a financial asset, quantitative and qualitative criteria are taken into account.\n\n#### **Trade accounts receivable, other financial and non-financial receivables and assets**\n\nTrade accounts receivable and other financial and non-financial receivables and assets are recognized on the settlement date, i.e., at the time the asset is created or economic ownership is transferred, at fair value plus transaction costs.\n\nTrade accounts receivable, other financial and non-financial receivables and assets, and receivables from banks with a remaining term of less than one year are reported as current.\n\nTrade accounts receivable, accounts receivable from banks, and all other financial receivables with fixed or ascertainable payments are held to \"collect cash flows\" and have \"cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest\". Subsequent measurement is carried out at amortized cost of acquisition, based on the effective interest method. Receivables in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **Assistance received from government**\n\nIn principle, public contributions (IAS 20) are only recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them are met and that the contributions are granted.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nContributions related to income are deducted from these expenses in the period in which the corresponding expenses are incurred. Entitlements to contributions for which sufficient security is in place are reported under other non-financial assets.\n\nThe contributions received in connection with short-time work schedules were recognized in personnel expenses as a reduction in expenses, and the existing entitlements were reported under other non-financial assets.\n\n#### **Impairment losses of financial assets**\n\nIn general, impairment losses are recognized through profit or loss by directly reducing the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nThe impairment provisions are applied to the following assets:\n\n- financial assets in the form of debt instruments that are measured at amortized costs, such as trade accounts receivables, loans to associated companies and bank balances and deposits\n- financial assets in the form of debt instruments that are measured at fair value without affecting profit or loss\n\nOn each balance sheet date, the carrying amounts of the aforementioned financial assets that are measured at amortized costs or at the fair value without affecting profit or loss are assessed to see whether there is any objective evidence (such as considerable financial difficulties of the debtor, high probability of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, or a permanent decline of the fair value below amortized cost) that the asset may be impaired. The assessment takes place by considering forward-looking, macro-economic information on whether the credit risk has significantly increased (or decreased). The assessment of whether there is a significant increase or decrease in credit risk is relevant for whether loan defaults must be calculated over the next 12 months or over the entire term. The assessment is carried out on the basis of the change in credit risk during the expected term of the financial instrument.\n\nFor trade accounts receivable, a risk provision is recorded on a collective basis in the amount of the expected payment defaults over the entire term of the receivables. The determination of the expected payment defaults are based on historical information on payment defaults and qualitative insights into possible future defaults.\n\nThe available probability of default of the respective counterparty, taking into account insolvency rates, taken from external sources, are used to calculate the expected credit loss for financial assets in the general approach and for securities.\n\nA risk provision is calculated taking into account the general materiality guidelines according to IAS 1. Changes are recognized in the amount of the required risk provisions as a write-up or impairment.\n\nIf an already impaired receivable is individually designated as non-recoverable, the asset is derecognized.\n\n#### **Inventories**\n\nInventories include work-in-process, raw materials, consumables, supplies, and property held for sale within the ordinary course of business.\n\nWork-in-process, raw materials, consumables, and supplies are measured at the lower of acquisition or production cost or net realizable value. Acquisition or production costs are generally calculated using the average cost method. Production costs include direct costs and adequate overheads.\n\nProperty held for sale within the ordinary course of business is also measured at the lower of acquisition or production cost or net realizable value.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe subsequent production cost required for land development is estimated for the entire marketable land area on the basis of specific cost unit rates for individual development measures. Depending on the land sales recognized in the respective year under review, the development costs are allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining land area to be sold. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less the costs incurred until the time of sale, and discounted over the planned selling period.\n\nExternal reports on the fair value of the land being sold, as well as information about previous land sales, form the basis for the calculation of the estimated selling price.\n\nWhere the inventories constitute qualifying assets, the borrowing costs are capitalized.\n\nIf a write-down made in previous periods is no longer necessary, a write-up is recognized.\n\n#### **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents basically include cash, cash accounts, and short-term cash deposits (including restricted cash) with banks maturing in three months or less. Cash deposits with banks with a maturity of more than three months from the time of acquisition are recorded in this item if their values do not fluctuate significantly and they can be liquidated at short notice without deduction for risk. Cash and cash equivalents are recognized at amortized costs. Cash in foreign currencies is translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **Non-current assets held for sale**\n\nNon-current assets held for sale are recognized at either the carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is the lower amount.\n\n#### **Accounting of taxes on income**\n\nTaxes on income are recognized using the liability method pursuant to IAS 12. All tax expenses and refunds directly related to income are recorded as taxes on income. These also include withholding taxes and penalties. Interest accrued based on subsequently assessed taxes are recorded as an interest expense.\n\nCurrent taxes are recognized on the date when the liability for taxes on income is incurred.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized pursuant to IAS 12 using the liability method based on temporary differences on a case by case basis. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the IFRS and tax financial positions of the single entities, and differences arising from unused, utilizable loss and interest carry-forwards and consolidation transactions. The recognition of goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes does not lead to deferred taxes.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset in the IFRS financial position exceeds its tax base (e.g. non-current assets depreciated on a straight-line basis), and if the difference is temporary, a deferred tax liability is recognized. Pursuant to the IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognized from financial position differences and for carry-forwards of unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available, against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated at future tax rates insofar as these have already been legally established and/or the legislative process is largely completed. Changes in deferred taxes on the financial position generally lead to deferred tax income or expense. When transactions resulting in a change to deferred taxes are recorded directly in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss, the change to deferred taxes is also included directly in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted insofar as these income tax claims and liabilities relate to the same tax authority and to the same taxable entity or a group of different taxable entities that, however, are assessed jointly for income tax purposes.\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries if Fraport can control the timing of the reversal and it is not expected that these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n#### **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**\n\nThe provisions for pensions relate to defined benefit plans and have been calculated in accordance with IAS 19 under the application of actuarial methods and an interest rate of 3.16% (previous year: 3.69%). For the calculation of the interest expense from the defined benefit plans and the income from plan assets, the same interest rate is used as a basis.\n\nRe-measurements resulting from the change in the interest rate or from the difference between actual and computed income from plan assets, for example, are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) as non-reclassifiable.\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The calculation takes place by discounting the future estimated cash outflows with the interest rate from industry bonds of the highest creditworthiness. The industry bonds are denominated in the currency of the distribution amounts and show the relevant maturities of the pension obligations. If benefit claims from the defined benefit plans are covered by plan assets in the form of reinsurance, the fair value of the plan assets is netted with the DBO. Benefit claims that are not covered by plan assets are recognized as pension provisions.\n\nAs in the previous year, the calculations did not include salary increases for the active members of the Executive Board. For former members of the Executive Board retirement pensions are valued in accordance with the Act on Adjustments to Compensation and Retirement in Hesse as amended. The calculation of provisions for pensions was based on the 2018G mortality tables by Professor Heubeck.\n\nThe service cost and net interest are recognized in personnel expenses.\n\nWith regard to the description of the various plans, see note 38.\n\n#### **Provisions for taxes**\n\nProvisions for current taxes are recognized for tax expected to be payable in the year under review and/or previous years taking into account anticipated risks.\n\n#### **Other provisions**\n\nProvisions represent liabilities that are uncertain with regard to amount and/or maturity. Other provisions are recognized in the amount required to settle the obligations. The amount recognized represents the most probable value.\n\nProvisions are recognized to the extent that there is a current commitment to third parties. In addition, they must be the result of a past event, lead to a future cash outflow, and more likely than not be needed to settle the obligation (IAS 37).\n\nRefund claims toward third parties are capitalized separately from the provisions as \"other receivables\", provided that their realization is virtually certain.\n\nNon-current provisions with remaining terms of more than one year are discounted at a capital market interest rate with a matching maturity, taking future cost increases into account, provided that the interest effect is material. This applies, among other things, to the provisions for wake turbulence, which are discounted over a period until 2031 and according to the expected cash outflow date of matching interest rates up to 3.15% (previous year: 2.99%).\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe provision for partial retirement is recognized pursuant to IAS 19. The recognition of the liability from step-ups starts at the time when Fraport can legally and factually no longer withdraw from the liability. The step-up amounts are added to the liability in installments until the end of the active phase on a pro rata basis. The utilization begins with the passive phase.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nContingent liabilities are possible liabilities that are based on past events, and the existence of which is only confirmed by the occurrence of one or more indeterminate future events that are nonetheless beyond Fraport's control. Furthermore, current obligations may constitute contingent liabilities if the probability of the outflow of resources is not sufficient for a liability to be recognized, or if the extent of the liability cannot be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities are not recorded in the financial position, but rather shown in the notes.\n\n#### **Liabilities**\n\nFinancial liabilities, trade accounts payable, and other financial and non-financial liabilities are recorded at their fair value less possible transaction costs upon initial recognition. For current liabilities, this corresponds generally to the nominal value. Noncurrent low-interest or non-interest-bearing liabilities are carried at their present value at the time of addition less possible transaction costs. Liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nSubsequent measurement of financial liabilities is based on the effective interest method at amortized acquisition cost. Each difference between the refund amount and the repayment amount is recorded in the income statement over the term of the contract in question using the effective interest method.\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments, hedging transactions**\n\nThe Fraport Group basically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge existing and future interest and exchange rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. Positive market values are recognized as other financial assets; negative market values as other financial liabilities. Effective changes of value on cash flow hedges are recorded in shareholders' equity in the reserve for financial instruments without affecting profit or loss. Corresponding to this, deferred taxes on the fair values of cash flow hedges are also recorded in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss. The effectiveness of the cash flow hedges is assessed on a regular basis. Ineffective cash flow hedges are recorded in the income statement through profit or loss under other financial result.\n\nIf the criteria for a cash flow hedge are not no longer met, the hedge accounting is released. In this case, the changes in the fair value and the related deferred taxes are recognized in the income statement (FVTPL). The fair value changes are recorded under \"financial result on other items\".\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at the trading date.\n\n#### **Treasury shares**\n\nRepurchased treasury shares are deducted from the issued capital and the capital reserve.\n\n#### **Virtual stock options**\n\nVirtual stock options (\"Long-Term Incentive Program\") have been issued since January 1, 2010 as part of the remuneration for the Executive Board and Senior Managers. As of January 1, 2020, virtual performance shares (\"Performance Share Plan\") have been allocated to the Executive Board and senior employees. They are paid out in cash immediately at the end of the performance period of four years. The measurement of virtual shares respectively performance shares is at fair value pursuant to IFRS 2. Up to the end of the performance period, the fair value is re-determined on each reporting date and on the date of performance and is recorded in personnel expenses on a pro rata basis.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n*166*\n\nTo Our Shareholders\n\nbined Management Report\n\nTo Our Shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financials Statements *Group Notes* Further Information [Fraport Annual Report 2](#page-5-0)023 [Group Notes / Note](#page-136-0)s t[o the Consolidation a](#page-144-0)n[d Accounting Policies](#page-236-0) 153\n\nents **Group No**\n\nFurther Information\n\n### **Judgment and uncertainty of estimates**\n\nThe presentation of the asset, financial, and earnings position in the consolidated financial statements depends on accounting and valuation methods as well as assumptions and estimates. The assumptions and estimates made by the management in drawing up the consolidated financial statements are based on the circumstances and assessments on the balance sheet date. Although the management assumes that the assumptions and estimates applied are reasonable, there may be unforeseen changes in these assumptions that could affect the Group's asset, financial, and earnings position.\n\n#### **Revenue, result and cash flow development and forecasts**\n\nThe air traffic and passenger numbers at the Group airports are substantial drivers of the revenue, result, and cash flow development in the Fraport Group. The assumptions about the short, medium and long-term development of this driver, and the global development of flight traffic and passenger numbers are incorporated via corporate and Group planning, in particular into the judgment of the impairment of assets according to IAS 36, especially in the context of cash flow forecasts, determining the useful life of property, plant, and equipment by influencing the economic and technical usability of airport infrastructure, and implicitly in the assessment of default risks for receivables from contracts with customers.\n\nThe assumptions made regarding the development of the air traffic and passenger numbers are based on forecasts from various external experts and sources, which are updated regularly, and among other things, form the basis for the medium and long-term Group planning. These forecasts depict risks for the development of the flight traffic and passenger numbers such as climate and environmental risks, political risks, and economic developmental risks in the traffic and passenger volume forecast, which are thus taken into account in the measurement of assets. Airport charges represent a significant portion of revenue and are directly dependent on air traffic. Due to the impact of air traffic on the environment, the development of future air traffic and passenger volumes is strongly dependent on decisions regarding climate policy. These risks are presented and assessed in the Risk and Opportunities Report. The forecast effects of climate policy are reflected in corporate and Group planning. Further details in this regard can be found in note 4 in the section \"Impairment losses pursuant to IAS 36\".\n\nBalance sheet items for which assumptions and estimates have a significant effect on the reported carrying amount are shown below.\n\n#### **Property, plant, and equipment**\n\nExperience, planning, and estimates play a crucial role in determining the useful life of property, plant, and equipment. Carrying amounts and useful lifespans are checked on each reporting date and adjusted as required.\n\n#### **Other financial assets**\n\nThe valuation of loans included in the other financial assets is based in part on cash flow forecasts.\n\n#### **Trade accounts receivable**\n\nThe determination of the expected payment defaults over the overall term of the receivables depends, among other things, on the assessment of qualitative insights into possible future defaults.\n\n#### **Taxes on income**\n\nFraport is subject to taxation in various countries. In assessing global income tax receivables and liabilities, estimates sometimes need to be made. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the tax authorities will come to a different tax assessment. The associated uncertainty is accounted for by recognizing uncertain tax receivables and liabilities when they are considered by Fraport to have a probability of occurrence of more than 50%. A change to the assessment, for example, as a result of final tax assessments, will have an effect on current and deferred tax items. For uncertain income tax items that have been recognized, the expected tax payment is used as a basis for the best estimate.\n\n#### **Deferred tax assets**\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if it is probable that future tax benefits can be realized. The actual tax earnings situation in future fiscal years, and therefore the actual usability of deferred tax assets, could differ from the forecasts at the time the deferred tax assets are recognized.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n### **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**\n\nMaterial valuation parameters for the valuation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations are the discount factor as well as trend factors (see also note 38).\n\n#### **Other provisions**\n\nThe valuation of the other provisions is subject to uncertainty with regard to estimations of amount and the time of occurrence of future cash outflows. As a result, changes in the assumptions on which the valuation is based could have a material impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group. In connection with legal disputes, Fraport draws on information and estimates provided by the Legal Affairs department and any mandated external lawyers when assessing a possible obligation to recognize provisions and when valuing potential outflows of resources. The existing provisions for passive noise abatement as at December 31, 2023 and wake turbulences are substantially dependent with regard to their amounts on the utilization of the underlying programs by the eligible beneficiaries. The existing provisions for compensation in accordance with nature protection laws as at December 31, 2023 are dependent with regard to their amount on the extent and time of implementation of the environmental compensation measures. For further information on significant provisions, please refer to Note 40.\n\n### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nThe contingent liabilities are subject to uncertainty with respect to estimations of their amounts and, in particular, the timing of cash outflows. The time of the expected cash outflow is specified if it can be determined sufficiently reliably.\n\n#### **Company acquisitions**\n\nWhen an acquired company is consolidated for the first time, all identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities must be recognized at their fair value at the time of acquisition. One of the main estimates relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities at the time of acquisition. The measurement is usually based on independent expert reports. Marketable assets are recognized at market or stock exchange prices. If intangible assets are identified, the fair value is usually measured by an independent external expert using appropriate measurement methods which are primarily based on future expected cash flows. These measurements are considerably influenced by assumptions about the developments of future cash flows as well as the applied discount rates. The actual cash flows may differ significantly from the cash flows used as a basis for determining the fair values.\n\n#### **Impairment losses**\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill and other assets within the scope of IAS 36 is based on assumptions about future developments. Fraport AG carries out these tests annually as well as when there are reasons to believe that goodwill has been impaired. In the case of cash-generating units, the recoverable amount is determined. This corresponds to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The measurement of the value in use includes estimates regarding the forecasting and discounting of future cash flows. The underlying assumptions could change on account of unforeseeable events and may therefore impact the asset, financial, and earnings position.\n\nSpecific estimates or assumptions for individual accounting and valuation methods are explained in the relevant section. These are based on the circumstances and estimates on the balance sheet date, and in this respect also affect the amount of the reported income and expense amounts of the fiscal years shown.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **New standards, interpretations, and changes**\n\nOf the new standards, interpretations and changes, Fraport generally applies those for which application was mandatory; i.e. those applicable to fiscal years beginning on or before January 1, 2023.\n\nOn May 18, 2017, the IASB adopted the new standard IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\", including the amendments of June 25, 2020. Further amendments (\"First-time Adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information\") were adopted by the IASB on December 9, 2021. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 \"Insurance Contracts\" and sets out new approaches for the presentation, recognition and measurement of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 and its amendments were adopted under EU law on November 19, 2021 and September 8, 2022 respectively and must be applied to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2023. An earlier application of the amendments is permitted. No such insurance contracts are held by the Fraport Group. There have consequently been no effects on the representation of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" and IAS 8 \"Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Accounting Errors\". The objective of the amendments to IAS 1 is to improve the quality of financial reporting by only requiring disclosures on material and non-significant accounting policies. Accounting policies are material if they are necessary to understand other material information in the financial statements. This is likely to apply to accounting policies that relate to significant transactions and other material events in the entity. The amendments to IAS 8 relate to the definition of accounting estimates. They include clarifications to better distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. Both amendments were adopted under EU law on March 3, 2022 and must be applied to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2023. Earlier application of the amendments was permitted. The amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 did not have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn May 7, 2021, the IASB published amendments to IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\". The current prohibition on recognizing deferred taxes upon initial recognition of an asset or liability is no longer to apply to transactions in which both deductible and taxable temporary differences arise in the same amount. The exception applies to narrowly defined cases, for example leases and disposal or restoration obligations. Where deductible and taxable temporary differences arise in equal amounts, both deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities must be recognized. The amendments were adopted under EU law on August 12, 2022 and must be applied to reporting periods from January 1, 2023. Earlier application was permitted. The application of the amendments to IAS 12 did not have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the IASB published amendments to \"IAS 12: International Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules\". The amendments include a temporary, mandatory exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes resulting from the introduction of a global minimum tax as well as specific disclosures in the notes for entities that are affected. In periods in which legislation to implement the global minimum tax has been passed but has not yet come into force, disclosures must be made regarding the effects of the Pillar Two regulations or an estimate of the resultant income taxes for the company. The amendments were endorsed in EU law on November 8, 2023 and are mandatorily effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. With regard to the amendments to IAS 12 and the future effects of the introduction of a global minimum tax on the presentation of the asset, financial and earnings position of the Fraport Group, see the section \"Global minimum taxation\" below.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Standards which have not been applied prematurely**\n\nFor the following new or amended standards and interpretations, which the Fraport Group is not obliged to adopt until future fiscal years, the Fraport Group is currently working on implementing the requirements for initial application. Early application is not planned. At this point in time, Fraport expects the effects on the consolidated financial statements described below.\n\n#### **Standards, interpretations, and amendments published and adopted into European law by the European Commission**\n\nOn September 22, 2022, the IASB approved amendments to IFRS 16 \"Leases\". The amendments relate to the accounting of leasing liabilities from sale and leaseback transactions. The amendment to IFRS 16 requires leasing liabilities to be measured in such a way that subsequent measurement does not result in a profit or loss in relation to the retained right-of-use asset. The amendments were adopted under EU law on November 21, 2023 and must be applied from January 1, 2024. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments to IFRS 16 are not expected to have a material impact on the future reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn January 23, 2020, the IASB published changes to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current. Liabilities must be reported as non-current if, at the end of the reporting period, the company has a substantial right to defer the settlement of the debt by at least twelve months after the balance sheet date. On July 15, 2020, the IASB postponed the initial application of the amendments to IAS 1 to January 1, 2022. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the IASB published changes to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\". The amendments relate to the classification of liabilities (as current or non-current) for which certain credit conditions (covenants) have been agreed. The amendments state that only those covenants that a company must comply with on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. Furthermore, the amendments provide for additional disclosure requirements for non-current liabilities with ancillary conditions. Among other things, the following disclosures must be made: Carrying amount of the liability, type of covenant, and period for which the ancillary conditions apply. The amendments to IAS 1 are to be applied for the first time to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2024. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 of January 23 and July 15, 2020 as well as October 31, 2022 were adopted into EU law on December 19, 2023 and must now be applied uniformly from no later than January 1, 2024.\n\n#### **Standards, interpretations, and amendments that have been published, but not yet adopted into European law by the European Commission**\n\nOn May 25, 2023, the IASB published amendments to IAS 7 \"Statement of Cash Flows\" and IFRS 7 \"Financial Instruments: Disclosures\" with respect to additional disclosures on financing agreements with suppliers (reverse factoring transactions). The new requirements make it mandatory to disclose the following information in the future: terms, conditions and subject matter of the supplier financing agreements, the carrying amounts and balance sheet items of the resulting liabilities at the beginning and end of the period, the range of payment terms and further information on the liquidity risk of the supplier financing agreements. The amendments are mandatorily applicable for fiscal years from January 1, 2024. An earlier application is permitted, but this requires EU endorsement. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the IASB published changes to IAS 21 \"Impacts of exchange rate differences\". The amendment concerns the determination of the exchange rate when a currency cannot be exchanged in the long term. The amended standard supplements IAS 21 with the requirements for assessing whether a currency can be exchanged for another currency, the procedure for determining an exchange rate and additional explanations on non-convertible currencies. The amendments to IAS 21 are to be applied for the first time to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2025. An earlier application is permitted, but this requires EU endorsement. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Global minimum taxation**\n\nThe Fraport group falls into the area of application of the OECD Model Rules (global minimum taxation). The legislation on global minimum taxation was promulgated in Germany, the country in which the ultimate parent company of the Fraport Group is domiciled and will enter into effect for fiscal years starting after December 30, 2023. According to the legislation, the Fraport Group is obligated to pay a supplementary tax for each country in which it maintains business units as defined in the legislation. The supplementary tax is calculated by determining the effective tax rate and, if the determined effective tax rate is lower than the minimum tax rate of 15%, the Fraport Group must pay the difference between the effective tax rate and the minimum tax rate.\n\nSince the legislation had not entered into force in any jurisdiction in which Fraport maintains business units as defined in the legislation at the time of reporting, there is no tax burden in this regard for the reporting period.\n\nThe Group has applied the temporary exemption from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12 published by the IASB in May 2023. Accordingly, no deferred taxes are recognized in relation to the rules on global minimum taxation and no related information is disclosed.\n\nThe Fraport Group is currently working on forecasting an estimate with regard to the impact of the global minimum tax on fiscal year 2024 (first year of application of the legislation).\n\nWith regard to its activities in Bulgaria, a country in which the statutory tax rate is 10%, the Group does not expect significant additional taxes to be incurred, partly due to the preliminary evaluations of the substance-based exemption regulations. Also with regard to its other activities, the Group anticipates that the first-time application of the regulations on global minimum taxation will not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate of the Group.\n\nDue to the complexity involved in the application of the legislation and the resulting comprehensive additional data requirements, it cannot be ruled out that the actual, effects could deviate significantly from the current estimates.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# <span id=\"page-170-0\"></span>*Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement*\n\n# **5 Revenue**\n\n**Revenue**\n\n| € million                                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                                      |         |         |\n| Aviation                                                             |         |         |\n| Airport charges                                                      | 814.4   | 618.4   |\n| Security services                                                    | 239.2   | 173.3   |\n| Other revenue                                                        | 45.2    | 36.0    |\n|                                                                      | 1,098.8 | 828.2   |\n| Retail & Real Estate                                                 |         |         |\n| Real Estate                                                          | 189.2   | 185.9   |\n| Retail                                                               | 186.7   | 153.0   |\n| Parking                                                              | 101.6   | 78.9    |\n| Other revenue                                                        | 21.3    | 28.0    |\n|                                                                      | 498.8   | 446.4   |\n| Ground Handling                                                      |         |         |\n| Ground services                                                      | 342.8   | 291.2   |\n| Infrastructure charges                                               | 313.9   | 237.5   |\n| Other revenue                                                        | 20.1    | 21.4    |\n|                                                                      | 676.8   | 550.0   |\n| International Activities & Services                                  |         |         |\n| Aviation                                                             | 686.4   | 594.6   |\n| Non-Aviation                                                         | 524.3   | 444.3   |\n| Contract revenue from construction and expansion services (IFRIC 12) | 515.4   | 331.3   |\n|                                                                      | 1,726.1 | 1,369.8 |\n| Total                                                                | 4,000.5 | 3,194.4 |\n\nDue to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved for the first time. In contrast, revenue from security services decreased by €155.3 million compared to the previous year as a result of the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023. Both effects impacted revenue from security services. For a detailed explanation of the revenue, see the combined management report, chapter \"Group Results of Operations\".\n\nThe Retail & Real Estate segment includes income from operating leases from renting terminal areas, offices, buildings, and properties. No purchase options have been agreed upon. When renting retail space, either minimum rents or variable, revenuerelated rents apply, depending on the occurrence of contractually defined conditions. Predominantly variable rents are agreed for these areas. Overall, during the fiscal year, revenue-related rent of €154.5 million (previous year: €127.8 million) was realized. The underlying lease contracts in the Retail section for fiscal year 2023 contain contractually agreed minimum lease payments of €40.1 million (previous year: €16.6 million).\n\nProperties were predominantly rented in the form of assigned hereditary building rights. On the reporting date, the remaining term of hereditary building rights contracts is 37 years on average (previous year: 42 years).\n\nThe acquisition and production costs of the leased buildings and land amount to €535.4 million (previous year: €523.9 million). Cumulative depreciation and amortization came to €396.8 million (previous year: €380.2 million), of which depreciation and amortization amounted to €6.0 million for the fiscal year (previous year: €4.3 million).\n\nRevenue in the International Activities & Services segment is allocated to the Aviation and Non-Aviation sections as well as contract revenue from construction and expansion services related to airport operating projects. The Aviation revenue includes revenue, in particular, from airport charges as well as security services (€686.4 million; previous year: €594.6 million). Revenue in the Non-Aviation section was €348.3 million (previous year: €288.1 million), resulting from retail and real estate activities as well as parking. In addition, €95.9 million (previous year: €84.5 million) was attributable to infrastructure charges and ground handling services. Contract revenue from construction and expansion services related to airport operating projects in the amount \n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nof €515.4 million (previous year: €331.1 million) was attributed to Lima (€465.7 million; previous year: €312.1 million), Greece (€36.9 million; previous year: €10.3 million) as well as Fortaleza and Porto Alegre (€12.8 million; previous year: €8.7 million).\n\nRevenue in the amount of €4,000.5 million (previous year: €3,194.4 million) resulted from €2,771.1 million (previous year: €2,236.2 million) from contracts with customers in accordance with IFRS 15. Other revenue relates to particular contract revenue from construction and expansion projects in accordance with IFRIC 12 as well as proceeds from rentals and other leases.\n\nThe total amount of future income from minimum lease payments arising from non-cancelable leases is as follows:\n\n**Minimum lease payments**\n\n| € million              |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      | Remaining term                         | Total   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|\n|                        | Due in the<br>1st subsequent         | Due in the<br>2nd subsequent         | Due in the<br>3rd subsequent         | Due in the<br>4th subsequent         | Due in the<br>5th subsequent         | Due from the<br>6th subsequent         |         |\n|                        | year                                 | year                                 | year                                 | year                                 | year                                 | year                                   | 2023    |\n| Minimum lease payments | 155.4                                | 108.3                                | 96.4                                 | 92.8                                 | 88.6                                 | 1,511.3                                | 2,052.8 |\n| € million              | Remaining term                       |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                        | Total   |\n|                        | Due in the<br>1st subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>2nd subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>3rd subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>4th subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>5th subsequent<br>year | Due from the<br>6th subsequent<br>year | 2022    |\n| Minimum lease payments | 162.0                                | 93.2                                 | 86.7                                 | 81.7                                 | 79.7                                 | 1,505.2                                | 2,008.5 |\n\nThe future income from minimum lease payments includes the contractual unconditional minimum rental for the retail areas as well.\n\n# **6 Other Internal Work Capitalized**\n\n| Other internal work capitalized              | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| € million<br>Other internal work capitalized | 50.5 | 39.9 |\n\nThe other internal work capitalized primarily relates to engineering, planning, and construction services and services of commercial project managers, as well as other performance work.

The effective taxes result from the taxable results of the fiscal year and any revisions to previous assessment periods, to which the local tax rates of the respective Group company are applied.\n\nDeferred taxes are generally measured using the applicable tax rate of the respective country. For domestic companies, a combined income tax rate of around 32%, which includes trade tax, is applied.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and IFRS financial statements, for utilizable carryforwards of unused tax losses, as well as for carry-forwards of tax-deductible interest.\n\nThe assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on the probability that the tax loss carryforwards and interest carryforwards will be utilized. This depends on the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which the tax loss carryforwards/interest carryforwards can be utilized.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, based on current information, the Fraport Group in Germany had non-utilizable trade tax losses carried forward of €5.4 million and corporation tax losses carried forward of €0.3 million attributable to taxes (previous year: €5.4 million related to trade taxes and €0.3 million to corporation taxes). The loss carryforwards that are not expected to be utilized result from Fraport Immobilienservice und -entwicklungs GmbH & Co. KG and FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH and can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThe Fraport Group has utilizable loss carryforwards in Germany of €443.6 million (corporation taxes; previous year: €618.4 million) and €565.9 million (trade taxes; previous year: €715.3 million) as well as utilizable losses carried forward aboard of €139.7 million (previous year: €97.1 million).\n\nFor temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries amounting to €760.0 million (previous year: €726.6 million), no deferred tax liabilities were recognized, as Fraport can control the timing of the reversal and it is not expected that these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. These potential tax liabilities are, however, limited to 1.59% of the difference as well as local withholding taxes in the case of future dividend payments from certain foreign subsidiaries.\n\nIn addition, deferred taxes result from consolidation measures. Pursuant to IAS 12, no deferred tax is recognized in the context of initial consolidation with respect to goodwill capitalized or any impairment losses of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted insofar as these income tax claims and liabilities relate to the same tax authority and to the same taxable entity or a group of different taxable entities that, however, are assessed jointly for income tax purposes.\n\nDeferred taxes resulting from temporary differences between tax financial valuation and assets/liabilities accounted according to IFRS are assigned to the following financial position items:\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management\n\nTo Our Shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financials Statements *Group Notes* Further Information\n\n#### **Allocation of deferred taxes**\n\n| € million                                    | 2023                   |                             | 2022                   |                             |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                              | Deferred tax<br>assets | Deferred tax<br>liabilities | Deferred tax<br>assets | Deferred tax<br>liabilities |\n| Investments in airport operating projects    | 21.9                   | –121.0                      | 16.5                   | –118.6                      |\n| Other intangible assets                      | 1.5                    | –13.1                       | 2.0                    | –13.1                       |\n| Property, plant, and equipment               | 2.8                    | –284.4                      | 3.0                    | –275.4                      |\n| Financial assets                             | 7.5                    | 0.0                         | 2.3                    | 0.0                         |\n| Accounts receivable and other assets         | 2.2                    | –30.4                       | 4.6                    | –20.0                       |\n| Provisions for pensions                      | 5.3                    | 0.0                         | 4.6                    | 0.0                         |\n| Other provisions                             | 30.9                   | –2.8                        | 34.5                   | –3.0                        |\n| Liabilities                                  | 228.7                  | –0.1                        | 237.9                  | –0.2                        |\n| Securities and financial derivatives         | 9.9                    | –2.1                        | 18.9                   | 0.0                         |\n| Losses and interest carried forward          | 206.6                  | 0.0                         | 236.1                  | 0.0                         |\n| Total separate financial statements          | 517.3                  | –453.9                      | 560.4                  | –430.3                      |\n| Offsetting                                   | –418.5                 | 418.5                       | –406.4                 | 406.4                       |\n| Consolidation measures                       | 3.5                    | –16.8                       | 5.5                    | –17.5                       |\n| Consolidated Statement of Financial Position | 102.3                  | –52.1                       | 159.5                  | –41.3                       |\n\nThe vast majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities result from non-current assets (investments in airport operating projects, other intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment) and non-current liabilities (primarily concession liabilities), as well as utilizable losses and interest carried forward.\n\nOver the fiscal year, equity-decreasing deferred taxes of €11.3 million (previous year: equity-increasing deferred taxes of €18.2 million) from the change in the fair values of financial derivatives and securities were recognized directly in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss.

The reported average revenue growth is adjusted for the recovery effect and reflects the average growth for the years 2028 to 2053. Over the entire forecast period, the average revenue growth is 4.5%.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe parameters used within the scope of the impairment tests are based on the current plan approved by the Executive Board. This takes account of internal empirical values and external economic framework data.\n\nThe revenue forecasts used to determine growth assumptions are based, in particular, on expected air traffic trends derived from external market forecasts.\n\nA variation in the discount rate of +0.5 percent points results in a need for impairment of goodwill in the amount of €4.7 million, while an adjustment of the growth forecasts by -0.5 percentage points does not result in a need for impairment.\n\nThe planning period on which the impairment test for Fraport Slovenija is based corresponds to the term of the right derived from a long-term land use contract to operate the airport in Ljubljana.\n\n# **18 Investments in Airport Operating Projects**\n\n| Investments in Airport Operating Projects |                   |                   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                                 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Investments in airport operating projects | 4,146.8           | 3,769.1           |\n\nInvestments in airport operating projects relate to concession rights, which comprise the following items due to the application of IFRIC 12 (see also note 4 and note 49): the initial payment and capitalized minimum concession payments of €1,790.8 million (previous year: €1,845.0 million) as well as capital expenditure of €2,304.7 million (previous year: €1,870.9 million) and prepayments of €51.3 million (previous year: €53.2 million). They relate to terminal operation at the concession airports in Greece at €1,864.9 million (previous year: €1,933.0 million), Lima at €1,522.2 million (previous year: €1,094.9 million), Fortaleza and Porto Alegre at €611.2 million (previous year: €595.9 million), as well as Varna and Burgas at €148.5 million (previous year: €145.3 million).\n\nLoans that were specifically taken out to finance the expansion of the airports in Brazil were accounted for as borrowing costs in the amount of €31.5 million (previous year: €35.8 million), of which €0.8 million (previous year: €7.6 million) were capitalized. Interest rates on loans range from 6.1% and 11.7%. Amounts for loan disbursements that are not yet required for capital expenditure in the expansion of the airports were reinvested. The accrued interest income for these investments amounted to €0.4 million (previous year: €1.2 million).\n\nAs part of the expansion at Lima Airport, loans amounting to €659.0 million were raised as part of specific financing and in this context borrowing costs of €28.6 million (previous year: €10.5 million) were capitalized. The loan will accumulate interest at an interest rate of 7.65%.\n\n# **19 Other Intangible Assets**\n\n**Other intangible assets**\n\n| € million                            | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Other concession and operator rights | 49.3              | 50.9              |\n| Software and other intangible assets | 47.7              | 45.0              |\n| Total                                | 97.0              | 95.9              |\n\nThe other concession and operator rights include in particular the right derived from an existing, long-term land use contract to operate the airport in Ljubljana (€49.2 million, previous year: €50.9 million) with a remaining term of 30 years (previous year: 31 years).\n\nThe other intangible assets as at the reporting date contain internally generated intangible assets with residual carrying amounts of €7.2 million (previous year: €7.7 million). At closing date further €2.9 million (previous year: €2.3 million) were attributable to the development phase.

Of this, €706.9 million (previous year: €593.7 million) is attributable to the construction of Terminal 3 (\"Expansion South\"), as well as further projects in connection with expansion measures to meet capacity at Frankfurt Airport.\n\nBorrowing costs were capitalized in the amount of €34.7 million (previous year: €21.5 million) for general project financing at Fraport AG. These relate to financing where it is not possible to directly attribute the borrowing costs to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. The borrowing cost rate applied averaged around 1.9% (previous year: around 1.5%). In addition, specific project financing has been concluded for measures related to the construction of Terminal 3. In total, borrowing costs of €6.8 million (previous year: €4.3 million) were capitalized in the financial year. The average financing cost rate was around 1.2% (previous year: around 0.6%).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, property, plant, and equipment with a carrying amount totaling €0.2 million (previous year: €0.1 million) carry mortgages.\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment of the Fraport Group comprises land, land rights, and buildings, including those on land leased by Fraport AG and is valued at €3,022.5 million (previous year: €3,060.1 million). As at the balance sheet date of 2023, land with an area of 26.1 million square meters (equivalent to approximately 10.1 sq mi) were owned by Fraport AG. Depending on the location and type of use, the market value of the land included in property, plant, and equipment varies between €1 and €720 per square meter (equivalent to approximately 10.75 sq ft) (land values published by the committees of experts for real estate values of the State of Hesse).\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment includes rights of use from leases for land and buildings. The development of the rights of use can be found in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Non-current Assets.\n\n#### **Right-of-use assets from leases**\n\n| € million                                                                                        | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Carrying amount of right-of-use assets as of December 31                                         | 158.3 | 191.0 |\n| Carrying amount of lease liabilities as of December 31                                           | 174.2 | 208.9 |\n| Additions right-of-use assets/ lease liabilities in fiscal year                                  | 8.6   | 0.2   |\n| Total cash outflow for leases                                                                    | 71.7  | 69.3  |\n| Expenses related to variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities | 26.5  | 21.1  |\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities                                                            | 7.2   | 8.5   |\n| Income from subleasing right-of-use assets                                                       | 96.8  | 85.3  |\n| Leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed                                        | 0.0   | 0.0   |\n\nRight-of-use assets as at the balance sheet date amounted to €121.5 million (previous year: €152.0 million) primarily relating to the companies of Fraport USA (International Activities & Services segment), which operates and develops commercial terminal space at various US airports as part of rental and concession contracts. Only the fixed minimum lease payments guaranteed to the lessor were included in the measurement of the lease liabilities of the companies of Fraport USA. Sales-related (variable) rental payments to be paid in addition are recognized as expenses in the respective period and are reported in the cost of materials for the companies of Fraport USA. The rental and concession agreements currently in force at Fraport USA generally have a term of ten years and some extension options of five years each, but these cannot be exercised unilaterally and therefore cannot be assessed with sufficient certainty. Therefore, only fixed terms without optional periods are taken into account as lease terms.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, Fraport USA was successful in the tender process for the center management at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). Operations were taken over on January 1, 2024. Due to the variable lease payments, the new contract does not result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset or a lease liability. The variable rental payments due are recognized on an accrual basis as cost of materials. With a term until March 31, 2034, this is the longest running contract at Fraport USA.\n\nThe variable leasing payments incurred in the fiscal year are entirely attributable to Fraport USA. Future cash outflows from variable lease payments occur if the lease payments for the fiscal year exceed the contractually defined minimum lease payments (base rents) that were included in the measurement of the lease liabilities. The exceeding part is treated as variable lease payment. The total amount of lease payments to be paid depends on the revenue received from subletting the concession areas.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, future nominal payment obligations arising from existing leases amounting to €224.8 million. A maturity analysis of the lease liabilities is shown in note 47.\n\nIn the Fraport Group, income of €3.2 million from the application of the relief provisions to IFRS 16.46 adopted on May 28, 2020 was realized in the previous year (rental concessions in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic).\n\n# **21 Investment Property**\n\nInvestment property includes land and buildings situated in direct vicinity to Frankfurt Airport, which are classified as follows:\n\n#### **Investment property**\n\n| € million                  | Carrying amount<br>December 31, 2023 | Carrying amount<br>December 31, 2022 | Fair value<br>December 31, 2023 | Fair value<br>December 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Undeveloped land – Level 2 | 3.1                                  | 3.1                                  | 2.6                             | 2.6                             |\n| Undeveloped land – Level 3 | 8.7                                  | 7.4                                  | 16.1                            | 14.8                            |\n| Developed land – Level 3   | 57.7                                 | 58.6                                 | 86.9                            | 82.6                            |\n| Total                      | 69.5                                 | 69.1                                 | 105.6                           | 100.0                           |\n\nThe undeveloped land – Level 2 is undeveloped land in the Kelsterbach district directly next to the Runway Northwest.\n\nThe fair value of the undeveloped land – Level 2 is calculated internally using the comparative value procedure pursuant to the Real Estate Valuation Regulation of December 3, 2019 (ImmoWertV) applicable in Germany based on the standard ground values published by a committee of experts. The fair value of undeveloped land – Level 3 is also determined internally using the comparative value method. However, the prices per square meter used for current land transactions in the same development area are not observable on the market.\n\nThe developed land – Level 3 comprises real estate leased for residential purposes from the voluntary purchase program for real estate in Flörsheim in the flight zone of Runway Northwest, the long-distance train station plot, and the parking garages in Gateway Gardens, as well as commercially leased properties.\n\nThe fair values of the developed land - Level 3 category are determined in part using the income capitalization approach in accordance with the German Real Estate Valuation Ordinance (ImmoWertV) and in part using the discounted cash flow approach by external appraisers. The main input parameters for the income capitalization approach are the multiplier, which depends on the useful life and the property interest rate, and the underlying annual rent. In the discounted cash flow method, a perpetual annuity is assumed. The main input parameters are the discount rate, the sustainable market rent, the assumed remaining useful life, forecast maintenance costs and the expected development of rents.\n\nFor major parts of the investment property, foreseeable restrictions on saleability arise from the fact that these areas are located in the immediate vicinity of Runway Northwest.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\ns Further Information\n\nNet lease revenue from investment property during the 2023 fiscal year amounted to €7.4 million (previous year: €6.1 million). The total costs incurred for the maintenance of investment property amounted to €2.3 million (previous year: €1.0 million), classified as expenses that are not allocatable (excluding depreciation and amortization), and of which €0.1 million was incurred for property for which no lease revenue was earned during the fiscal year.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, no obligations exist for the acquisition of investment property (previous year: €0.1 million).\n\n# **22 Investments in Companies accounted for Using the Equity Method**\n\nCompanies that are Group airports outside of Frankfurt are considered to be substantial joint ventures and associated companies in the Fraport Group. This relates to both companies in connection with the operating concession at Antalya Airport.\n\n### **Shares in joint ventures**\n\nFraport TAV Antalya Terminal Isletmeciligi Anonim Sirketi, Antalya/Turkey (\"Fraport TAV Antalya I\") is a joint venture of Fraport AG and TAV Havalimanlari Holding A.Ş. IC Yatirim Holding A.S. that operates the terminals at Antalya Airport as part of the concession agreement of May 22, 2007 with the Turkish airport authority (DHMI grantor). The concession for the operation of the terminals and thus the right to use all assets listed in the concession agreement runs for a total of 17 years to the end of 2024. In a letter dated February 12, 2021, the Turkish government approved the extension of the concession period for terminal operations at Antalya Airport for an additional two years, to December 31, 2026.\n\nWith regard to the authorized use of infrastructure, the company is obligated to perform maintenance and capacity expansions (as required). Distributed over the term of the concession agreement, concession fees of €2.01 billion net must be paid to DHMI. In exchange, the operator receives the right to use the existing and future terminal infrastructure to operate the airport and the right to generate revenue from passenger charges paid by the airlines and from other services related to terminal operations. Passenger charges are regulated by the grantor.\n\nFraport holds a 51% interest in the company's share capital, though neither party may make a decision unilaterally due to the voting system laid down in the partnership agreement. The division of the variable returns from the company is governed separately in the partnership agreement, according to which both partners are entitled to equal amounts in returns. The company accounts for 50% according to the equity method on the basis of the division of the dividend rights and the joint management and control. Since the company is not listed on a stock exchange, there is no available active market value for the shares.\n\nIn conjunction with the tender won in December 2021 for the new operating concession at Antalya Airport, Fraport AG, together with TAV Airports Holding, founded the company Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş., Antalya, Turkey, (\"Fraport TAV Antalya II\"). The operational period of the company will begin in early 2027, after the existing concession expires. Fraport AG holds 49% of the capital shares. The remaining 51% of the shares in the company are held by TAV Airports Holding. Pursuant to the contractually agreed participation rights, the company is jointly controlled by the shareholders. The concession agreement was also concluded in December 2021 between Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş and the Turkish government. The agreement runs until 2051. The concession covers the operation of the terminals and other landside infrastructure, including retail space, parking management, and passenger controls. For the new operating concession, Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş is required to pay fixed concession charges totaling €7.25 billion net over the term to the Turkish State (DHMI), of which 25% was paid after the conclusion of the concession agreement at the end of March 2022. Financing of around € 1.9 billion has been raised to date for the advance payment and the expansion investments of around € 765.3 million. The interim financing has a term until March 2024. The discussions on the conclusion of follow-up financing and on increasing the financing volume are already at an advance stage.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n####

Service Gesellschaft mbH, the newly founded FraScout GmbH (see note 2) and operational services GmbH & Co.KG.\n\nThe cumulated total amount of the non-recognized pro rata losses of the associated companies amounted to €6.4 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €4.7 million) and the corresponding losses of the reporting period amounted to €1.7 million (previous year: €1.6 million).\n\nThalita Trading Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Northern Capital Gateway LLC (NCG) were founded as companies by Fraport AG, the Russian bank VTB, and the Greek Copelouzos Group. NCG develops and operates Pulkovo Airport (St. Petersburg, Russia) as part of a 30-year concession agreement with the city of St. Petersburg. The company is responsible for the entire airport infrastructure. Since a change in the shareholder structure in 2017, Fraport AG holds 25.0% of the shares in Thalita Trading Ltd.\n\nBased on a decree by the President of the Russian Federation of November 30, 2023 as well as a regulation by the Russian government of December 1, 2023, the Russian company \"Holding VVSS Limited Liability Company\" (in English: NCG Holding Limited Liability Company), St. Petersburg was found with its entry in the Russian commercial register on December 18, 2023. The company's share capital amounts to €1,691 million. In accordance with the decree and the regulation, all the shares in the operating company of the Pulkovo Airport, Northern Capital Gateway LLC (\"NCG\"), are deemed as held by VVSS. From a Russian perspective, Thalita is therefore no longer shareholder of NCG. Until that time, Thalita held 100% of the shares in NCG. The management and group of shareholders remain unaffected by the decree. The shareholders of VVSS are the former shareholders of Thalita by entry in the Russian commercial register. Accordingly, Fraport holds 25% of the shares in VVSS. The voting rights associated with the capital shares have been temporarily transferred to two trustees. However, no end date has been stipulated. In accordance with the regulation, the respective share in VVSS is deemed as acquired by the shareholders from the date of entry of VVSS in the Russian commercial register and the shareholders' initial contribution is deemed as paid to VVSS in the nominal amount of their respective share.\n\nThe shares in VVSS were not recognized as an asset in the Fraport consolidated statement of financial position as Fraport has no control over the shareholder rights associated with the capital shares. Since Fraport became a shareholder of the company under Russian law, the shares held by Fraport AG (note 57) are recognized under other investments.\n\nSignificant resolutions and decisions on Thalita Ltd. can only continue to be made on the basis of the company statutes, which continue to be valid, and shareholder rights. As a result, the company continues to be recognized as an associated company in the consolidated financial statements. Due to cumulative losses in the past, the carrying amount of the investment is \"zero\".\n\nIn connection with the financing of the Pulkovo operating project, there is a loan receivable recognized as a loan (see note 23) and an interest receivable (see note 24) of the Fraport Group from Thalita Trading Ltd. As at June 30, 2022, the receivables were fully written off in the amount of €163.3 million as cash flows (interest payments and loan repayments) are no longer expected due to the sanctions situation. This assessment remains valid due to the unchanged sanctions situation and the development described above at the end of 2023.\n\nThere are no significant restrictions pursuant to IFRS 12.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **23 Other Financial Assets**\n\n#### **Other financial assets**\n\n| € million                     |  | Remaining term |             | Total             | Remaining term |             | Total             |\n|-------------------------------|--|----------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n|                               |  | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2023 | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2022 |\n| Financial instruments         |  |                |             |                   |                |             |                   |\n| Securities                    |  | 748.0          | 559.7       | 1,307.7           | 265.2          | 791.5       | 1,056.7           |\n| Other investments             |  | 0.0            | 117.9       | 117.9             | 0.0            | 130.4       | 130.4             |\n| Loans                         |  |                |             |                   |                |             |                   |\n| Loans to joint ventures       |  | 6.2            | 40.5        | 46.7              | 4.5            | 23.2        | 27.7              |\n| Loans to associated companies |  | 0.0            | 0.1         | 0.1               | 0.0            | 0.0         | 0.0               |\n| Other loans                   |  | 95.0           | 230.3       | 325.3             | 0.0            | 228.4       | 228.4             |\n| Insolvency-secured funds      |  | 0.0            | 4.6         | 4.6               | 0.0            | 0.0         | 0.0               |\n| Total                         |  | 849.2          | 953.1       | 1,802.3           | 269.7          | 1,173.4     | 1,443.1           |\n\nIn the year under review, investments in securities amounted to €717.5 million (previous year: €619.9 million), which partly were already disposed during the year. Other changes resulted from reclassifications to current other financial assets due to securities of €364.1 million maturing in 2024 (previous year: €155.8 million) and changes arising from valuation of +€31.8 million (previous year: –€64.7 million).\n\nThe fund units protected against insolvency are exclusively meant to hedge credits from the time-account models and partial retirement claims in particular of Fraport AG employees.

As at the reporting date, acquisition costs amounted to €74.3 million (previous year: €68.6 million). These securities are measured at fair value and credited against the corresponding obligations of €69.0 million (previous year: €66.3 million) (see also note 40). At year-end, there was an overfunding from fund units of €4.6 million (previous year: underfunding of €1.4 million).\n\nThe change in other investments relates to shares in Delhi International Airport Private Ltd, New Delhi, India, for which a fair value was determined in the reporting year.\n\nThe loans to joint ventures primarily relate to a loan granted to Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş in the 2022 fiscal year.

The shares were issued at a price of €44.39.\n\n#### **Authorized capital**\n\nAt the AGM on May 23, 2017 the existing authorized capital was canceled and new authorized capital of €3.5 million was approved, which can be used for issuing shares to employees of Fraport AG and companies controlled by Fraport AG. The Executive Board was entitled, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock on one or more occasions by up to a total of €3.5 million until May 22, 2022 by issuing new shares in return for cash. The Executive Board did not make use of this authorization, meaning there was no longer any authorized capital after the authorization expired on December 31, 2022.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on June 1, 2021, new authorized capital (\"Authorized Capital II\") of €458.8 million was approved. The Executive Board is entitled, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock on one or more occasions by up to a total of €458.8 million until May 31, 2026 by issuing up to 45,884,352 new no-par value bearer shares in return for cash. In principle, the shareholders are to be granted a subscription right. The new shares may also be underwritten by financial institutions with the obligation to offer them to company shareholders for subscription. The new shares will participate in the net income from the beginning of the fiscal year of their issue. To the extent legally permissible, the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and in deviation from Section 60 (2) AktG, can determine that the new shares will participate in net income from the beginning of a fiscal year that has already expired and for which no resolution has yet been passed by the Annual General Meeting on the appropriation of the profit earmarked for distribution at the time of their issue. The Executive Board is further authorized, also with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders one or more occasions, insofar as this is necessary to compensate for residual amounts.\n\n#### **Contingent capital**\n\nOn June 1, 2021, the Annual General Meeting also resolved to conditionally increase the share capital by up to €120.2 million by issuing up to 12,020,931 new no-par value bearer shares (\"contingent capital\"). The contingent capital serves exclusively to grant shares to the holders or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants or a combination of all these instruments, which, are issued by the company in accordance with the authorization up to May 31, 2026 resolved by the Annual General Meeting on June 1, 2021 and grant a conversion or option right to new no-par value bearer shares in the company or determine a conversion or option obligation or a right to tender and insofar as the issue takes place in return for cash. The new shares are issued at the conversion or option price to be determined according to the previously mentioned authorization resolution. The contingent capital increase is only to be carried out to the extent that conversion or option rights are exercised, or the conversion/option obligation is satisfied, or shares are tendered, and no other forms of fulfillment are used. The new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created by exercising conversion or option rights or through the fulfillment of corresponding obligations (fiscal year of origin); in deviation from this, the new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created if the Annual General Meeting has not yet passed a resolution on the utilization of the profit earmarked for distribution from the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created. The Executive Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the implementation of conditional capital increases.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Executive Board has not made use of the authorization for a contingent capital increase. As in the previous year, the contingent capital amounted to € 120.2 million as at December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **Capital reserve**\n\nThe capital reserve contains the premium from the issue of Fraport AG shares.\n\n#### **Revenue reserves**\n\nThe revenue reserves consist not only of the reserves of Fraport AG (including the statutory reserve of €36.5 million), but also the revenue reserves and retained earnings of the Group companies included in the consolidated financial statements, as well as effects of consolidation adjustments. Furthermore, the revenue reserves include reserves for currency translation differences and financial instruments.\n\nThe derivative valuation reserve is €6.3 million as at the balance sheet date (previous year: –€8.0 million). The reserve for the equity and debt instruments measured at fair value totals €56.8 million (previous year: €48.4 million).\n\nPursuant to Section 253 (6) sentence 1 of the HGB and in accordance with Section 268 (8) of the HGB, a total of €299.3 million of the shareholders' equity attributable to Fraport AG's shareholders (previous year: €344.9 million) is subject to a distribution block. However, the distribution block did not take effect insofar as sufficient free reserves were available.\n\nFor the past financial year, it is proposed that the net profits be transferred to other revenue reserves.\n\n# **32 Non-controlling Interests**\n\n| Non-controlling interests                                           |                   |                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                                                           | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Non-controlling interests (excluding the attributable Group result) | 236.3             | 188.3             |\n| Group result attributable to non-controlling interests              | 37.3              | 34.2              |\n| Total                                                               | 273.6             | 222.5             |\n\nNon-controlling interests related to allocated shareholders' equity and earnings of Fraport Twin Star Airport Management AD, FraCareServices GmbH, Media Frankfurt GmbH, Lima Airport Partners S.R.L., and the Fraport Group companies Fraport Greece A, Fraport Greece B and Fraport Regional Airports of Greece Management Company.\n\n# **33 Non-current and Current Financial Liabilities**\n\n#### **Non-current and current financial liabilities**\n\n| € million             | Remaining term |             | Total             | Remaining term |             | Total             |\n|-----------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n|                       | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2023 | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2022 |\n| Financial liabilities | 1,521.4        | 10,232.5    | 11,753.9          | 1,209.6        | 9,716.0     | 10,925.6          |\n\nIn the course of the year, promissory note loans in the amount of €1,167.7 million (previous year: €539.4 million) were issued.

A reinsurance was already obtained in 2005 to reduce actuarial risks and protect pension obligations for the former and current (in some cases still active) members of the Executive Board against insolvency. This is a group insurance policy with an annual, constant minimum insurance amount for the entire group. The pension benefits from the reinsurance correspond to the total achievable retirement, occupational disability, and widow's/widower's benefits in accordance with the pension commitments. Reinsurance benefits are recognized at the active value reported by the insurance company to the value of €23.5 million (previous year: €24.0 million), of which €1.1 million (previous year: €1.0 million) is attributable to reserved trust assets. The reinsurance is not traded on an active market. Plan assets are invested in shares, real estate, fixed-interest securities, and other assets. In addition, €0.0 million (previous year: €0.04 million) were paid in the reinsurance in fiscal year 2023 through deferred compensation. The average weighted term of the members of the Executive Board's defined benefit plans is 10.5 years (previous year: 12.2 years) for pensions with reinsurance and 9.2 years (previous year: 6.9 years) for pensions without reinsurance.\n\nThe Executive Board members are entitled to pension benefits and provision for surviving dependents. An Executive Board member is generally entitled to a retirement pension if he or she becomes permanently unable to work or retires from office during the term of, or upon expiry of, his or her employment agreement. If an Executive Board member dies, benefits are paid to his or her surviving dependents. These amount to 60% of the retirement pension for the widower or widow; children entitled to receive benefits receive 12% each. If no widow's pension is paid, the children each receive 20% of the retirement pension.\n\nUpon retirement, income from active employment as well as retirement pension payments from previous or, where applicable, later employment relationships shall be credited against accrued retirement pay up until reaching 60 years of age, insofar as without such credit the total of these emoluments and the retirement pension would exceed 75% of the fixed salary (100% of the fixed salary if Fraport AG wishes the employment to be terminated or not be extended). Effective January 1 of each year, the retirement pensions are adjusted at discretion, taking into account the interests of the former Executive Board member and the company's economic situation. The adjustment obligation is considered to be satisfied if the adjustment does not fall below the increase in the consumer price index for the cost of living for private households in Germany.\n\nThe retirement pension of an Executive Board member is defined by the percentage of a contractually agreed basis of assessment, with the percentage rising annually by 2% up to a limit of 75%, dependent on the duration of time an Executive Board member is appointed.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Dr. Schulte is entitled to a retirement pension of 75% and thus the maximum and Prof. Dr. Zieschang a claim of 62% of the respective contractually agreed basis of assessment.\n\nIn the event of occupational disability, the pension rate for Dr Schulte and Prof Dr Zieschang amounts to at least 55% of their respective fixed annual gross salaries or of the contractually agreed basis of assessment.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Executive Board members appointed from 2012 onwards, the pension benefits, provision for surviving dependents, and provision for long-term occupational disability are governed by a separate benefit agreement. This calls for the payment of a one-time pension capital or lifelong retirement pension after the insured event. The pension capital is generated when Fraport AG annually credits 40% of the fixed annual gross salary paid to a pension account. The pension capital accumulated at the end of the previous year pays interest annually at the interest rate used for the valuation of the pension obligations in the German balance sheet of Fraport AG at the end of the previous year pursuant to Section 253 (2) of the HGB, which is at least 3% and at most 6%. This is increased by 1% on January 1 of each year for lifelong retirement payments. No further adjustment is made. If the pension capital reached is less than €600 thousand when retirement benefits fall due as a result of long-term occupational disability, Fraport AG will increase it to this amount. In the event of long-term occupational disability within the first five years of their activities performed as members of the Executive Board, it is foreseen that Executive Board members can postpone the receipt of a monthly retirement pension payment by a maximum of five years from the start of the employment contract. Until the postponed start of the pension benefit payments, they will receive a monthly benefit of €2.5 thousand. The risk of pension payments in the increase phase and of payments for the increase has been reinsured by an occupational disability insurance policy. The full amount of all income pursuant to the Income Tax Act from employment or self-employment is credited against the retirement pension paid until the end of the month in which the Executive Board member reaches the age of 62.\n\nBenefits for surviving dependents of Executive Board members appointed from 2012 onwards are regulated as follows: If there is no prior event giving rise to retirement benefits, the widow or widower receives the pension capital generated so far. If there is no widow or widower entitled to benefits, each half-orphan receives 10% and each full orphan receives 25% of the pension capital generated so far as a one-time payment. If the pension capital reached is less than €600 thousand upon death, Fraport will increase it to this amount. The payment risk of this increase has been reinsured by a term life insurance policy. If an Executive Board member dies while collecting retirement pensions, the widow or widower is entitled to 60% of the last retirement pensions paid. Half-orphans receive 10% and full orphans receive 25% of the last retirement pensions paid. If there are no surviving dependents as set forth above, the heirs receive a one-time death grant in the amount of €8.0 thousand.\n\nMoreover, each member of the Executive Board has entered into a two-year post-contractual restrictive covenant. For this period, appropriate ex gratia compensation in the amount of 50% of the contractual benefits last received by the member of the Executive Board is granted (within the meaning of Section 74 (2) of the HGB); when calculating compensation, the performance-based remuneration components shall be taken into account according to the average of the last three completed fiscal years. If the current remuneration system has not existed for three fiscal years at the end of the contract, the average performance-based remuneration is determined based on the duration of the contract in accordance with the current remuneration system (within the meaning of Section 74b (2) of the HGB). Payment shall be made in monthly installments. The compensation shall be generally credited against any retirement pension owed by Fraport AG. In the case of Executive Board members appointed before 2012, this applies if the compensation together with the retirement pension and other income generated exceeds 100% of the last fixed annual salary. In the case of Executive Board members appointed since 2012, the full amount of the compensation counts toward the retirement pension up to the end of the month in which the member reaches the age of 62 or 65. Payments on the occasion of premature termination of the membership on the Executive Board are credited to the compensation for the period of.\n\nNo other benefits have been promised to Executive Board members should their employment be terminated.\n\nThe retirement pension payments entitlement of former Executive Board members is determined by a percentage of a contractually agreed fixed basis of assessment.\n\nFor Senior Managers and employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements who joined the company as Senior Managers or employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements after December 31, 1997 or who will join in future, the pension benefits and benefits for surviving dependents on the monthly compensation liable to top-up pension payments, for which contributions are payable, are restricted to the upper limit defined in Section 38 of the ATV-K in the amount of 1.133 times of the payment group 15 level 6 of the collective bargaining agreement for civil servants (TVöD). In addition to said limited pension benefits and benefits for surviving dependents, there exists a supplementary company retirement benefit for these persons. Accordingly, Fraport AG makes an annual contribution in the amount of 13% of the eligible income as capital components into an individually managed pension account. The period of contribution began on January 1, 1998 for employees who entered into an employment not covered by a collective bargaining agreement before January 1, 2000. Furthermore, this applies to employees who changed from an employment covered by a collective bargaining agreement to one not covered by a collective bargaining agreement after December 31, 1997 or who entered into an employment not covered by a collective bargaining agreement after\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nDecember 31, 1997, effective as at the time of the change in status. There were 718 benefits (of which 691 vested) as at the end of the year. The present value of the non-vested benefits amounted to €0.0 million (previous year: €0.0 million); the present value of the vested benefits amounted to €13.2 million in the 2023 annual financial statements (previous year: €12.5 million). Future obligations amount to €8.4 million for active employees and €4.8 million for former and retired employees. No significant provision amounts were paid this fiscal year due to the young age structure. The obligations for Senior Managers and employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements had an average weighted term of 7.2 years (previous year: 8.0 years).\n\nFurthermore, the opportunity to participate in an employee-financed company pension scheme (\"deferred compensation\") exists. The employee contribution is generated through converting a portion that can be chosen freely each year. This portion is converted into an insured sum and is accumulated by Fraport AG and accrues interest. At the end of the fiscal year, there were 24 vested pension commitments totaling €8.2 million (previous year: €7.4 million). Obligations amount to €5.0 million for active employees (previous year: €6.0 million); obligations amount to €3.2 million for former and retired employees (previous year: €1.5 million). The average weighted term of the employee-financed company pension scheme was 6.3 years (previous year: 7.0 years).\n\nGuidelines nos. 2 and 3 as well as company agreement BV 47 were replaced with a new version of company agreement BV 47 and an amalgamated guideline 2 effective January 1, 2017. The new version differs from the previously valid version in that the interest on contributions from January 1, 2017 is no longer accrued at a fixed interest rate of 6% nor is direct interest attributed based on age factors but rather at an annual rate based on the market rate, which is no less than 2% p.a. and no more than 6% p.a. Contributions that have been paid in by December 31, 2016 still accrue interest according to the previous version.\n\nThe valuation of pension obligations is based on the provisions of IAS 19. The pension obligations as at December 31, 2023 were calculated on the basis of actuarial opinions. Changes to the obligations outlined above were as follows:\n\n#### **Pension obligations (2023)**\n\n| € million                                                                            | Present

obligations of the Fraport Group. All pension obligations largely have the same assumptions where the adjustment to pensions is only calculated on pension obligations of the Executive Board members.\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis**\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is based on changes in the assumptions while other factors remained constant. In practice, it is unlikely that only one actuarial assumption would change. Changes in actuarial assumptions may correlate with other actuarial assumptions. The method for determining the sensitivity analysis did not change. The pension provision would vary by the following amounts in the event of a change in assumptions:\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis (December 31, 2023)**\n\n| € million         | 2023                                |                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate     | Decrease in interest rate by 0.5%   | Increase in interest rate by 0.5%   |\n|                   | 2.5                                 | -2.3                                |\n| Pension growth    | Decrease in pension growth by 0.25% | Increase in pension growth by 0.25% |\n|                   | -0.7                                | 0.7                                 |\n| Mortality         | Reduction by one year               |                                     |\n|                   | 0.0                                 |                                     |\n| Retirement age 1) | Increase by one year                |                                     |\n|                   | 1.3                                 |                                     |\n\n1) The obligation would increase by €1.3 million for all beneficiaries as a result of a one-year increase in the retirement age.\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis (December 31, 2022)**\n\n| € million                    | <b>2022</b>                         |                                     |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                              | Decrease in interest rate by 0.5%   | Increase in interest rate by 0.5%   |\n| Interest rate                | 3.6                                 | -1,7                                |\n|                              | Decrease in pension growth by 0.25% | Increase in pension growth by 0.25% |\n| Pension growth               | 0.0                                 | 1.7                                 |\n|                              | Reduction by one year               |                                     |\n| Mortality                    | 0.8                                 |                                     |\n|                              | Increase by one year                |                                     |\n| Retirement age <sup>1)</sup> | 2.3                                 |                                     |\n\n1) The obligation would increase by €2.3 million for all beneficiaries as a result of a one-year increase in the retirement age.\n\nThe retirement age has no influence on the pensions received by members of the Executive Board and was only calculated for other pensions. Due to the structure of the respective pension plans, the salary adjustment has no effect on pension obligations.\n\nIn connection with the defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to the actuarial risks mentioned above as well as the interest rate risk. Due to the liquidity available in the Group, there is no risk with regard to fulfillment of non- reinsured obligations.\n\n#### **Multi-employer plans**\n\nFraport AG has insured its employees for purposes of granting a company pension under the statutory insurance scheme based on a collective bargaining agreement (Altersvorsorge-TV-Kommunal [ATV-K]) with the Zusatzversorgungskasse for local authority and municipal employers in Wiesbaden (ZVK). The contributions are collected based on a pay-as-you-go model. As in the previous year, the contribution rate of the ZVK is 7.0% on compensation liable to top-up pension payments; thereof, the employer pays 5.3%, with the contribution paid by the employee amounting to 1.7%. In addition, a tax-free restructuring fee of 1.4% of the remuneration liable to top-up pension payments is levied by the employer in accordance with Section 63 of the ZVK Statutes (ZVKS). An additional contribution of 9.0% is paid for some employees included in the statutory social security insurance scheme (generally employees exempted from collective bargaining agreements and Senior Managers) for the consideration subject to ZVK that, according to Section 38 ATV-K, exceeds the upper limit defined in the collective bargaining agreement. The amounts subject to contributions amounted to €393.9 million.\n\nThis plan is a multi-employer plan (IAS 19.8), since the companies involved share the risk of the investment and also the biometric risk. Reference is also made to the collective bargaining agreement risks arising from the ZVK insurance in the Risk and Opportunities Report in the management report.\n\nThe ZVK insurance is generally to be classified as a defined benefit plan (IAS 19.30). Because there is not sufficient information on the plan and the company also covers the risks of other insuring companies with its contributions (IAS 19.34), only the current contributions are accounted for as if it were a defined contribution plan. Due to its structure, the ZVK does not provide any information to participating companies that would allow the allocation of obligations, plan assets, service costs, and, if applicable, over- or underfunding or the extent of Fraport's participation in the plan. In the consolidated financial statements of Fraport, the consideration of contributions corresponds to defined-contribution pension commitments. Along with the remaining member companies, Fraport AG is obliged to finance accrued obligations not covered by assets as well as future obligations. The precise\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Informat\n\nshare of the remaining extent of the obligation cannot be determined. In the event of Fraport AG withdrawing from the multiemployer plan (for example, through terminating the agreement), compensation in the amount of the present value of the obligation at the point of the membership being terminated is to be paid to the ZVK. This amount cannot be determined due to only insufficient information being available. Should the multi-employer plan be dissolved by a resolution of the administrative committee, no share in any possible remaining overfunding will be due to Fraport.\n\nIn the fiscal year, €24.3 million (previous year: €22.0 million) was recorded as contributions to defined contribution plans for ZVK. Contributions in the amount of €32.4 million are expected for the following financial year.\n\nIn addition, contributions are paid to state pension insurance institutions in Germany on the basis of statutory provisions. The current contributions are shown as expense for the respective year. Employer contributions made by the Fraport Group to statutory insurance schemes totaled €69.8 million (previous year: €71.6 million).\n\n# **39 Non-current and Current Income Tax Provisions**\n\n#### **Non-current and current income tax provisions**\n\n| € million                      |              | Remaining term | Total             |              | Remaining term | Total             |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|\n|                                |              |                | December 31, 2023 |              |                | December 31, 2022 |\n|                                | up to 1 year | over 1 year    |                   | up to 1 year | over 1 year    |                   |\n| Provisions for taxes on income | 73.3         | 47.3           | 120.6             | 24.7         | 77.0           | 101.7             |\n\nTax provisions amounting to €120.6 million (previous year: €101.7 million) were accrued for unassessed corporation tax and trade taxes, as well as for tax audit risks.\n\n# **40 Non-current and Current Other Provisions**\n\nThe development in the non-current and current provisions is shown in the following tables.\n\n#### **Non-current and current personnel-related provisions**\n\n| € million           | January 1, 2023 | Use   | Release | Additions | December 31, 2023 |\n|---------------------|-----------------|-------|---------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Personnel           | 116.7           | –58.3 | –5.7    | 66.0      | 118.7             |\n| thereof non-current | 45.4            |       |         |           | 34.7              |\n| thereof current     | 71.3            |       |         |           | 84.0              |\n\nIn addition to the provisions in connection with the \"Zukunft FRA – Relaunch 50\" program, the personnel provisions related in particular to partial retirement arrangements, as well as provisions for variable wage and salary components, such as profit distribution for the employees of Fraport AG.

As at December 31, 2023, estimated cash outflows (present value) amounted to €1.9 million within one year (previous year: €1.9 million), €8.5 million after one to five years (previous year: €9.1 million), and €27.7 million after five years (previous year: €24.2 million).\n\nThe \"passive noise abatement\" provision includes obligations to refund the passive noise abatement expenses of owners of private and commercial land and obligations to pay outdoor living and commercial area compensation. The obligations result from the planning approval notice made by the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Living (HMWEVW) on December 18, 2007 in conjunction with the Act for Protection against Aircraft Noise (Aircraft Noise Act), and the planning approval notice of April 30, 2013. The application deadline for measures from the program was October 13, 2021. Invoices for measures requested by the deadline could still be submitted until October 12, 2022. The provision remaining as at December 31, 2023 in the amount of €0.7 million relates to invoices submitted by the deadline and still being processed. For all obligations reported under \"passive noise abatement\" there is a corresponding reimbursement right at the reporting date, which is reported under other receivables (see also Note 25). The carrying amount of the refund claim depends on the actually collected, and future expected noise abatement charges. The carrying amount of the corresponding provision depends on the actual, and future expected cash outflows for passive noise abatement measures and wake turbulences.\n\nA provision for environmental protection compensating measures was created in previous years due to the long-term obligation to implement ecological compensating measures resulting from the work performed to clear the land in the southern part of the airport and in the area of Runway Northwest required for the airport expansion. As at December 31, 2023, estimated cash outflows (present value) amounted to €0.3 million within one year (previous year: €0.1 million), €3.4 million after one to five years (previous year: €3.4 million), and €8.7 million after five years (previous year: €7.6 million). In the fiscal year, there was a reassessment of the expected cash outflows that led to an adjustment of €0.7 million with no affect to profit or loss.\n\nThe wake turbulence protection program concerns the protection of roofs in the defined entitlement areas to protect against damage to roof cladding due to gusts of wind caused by wake turbulences. The obligations result from the corresponding supplementation decision dated May 10, 2013 and May 26, 2014. As at December 31, 2023, estimated cash outflows (present value) amounted to €4.1 million within one year (previous year: €3.7 million), €10.2 million after one to five years (previous year: €10.0 million), and €4.9 million after five years (previous year: €6.4 million). The additions in the fiscal year were made in full against the corresponding asset without affecting profit or loss (see note 25).\n\nThe remaining provisions include provisions for rebates and refunds of €28.4 million (previous year: €62.0 million), which in the 2023 fiscal year include revenue-decreasing additions of €16.7 million, provisions for possible claims settlements in connection with the strong recovery in traffic and passenger numbers in the fiscal year of €36.3 million (previous year: €36.9 million), provisions for interest related to expected back tax payments of €7.0 million (previous year: €7.3 million), provisions for development measures still to be implemented in connection with the sale of real estate inventories (also see note 28) of €5.1 million (previous year: €5.2 million). Cash flow used in the other provisions are primarily expected within one year.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **41 Financial Instruments**\n\n#### **Disclosures on

receivables, trade accounts payable and other financial receivables and assets, it was assumed that the carrying amount represents a reasonable approximation of the fair value. This assumption is largely due to the short term.\n\nThe fair values of listed securities are identical to the stock market prices on the reporting date. The valuation of unlisted securities was based on market data applicable on the valuation date using reliable and specialized sources and data providers. The values were determined using established valuation models.\n\nThe fair values of loans to joint ventures and associated companies, as well as non-current other receivables and financial assets, are determined as the present value of future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated on the basis of financial planning or derived on the basis of existing contractual terms. If financial planning is used as a basis, the company is classified as level 3, otherwise it is classified as level 2. Discounting was applied using the current maturity-linked interest rate as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe carrying amounts of other loans correspond to the respective fair values. The other loans are subject to a market interest rate, and their carrying amounts therefore represent a reliable valuation for their fair values. Part of the other loans are promissory note loans with a remaining term of more than one year. Due to the lack of an active market, no information is available on the risk premiums of their respective issuers. As the promissory note loans are mainly floating interest rate loans, their carrying amounts were used as the most reliable value for their fair values.\n\nOther non-current financial liabilities are recognized at their present value. To determine fair value, the respective cash outflows are discounted at interest rates with similar terms and with the Fraport credit risk as at the reporting date. The carrying amounts of current liabilities are equal to the fair value.\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to determine the fair value of not listed financial liabilities, the future expected cash flows are determined and discounted based on the yield curve on the reporting date. The market-driven and maturity-linked risk premium of the respective borrower as at the reporting date is added to the cash flows.\n\nThe derivative financial instruments relate to interest rate hedging transactions. In the 2023 fiscal year, six interest rate swaps were concluded in connection with the first disbursement of the financing contractually agreed in 2022 for the commitment in Lima.\n\nThe other investments categorized as Level 3 relate to the shares in Delhi International Airport Private Ltd. The fair value is determined based on the discounted cash flow valuation.\n\nThe substantial non-observable input factors for the shares in Delhi International Airport Private Ltd., for determining the fair value, are the forecast cash flows, which are based on the company's future earnings and planned capital expenditure, as well as the discount factor that is applied. The discount factor used was the WACC (country-specific, weighted average capital cost after taxes).\n\n#### **Fair value hierarchy level 3 reconciliation 2023 (values determined using valuation techniques)**\n\n| € million         | January, 1 2023 | Additions | Gains/losses in<br>income statement | Transfers<br>into level 3 | Gains/losses in<br>OCI | December, 31<br>2023 |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Other investments | 130.2           | 0.0       | 0.0                                 | 0.0                       | -12.7                  | 117.5                |\n\n#### **Fair value hierarchy level 3 reconciliation 2022 (values determined using valuation techniques)**\n\n| € million         | January, 1 2022 | Additions | Gains/losses in<br>income statement | Transfers<br>into level 3 | Gains/losses in<br>OCI | December, 31<br>2022 |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Other investments | 108.8           | 0.0       | 0.0                                 | 0.0                       | 21.4                   | 130.2                |\n\nThe following amounts generated from the fair value in the event of changes in assumptions are:\n\n#### **Sensitivities 2023**\n\n| € million         | Sensitivities with regard to unobservable input parameters |       |                  |       |       | Currency rate sensitivity (INR) |       |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|-------|\n|                   | Discount rate                                              |       | Growth forecasts |       |       |                                 |       |\n|                   | +0.5%                                                      | –0.5% | +0.5%            | –0.5% | +0.5% | –0.5%                           |       |\n| Other investments | 9.5 %                                                      | 87.6  | 151.2            | 123.0 | 111.9 | 116.9                           | 118.2 |\n\n#### **Sensitivities 2022**\n\n| € million         | Sensitivities with regard to unobservable input parameters |       |                  |       |       | Currency rate sensitivity (INR) |       |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|-------|\n|                   | Discount rate                                              |       | Growth forecasts |       |       |                                 |       |\n|                   | +0.5%                                                      | –0.5% | +0.5%            | –0.5% | +0.5% | –0.5%                           |       |\n| Other investments | 9.8 %                                                      | 98.9  | 165.6            | 135.7 | 124.6 | 124.0                           | 137.2 |\n\nThe following table shows the net result for 2023 and 2022 according to IFRS 9:\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Net results of the measurement categories**\n\n| € million               | 2023  | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|-------|--------|\n|                         |       |        |\n| Financial assets        |       |        |\n| At amortized cost       | -7.7  | -168.1 |\n| FVOCI with Recycling    | 31.3  | -57.7  |\n| FVOCI without Recycling | -12.5 | 21.2   |\n|                         |       |        |\n| Financial liabilities   |       |        |\n| At amortized cost       | 2.2   | 4.5    |\n| FVTPL                   | 1.2   | 12.0   |\n\nThe net result consists of changes in fair values recognized through profit or loss, impairment losses, and write-ups recognized through profit or loss, exchange rate changes, and gains and losses of disposals.\n\nInterest and dividend income from financial instruments held at FVOCI are also included in the calculation of the net result.\n\nThe gains on financial liabilities FVTPL include the fair values of an interest rate swap for which there were no hedged items in the course of the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**\n\nWith regard to the items in its statement of financial position and planned transactions, Fraport is, in particular, subject to interest rate and currency exchange risks. Fraport covers interest rate risks by establishing naturally hedged positions, in which the values or cash flows of primary financial instruments offset each other in their timing and amount, and/or by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the business transactions. Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nInterest rate risks arise in particular from the capital requirements associated with capital expenditure and from existing floating interest rate financial liabilities and assets. As part of the interest rate risk management policy, interest swaps and interest swaps with embedded floors were concluded in order to limit the interest rate risk arising from financial instruments with floating interest rates and assure planning security.\n\nThe Group holds seven interest rate swaps as at the reporting date (previous year: one).\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments**\n\n| € million                | Nominal volume    |                   | Fair value        |                   | Credit risk       |                   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                          | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Interest rate swaps      | 560.7             | 30.0              | -0.7              | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n| thereof hedge accounting | 530.7             | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n| thereof trading          | 30.0              | 30.0              | -0.7              | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n\nThe fair values of the derivative financial instruments are recorded as follows in the statement of financial position:\n\n#### **Fair values of derivative financial instruments**\n\n| € million                              |                   | Other assets      |                   | Other liabilities |  |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--|\n|                                        | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |  |\n| Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges | 2.9               | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |  |\n| Interest rate swaps - trading          | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.7               | 0.7               |  |\n\nOne interest rate swap (previous year: one) is classified as FVTPL. All changes in value resulting from this classification are recorded through profit or loss.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nSix interest rate swaps (previous year: zero) are already assigned to existing floating interest-bearing liabilities and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with IFRS 9. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income without affecting profit or loss. This economic relationship results from the compensation amount and thus the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges. Effectiveness is reviewed and documented at regular intervals. In general, the recorded hedging relationships can become ineffective if a gap arises in the material measurement parameters between the hedged item and hedging instrument. Due to a very low level of ineffectiveness, the change in value of hedging instruments corresponds to change in value of the underlying hedged item. These changes in value arise from the unrealized net income that was recorded in shareholders' equity during the fiscal year.\n\n#### **Interest rate swaps (2023 hedge accounting)**\n\n| € million         |             | December 31, 2023 |            |                       |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| Beginning of term | End of term | Nominal value     | Fair value | Average interest rate |\n| 2023              | 2029        | 530.7             | 2.9        | 3.4 %                 |\n| Total             |             | 530.7             | 2.9        |                       |\n\nThe difference between the transaction price and the fair value of the derivatives at the time of the transaction in the amount of €8.2 million was recognized as an expense in profit and loss. During the 2023 fiscal year, unrealized gains of €10.2 million from the change in the market values of derivatives were recognized in other comprehensive income. This resulted in changes to deferred taxes of €2.2 million. The interest result includes €6.6 million in income from the derivative.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# <span id=\"page-204-0\"></span>*Notes to the Segment Reporting*\n\n# **42 Notes to the Segment Reporting**\n\nSegment reporting in the Fraport Group according to IFRS 8 is based on internal reporting to the Executive Board as principle decision-maker and is attached as an appendix to the notes.\n\nThe same accounting principles as those used in the consolidated financial statements underlie segment reporting.\n\nThe strategic business units of Fraport AG at the Frankfurt site are clearly assigned to the Aviation, Retail & Real Estate, Ground Handling and International Activities & Services segments. In addition, these segments include Group companies integrated in the business processes at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe Aviation segment incorporates the strategic business unit \"Aviation\" as well as the Group companies involved in the processes at the Frankfurt site. With the takeover of control of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the 2023 financial year, the Aviation segment generated revenue from aviation security fees for the first time.\n\nThe Retail & Real Estate segment consists of the strategic business unit \"Retail and Properties\", comprising the retailing activities, parking facility management, and the rental and marketing of real estate at the Frankfurt site. In addition, the Group companies integrated into these activities on the Frankfurt site are allocated to this segment.\n\nThe Ground Handling segment combines the \"Ground Services\" strategic business unit and the Group companies involved in these operations at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe International Activities & Services segment encompasses in aggregate, due to the similarity of the economic criteria, the Group companies that are not integrated in the processes at the Frankfurt site, and Group companies that carry out their business operations outside the Frankfurt site (International Activities). The business operations of these companies consist of the operation of airports outside the Frankfurt site or the provision of airport-related services, and are primarily aimed at the users of airport infrastructure. In subareas, they are subject to country-specific regulatory requirements for the operation of airport infrastructure. In addition, the internal service units Integrated Facility Management, Corporate Infrastructure Management, Airport Expansion South, Information and Telecommunication and their Group companies and the strategic business unit Global Investments and Management are assigned to the segment because they primarily provide internal services for the Fraport Group.\n\nRevenue of €70.3million, EBITDA of €13.7million and EBIT of -€13.5 million result from the internal service units and their investments as well as the acquisitions and investments section.\n\nCorporate data at Fraport AG is divided into market-oriented business and service units on the one hand and into central units on the other hand. All the business and service units are allocated clearly to one segment each. The central units are categorized appropriately.\n\nThe data about the Group companies that are not integrated in the processes at the Frankfurt site and Group companies that carry out their business operations outside the Frankfurt site are allocated to the International Activities & Services segment during reporting. The Group companies that are integrated in the processes at the Frankfurt site are allocated to the relevant segment according to their business operations.\n\nInter-segment revenue is primarily generated by the allocation of rent for land, buildings and space, as well as maintenance services and energy supply within Fraport AG. The corresponding assets are allocated to the Retail & Real Estate segment. The relevant units are charged on the basis of the costs incurred, including imputed interest.\n\nInter-segment income also reflects income that has been generated between the companies included from different segments.\n\nGoodwill from business mergers and the appropriate impairment losses, where applicable, have been allocated clearly to a segment according to this segment structure.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe reconciliation of segment assets/segment liabilities column includes the income tax assets/liabilities (including the deferred tax assets/liabilities) of the Group.\n\nIn the additional disclosures \"Geographical Information\", allocation takes place according to the current main areas of operation: Germany, Rest of Europe, Asia, and America. The figures shown under \"Asia\" relate mainly to Turkey. The figures shown under \"America\" relate mainly to the United States, Peru, and Brazil. Of the non-current assets (consisting of property, plant, and equipment, investments in airport operating projects, other intangible assets and investment property) of €13,264.8 (previous year: €12,305.9 million) €8,739.7 million (previous year: €8,120.4 million) relate to Germany. Non-current assets in all other countries of €4,525.1 million (previous year: €4,185.5 million) primarily relate to investments in airport operating projects. The two Brazilian companies achieved revenue in the amount of €108.3 million in 2023 (previous year: €90.0million). The investments in airport operating projects according to IFRIC 12 increased from €595.9 million in the previous year to €611.2 million as at December 31, 2023. The revenue of Lima Airport Partners S.R.L., Lima, Peru, amounted to €792.0 million in 2023 (previous year: €590.1 million). The company holds non-current intangible assets in connection with the accounting pursuant to IFRIC 12 of around €1,522.2 million as at the balance sheet date (previous year: 1,094.9 million). In the \"Rest of Europe\" region, the two Greek companies contributed a total of €545.2 million (previous year: €443.8 million) to revenue (see also note 2). The investments in airport operating projects according to IFRIC 12 amounted to €1,864.9 million as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: €1,933.0 million).\n\nAdditions in the subsidiaries relate to Fraport Washington LLC and Fraport Washington Partnership LLC (International Activities & Services segment). In addition, as a result of the sale of a further 25% of the shares, FraSec Aviation Security GmbH is no longer included in the consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary but as a joint venture since January 1, 2023 (Aviation segment). The additions in the associated companies relate to the founding of FraScout GmbH (Aviation segment), the disposal in the associated companies to the sale of all shares in Airmail Center Frankfurt GmbH (Ground Handling segment). The effects of the additions and disposals are explained in more detail in note 2. The aforementioned changes had no substantial impact on the segment reporting.\n\nSegment assets of the Retail & Real Estate segment include real estate inventories of €0.5 million (previous year: €0.5 million).\n\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, revenue of €969.1 million was generated in all four segments with one customer (previous year: €740.8 million) and thus more than 10% of Group revenue.

The improvement of €75.9 million resulted in particular from an increase in the operating result.\n\n### **Cash flow used in investing activities**\n\nCash flow used in investing activities without investments in cash deposits and securities amounted to €1,482.6 million in the past fiscal year, an increase of €176.8 million year-on-year. The increase was primarily the result of higher investments in airport operating projects, particularly in Lima, as well as increased cash outflows for expansion measures at the Frankfurt site. In the previous year, the cash outflow was mainly due to capital contributions of –€375.3 million to the new joint venture that was established in connection with the operating concession at Antalya Airport and, on the other hand, due to the proceeds from the disposal of the shares in the associated company Xi'an of +€152.2 million. Considering capital expenditure in and revenue from securities and promissory note loans as well as capital expenditure in relation to time deposits, the overall cash flow used in investing activities was €1,818.9 million (2022: €1,216.0 million).\n\n#### **Cash flow from financing activities**\n\nCompared to the previous year, cash flow used in financing activities decreased only slightly by €86.9 million to €795.4 million. The raising of funds from the project financing concluded in December 2022 at the Group company Lima and the associated repayment of the short-term bridge loan had an effect of €675.1 million on the payments of non-current financial liabilities and – €302.4 million on the change in current financial liabilities.\n\nThe capital increases \"Non-controlling interests\" relate to capital contributions to the company Lima. In the previous year, the sale of capital and loan shares to a co-shareholder of the Greek companies was reported under transactions with non-controlling interests. Taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and other changes, the Fraport Group reported cash and cash equivalents based on the consolidated statement of cash flows of €670.3 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: €826.2 million).\n\nThe following overviews show the composition of cash and cash equivalents and non-cash changes to the liabilities from financing activities. With regard to the development of the leasing liabilities, see note 20.\n\n#### **Reconciliation to the cash and cash equivalents as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position**\n\n| €

|\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# <span id=\"page-208-0\"></span>*Other Disclosures*\n\n# **44 Long-Term Incentive Program**\n\n### **Long-Term Incentive Program**\n\nThe Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) for the Executive Board and Senior Managers was introduced effective January 1, 2010.\n\nA certain number of virtual shares (so-called performance shares) is allocated annually depending on certain performance objectives. Target achievement is measured over four years (performance period); payment in cash takes place immediately at the end of the four-year performance period.\n\nThe number of virtual shares actually allocated depends on the extent to which two performance targets are met:\n\n- Earnings per Share (EPS) (target weighting 70%) This internal performance target is determined by comparing the actual average EPS in the performance period with the weighted average plan EPS at the time of awarding.\n- Rank Total Shareholder Return MDAX (TSR) (target weighting 30%) The TSR measures the development of shares over a certain period of time subject to dividends and share price developments. Therefore, it constitutes a market-dependent performance target.\n\n### **Performance Share Plan**\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) used to determine the long-term performance remuneration for the Executive Board, and from January 1, 2021 for the other plan participants, was replaced by the Performance Share Plan (PSP), which maintains a performance period of four years.\n\nAt the start of the plan, each member of the Executive Board, or each plan participant, is promised a target amount in euros according to their function as an allocation value.\n\nAs at January 1, 2023, 215,694 virtual shares were issued for the PSP tranche. Their term is four years ending on December 31, 2026.\n\nThe allocation value is divided by the initial fair value (i.e., the actuarially determined fair value according to the accounting standard IFRS 2, Share-based Payment) per performance share at the beginning of the performance period, resulting in the provisional number of virtual performance shares allocated.\n\nThe achievement of the performance share plan is determined by two performance criteria, Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to the MDAX index.\n\n• The Earnings Per Share (EPS) criterion is used as an internal financial performance target and is taken into account with a weighting of 70%. The EPS performance criterion provides incentives to operate profitably. This forms the basis for the sustainable and long-term growth of Fraport AG and ensures the financing capacity of necessary capital expenditure and thus the achievement of important strategic goals. Long-term growth helps Fraport AG to achieve its objective of establishing itself as Europe's best airport operator and also to set global standards among the competition. In determining the achievement of the EPS target, a target value derived from strategic planning is compared with the actual EPS value achieved. This compares the average of the annual actual EPS values determined during the performance period with the average target EPS. If the average actual EPS value is equal to the average target EPS (target value), the target achievement rate is 100%. If the average actual EPS value is 25% below the target value, the target achievement rate is 50%. If the average actual EPS value is more than 25% below the target value, the target achievement rate is 0%. If the average actual EPS value is 25% or more above the target value, the target achievement rate is 150%. Between these values, the degree of achievement follows a straight-line development.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n• As a further performance criterion, the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) uses an external performance criterion geared to the capital market, which is weighted at 30%. The relative TSR takes into account the development of the Fraport share price plus fictitious reinvested gross dividends compared to a predefined comparison group. The relative TSR links the interests of the Executive Board and shareholders and integrates a relative measurement of success into the remuneration system for the Executive Board. This creates an incentive to outperform the relevant comparison group in the long term. Fraport AG pursues the goal of being an attractive investment for shareholders and therefore provides an incentive for above-average success on the capital market. Achieving the target for the relative TSR is based on a comparison with the MDAX. The Supervisory Board considers the MDAX to be an appropriate benchmark group, as Fraport AG is listed in this index and the MDAX consists of companies of a comparable size. To calculate the TSR in the performance period of the Fraport AG share and the MDAX, the arithmetic average of the closing prices over the last 30 trading days before the beginning of a year of the performance period and over the last 30 trading days before the end of a year of the performance period is determined and then averaged relative to the four years of a performance period. In determining the arithmetic average of closing prices at the end of the performance period, a fictitious amount of reinvested gross dividends is also taken into account. The target achievement is 100% if the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share corresponds to the TSR performance of the comparison group. If the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share is 25% below the TSR performance of the MDAX, the target is 50%. If the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share is more than 25% below the TSR performance of the MDAX, the target is 0%. If the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share is 25% or more below the TSR performance of the MDAX, the target is 150%. Achieving the targets between the defined target achievement points follows a straight-line development.\n\nThe aforementionded performance criteria allow a target to be achieved in the range of 0% to 150%. At the end of the four-year performance period, the achievement of the performance criteria is determined and the final number of virtual performance shares is determined. The distributed amount is calculated by multiplying the final number of performance shares determined by the average price at that time of the Fraport AG share in the last 3 months prior to the end of the performance period plus dividends paid per share during the performance period. The value of the performance shares to be distributed therefore depends on the achievement of the performance criteria and the share price relevant for the distribution. The maximum payout amount is limited to 150% for each tranche to the Executive Board and 125% for all other participants to the allocation value applicable at the start of the plan.\n\nThe payment of the PSP takes place no later than one month after approval of the consolidated financial statements for the fourth year of the performance period.\n\nThe target achievements for the respective performance criteria of the Executive Board tranches are published in the relevant Remuneration Report.\n\n| Tranche            | Fair value<br>December 31, 2023<br>Executive Board | Fair value<br>December 31, 2023<br>Senior Managers | Fair value<br>December 31, 2022<br>Executive Board | Fair value<br>December 31, 2022<br>Senior Managers |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| All figures in €   |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |\n| Fiscal year 20201) | 14.90                                              | 16.00                                              | 9.45                                               | 10.61                                              |\n| Fiscal year 20212) | 51.45                                              | 37.41                                              | 39.39                                              | 32.14                                              |\n| Fiscal year 2022   | 38.79                                              | 31.58                                              | 25.75                                              | 22.20                                              |\n| Fiscal year 2023   | 28.15                                              | 17.39                                              | 22.61                                              | 15.26                                              |\n\n#### **Development of the fair values of the virtual shares for the Executive Board and Senior Managers**\n\n1) Fair value for the Executive Board has been calculated under the PSP as of fiscal year 2020\n\n2) Fair value for the Senior Managers calculated for the first time under the PSP in fiscal year 2021\n\nThe valuation of the virtual shares takes place on the basis of the fair value per share for a tranche. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the fair value. A simulation of the log-normal distributed processes is carried out for the Fraport share price to determine the relevant payment according to the respective performance targets.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe fair value of virtual shares to be measured in fiscal years 2020 to 2023 was calculated based on the following assumptions:\n\n- The basis of the computations on the respective valuation date was a continuous zero interest rate. The interest rates were computed from the interest rate structures of government bonds maturing between one and ten years.\n- The computation basis for future dividend payments is public estimates made by ten banks. The arithmetic mean of these estimates is taken to determine the dividends.\n- Historic volatility is used for the calculations. The calculations are based on the daily XETRA closing price for the Fraport AG share and beginning in fiscal year 2020 also for the MDAX.\n- The remaining term of the LTIP or the PSP is used as the time horizon to determine volatility.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the provision for the still ongoing LTIP tranche 2020 (for senior managers) amounted to €0.3 million and €7.4 million for the ongoing PSP tranches.\n\nDue to the market dependence of the fair value measurement, there was a negative effect on profit and loss of €4.9 million in the past fiscal year 2023 (previous year: €1.1 million), which was recognized in personnel expenses. Of this amount, €3.4 million (previous year: €0.7 million) is attributable to Executive Board members and €1.5 million (previous year: €0.4 million) to the other plan participants.\n\nNo provision was created for the Executive Board tranche 2020. The reason for this is the support granted by the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Hesse to compensate for unfunded maintenance costs incurred by Frankfurt Airport during the first lockdown in 2020. The prerequisite for the approval of these support payments was that the Executive Board would not receive any bonuses, special payments in the form of share packages or other separate remuneration (gratuities) in addition to the fixed salary for the 2020 fiscal year. This also related to the allocation of variable remuneration components for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\n# **45 Contingent Liabilities**\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities\\***\n\n| € million                               | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Guarantees                              | 1.1               | 2.1               |\n| Warranties                              | 1,482.8           | 1,342.0           |\n| thereof contract performance guarantees | 1,426.4           | 1,265.3           |\n| Other contingent liabilities            | 100.4             | 89.9              |\n| Total                                   | 1,584.3           | 1,434.0           |\n\n\\* Previous year's values adjusted for the guarantees and the contract performance guarantees. This relates to capital contribution obligations from the expansion financing for the operating company in Lima, Peru. The matter is presented in note 47 under \"Liquidity risk\".\n\nThe warranties concluded mainly result from the respective contract terms in connection with national and international investment projects.\n\nAt € 1,426.4 million, the guarantees mainly include contract performance guarantees. The key guarantees are explained below.\n\nIn December 2021, Fraport AG and its partner company TAV Airports Holding were awarded the tender for the new concession to operate the Turkish Antalya Airport (see note 22). This new concession runs from 2027 to 2051. In the course of this acquisition, the concession company Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş had to submit a contract performance guarantee to the Turkish aviation authority as the grantor upon signing the concession agreement on December 28, 2021. This guarantee is currently provided by the Turkish Ziraat Bank and reinsured by the shareholders in accordance with their shares in the consortium (Fraport share: €38.3 million).\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, an advance payment on the concession fee of €1,812.5 million was made to the Turkish grantor in connection with this new concession in Antalya. To do so, the concession company took out financing in the amount of €1,225.0 million via a banking consortium. Additional funds from banks were used to finance the contractually obligatory expansion \n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nactivities at the Antalya site so that the operating company reported liabilities to banks totaling around €1,883.0 million (previous year: €1,361.0 million) as at the reporting date. Fraport AG, as a shareholder, issued a financing guarantee in favor of the bank consortium totaling €941.5 million (previous year: €687.3 million) in accordance with its share.\n\nIn connection with the current concession at Antalya Airport, Turkey, in which Fraport AG holds a 50% stake, the shareholder guarantees were contractually reduced in 2023 from €125.0 million (€62.5 million Fraport share) to €85.0 million (€42.5 million Fraport share) for an existing loan (financing by the Turkish Akbank or, as the issuing bank, the Spanish Banco Santander). Furthermore, there is a guarantee of €1.9 million in connection with the commitment (previous year: €3.8 million).\n\nFraport and the Brazilian Government signed concession agreements on July 28, 2017 for the operation and further development of the Brazilian airports of Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. This commitment resulted in guarantees of €323.1 million (previous year: €401.7 million).\n\nA performance guarantee, excluding recourse against Fraport AG, was signed between GMR Holdings Private Ltd., Fraport AG, and ICICI Bank Ltd. to the amount of INR3.000 million or €32.5 million (previous year: €34.0 million) to modernize, expand, and operate Delhi Airport (India). If, however, the party to the contract, GMR Holdings Private Ltd., fails to meet its contractual obligations, Fraport AG's liability may not be excluded given the fact that Fraport AG is party to the contract.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, there were contract performance guarantees in connection with the two service concession agreements concluded in 2015 for the 14 Greek Regional Airports of €29.2 million (previous year: €31.2 million).\n\nThe performance guarantee relating to the concession agreement for the operation of the airport in Lima, Peru, amounted to €24.1 million as at the balance sheet date (previous year: €24.6 million). The amount of the guarantee is regularly adjusted and depends on the investment obligations already fulfilled by the subsidiary in Lima.\n\nFraport Twin Star Airport Management AD is guaranteed unchanged to the amount of €7.5 million (previous year: €7.5 million) in the context of operating the airports in Varna and Burgas, Bulgaria.\n\nThe Group companies of Fraport USA have obligations amounting to €7.1 million (previous year: €7.0 million) in connection with the operation and development of commercial terminal areas at various US airports.\n\nThe other contingent liabilities include among others that Fraport AG is held liable to the amount of €5.8 million for rentals payable by Lufthansa Cargo Aktiengesellschaft to ACC Animal Cargo Center Frankfurt GmbH if Lufthansa Cargo Aktiengesellschaft exercises an extraordinary right to terminate the contract (previous year: €6.5 million) as well as contingent liabilities of the subsidiary Lima from tax risks to the amount of €9.9 million (previous year: €6.9 million). Other contingent liabilities in 2023 also include possible claims by the local authorities against the Brazilian Fraport company in Porto Alegre for the relocation/construction of alternative residential buildings for the residents of the \"Vila Nazaré\" settlement adjacent to the airport site. The relocation has been completed. Despite a possible capitalization of these expenses, they are to be presented under contingent liabilities. In total, this figure amounts to the equivalent of €75.4 million (previous year: €68.5 million).\n\nThe above mentioned contingent liabilities contain commitments in connection with investments in joint ventures in the amount of €85.9 million (previous year: €107.1 million) and €32.5 million (previous year: €34.0 million) obligations in connection with associated companies.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# **46 Other Financial Obligations**\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, there were other obligations amounting to €161.6 million (previous year: €144.4 million). These relate largely to obligations arising from a long-term heat and cold supply contract (€100.4 million, previous year: €59.1 million) with Mainova AG. The other obligations include €60.9 million (previous year: €80.1 million) of obligations to joint ventures.\n\nRevenue-related concession fees and additional obligations for capital expenditure of unspecified amounts on airport infrastructure have been agreed based on the existing concession agreements relating to the operation of the airports in Varna and Burgas, Bulgaria; Lima, Peru; Fortaleza and Porto Alegre, Brazil; and the 14 Greek Regional Airports (see also note 49).\n\nIn addition to order commitments, other financial obligations also include future expenses from existing rental and leasing contracts for operating and office equipment as well as technical systems and machines. No right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16 were recognized for these contracts for reasons of materiality. Contracts are recorded as expenses like operate leases.\n\n#### **Order commitments for capital expenditure**\n\n| € million                                                                              | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Orders for capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets | 1,333.7           | 1,387.3           |\n\nOrder commitments for intangible assets comprise an insignificant portion of the total amount.\n\n| Operating leases           |                   |                   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                  | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Rental and lease contracts |                   |                   |\n| up to 1 year               | 6.8               | 6.7               |\n| more than 1 up to 5 years  | 7.6               | 7.2               |\n| more than 5 years          | 0.0               | 0.1               |\n| Total                      | 14.4              | 14.0              |\n\n# **47 Risk management**\n\nFraport is exposed to market price risks mainly due to changes in exchange rates and interest rates. The Group is additionally exposed to credit risks. There are also liquidity risks arising in connection with credit and market price risks or resulting from a worsening of the operating business or disturbances on the financial markets. It is the objective of financial risk management to monitor and limit these risks by means of current operating and finance-related activities. Depending on a risk assessment, selected hedging instruments are used for these purposes. In general, Fraport hedges only those risks that affect the Group's cash flows. Recently concluded derivative financial instruments are used exclusively as hedging instruments; i.e. they are not used for trading purposes.\n\nReporting to the Executive Board of risk positions is made once per quarter as part of the early risk recognition system. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer receives a current financial report each month with all important financial risk positions. These are also part of the monthly Treasury Committee Meetings (TCM) in which the Chief Financial Officer and representatives of the financial department participate. The processes of risk control and the use of financial instruments, among others, are regulated as part of the Group's financial guidelines. These regulations also include requirements for the unambiguous segregation of functions in respect of operating financial activities, their settlement and accounting, and the controlling of the financial instruments. The guidelines, which are the basis of the risk management processes, aim to limit and control the risks appropriately and monitor them. Both the guidelines and the systems are regularly reviewed and adjusted to current market and product developments.\n\nFor further details, please refer to the opportunity and risk reporting in the combined management report.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Credit risk**\n\nFraport is subject to default risks from its operating business and certain financial positions. The default risks arising from financial positions are controlled by a broad diversification of counterparties and issuers, as well as regular verification of their credit ratings and the limits derived from this. It is the company's risk policy that financial assets and derivative transactions are in principle only carried out with issuers and counterparties with a credit rating of at least \"BBB–\". If the credit rating is downgraded to a grade worse than \"BBB–\" during the asset's holding period or the term of the derivative, a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis on how to deal with the asset or derivative in future, taking into account the remaining term. A low credit risk is expected, unless the debtor of a financial asset shows an external rating with \"investment grade\" upon initial recognition or on the balance sheet date.\n\nThe maximum credit risk on the balance sheet date is mainly reflected in the carrying amounts of the assets reported in the financial position. The amount of the debt instruments corresponds to the credit risks of the securities and promissory note loans. On the balance sheet date, the material securities and promissory note loans were broken down as follows:\n\n#### **Classification of debt instruments**\n\n| € million        | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Debt instruments | 1,630.8           | 1,281.7           |\n\nThe carrying amount of securities and promissory note loans have the following long-term issuer ratings:\n\n#### **Issuer ratings of securities and promissory note loans**\n\n| € million | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| AAA       | 322.2             | 6.2               |\n| AA+       | 5.2               | 5.2               |\n| AA        | 23.2              | 38.9              |\n| AA–       | 294.8             | 187.3             |\n| A+        | 295.7             | 252.6             |\n| A         | 115.6             | 161.5             |\n| A–        | 236.9             | 93.9              |\n| BBB+      | 113.0             | 252.6             |\n| BBB       | 144.1             | 192.6             |\n| BBB–      | 76.4              | 87.4              |\n| BB        | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n| Not rated | 3.7               | 3.6               |\n| Total     | 1,630.8           | 1,281.7           |\n\nThe credit risk on liquid funds (carrying amount) applies solely with regard to banks.

The funds are primarily used to finance capital expenditure for items of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThe operating cash flow, the available liquid funds (including cash and cash equivalents and current realizable securities and other financial instruments), as well as current and non-current credit lines and loan commitments, give sufficient flexibility to ensure the liquidity of the Fraport Group.\n\nGiven the diversity both of the financing sources, and the liquid funds, and financial assets, there is no risk of concentration in the liquidity.\n\nThe operating liquidity management comprises a cash concentration process, which, on a daily basis, combines the liquid funds of most of the Group companies headquartered in Germany. This allows optimum control of liquidity surpluses and requirements in line with the needs of individual Group companies. Short and medium-term liquidity management includes the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities and estimates of the operating cash flow.\n\nThe following list of maturities shows how the liability cash flows as at December 31, 2023 influence the Group's future liquidity.\n\n| € million                        | Total    |          | 2024    |          | 2025    |          |

The respective forward interest rates were used to determine the interest payments on primary financial liabilities in foreign currency.\n\nFor project-financing arrangements of foreign Group companies, credit clauses typical for this type of financing have been agreed. These clauses include regulations under which certain debt service coverage ratios and control indicators for leverage and credit terms must be complied with. Failure to comply with the agreed credit clauses may lead to restrictions on the distribution of dividends and/or to the early redemption of loans or to the additional payment of shareholders' equity. Furthermore, pledges of, for example, shares in the company or the assets associated with the service concessions were agreed to secure the project financing. In connection with the project financing concluded for the expansion of the airport in Lima, Fraport AG undertook to secure this financing, while maintaining certain shareholders' equity/borrowings ratios, by increasing the company's pro rata shareholders' equity by up to €347.6 million. Of this amount, €134.8 million was already paid in during fiscal year 2023.\n\nFurthermore, there are loans with contractually agreed credit clauses. These clauses relate, among other things, to changes in the shareholder structure, and control of the company. If these changes have a proven negative effect on the credit rating of Fraport AG, the creditors have on a case-by-case basis, above a certain threshold, the right to call the loans due ahead of time.\n\nAs at the reporting date, all companies were in compliance with the provisions of the financing agreements.\n\n#### **Currency risk**\n\nThe international focus of the Fraport Group makes its operating business, the financial results reported, and the cash flows subject to foreign currency fluctuation risks. Within the Group, foreign currency risks mainly arise from revenue in foreign currencies, which are not covered by expenses in matching currencies. This results in a cash flow risk between foreign currency revenue and functional currency revenue. Only the transaction risks affecting cash flows are actively controlled. These mainly apply between the US Dollar (US\\$) and the Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN). To reduce the foreign currency effects in the operating business, the transaction risk is assessed on an ongoing basis and hedged where necessary by using derivative financial instruments. Entering into financial instrument transactions is the responsibility of the Group companies in close coordination with the Treasury department of Fraport AG. The transaction risks are assessed by means of sensitivity analyses. The calculation rates on which the analyses are based are the result of the mean value for the respective exchange rate in the period under review, less or in addition to a standard deviation. Taking these assumptions as a basis with a deviation of 10%, the result for the period would have been affected in the year under review as follows:\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Currency rate sensitivity**\n\n| Risk in € million |  | December 31, 2023     |                 | December 31, 2022     |                 |\n|-------------------|--|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n|                   |  | Net income before tax | Loss before tax | Net income before tax | Loss before tax |\n| US\\$/PEN          |  | 0.60                  | 0.60            | 0.40                  | 0.40            |\n\nIn addition, there are effects in the Group from the translation of foreign currency assets or liabilities into euros and/or from the consolidation of Group companies not accounted for in euros. These translational risks are met as far as possible by applying natural hedging.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nThe Fraport Group is exposed to interest rate risks on a variety of primary and derivative financial assets and liabilities, as well as future planned capital requirements.\n\nIn regard to assets and liabilities that are currently held, the objective of refinancing at matching maturities is generally pursued. The interest rate risk arising in the next twelve months is relevant for control. Therefore, it is assessed every quarter and reported to the financial risk committee. Sensitivity analyses are prepared to determine the risk. These show the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses, other profit or loss portions, and shareholders' equity. Interest rate changes are defined to be the maximum fluctuation of the key interest rate in the past for the respective currency and the respective period of time and/or the maximum fluctuation of the ten-year euro swap rate in the past. Here, the deviation in absolute terms is taken into consideration.\n\nTo limit the interest rate risks, derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, floors, and swaptions, are used.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions:\n\nChanges in market interest rates of primary financial instruments with fixed interest rates affect profit or loss, or shareholders' equity, only if the instruments are measured at fair value. The sensitivity analysis for these financial instruments assumes a parallel shift of the interest rate curve by 169 basis points over a period of twelve months.\n\nThe financial instruments measured at amortized acquisition cost with fixed interest rates do not affect the result for the period or the shareholders' equity of the Fraport Group.\n\nMarket interest rate changes of primary floating-rate financial instruments that are not designated hedged items in a cash flow hedge of interest rate exposures affect the interest result and are therefore included in the calculation of profit or loss related sensitivities. The respective net financial position for each currency is taken into account in the process. The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: in €: 4.0 percentage points; US Dollar (US\\$): 4.5 percentage points; Turkish Lira (TRY): 33.5 percentage points; Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN): 6.0 percentage points; Saudi Riyal (SAR): 4.25 percentage points; Bulgarian Lew (BGN): 5.22 percentage points; Hong Kong Dollar (HKD): 5.25 percentage points; Brazilian Real (BRL): 10.52 percentage points. The individual sensitivities are then aggregated to become one profit or loss related sensitivity in €.\n\nChanges in market interest rates of interest rate derivatives which are not part of a hedging relationship pursuant to IFRS 9 affect the other financial result and are therefore included in the profit or loss related sensitivities. The maximum variability is taken to be a parallel shift of the interest rate curve by 169 basis points over a period of twelve months.\n\nBased on the portfolios and the structure of the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023 and the assumptions made, the profit or loss-related sensitivity is €13.3 million in the event of an increase (decrease) in the market interest rate (previous year: €8.6 million). This means that the financial result could hypothetically have increased (decreased) by €13.3 million. This hypothetical effect on the result would have resulted from the potential effects of interest rate derivatives of €0.9 million (previous year: €1.0 million) and an increase (decrease) in the interest result from primary floating-rate net financial positions of €14.2 million (previous year: €7.6 million).\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Interest sensitivity on the financial result (169 basis points)**\n\n|                   | Interest sensitivity in €<br>million | Thereof from derivative financial instruments | Thereof from primary financial instruments |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2023 | -13.3                                | 0.9                                           | -14.2                                      |\n| December 31, 2022 | 8.6                                  | 1.0                                           | 7.6                                        |\n\nThe equity-related sensitivity is €32.4 million (previous year: €39.7 million). By applying the assumptions made, an increase (decrease) in interest rates would have resulted in an increase (decrease) in shareholders' equity of €32.4 million.\n\nAssuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve of 150 basis points (previous year: 107 basis points) over a twelve-month period in the current interest rate environment gives the following results-oriented interest sensitivity:\n\n#### **Interest sensitivity on the financial result in the current interest rate environ-**\n\n| ment              |                                      |                                                         |                                               |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                   | Interest sensitivity in €<br>million | Thereof from deriva-<br>tive financial instru-<br>ments | Thereof from primary<br>financial instruments |\n| December 31, 2023 | -13.4                                | 0.8                                                     | -14.2                                         |\n| December 31, 2022 | 8.2                                  | 0.6                                                     | 7.6                                           |\n\nThe equity-related sensitivity for 150 basis points (previous year: 107 basis points) is –€3.6 million (previous year: –€25.1 million). By applying the assumptions made, an increase (decrease) in interest rates would have resulted in an increase (decrease) in shareholders' equity of –€3.6 million.\n\n#### **Capital management**\n\nThe Group's objectives with a view to capital management are ensuring the company's continued existence and a sustained increase in the company's value. As a capital market-oriented company with continuing capital expenditure requirements, Fraport monitors the development of its financial debt using ratios that relate EBITDA to net financial debt and/or interest expense and also very closely monitors developments in the various financing markets.\n\nThe components of the control indicators are defined as follows:\n\n#### **Components of the control indicators**\n\n| Net financial debt | Current financial liabilities<br>+ Non-current financial liabilities                                    |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | – Liquid funds                                                                                          |\n|                    | – Current realizable assets in \"other financial assets\" and \"other receivables<br>and financial assets\" |\n| EBITDA             | Operating result + depreciation and amortization                                                        |\n| Interest expense   | Interest expense                                                                                        |\n\nThe financial ratios developed as follows in the period under review:\n\n#### **Financial debt ratios**\n\n| Key figures             | Corridor     | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Net Debt/EBITDA         | Max. 5 x     | 6.4               | 6.9               |\n| EBITDA/interest expense | Min. 3 – 4 x | 3.8               | 3.3               |\n\nDue to the unforeseeable extent of the coronavirus pandemic, it was temporarily not possible to comply with the ranges and thresholds shown in relation to the financial debt ratios during this period. With the onset of economic recovery in the 2023 fiscal year, an improvement was achieved in both financial debt ratios compared to the previous year and at least the EBITDA/interest\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nexpense financial debt ratio remains within the target range. It is expected that the net debt/EBITDA ratio will also approach the target value of a maximum of five again in the future due to the expected improvement in Group EBITDA.\n\nOn the basis of a financial institution license, Fraport Malta Business Ltd. finances both companies controlled by Fraport AG and joint ventures and associated companies in the Group. There are minimum capital requirements due to regulatory requirements in connection with the existing financial institution license. In particular, with regard to lending to companies in which Fraport AG directly or indirectly only holds a minority interest, special minimum capital requirements in relation to the amount lent complied with by the company as at the balance sheet date are to be observed per loan. The minimum capital requirements were consistently met during fiscal year 2023. Capital management is performed by the company taking account of the regulatory conditions set by the EU and the Maltese financial supervisory authority.\n\n# **48 Related Party Disclosures**\n\n### **Relationships with related parties and the State of Hesse**\n\nAlongside the Group companies included in the consolidated financial statements, in the context of the course of ordinary business operations, the Group is also related to parties that are not included as well as associated companies and joint ventures, which are parties related to the Group according to IAS 24. Thus, Fraport AG has numerous business relationships with the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt and their majority-owned investments. Fraport AG is a dependent public-sector company due to the 31.31% (2022: 31.31%) stake held by the State of Hesse and the 20.92% (2022: 20.92%) stake held by Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, as well as the consortium agreement concluded between these shareholders on April 18/23, 2001, amended on December 2, 2014. The voting rights of the City of Frankfurt are held indirectly via its subsidiary Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH. Related companies and authorities with which major business relationships are maintained include Mainova AG and its subsidiaries.\n\nAll transactions with related parties have been concluded under conditions customary in the market as with unrelated third parties. The services rendered to authorities are generally based on cost prices. The following table shows the scope of the respective business relationships:\n\n| € million                    |      |                | Majority shareholders                              |  | Joint Ventures | Associated<br>companies | Companies con<br>trolled and signifi<br>cantly influenced<br>by majority<br>shareholders |\n|------------------------------|------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|--|----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                              |      | State of Hesse | Stadtwerke<br>Frankfurt am<br>Main Holding<br>GmbH |  |                |                         |                                                                                          |\n|                              | 2023 | 2.8            | 0.2                                                |  | 122.4          | 2.8                     | 18.3                                                                                     |\n| Revenue                      | 2022 | 0.9            | 0.2                                                |  | 98.7           | 4.9                     | 19.6                                                                                     |\n|                              | 2023 | 1.7            | 8.4                                                |  | 81.1           | 17.1                    | 118.4                                                                                    |\n| Purchased goods and services | 2022 | 1.7            | 7.5                                                |  | 6.5            | 14.5                    | 80.8                                                                                     |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 2.1            | 0.1                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n| Interest                     | 2022 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 0.8            | 0.1                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 15.9           | 0.0                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n| Accounts receivable          | 2022 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 10.5           | 0.5                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 46.7           | 0.1                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n| Loans                        | 2022 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 27.7           | 0.0                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 11.2           | 2.5                     | 8.9                                                                                      |\n| Liabilities                  | 2022 | 0.1            | 0.0                                                |  | 37.4           | 2.5                     | 4.7                                                                                      |\n\n**Relationships with related parties and the State of Hesse**\n\nRegarding contingent liabilities and other financial obligations to joint ventures, please refer to note 45 and note 46.

This permit does not expire at any specific time and was last amended by the decision of October 29, 2012 based on the outcome of the planning approval notice for the expansion of the airport, in particular regarding Runway Northwest, taking into account the relevant ruling of the German Federal Administrative High Court.\n\nThe right to operate the airport is linked to various obligations that are specified in the permit. According to this, Fraport AG is required, among other things, to keep the airport in good operating condition at all times, to provide and maintain the equipment and signs needed to monitor and control air traffic at the airport, and to guarantee the availability of fire prevention and protection systems that take account of the special operating conditions. The restrictions on night flight traffic that were initially imposed in 1971 and subsequently updated have been tightened by the aforementioned amendment and extension to the permit. Also daytime operational restrictions on aircraft for civil aviation purposes at Frankfurt Main Airport that do not comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) noise protection regulations have been further tightened. Furthermore, there are statutory\n\n{220}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nrequirements for passive noise abatement and outdoor living area compensation as a result of the construction work for the airport expansion around Runway Northwest.\n\nThe company charges airlines that fly to Frankfurt Airport what are known as \"traffic charges\" for provision of the transport infrastructure. These traffic charges are broken down into airport charges that require approval and other charges that do not require approval.\n\n- The airport charges that require approval according to Section 19b of the German Air Traffic Law (LuftVG) are divided into takeoff and landing charges, including noise components and emission charges, parking charges, and passenger and security charges, as well as charges for the financing of passive noise abatement measures (noise surcharges) as of July 1, 2012. The responsible approving authority for Frankfurt Airport is the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing (HMWEVW). The amount of the charges is specified in a related charge table and is published in the Air Transport Bulletin (NfL).\n- From January 1, 2023, there was an average increase in airport charges of 4.9% and a further spread in noise-related charges. In addition, the charge table included an incentive program \"Recovery Program FRA 2023\" for airlines, with the aim of promoting a rapid recovery of passenger volumes at Frankfurt Airport following the pandemic-related slumps.\n- On January 1, 2024, a new charge table entered into effect, which provides for an average increase in airport charges of 9.5%. In addition, the noise assessment bases were redefined in the 2024 schedule of charges, louder noise categories were significantly burdened and further incentives for quieter flying were created.\n- Airport charges accounted for 35.21% (previous year: 34.76%) of Fraport AG's revenue in the year under review.\n- The remaining charges not subject to approval are classified as charges for central ground service infrastructure facilities and ground service charges. In accordance with EU regulations, ground services on the apron were opened up to competition on November 1, 1999 (opened up in practice on April 15, 2000), by issuing a permit to another third-party ground handling company along with Fraport AG. The services in the area of central ground service infrastructure facilities continue to be excluded from competition (monopoly sector) and are completely segregated from the ground services when they are offset with the airlines. Of Fraport AG's revenue in 2023, 14.83% was generated by ground services (previous year: 16.22%) and 13.57% by infrastructure charges (previous year: 13.35%).\n\nAbove and beyond the traffic charges, Fraport AG generates revenue essentially from revenue-based payments, renting and parking, and security services. The proceeds from these operations which do not require approval accounted for 36.39% (previous year: 35.67%) of Fraport AG's entire revenue in the year under review.\n\n### **Fraport Twin Star Airport Management AD**\n\nFraport Twin Star Airport Management AD (operator) and the Republic of Bulgaria (grantor), represented by its Minister of Transport, signed a concession agreement on September 10, 2006, for the operation and management of the Bulgarian airports in Varna and Burgas on the Black Sea. On October 18, 2022, it was decided to extend the concession by five years until November 2046. The extension is accompanied by an additional investment obligation of €10 million.\n\nAccording to the concession agreement, the operator is obligated to render various airport services and to improve services in line with international standards, national laws, and the provisions stipulated in the concession agreement. Moreover, the operator has capital expenditure obligations of unspecified amounts for the expansion and a capacity increase of the airports in Varna and Burgas and to maintain the assets ceded for use. In addition, the operator pays an annual concession fee of 19.2% of total revenue, at least 19.2% of BGN57 million (€29.1 million), adjusted for the development of the national inflation rate, to the grantor.\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe operator paid an additional non-recurring concession fee in the amount of €3.0 million to the grantor after the agreement was signed. In return, the operator receives the right to use the existing and future infrastructure for airport operations and the right to generate revenues, in particular through airport charges (passenger, landing, and parking fees), and for ground handling services. Airport charges are regulated by the grantor.\n\nThe term of the concession agreement began on November 10, 2006 and will be 40 years after the extension decided in 2022. There are no further options for extension.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nAt the end of the concession term, the infrastructure pursuant to the contract that is essential for airport operations must be returned to the grantor in proper operating condition without receiving any consideration in return.\n\n### **Lima Airport Partners S.R.L. (LAP)**\n\nOn February 14, 2001, LAP (operator) and the Peruvian government (grantor) signed the concession agreement for Jorge Chavez International Airport on the operation, expansion, maintenance, and use of the Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima (Peru).\n\nThe term of the concession agreement was extended in 2017 from 30 to 40 years, until 2041. There is also an option to extend it by an additional ten-year period, to end in 2051. By concluding the amendments, the land required for the airport expansion was handed over to the company, and in return it is obliged to invest in the airport infrastructure. As part of the expansion project, the construction measures for the for airside expansion of the airport have now been completed. The second runway and the air traffic control tower started operations in April 2023. The construction of the new passenger terminal continues to progress. It is scheduled to open at the end of 2024. For the construction of the passenger terminal, LAP commissioned a construction consortium which, as the general contractor, takes on the EPC services (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) customary in the industry, which include all planning, procurement and construction measures. Due to the size and complexity of the project, various risks are associated with the expansion program. For further details, please refer to the opportunity and risk reporting in the combined management report.\n\nIn addition to the capital expenditure, the company has additional obligations in connection with the operation and maintenance of airport infrastructure.\n\nThe operator is obligated to pay concession fees. The concession fee is the higher of two amounts: either the contractually fixed minimum payment (basic payment of US\\$15 million per year, adjusted by US CPI) or 46.511% of total revenue after deduction and transfer to Corpac (Aviation Regulatory Authority) of 50% of landing charges and 20% of the international passenger charges (TUUA). In addition, a regulatory charge of 1% of the same assessment basis is payable. In return, the operator receives the right to use the existing and future infrastructure for airport operations and the right to generate revenue, in particular through airport charges (passenger, landing, and parking fees), and for ground handling and other services. Airport charges are regulated by the grantor.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nAt the end of the contract term, the infrastructure pursuant to the contract that is essential for airport operations must be returned to the grantor by the operator in the contractually defined operational condition. The operator has the right to have the residual carrying amount of said infrastructure reimbursed by the grantor for a limited period of time. This does not apply if the concession agreement is terminated early.\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n### **Fraport Regional Airports of Greece**\n\nThe two concession agreements, each for the operation of seven Greek regional airports, were signed between Fraport AG and its Greek consortium partner with the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF) on December 14, 2015. After fulfilling all conditions precedent, the take-over of the operating business of the 14 Greek regional airports took place on April 11, 2017. The initial term of each concession agreement is 40 years. At the end of the 40-year concession term, the term can be extended once for a further 10 years by mutual agreement.\n\nIn return for the right to operate the Greek airports, an initial one-time fee of €1,234 million was paid. Initial annual minimum concession payments of €11.3 million per annum for Fraport Greece A and €11.6 million per annum for Fraport Greece B were agreed over the term of the concessions. The minimum concession payments will be adjusted for inflation. In addition, from the beginning of the concession an additional levy of approximately €1 per departing passenger is payable to the grantor for the entire term. According to the concession agreement, from 2021 a variable concession fee of 28.2% of the EBITDA of Fraport Greece A and 28.9% of the EBITDA of Fraport Greece B will also be charged.\n\nFurthermore, the consortium partners are obliged to invest in measures to upgrade and expand the airport infrastructure. The construction work was completed in April 2021, as agreed in the concession agreement. In addition, additional capital expenditure for the maintenance of the airports and transport-related capacity expansions will be made in subsequent years.\n\nIn return, the operator is entitled to charge fees for its services, in particular state-regulated airport charges (passenger, landing, and parking fees) as well as other non-regulated levies related to air traffic and other services.\n\nFollowing the completion of the construction work under the 40-year concession, the charges at the remaining three airports Kos, Santorini, and Thessaloniki were also raised in April 2021 to an average of €18.50 per departing passenger plus local inflation developments, as agreed in the concession agreement.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nAt the end of the concession term, the operator must return the airports to the grantor, including any capital expenditures made, in a defined and proper operating condition. There will be no consideration given in return.\n\n#### **Fraport Brasil Aeroporto de Fortaleza and Fraport Brasil Aeroporto de Porto Alegre**\n\nThe Fraport Group and the Brazilian Government signed concession agreements on July 28, 2017 for the operation and further development of the Brazilian airports of Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. After paying the initial one-off fees, adjusted for inflation, of BRL291.8 million (€73.5 million) for Porto Alegre and BRL426.9 million (€107.5 million) for Fortaleza as well as fulfilling other conditions precedent, the term of the concession agreements of 30 years for Fortaleza Airport and of 25 years for Porto Alegre Airport started at the end of August 2017. In addition, a one-off extension for a further five years is possible under certain conditions. The Fraport Group took over operations of both airports on January 2, 2018.\n\nIn addition to the paid initial concession fees, additional acquisition costs of approximately €54.2 million were incurred by the Fraport Group within the scope of acquiring the concession.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned payments, additional fixed minimum concession payments plus inflation-related adjustments in the initial amount of BRL9.4 million for Fortaleza Airport must be made from 2023. For Porto Alegre Airport, an agreement was reached with the authorities in the 2022 fiscal year for the early payment of the entire fixed minimum concession payments in the amount of BRL37.6 million (around €6.7 million). The payment was already made in December 2022. Also, a variable concession payment of 5% of revenue is payable annually. An agreement was again reached with the competent authorities to compensate for the effects associated with the coronavirus pandemic for fiscal year 2023. The resulting reimbursement claim amounted to €18.6 million (previous year: €18.5 million). The existing reimbursement claims will be offset against variable and fixed concession payments due in subsequent years, as well as a temporary increase in airport charges.\n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, the concession agreements stipulate investment obligations for the modernization and expansion of the current airport infrastructure as well as construction of new airport infrastructure. The major infrastructure measures planned at both airports were completed with the inauguration of the extended runway in Porto Alegre in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe companies also laid out other contractually defined standards and obligations relating to the operation, availability, use, and maintenance of the airports.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nIn return for the right to operate the two airports, the operator is entitled to charge fees for its services, in particular state-regulated airport charges (passenger, landing and parking fees) as well as other non-regulated levies related to air traffic and other services.\n\nAt the end of the concession term, the operator must return the airport infrastructure to the grantor in a condition that guarantees the proper continued operation of the airports. There will be no consideration given in return.\n\n# **50 Events after the balance sheet date**\n\nAt the end of January 2024, Fraport Greece entered into an agreement with the Greek government regarding compensation for the negative economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the second half of fiscal year 2021. The agreement will have a positive effect on Group EBITDA 2024 of around €28 million.\n\n# **51 Exemption pursuant to Section 264 (3) of the HGB**\n\nThe following German subsidiaries fully claim the exemptions under Section 264 (3) of the HGB for the 2023 fiscal year:\n\n- AirIT Services GmbH\n- Airport Assekuranz Vermittlungs-GmbH\n- Airport Cater Service GmbH\n- Fraport Ausbau Süd GmbH\n- Fraport Brasil Holding GmbH\n- Fraport Casa GmbH\n- Fraport Passenger Services GmbH\n- FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH\n- FraSec Services GmbH\n- FRA Vorfeldkontrolle GmbH\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe following German subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries claim the exemptions under Section 264 (3) of the HGB for the 2023 fiscal year regarding the provisions of the First Subsection (annual financial statements of the corporation and management report) and the Fourth Subsection (disclosure):\n\n- Fraport Facility Services GmbH\n- Fraport Ground Services GmbH (formerly: FraGround Fraport Ground Handling Professionals GmbH)\n- FraSec Flughafensicherheit GmbH\n\n# **52 Information on Investments pursuant to the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG)**\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, Fraport AG received the following notifications pursuant to Section 33 and Section 34 WpHG:\n\nATLAS Infrastructure Partners Ltd., London, United Kingdom of Great Britain informed us on February 3, 2023, in accordance with Sections 33 and 34 of the WpHG, that its voting rights in Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, exceeded the threshold of 3% of voting rights on January 31, 2023 and on that day amounted to 3.08% (2,843,684 voting rights).\n\nFirst Maven Pty Ltd., Melbourne, Australia informed us on October 16, 2023, in accordance with Sections 33 and 34 of the WpHG, that its voting rights in Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, exceeded the threshold of 3% of voting rights on October 6, 2023 and on that day amounted to 3.10% (2,863,143 voting rights).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the shareholder structure of Fraport AG was as follows:\n\nThe combined voting rights of the State of Hesse and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH in Fraport AG pursuant to Section 34 (2) of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) amounted to 52.23 % as at December 31, 2023.

In the meantime, 700 glass elements have already been installed as part of the facade work. Inside the construction site, numerous technical installations are being carried out. The central \"marketplace\" also continues to take shape every day. Thanks to a specially developed ceiling construction made of bent aluminum tubes, this marketplace is becoming a special highlight. The opening of the new terminal is planned for the start of the summer flight schedule of 2026.\n\n# *Further Information*\n\n- *238* [Responsibility Statement](#page-237-0)\n- *239* [Independent Auditor´s Report](#page-238-0)\n- *247* [Independent Practitioner´s Report](#page-246-0)\n- *250* [Ten-Year Overview](#page-249-0)\n- *252* [Glossary](#page-251-0)\n- *255* [Financial Calendar 2024](#page-254-0)\n- *255* [Traffic Calendar 2024](#page-254-0)\n- *255* [Imprint](#page-254-0)\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>*Further Information*\n\n# *Responsibility Statement*\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the asset, financial, and earnings position and profit or loss of the Group.

In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the parent and the group of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have neither audited the content of the non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b German Commercial Code (HGB) included in the combined management report, nor of the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB, which is made reference to in the section \"Combined corporate governance statement\" of the combined management report. Furthermore, we have neither audited the disclosures extraneous to management reports marked as unaudited included in the sub-section \"Disclosures on the central internal control system\" in the section \"Risks and opportunities\" nor have we audited any information provided on Company websites not referenced as legally provided by means of making cross-references in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e Abs. (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does neither cover the content of the statements mentioned above, nor the afore-mentioned disclosures extraneous to management reports marked as unaudited and any information made reference to by means of cross-references not provided for by law.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinions**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services \n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nprohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n#### **Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn the following, we present the recoverability of investments in airport operating projects and property, plant and equipment, which we have determined to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\n- a) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements)\n- b) auditor's response\n\n#### **Recoverability of investments in airport operating projects and property, plant and equipment**\n\na) The consolidated financial statements of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, disclose the item \"investments in airport operating projects\" under long-term financial assets totalling mEUR 4,146.8 (prior year: mEUR 3,769.1) as well as \"property, plant and equipment\" of mEUR 8,951.5 (prior year: mEUR 8,371.8). Together, these items account for 69.3% of total assets (prior year: 69.0%). Investments in airport operating projects include airport concessions allowing the respective airport operator to charge fees to users of the airport infrastructure over a term contractually agreed upon. In return, the Company, as the concessionaire, commits to provide expansion services as well as to operating the airport. Of property, plant and equipment, 95.9% are allotted to the airport infrastructure of Fraport AG (prior year: 95.2%). The assessments of recoverability of concessions and of property, plant and equipment are done by implication via the assessment of recoverability of the cash-generating unit the assets have been assigned to. In doing so, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is compared to the corresponding recoverable amount. The present values of the cash-generating units are being determined by means of the discounted cash flow method derived from the expected cash flows based on the medium-term planning for the years from 2024 to 2029. The executive directors' planning for the cashgenerating units of this site on an aggregated level from 2029 to 2035 and subsequently were continued with assumptions on long-term growth rates due to the long-term investment intention at the site in Frankfurt am Main/Germany. In case of cash-generating units with fixed-term airport concessions, the planning period corresponds to the residual term of the concession agreement. The planning is influenced by expectations on future market development and assumptions on the development of macro-economic parameters. Discounting to the present value is affected by means of the weighted average cost of capital derived from the discount rate of the respective cash-generating unit.\n\nAs soon as for the identification of indications for impairment, the recoverability of the cash-generating unit is assessed by means of an annually updated cash flow model, which takes into account additional blanket risk factors in the discounting rate. Should this initial assessment result in a need for impairment, the indicative impairment test is customised to the circumstances of the cash-generating unit in order to be able to determine a more exact need for impairment.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, no impairments resulting from impairment tests regarding the investments in airport operating projects or property, plant and equipment were recognised. The result of this measurement is subject to the executive directors' assessment regarding the existence of indications for probable impairment, regarding future cash flows of the cashgenerating units, regarding the discount rate used, regarding the growth rate as well as regarding further judgement-based assumptions and thus are prone to uncertainties. Therefore and due to the underlying complexity of the calculations, these matters were of particular significant in the scope of our audit.\n\nThe executive directors' disclosures regarding the measurement of investments in airport operating projects and of property, plant and equipment are included in sections 4, 10, 18 and 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\nb) Within the scope of our audit, we gained an understanding of the methodical approach for impairment tests carried out for investments in airport operating projects as well as for property, plant and equipment. In this respect, we have examined the underlying processes and audited identified audit-relevant controls as regards the appropriateness of their design and implementation.\n\nBased on this, we selected and critically assessed the discounted cash flow model used by means of materiality considerations as well as taking into account risk aspects in order to evaluate whether impairments arose. We compared the future cash flows used for the calculation with the resolved planning for the Group and the Company and critically assessed them as regards their appropriateness by reconciling them with general and industry-specific market expectations. In doing so, we critically assessed the assumptions made and the data used, and evaluated to what extent the processes and the data used in this respect could be affected by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors. In case adjustments were made to the planning for the purpose of impairment tests with not immaterial effects, we discussed the adjustments made with the responsible parties and critically assessed the calculations as well as their contents. During the scope of our audit, we – involving specialists – gained a detailed understanding of the measurement parameters affecting the discount rate, particularly by means of reconciling them with market data due to the high sensitivity of the measurement regarding the discount rate used. Furthermore, we have assessed the sensitivity analyses prepared by the Company and in case of cash-generating units with little headroom additionally conducted our own sensitivity analyses. We have examined the completeness of necessary disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for cash-generating units for which a change of an assumption considered possible would lead to a recoverable amount below the carrying amount.\n\n#### **Other Information**\n\nThe executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprise\n\n- the report of the supervisory board,\n- the remuneration report in accordance with Section 162 AktG referenced in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report,\n- the combined non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b HGB included in the combined management report,\n- the corporate governance statement pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d HGB, to which reference is made in the group management report,\n- disclosures extraneous to management reports included in the combined management report, which were marked as unaudited,\n- any information on Company websites to which reference is made in cross-references not legally provided for in the combined management report,\n- the executive directors' confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB, and\n- all other parts of the annual report, which is expected to be presented to us after the date of this independent auditor's report,\n- but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor's report thereon.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the statement according to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) concerning the German Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the corporate governance statement and for the remuneration report to which reference is made in the combined management report. Otherwise the executive directors are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report**\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n# **Other legal and regulatory requirements**\n\n### **Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report Prepared for Publication Pursuant to Section 317 (3A) HGB**\n\n#### **Audit Opinion**\n\nWe have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance whether the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report (hereinafter referred to as \"ESEF documents\") prepared for publication, contained in the file, which has the SHA-256 value d6b98d1ff29bf97fbd5622a86f7dcf3e1de059d70b109b4ae205975af468c63b, meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Further Information**\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinion**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the electronic reproductions of the consolidated and the combined management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB on the basis of the IDW Auditing Standard: Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AuS 410 (06.2022)). Our responsibilites in this context are further described in the \"Group Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm has applied the requirement of the IDW Quality Management Standards.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents**\n\nThe executive directors of the parent are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents based on the electronic files of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the parent are responsible for such internal controls that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n#### **Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit on the ESEF Documents**\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.\n- evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.\n\n### **Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation**\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the general meeting on 23 May 2023 and subsequently we were engaged orally and in writing on 19 December 2023 / 11 January 2024. We have been the group auditor of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, since the financial year 2023.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this

Fraport Group EBITDA exceeded the 2019 figure for the first time in the 3rd quarter, despite lower passenger volume at the Frankfurt site. With growth rates above the 2019 level, Fraport Greece remained at the top of the Group sites. The number of passengers in Antalya was also above the pre-crisis sommerreisewelle level.\n\n*Online version:*  [wwww.annual-report.fraport.com](http://www.annual-report.fraport.com)\n\n# 1st QUARTER\n\n- Positive traffic development\n- Two strike days in Frankfurt only slightly dampened development\n- Intensive preparations for the summer travel wave\n\n## *Lima Airport: Takeover of apron control*  with German Air Traffic Control\n\nThe operation of apron control at Lima Airport was awarded to the subsidiary of Deutsche Flugsicherung DFS Aviation Services (DFS). Following the commissioning of the new terminal at the end of 2024, apron control will be managed using state-of-the-art camera technology for the first time in South America. This is an important milestone on the way to turning the Peruvian capital´s airport into one of the most modern hubs on the continent.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/14 description: The image shows an airport control tower. The tower is tall and cylindrical, with a large, glass-enclosed control room at the top. The control room has a green frame and is surrounded by a metal railing. The tower is located on an airport runway, and there are several buildings in the background. The sky is a light orange color, suggesting that the photo was taken at sunset or sunrise. The image is framed in a circle with a light purple background.\n\n2nd QUARTER\n\n# *Further Power Purchase Agreement concluded*\n\nA new Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the European energy provider Centrica Energy Trading A/S supplies the Frankfurt Airport hub with additional wind energy. The contract provides for the supply of a total annual wind power volume of around 63 gigawatt hours. This corresponds to an output of 22 megawatts. The energy comes from newly constructed onshore turbines near Bremerhaven. From July, four wind turbines will be operating there just for Fraport´s needs. The contract is set initially for five years.\n\n# New baggage drop-off machines *in Terminal 1*\n\nLufthansa Group passengers in Frankfurt can now use 21 state-of-the-art check-in counters inside the Terminal 1. With the automated bag drop function passengers can check in their baggage themselves. The new check-in counters provide passengers with a comfortable, modern and efficient travel experience. The use of state-of-theart technology optimizes the processes during baggage check-in.\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/20 description: The photograph shows a building under construction. The building has multiple floors and large windows. The exterior of the building is made of concrete and steel. There is construction equipment visible in the foreground. The sky is blue and clear.\n\n# *Half-time for airport expansion in Antalya*\n\nTogether with the joint venture partner TAV, Fraport is expanding the terminal areas at Antalya Airport with the long-term goal to double capacity. In addition the apron areas are being expanded and new parking spaces for several thousand vehicles are created. At the beginning of 2025, Fraport will take the first construction phase into operation.\n\n4th QUARTER\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/1 description: The image shows a close-up of a document with some text and a green check mark. The text is blurry and difficult to read, but it appears to be some kind of form or survey. The check mark is next to one of the options, indicating that it has been selected.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/2 description: The image shows an airport security checkpoint with several people in line. There are two women and one man in the foreground. The woman on the left is wearing a black jacket and standing behind a counter. The woman in the middle is wearing a gray shirt and blue jeans. The man on the right is wearing a black shirt and blue jeans. The security checkpoint has a white counter and a gray floor. The ceiling is white and has several lights.\n\n# *Takeover of aviation security*\n\nAt the turn of the year, Fraport took over control of the management of the aviation security checks at Frankfurt Airport. In addition to the takeover of the existing infrastructure of the Federal Police new control infrastructure was procured at the same time. This includes new CT scanners, which facilitate and speed up the passenger process.\n\n# *Rethinking the world of work*  at Fraport: Start for HRneo\n\nHRneo is the largest development program in Human resources in recent years. Its aim is to modernize the HR department and further increase Fraport´s attractiveness as an employer.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/7 description: The image shows five figures. The first figure is wearing a yellow vest and headphones and holding two orange batons. The second figure is standing behind a desk with a computer monitor on it. The third figure is standing. The fourth figure is wearing a yellow vest and holding a black briefcase. The fifth figure is wearing a baseball cap.\n\n- Start of the summer travel wave\n- For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic again more than 200,000 passengers in one day in Frankfurt\n- Regular operations in the first half of the year\n- Greek airports still clearly above traffic volume of 2019\n\n## *Second runway in Lima opened*\n\nWith the take-off of the first commercial flight on April 3, the new runway at Lima´s international airport \"Jorge Chávez\" International Airport in Lima and the new airport control tower were inaugurated. This makes Fraport´s airport the first in Peru to have two runways. The utilization of the new runway and the tower will be successively increased until they are fully operational with the completion of the new Terminal at the end of 2024.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/14 description: In a medium shot, a man in a neon yellow vest is standing on a tarmac, watching a Star Peru airplane take off. The man is facing away from the camera, and his head is turned to the right, as if he is watching the plane. The plane is white with red and blue accents, and it is taking off from a runway. The background is a clear blue sky.\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/15 description: In the image, a man and a woman are at an airport, checking in their luggage. The man is wearing a pink shirt and black pants, and he is putting his black suitcase on the conveyor belt. The woman is wearing a blue jacket and a long skirt, and she is putting her black suitcase on the conveyor belt as well. There are signs above the conveyor belts that say \"Lufthansa\".\n\n# 3rd QUARTER • Sustained high passenger demand\n\n- \n- Frankfurt at 82 percent of pre-crisis level\n- Thanks to the use of additional CT scanners improved waiting times for security\n- Antalya exceeds the 2019 level\n\n- Traffic volume in Frankfurt at around 14 million and thus only ten percent below pre-crisis level\n- International airports partly above pre-crisis level\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/23 description: An indoor shot shows a large American flag hanging in an airport. The airport has a high ceiling with gold-colored beams and a wall of windows. People are walking through the airport.\n\n# *Fraport USA wins center management concessions for two additional airports*\n\nFraport USA has successfully competed for the center management concessions at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The contract begins in January 2024 and has a term of ten years. On behalf of the local airport authority MWAA, Fraport USA will manage the retail and restaurant space at the two Washington airports and develop them further.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\nA particularly important milestone in improving operational performance in Frankfurt was **taking over** aviation security checks at the beginning of the fiscal year, in conjunction with using new CT scanners for the first time.

This also includes the procurement of the checkpoint infrastructure as well as testing new technology and optimizing processes in cooperation with the German Federal Police.\n\nAlso since the beginning of the year, state-of-the-art computer tomography scanners (CT scanners) have been in use at selected aviation security lanes. More of these devices are gradually being put into operation. For passengers, the process of going through the security checkpoint will be considerably simplified. At the new security checkpoints, liquids, smartphones and other electronic devices can remain in hand luggage. In addition, different materials and objects are reliably and quickly differentiated. This efficient technology significantly reduces waiting times at the checkpoints. Successes were already evident during the summer travel wave, with over 200,000 passengers per day.\n\nAn dieser neuen Kontrollspur können Sie\nalle elektronischen Geräte und Flüssigkeiten\nim Gepäck lassen.\n\nAt this new control lane you can leave all\nelectronic devices and liquids in your luggage.\n\n# *To Our Shareholders*\n\n- *07* [Letter from the CEO](#page-6-0)\n- *10* [The Fraport Executive Board](#page-9-0)\n- *12* [Report of the Supervisory Board](#page-11-0)\n- *19* [Joint Statement on Corporate](#page-18-0)  Governance\n- *34* [Share and Investor Relations](#page-33-0)\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>Fraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 1\n\n# *Letter from the CEO*\n\n*Letter from the CEO*\n\nDear Marcelobos,\n\nI am pleased to present our Annual Report for 2023.\n\nA challenging yet good fiscal year lies behind us.

With **ReFuelEU Aviation**, the European Union has adopted a new legal act that will make the European aviation market \"cleaner\" in the long term. The core concept of ReFuelEU Aviation is to enforce binding minimum thresholds for the use of sustainable aviation fuels, which will gradually increase from 2025 onwards.\n\nAt company level, we have rolled out our **decarbonization master plan** to our significant, fully consolidated company sites and have now created a Group-wide program of measures to achieve carbon freedom by 2045. In Frankfurt, I am delighted to report that you will see another \"visible\" sign of our sustainability activities by the end of the year: Runway West will have a 2.8-kilometerlong photovoltaic system running along it, which we submitted an application to build last year.\n\nYour company is celebrating another special event this year too: **100 years of air transport in Frankfurt**. Starting out as Südwestdeutsche Luftverkehrs-AG at the \"airfield\" in Rebstock, the Fraport you know today has grown into one of the world's leading international air traffic groups. You can track this evolution in our new photo book \"100 Jahre Flughafen-Geschichte in Frankfurt\" (100 Years of Airport History in Frankfurt), which was published at the start of the year. It is precisely this DNA that makes us unique and that we need more than ever today: \"develop together,\" \"don't stand still,\" or simply \"shape the future together.\" With our strategy **Fraport.2030**, we are rising to our challenges and focusing our responses on the strategic priorities of \"growth and sustainability,\" \"efficiency and innovation,\" and \"employer of choice\" – with the firm conviction that we will only achieve success in these areas if we work together. We believe that the various changes and challenges we are facing – take for example the catchwords **demographic change** and **artificial intelligence** – also offer exciting opportunities that we want to actively seize for the benefit of your company.\n\nWe are in a good position to achieve this: With the projects we have initiated such as Terminal 3, the modernization of Terminals 1 and 2 in Frankfurt, a multitude of development projects outside Germany, and **HRneo**, not to mention numerous innovation projects, we believe that we have taken the right steps to position your company successfully in the competitive market. Our new slogan **\"Connecting the world with tomorrow\"** clearly expresses our corporate mission: Fraport creates connections. We connect passengers and business models, we foster Group-wide and therefore international collaboration within our workforce, and we consistently focus on the future.\n\nThanks to this strategically attractive setup, the expected traffic growth, the projects being implemented, and the great dedication of our employees, we are confident that we will achieve the financial targets we have set with **Fraport.2030** too: **EBITDA of 2 billion Euros** and **free cash flow** of *Fraport creates connections.* **1 billion Euros in 2030**.\n\nWe are already taking steps in this direction in the current year: With EBITDA of between approximately 1.26 and 1.36 billion Euros, we expect to achieve a new **record result**. The Group result is also set to rise strongly to around 435 to 530 million Euros. In operational terms, we predict that Frankfurt will see passenger numbers grow to between around 61 and 65 million passengers. With the completion of the first phase of the Lima terminal construction, we are also getting closer to concluding our major expansion activities. The sizeable investment measures that are still ongoing, however, mean that we expect further significant negative free cash flow for 2024 until the investment volume declines from 2025 onwards.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nAs Fraport is particularly affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the same time continues to invest heavily in the expansion of its capacities, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board have **decided against proposing a dividend** for the past fiscal year to the 2024 Annual General Meeting and plan to allocate the profit earmarked for distribution to revenue reserves instead.\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 To Our Shareholders / Report of the Supervisory Board 3\n\nDear shareholders, your company is in an excellent position to cope with changing market conditions. We are pleased to have finally left the coronavirus pandemic behind after three years.

In the reporting year, this self-assessment was discussed in-depth at the Supervisory Board meeting held on December 14, 2023.\n\nFurther details on Corporate Governance and the wording of the current statement of compliance pursuant to Section 161 of the AktG, released by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on December 14, 2023, are provided in the \"Combined Statement on Corporate Governance\". The current and past statements of compliance can also always be found on the Group's website at www.fraport.com/en/investors/corporate-governance.html.\n\n#### **Conflicts of interest and their treatment**\n\nThere were no conflicts of interest for members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### **Audit of annual and consolidated financial statements as well as remuneration report**\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, audited the annual financial statements of Fraport AG and the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023, as well as the combined management report, and issued an unqualified auditor's report for each. The audit mandate was issued by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and by the Chairwoman of the finance and audit committee in accordance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 23, 2023.\n\nThe separate financial statements and the combined management report were prepared in accordance with the regulations of the HGB applicable to large capital companies and the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS as applicable in the EU. Furthermore, the German legal regulations to be applied in addition to Section 315e(1) of the HGB in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report were applied. The separate financial statements, consolidated financial statements, and the combined management report were audited by the auditor. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report meet the conditions for exemption from the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with German commercial law. According to the auditor, there is an early risk warning system in place that meets the legal requirements and which makes it possible to identify developments that could jeopardize the company as a going concern at an early stage.\n\nThe documents mentioned above and the proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of profit earmarked for distribution were sent to the Supervisory Board by the Executive Board without delay. The finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board examined these documents extensively and the Supervisory Board also reviewed them personally. The audit reports of Deloitte and the financial statements were available to all members of the Supervisory Board and were comprehensively dealt with in the accounting meeting of the Supervisory Board on March 15, 2024 in the presence of the auditor, who reported on the significant results of its audit and was available to respond to additional questions and provide further information. In the meeting, the chairwoman of the finance and audit committee provided a comprehensive report on the treatment of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements in the finance and audit committee. A focal point of this reporting were the key audit matters described in the auditor's report. The Supervisory Board approved the results of the annual audit. After the completion of the audit by the finance and audit committee and its own review, the Supervisory Board did not raise any objections. The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements prepared by the Executive Board; the annual financial statements were thus adopted.\n\nThe profit earmarked for distribution of Fraport AG amounted to €164,6 million in the past fiscal year. Considering the ongoing late impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on Fraport and the continued high capital expenditure, the Executive Board of Fraport AG proposed again to waive the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 fiscal year. After an in-depth assessment and, in particular, taking into account the interests of the Company and the shareholders, the Supervisory Board has endorsed this proposal.\n\nThe report prepared by the Executive Board on the relationships of Fraport AG with affiliated companies pursuant to Section 312 of the AktG (dependency report) for the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 was submitted to the Supervisory Board. The report concludes with the following statement of the Executive Board, which is also included in the combined management report:\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n\"The Executive Board declares that under the circumstances known to us at the time, Fraport AG received fair and adequate compensation for each and every legal transaction conducted. During the reporting year, measures were neither taken nor omitted at the request of or in the interests of the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt am Main and their affiliated companies.\"\n\nThe auditor reviewed the report on the relationships with affiliated companies and issued the following auditor's report:\n\n\"Based on our mandatory audit and the conclusions reached, we confirm that\n\n1. the effective disclosures made in the report are correct,\n\n2. the consideration paid by the company for the legal transactions referred to in the report was not unreasonably high.\"\n\nThe auditor participated in the discussions with the Supervisory Board on March 15, 2024 on the report regarding the relationships with affiliated companies and was available to the Supervisory Board to provide additional information. After the final result of the audit of the dependency report, no objections were made to the declaration of the Executive Board at the end of the report, which was also included in the combined management report. The outcome of the audit of the dependency report by the auditor was approved.\n\nDeloitte was also commissioned to review the content of the Remuneration Report of Fraport AG as at December 31, 2023 as prepared by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In addition to the formal examination required by law in accordance with Section 162(1) and (2) AktG, the content of the Remuneration Report was also reviewed. Based on the substantive audit, the auditor was able to form an opinion on this with reasonable assurance and confirmed in the context of the audit report that the Remuneration Report complies with the provisions of Section 162 AktG in all material respects. The audit report is attached to the Remuneration Report.\n\n#### **Audit of the non-financial statement**\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also responsible for auditing the content of the combined non-financial statement. As part of the preparation for this audit, the auditor Deloitte was commissioned to prepare a voluntary audit of the combined non-financial statement with limited assurance. The finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board examined the combined non-financial statement extensively and it was also reviewed by the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt the accounting meeting of the Supervisory Board on March 15, 2024, the auditor, in addition to the results of its audit of the financial reporting, also reported on the significant results of its audit of the combined non-financial statement and, in this regard, was available for additional questions and information.\n\nUltimately, it was determined that the combined non-financial statement is correct and complies with the requirements under German commercial law.\n\n#### **Personnel particulars**\n\nThe term of office of the current members of the Supervisory Board ended with the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on May 23, 2023.

The objective of the CMS is to ensure corporate management based on values and with integrity that goes beyond the mere fulfillment of standards.\n\nThe CMS of Fraport AG is based on and starts with a rolling compliance risk analysis (CRA), which includes the fight against corruption as one focus area.\n\nThe compliance system in place within the Fraport Group must differentiate between central and local levels. Every member of the Executive Board of Fraport AG is also responsible for the organization of compliance within the Fraport Group. It has assigned the Head of the Legal Affairs and Compliance central unit, who also serves as Chief Compliance Officer, to develop, organize, and operate the CMS of Fraport AG. The Group companies are obliged to set up a local CMS in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the relevant Group guidelines. Responsibility for the individual CMS within the Group lies with the local management of the respective Group company. The central CMS organization is responsible for the Group's requirements with regard to the minimum standards for the design of the local CMS and monitoring of compliance with those requirements. The finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board is informed at least once per year of the status of the CMS within Fraport AG and the Group by the Executive Board.\n\n#### **Responsible corporate governance**\n\nFraport is a community and partnership-oriented group. Fraport aims to remain competitive at all sites and in all operational units and thereby secure jobs with fair and just working conditions. Fraport offers good working conditions based on collective bargaining agreements, professional and personal development pathways, and a highly developed corporate ethic. The long-held objective of Fraport to offer all employees a high level of workplace security is a significant factor for the appeal of Fraport as an employer, especially in the current conditions of the labor market. Comprehensive, integrated occupational health and safety is also an important component of overall corporate responsibility at Fraport. Comprehensive protective measures have been taken at both the Frankfurt site and the Group airports.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Fraport Group is also committed to maintaining a sustainable, conserving, and preventive approach to natural resources and the environment. The topic of sustainability has been of particular significance for Fraport in recent years. The stated goal for Fraport AG and the Fraport Group is to be carbon-free by 2045 within scopes 1 (direct emissions) and 2 (indirect emissions). Ambitious milestones for CO<sup>2</sup> reductions on the path toward climate neutrality by 2045 were agreed for both Fraport AG and the Fraport Group with a view to achieving this goal. In 2022, a \"decarbonization master plan\" was adopted to enable Fraport to meet its sustainability goals. Starting with Fraport AG, the \"decarbonization master plan\" was successfully rolled out to all areas of the Fraport Group in the course of fiscal year 2023. Under the plan, the foreign equity holdings have defined measures for a carbon reduction path similar to the process at the Frankfurt site. A Decarbonization Board was created to ensure continuous monitoring of the implementation of the \"decarbonization master plan,\" which regularly reports to the Executive Board on the implementation status of the measures. Examples of the numerous concrete measures taken to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions include the establishment of a ground-mounted photovoltaic system next to the runway North-West, the increasing purchase of green electricity, and the expansion of the infrastructure for alternative drive systems of vehicles at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe Executive Board ensures that it takes account of sustainability-related goals in its resolutions concerning key corporate decisions. In addition to financial goals, the corporate strategy also includes ecological and social goals and reflects the basic understanding of Fraport of balanced corporate management. \"Growth and Sustainability\" is one of the three priorities of our company strategy (in addition to \"Efficiency and Innovation\" and \"Employer of choice\"). Using non-financial indicators, such as CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, which are measured as at December 31 and June 30, and employee satisfaction, which is determined every two years, the company measures the degree of target achievement. Corporate planning includes projects and measures aimed at achieving the financial and sustainability-related goals.\n\nLastly, Fraport AG is involved in community, cultural, and social initiatives by sponsoring associations and supporting volunteer activities.\n\nFurther corporate governance practices are publicly available on the Company's website at www.fraport.com.\n\n#### **Structure and functioning of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board**\n\nFor Fraport, a responsible and transparent corporate governance and monitoring framework is the cornerstone for creating value and trust. In accordance with the statutory provisions, Fraport AG is subject to a \"dual governance system,\" which is achieved by the strict separation of personnel in the management and monitoring bodies (two-tier board). The Executive Board manages Fraport AG, and the Supervisory Board monitors the Executive Board. The members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board work closely together in the interests of the company.\n\n#### **Executive Board**\n\nThe Executive Board of Fraport AG is comprised of the following five members: Dr. Stefan Schulte (Chair), Anke Giesen, Julia Kranenberg, Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm, and Prof. Dr. Matthias Zieschang.\n\nAs the management body, the Executive Board conducts the business of the company. It is bound by the company's interests and corporate sociopolitical principles within the framework of stock corporation law. In addition, its work is based on the \"Executive Board rules of procedure\", which have been approved by the Supervisory Board. The schedule of responsibilities for the Executive Board, which governs the allocation of responsibilities, is also attached to these rules of procedure as an annex.\n\nOn this basis, the Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board on all relevant matters of business development, corporate strategy, and possible risks in a regular, timely, and comprehensive manner. In addition, the Executive Board must have the prior approval of the Supervisory Board for certain material matters, particularly for capital expenditure and equity investment measures above a value of €10 million, to the extent that this is not provided for in a business plan approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe length of the appointment of the Executive Board members is geared toward the long term and has thus far been five years as standard. In deviation from this standard, the Supervisory Board in 2021 extended the appointment of Prof. Dr. Zieschang as a member of the Executive Board for a further three years and ten months until January 31, 2026, and in 2022 extended the appointment of Ms. Giesen for a further three years with effect from January 1, 2023. Ms. Kranenberg was appointed as a member of the Executive Board for a term of three years when she was first appointed in 2022 in accordance with recommendation B.3 of the GCGC. Furthermore, in its meeting on September 15, 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to extend the appointment of Dr. Schulte as a member of the Executive Board with effect from September 1, 2024 for an additional three years until \n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nAugust 31, 2027. Dr. Schulte's appointment would have ended on August 31, 2024. In the same meeting, the Supervisory Board decided to extend the appointment of Dr. Prümm as Executive Board member with effect from July 1, 2024 for a period of five further years until June 30, 2029. Dr. Prümm's appointment would have ended on June 30, 2024. In compliance with recommendation B.4 of the GCGC, the reappointments of Dr. Schulte and Dr. Prümm did not take place before one year of their current appointments had passed.\n\nThe age limit for members of the Executive Board has, in principle, been set at 65 by the Supervisory Board. In the case of Dr. Schulte, the Supervisory Board dealt in-depth with the age limit in its meeting on September 15, 2023 and decided, as an exception, to deviate from the fundamentally set age limit of 65 years in the (re)appointment of Dr. Schulte until August 31, 2027. Reasons for the (re)appointment of Dr. Schulte until August 31, 2027 and the deviation from the fundamentally set age limit of 65 years as an exception were the continuing expansions in Frankfurt, Lima, and Antalya for which the Supervisory Board regarded continuity in the office of the Chair of the Supervisory Board due to Dr. Schulte's many years of experience and his many years of departmental responsibility for these projects until 2027 as important and in the interests of the company.\n\nRemuneration of the Executive Board comprises fixed and performance-related components. The Remuneration Report for the 2023 fiscal year, the auditor's report as per Section 162 AktG, and the applicable remuneration system for the Executive Board are published at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/publications-events.html.\n\nThe Executive Board usually meets every week and constitutes a quorum if at least half of its members participate in the meeting. Resolutions are adopted by a simple majority of all the participating members of the Executive Board. In the case of a tied vote, the chair holds the casting vote.\n\nFurther information on the members of the Executive Board as well as their memberships to be disclosed in accordance with Section 285 (10) HGB and information on the respective areas of responsibility can be found in note 55 of the Group Notes as part of the 2023 Annual Report. CVs of the members of the Executive Board are available on the company's website under https://www.fraport.com/en/our-group/about-us/executive-board.html\n\n#### **Supervisory Board**\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Fraport AG supervises the activities of the Executive Board. It is composed of an equal number of shareholder and employee representatives and comprises 20 members as provided for in the company statutes. The ten shareholder representatives are elected by the Annual General Meeting, and the ten employee representatives are elected by the employees in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (MitbestG) for five years. The Supervisory Board has created rules of procedure, under which it has a quorum if \">– on the basis of a proper notice of meeting – at least half of its members participate in the voting in person or through submission of written votes. Resolutions are adopted with a simple majority unless otherwise mandated by law. In the event of a tied vote, the Chair of the Supervisory Board, who must be a shareholder representative, shall be entitled to a second vote. Beyond this, the rules of procedure provide for, in particular, the creation and powers of committees of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs a rule, the Supervisory Board meets four times a year. In 2023, the Supervisory Board held six meetings, one of which was a strategy meeting. The Supervisory Board meetings in 2023 were all held in-person, while individual members had the option of participating virtually.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly carries out a self-assessment of the effectiveness of its activities and the activities of its committees. The efficiency review is usually carried out alternately in a structured process with the help of external consultants (as in 2022) and by means of a self-assessment. In 2023, a self-assessment of the Supervisory Board was carried out using a questionnaire, which was discussed in detail at the Supervisory Board meeting on December 14, 2023. The focus of the discussion was on issues relating to the company strategy, the collaboration within the Supervisory Board, the committees, and with the Executive Board, the preparation and conduct of Supervisory Board meetings, the reporting and information system, and the topic of digitalization.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews its activities in the past fiscal year on an annual basis in the Supervisory Board report. The Supervisory Board report for the 2023 fiscal year can be found under \"To Our Shareholders\" in the 2023 Fraport Annual Report. The Remuneration Report for the 2023 fiscal year, the auditor's report as per Section 162 AktG, the applicable remuneration system for the Executive Board, and the most recent remuneration resolution as per Section 113(3) AktG are published at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/publications-events.html.\n\nIn 2023, elections were held for the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. At the time of publication of this combined statement on corporate governance, the Supervisory Board was composed as follows:\n\n#### **Composition of the Supervisory Board**\n\n| Representatives of the shareholders            | Representatives of the employees               |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Michael Boddenberg (Chair)                     | Mathias Venema (Vice Chair)                    |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 26.05.2020) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 01.07.2020) |\n| Dr. Bastian Bergerhoff                         | Devrim Arslan                                  |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 24.05.2022) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 31.05.2013) |\n| Kathrin Dahnke                                 | Karina Becker-Lienemann                        |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 23.05.2023) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 23.05.2023) |\n| Dr. Margarete Haase                            | Ines Born                                      |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 01.01.2011) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 19.07.2022) |\n| Harry Hohmeister                               | Hakan Bölükmese                                |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 23.05.2023) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 29.05.2018) |\n| Mike Josef                                     | Sidar Kaya                                     |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 23.05.2023) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 23.05.2023) |\n| Frank-Peter Kaufmann                           | Karin Knappe                                   |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 30.05.2014) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 08.06.2022) |\n| Lothar Klemm                                   | Felix Kreutel                                  |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 10.05.1999) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 23.05.2023) |\n| Sonja Wärntges                                 | Matthias Pöschko                               |\n| (Member of Supervisory Board since 16.10.2020) | (Member of Supervisory Board since 01.01.2021) |\n| Prof. Dr.-Ing.

|\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Nomination Committee did not meet in person in 2023 but passed its resolutions in two written circulation procedures.\n\n# **Shareholders and Annual General Meeting**\n\nThe shareholders of Fraport AG exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting where they exercise their right to a voice and a vote. The shareholders are informed of business developments in the past year and the company's forecasts included in the combined management report with sufficient time prior to the meeting. During the year, the shareholders are provided with comprehensive and timely information about current business developments through interim reports and other company publications on the company website.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting is held within the first eight months of every fiscal year and makes decisions concerning the tasks assigned to it by law, such as the appropriation of profits, election and approval of the actions of the members of the Supervisory Board and approval of the actions of the Executive Board, the selection of the auditor, amendments to the company statutes, Supervisory Board remuneration, approval of the remuneration system for Executive Board members, and other tasks. The shareholders can either exercise their right to vote in person or can authorize third parties to exercise their right to vote. Each share entitles its holder to one vote in the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with the company statutes, the Executive Board is authorized to provide for\n\n- the Annual General Meeting to be held without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies at the venue of the Annual General Meeting (virtual Annual General Meeting) – this authorization is limited in time and applies to Annual General Meetings held within three years of the commercial register entry made in June 2023 of this new provision in the company statutes created by the Annual General Meeting 2023 and can be extended or renewed (also several times) by a corresponding resolution of the Annual General Meeting;\n- shareholders to cast their votes in writing or by means of electronic communication (postal vote);\n- shareholders to participate in an Annual General Meeting that is not a virtual Annual General Meeting within the meaning of the company statutes without being present at the venue and without a proxy and to exercise all or some of their rights in whole or in part by means of electronic communication (online participation).\n\nThe Annual General Meeting 2023 was held as a virtual Annual General Meeting in accordance with Section 118a AktG without the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies, thereby making use of the (transitional) provisions of Section 26n (1) of the Introductory Act to the German Stock Corporation Act (Einführungsgesetz zum Aktiengesetz). Duly registered shareholders and their proxies were able to follow the entire 2023 Annual General Meeting by video and audio transmission via the passwordprotected AGM portal accessible on the Internet and to exercise their voting rights and other shareholder rights via the AGM portal. This meant that duly registered shareholders and their proxies were able to exercise their right to speak and obtain information at the 2023 Annual General Meeting via video communication for the first time. The virtual Annual General Meeting 2023 was thus largely aligned with the format of an in-person Annual General Meeting in terms of content and the protection of shareholder rights. In addition, shareholders who duly registered for the 2023 Annual General Meeting or their authorized representatives had the opportunity to submit statements in advance in text form or as a video message.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Defining targets for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board, Executive Board, and the two levels below the Executive Board**\n\nAccording to the German Stock Corporation Act, Fraport AG, as a listed company to which the German Co-Determination Act applies and whose Executive Board consists of more than three persons, must have at least one woman and at least one man as a member of the Executive Board (minimum participation requirement). Fraport AG complied with this requirement during the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nThe targets for the proportion of women at the two management levels below the Executive Board as well as the deadlines for reaching these targets must be determined based on this law.\n\nIt is not necessary to set targets for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board at Fraport AG because that board is already subject to a fixed gender quota in accordance with Section 96(2) of the AktG.\n\n#### **Targets for the Executive Board**\n\nIf the above-mentioned minimum participation requirement applies to the Executive Board, the obligation to set a target figure for the participation of women on the Executive Board is waived in accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act. The Supervisory Board set a target of 25% of women on the Fraport AG Executive Board at its meeting of September 18, 2015, and this target remained even after the obligation to set targets for the Executive Board had been eliminated. Since Julia Kranenberg's joining the Executive Board of Fraport AG on November 1, 2022, the percentage of women on the Executive Board of Fraport AG is 40%.\n\n#### **Targets for the first and second management levels below the Executive Board**\n\nThe Executive Board sets the targets for the proportion of women at the two levels below the Executive Board in accordance with Section 76(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act and Principle 3 of the GCGC.\n\nThe Executive Board set a target for Fraport AG of 31.8% of women in the first management level below the Executive Board (\"direct reports\" to the Executive Board) and a target of 30.9% of women in the subordinate management level (\"direct reports\" to the first management level under the Executive Board) for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026. Regarding the Group as a whole, the Executive Board also set a target of 30.8% of women in the first management level below the Executive Board (\"direct reports\" to the Executive Board) and a target of 30.2% of women in the subordinate management level (\"direct reports\" to the first management level under the Executive Board) for the same period.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, the actual proportion of women in the first management level at Fraport AG was 23.8%, and 31.8% in the second management level. As at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, the actual proportion of women in the first management level within the Group was 24.4%, and 33.9% in the second management level.\n\n#### **Gender ratio on the Supervisory Board**\n\nIn accordance with Section 96 (2) AktG (Principle 11 of the GCGC), where members are newly elected and posted to the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG, the statutory gender ratio must be met, with a minimum of 30% women and 30% men on the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has decided that these ratios are to be met separately by the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. This requirement was met as part of the new elections of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting on May 23, 2023. The election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board in 2023 was based on corresponding resolutions by the nomination committee.\n\nIn the election of employee representatives by the delegates' assembly in May 2023, only two people were elected to the Supervisory Board as female employee representatives, which means that the minimum percentage of 30% women on the employee representative side, which must be met separately, was not met. As provided for in the German Co-Determination Act, in order to meet the gender ratio, the election of the male candidate on the employee representative side who received the lowest maximum number of votes in the respective ballot according to the order of the maximum numbers of candidates was therefore declared invalid. On the application of the Fraport AG Executive Board, the district court Frankfurt am Main subsequently appointed Ms. Ines Born (from the ver.di trade union) to the Supervisory Board of the company as employee representative until the beginning of the next regular period of office for the elected representatives of the employees by means of a resolution passed on August 4, 2023.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board; diversity concept for the Supervisory Board and Executive Board as well as the succession planning for the Executive Board**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, the Supervisory Board adopted a new requirements profile for the members of the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG, which stipulates, among other things, that the Supervisory Board as a whole should have adequate expertise with regard to sustainability issues of importance to Fraport, as well as sustainability reporting.\n\nThe targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board and the competence profile for the overall board (including the diversity concept) are as follows:\n\n\"The objective is that the Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that it ensures the competent control and support of the company's Executive Board by the Supervisory Board. It should be taken into account that the Supervisory Board as a collective body has the overall knowledge, skills, and professional experience required to properly perform its tasks. It cannot be expected that each individual member of the Supervisory Board possesses the required knowledge and experience to the fullest extent; however, there should be at least one competent member of the Board for each aspect of the Supervisory Board's activities to ensure that the Board's members together represent a comprehensive range of knowledge and experience. This should include an understanding of the relevant market environment, financial, and commercial experience, and a strong regional connection.\n\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board should be expected to have a certain level of essential general knowledge and experience that is appropriate to the nature, extent and complexity of the business activities, and the risk structure of an internationally operating company such as Fraport AG.\n\nIn order to comply with the standard age limit set by the Supervisory Board of 72 years at the time of election or re-election, which may be deviated from in justified individual cases provided there are no doubts as to the suitability of the persons proposed and their election appears expedient in the interests of the Company despite exceeding the age limit and the targets set by the Supervisory Board of a proportion of generally at least 30% of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board being no more than 62 years old at the time of their election, candidates should be proposed who, by virtue of their integrity, willingness to perform, availability, and personality, are able to perform the duties of a Supervisory Board member in an internationally operating company and to maintain the public image of Fraport AG. The principles of diversity and the proportion of women and men based on the statutory provisions should be taken into account when nominating candidates for the Board. In addition, the Supervisory Board should have at least three independent members.\"\n\nThe previous strict age limit of 72 years at the time of (re)election was therefore made more flexible by amending the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 13, 2023. Accordingly, the maximum age limit for Supervisory Board members is generally 72 years at the time of election or reelection. This age limit may be deviated from in justified individual cases, provided there are no doubts about the suitability of the proposed persons. The requirements profile for Supervisory Board members, which was revised in 2023, also stipulates that the Supervisory Board must have at least three independent members. To ensure a balanced mix of experience and new talent on the Supervisory Board, at least 30% of the shareholder representatives should not be older than 62 at the time of election or reelection.\n\nIn the election of shareholder representatives by the Annual General Meeting 2023, Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann were older than 72 years at the time of reelection. The Supervisory Board discussed this fact at its meeting on March 13, 2023 and proposed the election of Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann for a term of two years with the required majority, while a term of five years was proposed to the Annual General Meeting for the other candidates. The reasons given for the deviation from the standard age limit as an exception in the cases of Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann were that Mr. Klemm, as the Chair of the investment and capital expenditure committee, should assist with the construction of Terminal 3 and the expansion of the airport in Lima and Antalya as important infrastructure projects in this critical phase for another two years due to his many years of experience, and that Mr. Kaufmann is highly committed to advancing the important issues of climate protection and decarbonization. The 2023 Annual General Meeting agreed to the election proposal and reelected Mr. Klemm and Mr. Kaufmann to the Supervisory Board for a two-year term of office as an exception to the general age limit of 72 years at the time of reelection. As the term of office of two members of the Supervisory Board therefore differs from that of the other Supervisory Board members, this also paves the way for the gradual formation of a Supervisory Board with staggered terms of office for Supervisory Board members (\"staggered board\") for the future.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs regards the statutory gender ratio of at least 30% women and at least 30% men on the Supervisory Board, most recently in 2022, the Supervisory Board decided that this ratio is to be met separately for the members representing the shareholders and those representing the employees. In line with this objective, the Supervisory Board consists of four female and six male shareholder representatives as well as three female and seven male employee representatives (see above under \"Gender ratio on the Supervisory Board\").\n\nAccording to Section 100(5) AktG, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have accounting expertise and at least one further member must have expertise in the auditing of accounts. According to recommendation D.3 of the GCGC, the expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of account auditing shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Recommendation D.3 of the GCGC goes on to state that accounting and account auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance. The Chair of the audit committee shall have appropriate expertise in at least one of these two areas.\n\nWith Supervisory Board members Dr. Margarete Haase, who is Chair of the finance and audit committee, and Ms. Sonja Wärntges, two members of the Supervisory Board and the finance and audit committee possess the expertise in accounting and account auditing required by Section 100(5) of the AktG. In addition, Ms. Dahnke also has expert knowledge in the area of accounting as defined in Section 100 (5) AktG and in the area of auditing as defined in Section 100 (5) AktG.\n\nDr. Haase has completed a degree in business administration at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, where she also obtained her doctorate. She has also completed the Executive Education Program at Harvard Business School in Boston. During her professional career, Dr. Haase has been responsible for numerous roles, which marks her as an expert in the fields of accounting and account auditing. She has held positions that include Head of Controlling, Division Manager for Group Planning and Control, Commercial Director and Director Corporate Audit, and was also a member of the Executive Board for companies belonging to the Daimler Group. Dr. Haase was a member of the Executive Board for Corporate Finance, Human Resources and Investor Relations at Deutz AG, Cologne until April 2018. Since February 2016, Dr. Haase has been a member of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nMs. Wärntges completed degrees in economics at the Technical University of Braunschweig and the University of Hanover, from where she obtained a master's degree in business economics. Ms. Wärntges worked for several years at leading auditing and tax consulting companies and has been Chief Financial Officer of BRANICKS GROUP AG (formerly DIC Asset AG) since 2013, additionally assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer in 2017. In this role, Ms. Wärntges' areas of responsibility include Environmental, Social and Governance and sustainability issues, as well as the sustainability report, which BRANICKS GROUP AG (formerly DIC Asset AG) has been issuing since 2011.\n\nMs. Dahnke holds a degree in business administration of the Georg August University in Göttingen. She headed the finance department at Beiersdorf AG, held the position of Director of Finance and member of the Management Board for Finance and Controlling at DMG Mori Seiki Aktiengesellschaft (formerly GILDEMEISTER AG) and was CFO at both OSRAM Licht AG and Ottobock SE & Co KGaA.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Fraport AG thus meets the requirements of stock corporation law with regard to the requirement of Supervisory Board members with expertise in the areas of accounting and account auditing.\n\nFor shareholders, the Supervisory Board should include what they consider to be an appropriate number of independent members; the ownership structure should be taken into account (see Recommendation C.6 of the GCGC). The Supervisory Board decided that the board should include at least three independent shareholder representatives.\n\nThe above-mentioned objectives and recommendations were and are met in that, with Dr. Margarete Haase, Ms. Kathrin Dahnke, Prof. Dr. Ing. Katja Windt and Ms. Sonja Wärntges, the Supervisory Board consisted of four shareholder representatives who were independent of the company, its Executive Board, and the controlling shareholders (the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt) in the reporting year. In the election of the shareholder representatives, five – and therefore in line with the requirements profile for members of the Supervisory Board, more than 30% of the candidates standing for election on the shareholder side – were not older than 62 years of age.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, Fraport AG also complies with recommendations C.7 and C.9 of the GCGC, according to which more than half of the shareholder representatives must be independent of the company and the Executive Board and at least two of the shareholder representatives must be independent of the controlling shareholder. According to recommendation C.7 of the GCGC, when assessing the independence of Supervisory Board members by the company and the Executive Board, it should be taken into account, among other things, whether the Supervisory Board member has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years.\n\nIn the view of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, despite having been a member of the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG for more than 12 years (member since January 1, 2011), Dr. Haase is regarded as independent of the company and the Executive Board. Due to her personality, her integrity, and her professionalism, combined with many years of various professional activities with management responsibility outside of Fraport, there are no doubts with regard to her independence in respect of Fraport AG and the Executive Board. Through her work as a member of the Supervisory Board and Chair of the finance and audit committee, Dr. Haase demonstrates that she has the necessary critical distance from the company and its Executive Board when carrying out her work on the Supervisory Board at Fraport AG. Due to her stature and independence, she openly holds discussions with the Executive Board and understands how to critically scrutinize proposals. Furthermore, Dr. Haase is also a member of the Supervisory Board of Marquard & Bahls AG and Chair of the Supervisory Board of ams OSRAM AG, which emphasizes her independence of Fraport AG and its Executive Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has no former members of the Executive Board of Fraport AG.\n\nThe Supervisory Board, along with the Executive Board and based on the preparatory work by the executive committee, ensures the long-term succession planning of the Executive Board. In addition to the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act and the GCGC, long-term succession planning takes into account the target set by the Supervisory Board for the proportion of women on the Executive Board as well as other diversity criteria. Taking into account the specific qualification requirements, the structure of the Executive Board, including the division of portfolios, and the aforementioned personnel criteria, the executive committee develops an ideal profile on the basis of which it draws up a shortlist of eligible candidates. Structured discussions are held with these candidates. A recommendation for a resolution is then submitted to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also takes diversity into account regarding the composition of the Executive Board (Recommendation B.1 of the GCGC). Given the identified qualifications of its members, the Supervisory Board does not yet pursue a diversity concept for the Executive Board.\n\nThe status of the implementation of the requirements profile for members of the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG is outlined in the following qualification matrix. The general requirements for members of the Supervisory Board of Fraport are met by all members of the Supervisory Board. These include a general understanding of the aviation industry, in particular the market environment of an airport operator, the individual business fields, customer requirements, the regions in which Fraport AG operates, and the strategic orientation of the company and the Group as a whole. All of the members of the Supervisory Board are therefore familiar with the sector in which Fraport AG operates.\n\nThe following table contains further details on the current members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Qualification matrix: Shareholder representatives**\n\n|

remuneration system as well as the disclosures on the remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the 2023 fiscal year can be found in the Remuneration Report. The Remuneration Report was subject to a formal and substantive audit by the auditor Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. The Remuneration Report is published as a separate document at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/publications-events.html.\n\n#### **Acquisition or disposal of company shares (directors' dealings)**\n\nPursuant to Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), board members and other managers (directors) and persons closely related thereto are legally obliged to disclose the acquisition or disposal of shares of Fraport AG or any financial instruments related thereto, if the value of the transactions undertaken exceeds the sum of €20,000 within one calendar year. The notifications in this respect are immediately disclosed by Fraport AG.\n\n#### **Shareholdings of the bodies**\n\nThe total shareholdings of all members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board amount to less than 1% of the total number of shares issued by Fraport AG.\n\n#### **Risk and opportunity management**\n\nFor Fraport, corporate governance also means handling corporate risks and opportunities responsibly. For this reason, Fraport has introduced a comprehensive Group-wide risk and opportunity management system. The structure of the risk and opportunity management system and a report on key risks and corporate opportunities are presented in detail by the Executive Board in the combined management report for the fiscal year. Depending on their importance for the company, changes to key risks or significant opportunities opening up during the year are published either in an ad hoc disclosure or as part of the financial reporting during the year.\n\nThe Internal Audit System (IAS) and the Risk Management System (RMS) are implemented by means of guidelines within the Fraport Group. The measures required in order to meet the sustainability-related corporate goals are also subjected to an (ongoing) deviation analysis within the Risk Management System.\n\nThe processes, risks and audits within the IAS are reviewed and updated annually by way of adequacy checks. The effectiveness of the IAS is checked by means of an annual control self-assessment performed by the control officer and approved by the process owner (dual verification principle). The results of the control self-assessment are presented annually in the finance and audit committee. The IAS and the further development of the RMS are audited by the internal audit team.\n\nThe early risk recognition system is also part of the auditor's annual audit. The effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system, the internal auditing system, and the audit of accounts is monitored by the Supervisory Board. At Fraport, the finance and audit committee of the Fraport AG Supervisory Board performs this task in accordance with Section 107(3) of the AktG.\n\n#### **Accounting and audit of accounts**\n\nFraport prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union, and the additional applicable requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e(1) of the HGB. A combined management report is prepared in accordance with Section 315(5) of the HGB. The annual financial statements of Fraport AG are prepared in accordance with the HGB. Further information on the accounting principles is available in the notes to the respective financial statements. The annual and consolidated financial statements are published within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe annual and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report of Fraport are audited by an auditor in accordance with Section 316 of the HGB. On the basis of the AGM's resolution, in the 2023 fiscal year this was Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main (hereinafter referred to as Deloitte), who audited Fraport for the first time after the change of auditor in the 2023 fiscal year. Prior to the submission of the nomination, the Supervisory Board and its audit committee obtained a declaration of independence from Deloitte. The audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report was carried out in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014,\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nhereinafter referred to as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). It was agreed with the auditor that the latter would immediately inform the Fraport AG Supervisory Board of any possible grounds for disqualification or bias arising during the audit, provided that these were not remedied immediately. The auditor shall also immediately report on all findings and incidents arising during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report which are significant for the tasks of the Supervisory Board. In addition, the auditor must inform the Supervisory Board and record in the audit report if it finds facts that reveal an inaccuracy in the statement of compliance submitted by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with Section 161 of the AktG while performing the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report.\n\nDuring the year, the auditor also participated in meetings with the finance and audit committee regarding the Group interim financial statements, and meetings with the Fraport AG Supervisory Board regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements. In accordance with Recommendation D.10 of the GCGC, the finance and audit committee discussed with the auditor the audit risk assessment, the audit strategy and audit planning, and the audit results. The Chair of the audit committee, Dr. Haase, regularly discussed the progress of the audit with the auditor and reported to the committee on this. The finance and audit committee consults with the external auditors on a regular basis also without the Executive Board.\n\n#### **Disclosure of the joint statement on corporate governance and corporate governance report**\n\nThe Executive Board published the combined statement on corporate governance on March 15, 2024 at https://www.fraport.com/en/investors/corporate-governance.html.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>*Share and Investor Relations*\n\n# **Share performance 2023**\n\nThe key topics of the 2023 trading year were global inflation development, along with key interest rate decisions and expectations about how interest rates will develop in the future. Continuing geopolitical crises, such as the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, and new crises such as an escalation in the war between Israel and Islamist Hamas have also affected the stock exchanges. In the first quarter, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States, and the necessary rescue of Credit Suisse Bank by UBS Bank led to additional stock market volatility.\n\nIn this environment characterized by uncertainty, the German leading share index DAX rose by 20.3%, offsetting the losses of the previous year. At 16,752 points, the index closed close to its record high, which was reached in December 2023 at 16,794 points. The index for medium-sized stocks MDAX also grew last year. With growth of 8.0% to around 27,137 points, the MDAX could not completely make up the losses of the previous year however and remained clearly below its record high from 2021.\n\nAfter the noticeable losses in the 2022 fiscal year, the Fraport share recovered noticeably in 2023 and achieved clear growth of 43.9% with a year-end closing price of €54.76. The Fraport share already recorded a clear increase in the first quarter of the year. Buoyed by the prospect of possible key interest rate cuts, the share developed rapidly in January and achieved an increase of more than 36% at the end of the month compared to the closing price of the previous year. However, the Fraport shares lost some of their performance in March in connection with the regional banking crisis in the United States, triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Nevertheless, the shares ended the first quarter with a clear gain (+21.7%) at a price of €46.31. With growth of 5.5% to €48.86 and a further increase to €50.24 (+2.8%), the Fraport share also reported share price developments that were overall positive in quarters two and three of the fiscal year. The escalation in the war between Israel and Islamist Hamas led to a considerable price setback at the start of the fourth quarter. On October 20, at €44.64 the Fraport share recorded a reduction of more than 11% compared to the closing price of the third quarter. The hope of possible key interest rate cuts subsequently led to clear price gains. At €56.80, the shares reached their highest price of the year on December 14, before closing the trading year not much lower at a price of €54.76. The fourth quarter thus saw an increase of 13.1%.\n\nThe market capitalization of Fraport shares, including strategic shareholders not included in the free float, amounted to around €5.1 billion at the end of the year (previous year: €3.5 billion). After deducting the strategic shareholdings of the State of Hesse, the City of Frankfurt, Deutsche Lufthansa, and the treasury shares, the index-relevant market capitalization amounted to almost €2.0 billion (previous year: €1.4 billion). The share was thus, based on market capitalization, the 31st largest stock among the 50 MDAX shares. With an average of 149,982 shares traded daily, the trading volume in 2023 was much lower than the previous year's volume of 202,994.\n\n#### **Fraport share**\n\n|                                                             | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2016    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Opening price in €                                          | 38.05   | 59.18   | 49.36   | 75.78   | 62.46   | 91.86   | 56.17   | 58.94   |\n| Closing price in €                                          | 54.76   | 38.05   | 59.18   | 49.36   | 75.78   | 62.46   | 91.86   | 56.17   |\n| Change in €                                                 | +16.71  | -21.13  | +9.82   | -26.42  | +13.32  | -29.40  | +35.69  | -2.77   |\n| Change in %                                                 | +43.9   | -35.7   | +19.9   | -34.9   | +21.3   | -32.0   | +63.5   | -4.7    |\n| Highest price in € (daily closing price)                    | 56.80   | 67.62   | 68.30   | 75.50   | 78.68   | 96.94   | 91.86   | 58.94   |\n| Lowest price in € (daily closing price)                     | 38.05   | 36.20   | 43.12   | 30.01   | 61.44   | 61.56   | 55.26   | 45.25   |\n| Average price in € (daily closing prices)                   | 49.10   | 48.08   | 55.58   | 44.52   | 73.20   | 79.18   | 74.12   | 51.77   |\n| Average trading volume per day (number)                     | 149,680 | 202,994 | 256,728 | 398,143 | 128,953 | 160,367 | 173,015 | 173,666 |\n| Market capitalization in € million (year-end closing price) | 5,064   | 3,518   | 5,472   | 4,564   | 7,007   | 5,776   | 8,494   | 5,192   |\n\nThe shares of other listed European airports performed as follows in 2023:\n\nAENA +39.9 %, Aéroports de Paris -6.4 %, Flughafen Wien +57.3 % and Flughafen Zürich +22.7 %.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Report\n\n*[To Our Shareholders](#page-5-0)* Fraport Annual Report 2023 [Combined Management Report](#page-39-0) [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) Combined M[anagement Report](#page-144-0) / S[ituation of the Group](#page-236-0) Group Notes Further Information 27\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **2023 development of the Fraport share compared to the market and European competitors**\n\nImage /page/34/Figure/6 description: This line graph compares the 2023 development of the Fraport share to the market and European competitors.

Shares below 3% are classified under \"free float.\"\n\nThe majority of the approximately 92.5 million shares were held by German regional and local authorities (52.23%). With a share of 31.31%, the State of Hesse was the largest shareholder in the company, while the City of Frankfurt/Main held 20.92% of the shares. The voting rights owned by the City of Frankfurt are held indirectly via the Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH subsidiary. Deutsche Lufthansa AG held a share of 8.44%, or over 7.8 million no-par-value shares, making it the third largest individual shareholder of Fraport AG. Other shareholders that exceeded the statutory threshold of 3% of the outstanding Fraport shares were First Maven Pty (3.10%) and ATLAS Infrastructure Partners (UK) Ltd., whose respective portfolios are managed in Australia.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nImage /page/36/Figure/5 description: This image is a pie chart showing the allocation of free float in percentage.

Before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, this was a dividend of approximately 40 % to 60 % of the profit attributable to shareholders of Fraport AG. In addition, a second principle of the Executive Board regarding the dividend per share was to keep the dividend at least stable compared to the previous year.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Investor Relations (IR)**\n\nConsistent, timely, and transparent communication with investors and analysts is a top priority for IR work at Fraport AG. The IR team maintains face-to-face and virtual contact with existing and potential investors as part of roadshows, capital market conferences, or regular meetings, including at the company headquarters at Frankfurt Airport. Over the past fiscal year, targeted individual and Group meetings again took place as well as presentations with the company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe central themes of the meetings in 2023 were passenger development and forecasts at the Group airports, the impact of rising interest rates, and the progress in construction of the substantial capital expenditure in Frankfurt and Lima. In this context, the medium-term development of the free cash flow was also a returning point of discussion. Focus was also put on the strategy of the international business as well as possible expansions or reductions in the portfolio.\n\nThroughout the year, the IR team was available by phone (+49 69 690-74840) or by email (investor.relations@fraport.de) for direct dialog. The telephone conferences for analysts on the financial publications, the virtual AGM in May 2023, and the provision of up-to-date information on the IR website at <www.meet-ir.com> rounded off the range of IR services in the past fiscal year.\n\n#### **Data relevant to the capital market**\n\n|                                                     |                 | 2023       | 2022       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                     |                 |            |            |\n| Share capital Fraport AG1)                          | € million       | 924.7      | 924.7      |\n| Total number of shares as at December 31            | Number          | 92,468,704 | 92,468,704 |\n| Number of floating shares as at December 312)       | Number          | 92,391,339 | 92,391,339 |\n| Number of floating shares (weighted annual average) | Number          | 92,391,339 | 92,391,339 |\n| Absolute share of capital stock                     | per share, in € | 10.00      | 10.00      |\n| Annual performance (including dividend)             | in %            | +43.9      | –35.7      |\n| Beta relative to the MDAX                           |                 | 1.03       | 0.99       |\n| Earnings per share (basic)                          | in €            | 4.26       | 1.43       |\n| Earnings per share (diluted)                        | in €            | 4.26       | 1.43       |\n| Price-earnings ratio                                |                 | 12.9       | 26.6       |\n| Dividend per share3)                                | in €            | 0.00       | 0.00       |\n| Profit earmarked for distribution                   | € million       | 0.00       | 0.00       |\n| Dividend yield as at December 313)                  | in %            | –          | –          |\n\n| ISIN                                 | DE 000 577 330 3                                        |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Security identification number (WKN) | 577 330                                                 |\n| Reuters ticker code                  | FRAG.DE                                                 |\n| Bloomberg ticker code                | FRA GF                                                  |\n| Selected indexes                     | MDAX, FTSE4Good Index, Deutschland Ethik 30 Aktienindex |\n\n1) Including treasury shares.\n\n2) Total number of shares as at the balance sheet date, less treasury shares.\n\n3) In relation to the proposed dividend (2023).\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Report\n\n*[To Our Shareholders](#page-5-0)* [Combined Management Report](#page-39-0) [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) [Group Notes](#page-144-0) [Further Information](#page-236-0)\n\nFurther Information\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>*HR neo*\n\nHRneo is the largest development program in HR in recent years.

The main site of the Group is Frankfurt Airport, one of the most important passenger and cargo airports in the world, in respect of which the Group's parent company, Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (abbreviated: Fraport AG), has an operating permit with no time limit. Beyond the Frankfurt site, the Group operates on four continents, mainly on the basis of concession agreements at international airports. The main sites outside Frankfurt, which are designated as \"investments in airport operating projects,\" include 14 airports in Greece, Lima Airport in Peru, and two airports in Brazil – Porto Alegre and Fortaleza, as well as Antalya Airport in Turkey (see also the \"Key sites\" chapter).\n\nAs an airport operator, Fraport provides a wide range of operational and administrative services for airport and terminal operations. Within the framework of the concession agreements, the scope of the services offered varies from contractually binding construction and expansion activities, administration and control of airport processes, to the management of retail areas. In addition to the services provided, the concession models differ in terms of their term and the structure of the concession fees to be paid. The Fraport Group also offers planning and consulting services as well as IT services and facility management. Fraport aims to ensure that customers are the focus of all its company services. This applies both at the home site in Frankfurt and at the international Group sites. Fraport considers itself to be a learning organization that uses its know-how in a targeted and profitable way worldwide.\n\nThe Group generates the majority of its revenue and earnings from the passenger and freight business at each of its sites. Apart from passengers, its main customers include airlines, tenants of office and retail space, authorities and freight forwarders. Fraport primarily levies charges for the use of the airport infrastructure, generates income from the development of commercial areas, and offers additional operational services. Fraport reports the main revenue streams resulting from this as \"airport charges,\" \"infrastructure charges,\" \"ground services\" and \"security services,\" \"retail,\" \"real estate\" and \"parking.\" In the area of airport concessions, revenue from \"construction and expansion services in accordance with IFRIC 12\" are also reported. In its reporting, Fraport distinguishes between the following four segments:\n\n- **Aviation** holistic management of the terminal facilities and passenger processes at Frankfurt Airport.\n- **Retail & Real Estate** development and renting of space at the airport and in the area near the airport in Frankfurt. This primarily includes the retail business, building and space leasing as well as parking management.\n- **Ground Handling** ground services such as loading, baggage and passenger services as well as the operation of the central infrastructure and baggage transfer system at Frankfurt Airport.\n- **International Activities & Services** international marketing of the Group's expertise and airport operations as well as bundling central services in Frankfurt.\n\nFraport's business model creates value by participating in the international demand for air travel and flows of goods. Fraport is pursuing a clear growth strategy that also takes into consideration environmental and social concerns (see also the \"Strategy\" chapter). In addition to the broad portfolio of airport investments, which focuses on both business travel demand and local tourism offerings, the employees form the basis of the company's success. Together with its partners, Fraport is consistently developing the Group sites and achieving a broad revenue and earnings base.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/41/Figure/0 description: The image shows a diagram of Fraport's value generation chain. The diagram is divided into three main sections: Input, Output, and Value Generation. The Input section lists the resources that Fraport uses to generate value, such as airport infrastructure, financial resources, know-how, human resources, services and performance, and environmental resources. The Output section lists the benefits that Fraport provides to its stakeholders, such as connectivity, mobility, growth driver for the region, airport as a workplace, airport infrastructure, satisfied customers, know-how & innovation, profitability & dividends, and climate protection. The Value Generation section shows the activities that Fraport performs to transform its inputs into outputs, such as airport security, strategy, IT & Digitalization, supporting functions, purchasing, finance, parking, advertising, real estate management, concessions for retail & food & beverage, terminal operations, security checks, passenger & freight handling, airside operations, international airport management & consulting, governance and compliance, infrastructure development, facility management, communications, and human resources.\n\n### **External influences**\n\nThe main external factors influencing the business model of Fraport include disruptive events, such as extreme weather conditions or pandemics, in addition to economic, (socio-)political, and regulatory factors. The influencing factors can both positively and negatively affect passenger and freight demand as well as the range of aircraft movements and passenger capacity at Group airports. At the same time, they can influence the purchasing behavior of passengers and thus the economic situation of the Fraport Group as a whole (see also the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter).\n\n**Economic growth** and **globalization** generally favor the demand for air travel and freight transport. At the same time, economic prosperity and a globally growing middle class tend to lead to a higher number of air journeys. High **inflation rates** potentially reduce disposable income and can have a negative impact on business development. **Exchange rates** also affect the appeal of tourist destinations, travel and freight flows, and passengers' booking behavior as well as their buying behavior in the retail area. Exchange rates also play an important role in the financial contribution of individual foreign Group companies, whose functional currencies are converted into the currency of the Group, the euro.\n\n**Price fluctuations on commodity markets**, especially for crude oil and therefore jet fuel, also have an influence on air traffic and can have both a positive and negative impact on air traffic demand.\n\n**Politics** affect air traffic at the regional, national, and international levels. Operating restrictions, such as night flight bans and noise control measures, as well as travel restrictions and taxes, can have a negative impact on airline offerings. This may also affect passenger and cargo volume at the affected sites and may contribute to the development of other airports. **Environmental policy** in particular can affect air traffic. A further political influencing factor is the possible **liberalization of air traffic rights**. This\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nmay result in the opening of new markets for air traffic or the expansion of already existing markets. By contrast, sanctions or tightly specified air traffic agreements lead to the closure of markets.\n\n**Geopolitical crises** are leading to increasing global political and economic instability. They can influence air traffic development in many ways.\n\nFraport monitors various early warning indicators to identify trends in travel or freight flows at an early stage, and to derive appropriate countermeasures if necessary.\n\n# **Structure**\n\n#### **No material changes compared with the previous year**\n\nAfter FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fraport AG, transferred 26% of the shares in FraSec Aviation Security GmbH, formerly FraSec Luftsicherheit GmbH, to the Dr. Sasse Group in the 2022 fiscal year, FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH transferred a further 25% of the capital shares as at January 1, 2023. As a result of the transfer, FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH now holds 49% of the capital shares in FraSec Aviation Security GmbH, which has since been included as a joint venture in the Fraport Group.\n\nAs part of a transfer agreement, the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community (BMI) has transferred responsibility for the organization, financing, control and implementation of aviation security checks at Frankfurt Airport to Fraport AG effective January 1, 2023. Fraport also assumes responsibility for procuring security equipment at Frankfurt Airport and for calculating and levying aviation security charges from the airlines. In future, the aviation security checks will be carried out at the Frankfurt site by specialist personnel on behalf of Fraport AG, under the supervision of the German Federal Police.\n\nIn September 2023, the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG decided to extend the contract with Dr. Stefan Schulte, Chairman of the Executive Board of Fraport AG, for an additional three years until August 31, 2027 with effect as of September 1, 2024. In addition, the Supervisory Board extended the contract with Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm, Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Aviation and Infrastructure, for an additional five years until July 31, 2029 with effect as of August 1, 2024.\n\nBeyond that, no fundamental changes were made to the legal and organizational Group structure in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### **Legal structure of the Group**\n\nAs the parent company of the Fraport Group, Fraport AG directly or indirectly holds the shares in the other Group companies and has its registered office in Frankfurt am Main. As at December 31, 2023 there were 56 consolidated companies excluding companies accounted for using the equity method, and 78 companies including companies accounted for using the equity method (in the previous year: 55 and 76 companies, respectively). For a detailed overview of the shareholdings within the Group, please see Group notes, note 57.\n\n#### **Organizational Group structure**\n\nAs a management body, the Executive Board bears the strategic and operational responsibility for the Group. At the time of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Executive Board consisted of the five members Dr. Stefan Schulte (Chair), Anke Giesen (Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Retail & Real Estate), Julia Kranenberg (Labor Relations Director), Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm (Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Aviation and Infrastructure), and Prof. Matthias Zieschang (Member of the Executive Board and Executive Director Controlling and Finance).\n\nFor the purpose of managing the Group, the Executive Board has divided the business activities into four segments: \"Aviation\", \"Retail & Real Estate\", \"Ground Handling\", which are largely active at the Frankfurt site, as well as \"International Activities & Services\", which primarily includes the Group companies outside of Frankfurt. The segments encompass the strategic business units and service units of Fraport AG and include the Group companies involved in each of these business processes. The central units of Fraport AG in Frankfurt are responsible for Group-wide administrative services, among other things.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/4 description: The image shows a blue airplane icon inside a white square. The airplane is facing to the right.\n\nThe **Aviation segment** mainly operates the land and airside infrastructure at the Frankfurt site. It therefore includes both the area of airport charges, which is legally regulated in Germany, and relevant security services. The regulated airport charges consist of passenger, landing, and takeoff fees, security fees, and parking fees. The Aviation segment is responsible for ensuring safe, efficient, and customer-oriented processes in the flight operating areas and terminals as well as\n\nthe implementation of airport and air safety tasks in compliance with legal requirements.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/7 description: The image shows a blue square containing a house, a shirt, and a gift. The house is at the top, the shirt is on the left, and the gift is at the bottom.\n\nThe **Retail & Real Estate segment** is responsible in particular for the commercial development of the Frankfurt site, including the retail activities as well as real estate and land. Its activities extend from the management of buildings and facilities through to the management and development of the parking and retail areas and the renting of advertising\n\nspace. In addition to the stationary business at Frankfurt Airport, the focus is, among other things, on greater use of online retail offers and sales channels.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/10 description: The image shows a blue square with a white border. Inside the square is a blue briefcase with a handle on top. Below the briefcase are seven blue dots in a horizontal line.\n\nThe **Ground Handling segment** consists of loading, baggage, and passenger services, airmail and luggage transport, and freight handling at Frankfurt Airport. The segment is primarily responsible for the quality of Frankfurt Airport's role as a hub, characterized by transfer processes. The provision of the central infrastructure, in particular the baggage\n\ntransfer system, is also allocated to this segment.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/13 description: The image shows a blue logo inside a white square. The logo consists of a globe with an airplane flying over it. The airplane is positioned above the globe, with its wings spread out. The globe is represented by intersecting lines, creating a grid-like pattern. The entire logo is in a dark blue color.\n\nThe **International Activities & Services segment** includes in particular the acquisition, operation, development, and expansion of airports abroad. Consulting services, including in the \"Operational Readiness and Airport Transfer\" (ORAT) section, are additionally provided. The segment also includes Fraport AG service units that provide central services for\n\nthe Fraport Group.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the organizational structure of the Fraport Group was as follows:\n\n|  |  | Fraport Group structure |\n|--|--|-------------------------|\n|--|--|-------------------------|\n\n|                                                | Dr. Stefan Schulte

Regionally, there is competition for passengers and air freight with airports in the original catchment area. Internationally, Frankfurt Airport competes for domestic and international transfer passengers and transshipment freight on the basis of its function as an international transfer airport. The main customer at the Frankfurt site remains the Lufthansa Group, which maintained its share of more than 60% of passengers in Frankfurt in the 2023 fiscal year. The largest competitors for transfer passengers are primarily the hub airports London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, Istanbul, and Munich, which are in particular influenced by the global route networks of their resident main customers British Airways, Air France-KLM, Turkish Airlines, and Lufthansa Group. Due to the dynamic development of many airlines and airports from the Middle East, the Frankfurt site is also in intercontinental competition with these airports.\n\nIn particular, the expansion and modernization programs contribute to maintaining and improving the international competitive position. For example, the northward relocation of the security checks in Terminal 1 should lead to a much improved transfer process. Terminal 3 (\"Expansion South\") should also ensure the long-term landside capacities required to give the site a successful future-oriented competitive edge. The construction of Terminal 3 with Piers H and J, the road infrastructure, and parking garage are already well advanced. The roof of the main terminal building, for example, is fully installed, and the façade work, including glazing, is largely complete. Numerous technical installations are running inside the terminal. Pier G of Terminal 3 has been completed except for the installations that are only required for the start of operations. The opening of the new terminal is planned for the start of summer flight schedule in 2026.\n\nThe ranking of the top 10 airports in Europe, which has changed due to the crisis, is slowly returning to the pre-crisis structure (ranking according to ACI Europe; as of: February 2023). With 48.9 million passengers, Frankfurt Airport ranked sixth among the leading airports in terms of passengers in the reporting year. The Group airport Antalya (31.2 million passengers) ranked tenth. In Germany, Frankfurt Airport was the largest passenger airport, ahead of Munich with 31.6 million passengers in the same period. Based on its air freight turnover of approximately 1.9 million metric tons, Frankfurt has remained Europe's leading airport in the same period, ahead of Paris Charles de Gaulle. In Germany, Leipzig/Halle Airport was the next largest competitor, with 1.5 million metric tons of freight.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Competetive position in Europe**\n\n| Rank1) | 2023 | 2022 | 2019 | Airport         | Passengers | delta % | Rank1) | 2023 | 2022 | 2019 | Airport         | Air freight | delta % |\n|--------|------|------|------|-----------------|------------|---------|--------|------|------|------|-----------------|-------------|---------|\n|        | 1.   | 2.   | 1.   | LHR - London    | 79,183,190 | 28.5    |        | 1.   | 1.   | 1.   | FRA - Frankfurt | 1,828,091   | -5.0    |\n|        | 2.   | 1.   | 5.   | IST - Istanbul  | 75,899,236 | 18.1    |        | 2.   | 2.   | 2.   | CDG - Paris     | 1,814,952   | -1.8    |\n|        | 3.   | 3.   | 2.   | CDG - Paris     | 67,424,082 | 17.3    |        | 3.   | 5.   | 5.   | IST - Istanbul  | 1,516,396   | 6.3     |\n|        | 4.   | 4.   | 3.   | AMS - Amsterdam | 61,889,586 | 17.9    |        | 4.   | 6.   | 3.   | LHR - London    | 1,387,059   | 2.7     |\n|        | 5.   | 5.   | 6.   | MAD - Madrid    | 60,181,604 | 18.9    |        | 5.   | 4.   | 4.   | AMS - Amsterdam | 1,378,041   | -4.2    |\n|        | 6.   | 6.   | 4.   | FRA - Frankfurt | 59,355,389 | 21.3    |        | 6.   | 10.  | 11.  | MXP - Milan     | 665,655     | -7.0    |\n|        | 7.   | 7.   | 7.   | BCN - Barcelona | 49,883,928 | 19.9    |        | 7.   | 12.  | 10.  | MAD - Madrid    | 643,534     | 13.0    |\n|        | 8.   | 8.   | 10.  | LGW - London    | 40,902,076 | 24.5    |        | 8.   | 11.  | 12.  | BRU - Brussels  | 579,549     | -5.9    |\n|        | 9.   | 12.  | 11.  | FCO - Rome      | 40,494,654 | 38.0    |        | 9.   | 16.  | 15.  | MUC - Munich    | 277,200     | 7.3     |\n|        | 10.  | 11.  | 13.  | SAW - Istanbul  | 37,097,582 | 20.5    |        | 10.  | 15.  | 16.  | ZRH - Zurich    | 268,164     | -0.2    |\n\n1) Ranking according to ACI Europe (February 2024).\n\n#### **Competitive Position Outside the Frankfurt Site**\n\nImage /page/45/Figure/8 description: This image is a world map showing the locations of various cities.

As an originating airport, Ljubljana is in particular in competition with airports in its catchment area, such as Zagreb Airport near the border. Compared to the previous year, the airport recorded a clear recovery in traffic. This is mainly due to improved connectivity and the resumption of flight connections that were temporarily suspended due to the bankruptcy of Adria Airways in the fall of 2019 and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Alongside a large number of connections to European capitals and business sites, an increasing number of charter flight connections to tourist regions continued to contribute to the appeal of the site and the airport.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nPassenger numbers at the two Brazilian airports **Porto Alegre** and **Fortaleza** are strongly influenced by domestic originating traffic. The share of domestic passenger numbers was around 95% in both Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. The three major airlines LATAM Brazil, GOL and Azul continue to dominate the Brazilian market and accordingly offer numerous connections from Porto Alegre and Fortaleza. Porto Alegre benefits from its geographical proximity to the economic center of Brazil. Fortaleza Airport is highly tourist-oriented and is conveniently located for flights to Europe and North America. However, during the year the airport was affected by the weak development of the economy and a decline in tourist numbers. In addition, GOL has moved part of its fleet to other Brazilian sites. Freight volumes at both airports developed positively.\n\nThe Jorge Chávez Airport in **Lima** is Peru's leading airport, and one of the largest airports in South America. The site profits from its geographical position, which makes the airport an attractive transfer point for traffic between South and North America. LATAM Airlines Group has the largest share of aircraft movements and passengers at Lima Airport. The largest low-cost airlines at the site, SKY Airline and Jetsmart, continue to pursue a growth strategy and contribute to positive traffic growth. The expansion project at the Jorge Chávez Airport includes the construction of a new passenger terminal, a new runway, including aprons and taxiways, as well as other peripheral infrastructure. This will ensure that sufficient capacity is available for further growth in the South American aviation market in the future. The second runway and the air traffic control tower started operations in April 2023. The construction of the new passenger terminal continues to progress. It is scheduled to open at the end of 2024.\n\nThe traffic and business developments at the strongly tourist-oriented Greek sites, at Varna and Burgas, as well as in Antalya are substantially affected by charter traffic of tourist carriers. There is generally no substantial concentration of individual airlines. In addition to the economic development in each respective country where the traffic originates, the sites depend particularly on the appeal of the respective regions with regard to safety, quality, price level, and entry requirements.\n\n**Fraport Greece** operates 14 Greek regional airports. These are the airports in Kerkyra (Corfu), Chania (Crete), Kefalonia, Kavala, Aktio/Preveza, Thessaloniki, Zakynthos, Mykonos, Skiathos, Santorini (Thira), Kos, Mytilene (Lesbos), Rhodes, and Samos. The development at the Greek Group airports is mainly characterized by tourist traffic. Greece's appeal as a tourism destination and the associated potential for a further increase in demand should continue in the coming years. Despite isolated natural events, such as the forest fires on Rhodes and Corfu, traffic figures continued to increase and reached a new peak in 2023.\n\nThe Black Sea airports in **Burgas** and **Varna** are the second- and third-largest passenger airports in Bulgaria after Sofia. The flight schedule included 64 destinations in Varna and 75 destinations in Burgas in 2023. In addition to charter services, low-cost transport promises further growth potential. Wizz Air provided the largest share of passengers by far, at around 26%. In 2023, the airline stationed three aircraft in Varna, two since October 2023. The modular expansion of the terminals at both sites offer sufficient capacity to be able to meet the regional growth expected in the medium term.\n\n**Antalya** was the second-largest passenger airport in Turkey in the past fiscal year, behind Istanbul Airport, and remains one of the most important tourist airports in the Mediterranean region. The demand for holiday travel to the region is essential for the further development of traffic at Antalya Airport. This depends on the political and economic situation in the countries of origin of the main passenger groups as well as Turkey. At the end of 2021, a consortium made up of Fraport and its Turkish partner TAV was awarded the tender for the new operating concession at Antalya Airport. The operational period of the new concession will start at the beginning of 2027 after the current concession expires, and will run until the end of 2051. As part of the new concession, necessary expansion measures at the terminals and other areas at the airport began in the first quarter of 2022. The completion of the main infrastructure measures is expected until January 2025. This will ensure Antalya Airport will remain highly competitive in the segment of tourist airports in the Mediterranean region in the long term.\n\nAdditional information about business development in the past fiscal year can be found in the \"Economic Report\" chapter.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Strategy**\n\n#### **Long-term market development remains positive despite short-term volatility**\n\nFollowing the worldwide traffic decline caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the volume of traffic is recovering globally. In the long term, stable growth of the aviation market is expected to continue. Fraport aligns its strategy to the long-term forecasted development of the global aviation market and its trends. In particular, projected global economic growth and stable world trade will have a positive impact on the development. The world's growing population, combined with the expanding middle class, which tends to consume more, are the main factors driving tourism demand. Disproportionate growth is still expected from and in the economic emerging markets.\n\n#### Long-term market development\n\nImage /page/47/Figure/8 description: The image shows a forecast for the long-term development of global air traffic. The forecast is underpinned by growth prospects. The image shows that growing global gross domestic product and increasing global trade will promote the development of air traffic. Globalization and a pronounced trend towards private travel are contributing positively to this development. The source of the forecast is Airbus. The term of the forecast is 2019-2042. The reference is passenger kilometers sold. The average annual growth is +3.6%.\n\n| Airbus  | 2019 – 2042 | Passenger kilometers sold | +3.6% |\n|---------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|\n| Boeing  | 2019 – 2042 | Passenger kilometers sold | +3.7% |\n| Embraer | 2019 – 2042 | Passenger kilometers sold | +3.2% |\n| ACI     | 2019 – 2041 | Number of passengers      | +3.5% |\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Strategic objectives**\n\nThe vision of the Fraport Group, with its five strategic objectives, serves to implement the mission and remains unchanged despite short-term volatility:\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/6 description: The image shows the vision and values of an organization, likely an airport operator. The vision statement reads, \"Our vision: We are Europe's best airport operator and set standards worldwide.\" The values are represented by icons and short descriptions within blue squares. These include: Growth in Frankfurt and internationally (airplane icon with bar graph), Service-oriented airport operator (person with briefcase icon), Economically successful through optimal cooperation (currency icons with graph), Learning organization & digitalization (people with @ symbol icon), and Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors (hand holding people icon).\n\nA description as well as target values and time horizons for the most important financial and important non-financial key figures can be found in the \"Control system\" chapter, and the development during the past fiscal year can be found in the \"Economic Report\" chapter. The forecast values for the key financial performance indicators for the 2024 fiscal year are included in the \"Outlook Report\" chapter. Substantial risks and opportunities can be found in the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter.\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/8 description: The image is a square icon with a white background and a blue border. Inside the square, there is a blue silhouette of an airplane flying diagonally upwards from left to right. Below the airplane, there is a blue bar graph with several vertical bars of varying heights.\n\n#### **Growth in Frankfurt and internationally**\n\nThe expected market development indicates that air traffic will remain a growth market. Against this background, Fraport is aligning the company to ensure competitiveness and to participate sustainably in this growth – both at the Frankfurt site and internationally.\n\nBased on this, it is expected that traffic volume at Group airports will follow the general market trend, the aviation value added will increase, and sustainable EBITDA growth will be achieved in the non-aviation segment. The international business is also expected to continue to grow and contribute to the Group EBITDA and result.\n\nAt the Frankfurt site, the construction of Terminal 3 will secure the infrastructure required for growth in the long term. Construction is progressing according to plan, and the new terminal will open for the 2026 summer flight schedule. The resulting additional capacity of around 20 million passengers will make it possible to gradually modernize older terminal infrastructure. In particular, Terminal 2 will be temporarily closed and modernized.\n\nThe role of Frankfurt Airport as one of the leading cargo hubs in Europe will also be strengthened, and freight will be developed as a business field. Infrastructural expansion areas at Frankfurt Airport, the e-commerce segment, and the forecasted overall economic upswing are expected to contribute to growth in freight in the coming years.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nFraport is continuing the expansion measures required to meet capacity that it has begun at international sites. In Peru, expansion measures are well advanced. The new terminal will be opened at the end of 2024 following the inauguration of the runway and air traffic control tower. Compared to 23.6 million passengers carried in 2019, the airport's capacity will be increasing to around 40 million passengers. The terminal at Varna Airport in Bulgaria is also to be expanded in the next few years.\n\nFraport particularly uses the passenger numbers at Frankfurt Airport as well as at the Group airports as an indicator for the Groupwide growth in traffic. Fraport measures Group-wide growth in the result and controls this, among other things, by monitoring the development of Group EBITDA and the Group result, the ROFRA (Return on Fraport Assets), net financial debt to EBITDA ratio, and free cash flow. In view of the dynamic economic environment, Fraport is also focusing on securing Group liquidity in the long term.\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/7 description: The image is a square sign with a blue border. Inside the square, there is a blue figure of a person walking with a briefcase in their left hand. To the right of the person, there is a white circle with a simple smiley face inside. The background of the sign is white.\n\n#### **Service-oriented airport operator**\n\nMotivated employees, efficient processes and infrastructure that meets current needs ensure that Group airports reach a leading position in their respective aviation market and underpin the claim of Fraport of having a strong customer and service orientation at all sites.\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, Fraport is responsible for the organization, control, and implementation of aviation security checks at Frankfurt Airport. This is a substantial milestone in optimizing control of the travel process. In combination with the gradual rollout of new computer tomography (CT) scanners, queues at security checkpoints will be reduced. Customer experience will improve as a result.\n\nIn order to further strengthen the hub function of the Frankfurt site, the security checkpoint in Terminal 1 B will be relocated over the next few years. This will increase capacity for checks and create easier transfer processes as well as a new airside shopping area.\n\nIn addition to the passengers, airport business partners including airlines, retailers, and logistics specialists are of key importance to Fraport. Fraport aims to provide its partners Group-wide with a good commercial basis. Processes and interfaces are technologically supported and are intended to be improved continuously. This simplifies and accelerates processes. With the founding of FraAlliance GmbH, Fraport and Lufthansa have strengthened their strategic and operational cooperation at the Frankfurt site. The main focus in the reporting period was on improving the gastronomic and retail offerings.\n\nCustomer and service orientation will also be continually improved at the other Group airports. Understanding customer needs and obtaining feedback is essential for this. This is why customer surveys are regularly conducted in Frankfurt and at the Group airports. The global passenger satisfaction reflects the effectiveness and success of the passenger-oriented processes and service offers. Also, baggage connectivity is an essential measure for performance of the Frankfurt hub airport. The punctuality rate is another quality indicator for Frankfurt as a hub airport.\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/14 description: The image is a square icon with a white background and a blue border. Inside the border, there is a blue rectangle containing a line graph, a euro symbol, a dollar sign, and the letters \"RS\" inside a circle.\n\n#### **Economically successful through optimal cooperation**\n\nFraport aims to ensure that Group companies, business fields and services perform with quality and cost structures that can compete with specialized aviation service providers. Optimized collaboration enables the operating cost to be reduced further and made more flexible.\n\nIn order to support the restart of air traffic and ensure the long-term success of Fraport, the focus is on adapting the organization and its processes. Among other things, a bundling of ground services in Frankfurt within the framework of a joint operation is planned. This should improve the quality and profitability of the business model.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/5 description: The image shows a blue and white icon. The icon depicts four stylized figures, arranged in a group, with an \"@\" symbol above them. The figures are simple, with round heads and no facial features. They are positioned as if they are sitting around a table or gathered together. The \"@\" symbol is located in the upper right corner of the icon, suggesting a connection to communication or networking.\n\n#### **Learning organization & digitalization**\n\nFlexible and fast response is part of everyday operations for Fraport. The intention is for risks and opportunities to be recognized at an early stage, and changes in the market anticipated. Learning takes place every day and everywhere, both in terms of leadership and in the area of expertise. This also includes the regular exchange of technical experts within the Group on specific airport management issues. One example of this is the \"Sustainability X-Change,\" in which sustainability experts and managing directors of the international Group companies and Fraport AG regularly exchange ideas and drive forward joint projects. The main focus in 2023 was to extend the decarbonization master plan to the Group level.\n\nThe volatile business environment in which Fraport operates requires a high level of adaptability from the organization and its staff. Fraport is increasingly building on digital solutions with collaborative value creation and is thus consistently implementing its digitalization and innovation strategy. The partnership with Microsoft established as part of the AI@FRA initiative is primarily used to improve the handling process in flight operations. The first concrete use cases for artificial intelligence are also being worked on in the administrative area. The basis for this work is, among other things, appropriate data quality. The Data Literacy training program aims to consistently prepare employees for more data-based work. Fraport considers digitalization and innovation to be a lever to improve customer satisfaction and financial performance indicators. All the projects listed above aim to open up earnings potential or reduce costs, and thus increase competitiveness.\n\nImage /page/50/Picture/9 description: The image is a blue square containing a white background. In the foreground is a blue hand with the palm facing upwards. On the hand is a house, a tree, and a family of three people. The family consists of a man, a woman, and a child.\n\n#### **Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors**\n\nOne focus of the Fraport Group's sustainability activities is to treat partners, neighbors, and natural resources respectfully throughout the Group.\n\nBeing a good neighbor means communal, cultural, and social engagement in the respective regions. At the Group sites, the regions close to the airport benefit from the economic performance of the airports. Donations or sponsoring activities are carried out independently by the Group companies.\n\nActive and passive noise abatement serves to reduce the negative effects of aviation traffic on its environment. Emission-related airport charges at the Frankfurt site provide financial incentives for airlines to use aircraft with low pollutant and noise emissions. Noise protection measures in accordance with national and local noise protection regulations have been applied and monitoring systems implemented at Group airports as well.\n\nIn addition, Fraport feels responsible for meeting ecological requirements. In the field of climate protection, Fraport is pursuing the goal of reducing Group-wide CO<sup>2</sup> emissions to a maximum of 95,000 metric tons by 2030. Fraport aims to be carbon-free by 2045. No emissions will be compensated. In 2022, the \"Decarbonization Master Plan\" for Fraport AG was developed as a policy paper for decarbonization. It derives an overall concept for reducing CO₂ emissions from the scientific and legal framework conditions as well as the technical possibilities and provides a comprehensive view and structuring of the measures to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. In the 2023 fiscal year, the master plan was also rolled out to the relevant Group companies. Key components include packages of measures to increase energy efficiency, the conversion of the vehicle fleet to electric drives and the procurement of energy from renewable sources.\n\nWith regard to social sustainability aspects, Fraport also retains qualified and motivated employees as an attractive and responsible employer, among other things with systematic further development offers and talent management programs. For this purpose, the HRneo strategic program was launched in 2023. It comprehensively addresses the requirements of the personnel market and aims to position Fraport as a top employer. In this way, Fraport aims to secure its own long-term competitiveness in an increasingly tight labor market. HRneo takes a holistic view of HR work and will also revise the current understanding of leadership.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nComprehensive, integrated occupational health and safety is also an important component of the Fraport Group's understanding of sustainability.\n\nFraport respects and promotes personal diversity and attaches great importance to ensuring that this is reflected in the way employees interact with each other. The Group agreement \"Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace\" forms the platform for principles such as freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities. Fraport places particular emphasis on development measures aimed at increasing the proportion of women in management positions. This applies to management positions at levels 1 and 2 below the Executive Board, as well as the respective management boards and the management level below them at the German Group companies.\n\nFraport uses the key indicators of employee satisfaction, the proportion of women in management positions, the sickness rate, and level of CO<sup>2</sup> emissions to monitor its sustainability activities.\n\n# **Research and Development**\n\nFraport does not conduct research and development in the narrowest sense. Nevertheless, the company is eager to ensure necessary developments are made and to integrate market proven solutions in a timely manner. The focus therefore lies on continuously observing markets and technologies in order to identify and implement promising developments at an early stage.\n\n# **Legal Disclosures**\n\nAs a listed corporation headquartered in Germany, Fraport AG is subject to a number of statutory disclosure requirements. Important reporting obligations that apply to this combined management report as a result of these requirements are shown in the following.\n\n#### **Takeover-related disclosures**\n\nThe capital stock of Fraport AG is €924,687,040. It is divided into 92,468,704 no-par-value bearer shares. The company holds treasury shares (77,365 shares), which are offset from capital stock on the balance sheet. The issued capital stated in the commercial balance sheet as at December 31, 2023 and reduced by treasury shares is €923,913,390 (92,391,339 no-par-value shares). There are no differing classes of shares. Additional information regarding treasury shares in accordance with Section 160 (1) no. 2 of the AktG can be found in the Group notes, note 31, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 28.\n\nThe shares of Fraport AG are not subject to any restrictions on voting rights under the company statutes or the law. None of the shares issued by Fraport AG certify any rights that confer special supervisory powers on the holders. In the event of a change of control following a takeover bid, there are no compensation agreements with members of the Executive Board or employees.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of Executive Board members is carried out in compliance with the relevant provisions of AktG (Sections 84 and 85). Pursuant to Section 179 (1) sentence 2 AktG in conjunction with Section 11 (3) of the company statutes, the Supervisory Board is entitled to amend the company statutes only with respect to the wording. Other amendments to the company statutes require a resolution of the Annual General Meeting, which, according to Section 18 (1) of the company statutes, must be passed in general by a simple majority of the votes cast and, provided that a capital majority is required, by a simple majority of the capital stock represented at the time of the resolution. If, by way of exception, the law requires a higher capital majority (e.g., when changing the purpose of the company as stated in the company statutes, Section 179 (2) sentence 1 AktG; or when creating contingent capital, Section 193 (1) sentence 1 AktG), the resolution of the Annual General Meeting has to be passed by a three-quarter majority of the represented capital stock.\n\nThe Executive Board is entitled, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock on one or more occasions by up to a total of €458,843,520.00 until May 31, 2026 by issuing up to 45,884,352 new no-par value bearer shares in return for cash (\"Authorized Capital II\"). In principle, the shareholders are to be granted a subscription right. The new shares may also be acquired by a credit institution to be determined by the Executive Board or a company (financial institution) acting in accordance with the first sentence of Section 53(1) of the German Banking Act (KWG) or the first sentence of Section 53b(1) or Section 53b(7)\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nKWG or a consortium of such credit or financial institutions with the obligation to offer them to the company's shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription right). The new shares will participate in the net income from the beginning of the fiscal year of their issue. To the extent legally permissible, the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and in deviation from Section 60 (2) AktG, can determine that the new shares will participate in net income from the beginning of a fiscal year that has already expired and for which no resolution has yet been passed by the Annual General Meeting on the appropriation of the profit earmarked for distribution at the time of their issue. The Executive Board is further authorized, also with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders one or more occasions, insofar as this is necessary to compensate for residual amounts. The Executive Board is authorized to determine, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, the further details of the capital increase, the further content of the share rights and the terms and conditions of the issue of shares. The Supervisory Board is authorized to adjust the wording of Section 4 of the company statutes in accordance with the respective utilization of Authorized Capital II and after the expiration of the authorization period.\n\nThe capital stock is conditionally increased by up to €120,209,310.00 through the issue of up to 12,020,931 new no-par value bearer shares (Contingent Capital). The contingent capital serves exclusively to grant shares to the holders or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants or a combination of all these instruments, which are issued by the company in accordance with the authorization up to May 31, 2026 resolved by the Annual General Meeting on June 1, 2021 under agenda item 7 a) and grant a conversion or option right to new no-par value bearer shares in the company or determine a conversion or option obligation or a right to tender and insofar as the issue takes place in return for cash. The new shares are issued at the conversion or option price to be determined according to the previously mentioned authorization resolution. The contingent capital increase is only to be carried out to the extent that conversion or option rights are exercised, or the conversion/option obligation is satisfied, or shares are tendered, and no other forms of fulfillment are used. The new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created by exercising conversion or option rights or through the fulfillment of corresponding obligations (fiscal year of origin); in deviation from this, the new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created if the Annual General Meeting has not yet passed a resolution on the utilization of the profit earmarked for distribution from the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created. The Executive Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the implementation of conditional capital increases.\n\nAs part of the annual employee stock program, 35,625 shares of Fraport AG were issued in the reporting period, which are subject to a one-year lock-up period. In addition, each member of the Executive Board is obliged to acquire shares of Fraport AG in the amount of at least one annual gross base remuneration within a five-year establishment phase in annual installments, and to hold them permanently during their membership on the Executive Board.\n\nFurthermore, there are loans with contractually agreed credit clauses. These clauses relate, among other things, to changes in the shareholder structure, and control of the company. If these changes have a proven negative effect on the credit rating of Fraport AG, the creditors have, above a certain threshold, the right to call the loans due ahead of time on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOn the basis of the consortium agreement concluded between the State of Hesse and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH dated April 18/23, 2001 with a supplement as at December 2, 2014, the total voting rights in Fraport AG held by both shareholders, calculated in accordance with Section 34 (2) of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG), amounted to 52.23% as at December 31, 2023. Of this, the State of Hesse held 31.31% and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH 20.92%. The voting rights in Fraport AG owned by the City of Frankfurt/Main are held indirectly via the Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH subsidiary.\n\n#### **Report on the relationships with affiliated companies**\n\nDue to the shares of 31.31% (previous year: 31.31%) held by the State of Hesse and 20.92% (previous year: 20.92%) held by Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, as well as the consortium agreement concluded between these shareholders on April 18/23, 2001 with a supplement as at December 2, 2014, Fraport AG is a publicly controlled enterprise. There are no control or profit transfer agreements.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Executive Board of Fraport AG therefore compiles a report on the relationships with affiliated companies in accordance with Section 312 of the AktG. At the end of the report, the Executive Board made the following statement: \"The Executive Board declares that under the circumstances known to us at the time, Fraport AG received fair and adequate compensation for each and every legal transaction conducted. During the reporting year, measures were neither taken nor omitted at the request of or in the interests of the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt am Main and their affiliated companies.\"\n\n#### **Combined Statement on Corporate Governance**\n\nThe Fraport AG Executive Board reports – in the name of the Supervisory Board as well – on the contents subject to the reporting requirements pursuant to Section 289f of the German Commercial Code (HGB) for Fraport AG as well as for the Fraport Group as part of a combined statement on corporate governance pursuant to Section 289f HGB and Section 315d HGB read in conjunction with Section 289f HGB, in order to enable a general statement on the Group's corporate governance principles. The combined statement on corporate governance is published in the \"To our shareholders\" chapter and on the corporate website at www.fraport.com/en/investors/corporate-governance.html.\n\n#### **Information in accordance with the German Energy Economics Act (EnWG)**\n\nFraport AG operates its own energy supply network and in mid-2011 applied for the status of \"closed distribution network\", which is associated with considerable benefits compared to general supply networks. In accordance with the requirements of Section 6b of the EnWG (German Energy Industry Act), Fraport AG is obliged to prepare separate business statements. The regulations were applied in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Network Agency in the 2023 annual financial statements.\n\n#### **Annual General Meeting (AGM)**\n\nAt the past virtual AGM on May 23, 2023, Fraport received a clear majority from its shareholders on all agenda items. Of the capital entitled to vote, 73,253,707 no-par-value shares and the same number of voting rights (79.22% of capital) were exercised. The AGM for the 2023 fiscal year will be held on May 28, 2024 as an in person meeting.\n\n# **Control system**\n\nThe \"Control system\" chapter explains the key indicators used by the Executive Board to make the corporate measures taken as part of the Group strategy measurable and to evaluate them\n\n#### **Changes compared with the previous year**\n\nThe following changes were made to the Group's control system in the 2023 fiscal year. The \"Non-financial performance indicators\" section is part of the \"Combined non-financial statement.\" As in the previous year, the non-financial performance indicators are still presented in this chapter. The Executive Board dealt with the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). In preparation for the implementation, the control system was determined and checked to ensure it was up to date. The first step was to analyze and define the non-financial performance indicators. A comprehensive revision of the control system, along with the adoption of the materiality matrix and the further development of the Fraport.2030 Group strategy, is planned for 2024 (see also the \"Business outlook\" chapter). The relevance of the key financial performance indicators to control activities was confirmed for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nAs planned, the employee satisfaction indicator was not measured during the reporting period. The focus is on the development and implementation of measures derived from the last survey in 2022.\n\nBeginning with the reporting for the 2023 fiscal year, the Executive Board will focus on the following financial and non-financial performance indicators, the developments of which are presented in the \"Group results of operations,\" \"Asset and financial position,\" \"Value management,\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters. Corresponding forecasts for the key financial performance indicators have been stated in the \"Business outlook\" chapter.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Financial performance indicators**\n\n### **Overview financial key performance indicators**\n\n| Topic                                               | Target                                                               | Key figure                      | Scope      | Term      | Target level                                                   | Value 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Earnings position/<br>Assets and financial position | We generate<br>long-term earnings<br>growth and maintain             | EBITDA<br>(€ million)           | Group      | 2024      | Between roughly<br>€1,260 million and<br>around €1,360 million | 1,204.0    |\n|                                                     | financial strength at a<br>high level despite<br>future investments. | Group result<br>(€ million)     | Group      | 2024      | Between around<br>€435 million and<br>roughly €530 million     | 430.5      |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Free Cash Flow<br>(€ million)   | Group      | 2024      | Negative mid<br>three-digit<br>million € amount                | -656.4     |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Group liquidity<br>(€ million)  | Group      | Long term | ≥ €1 billion,<br>temporarily<br>clearly higher                 | 4,041.3    |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Net financial<br>debt to EBITDA | Group      | Long term | Max. 5x                                                        | 6.4        |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | ROFRA (%)                       | Group      | Long term | >WACC (2023: 7.6 %)                                            | 6.6        |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Net profit<br>(€ million)       | Fraport AG | Long term | Between around<br>€300 million and<br>roughly €350 million     | 329.1      |\n|                                                     |                                                                      | Liquidity<br>(€ million)        | Fraport AG | Long term | ≥ €1 billion,<br>temporarily<br>clearly higher                 | 3,285.6    |\n\nFor Fraport, the growth-oriented development of financial performance indicators is critical for the long-term success of the company. The overriding importance of these indicators is reflected in the Group strategy as a set of criteria for the Group objectives \"Growth in Frankfurt and internationally\" and \"Economically successful through optimal cooperation\". Control, derived from the Group strategy, is carried out primarily at the Group level, and segment-specific key figures are used to support this.\n\nFraport uses key figures relating to the consolidated results of operations and to the Group asset and financial position, as well as key figures that link the results of operations with the asset and financial position (value management), as key financial performance indicators. In accordance with the long-term oriented Group strategy, the Executive Board manages and evaluates the development of financial performance indicators while also taking account of long-term forecasted market developments. In this context, strategic measures – such as the implementation of larger capital expenditure projects or the expansion of international business – can also lead to a short- to medium-term burden on the financial performance indicators.\n\nThe key financial performance indicators and their significance for Fraport are described in the following. The description of their development during the past fiscal year can be found in the \"The Group's results of operations\", \"Asset and financial position\", and \"Value management\" chapters. The associated forecasted figures for the 2024 fiscal year can be found in the \"Business outlook\" chapter. Definitions for calculating the financial key figures can be found in the \"Glossary\" chapter.\n\n## **Results of operations key figures**\n\nThe results of operations include the presentation and explanation of significant earnings components and key figures. While the results of operations in the context of regular reporting provide information about the past business development and are forecasted in the business outlook, earnings forecasts are also regularly drawn up over long-term periods for internal planning purposes. The information resulting from this is relevant for the Executive Board in relation to the company's long-term management.\n\nThe most important financial performance indicators for Fraport are **EBITDA** and the **Group result**.\n\nEBITDA and, indirectly, the Group result through the earnings per share (EPS) are a component of the Executive Board remuneration and underline the relevance of these financial key figures as a control element.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Asset and financial position key figures**\n\nAs well as in the results of operations, the result of the strategically adopted measures and operating activities of Fraport is also reflected in the Group's asset and financial position. For Fraport, in particular the development of the net financial debt to EBITDA ratio and the free cash flow are significant. Also, under the influence of the coronavirus pandemic Group liquidity was introduced as a control parameter.\n\nThe net financial debt to EBITDA ratio and the free cash flow in particular serve as key financial indicators to the Executive Board to assess financial strength. The **net financial debt to EBITDA** ratio provides information on the financial stability of the company and how many years are required to service the net financial debt via EBITDA. Net financial debt consists of long-term and shortterm financial liabilities less Group liquidity. The Executive Board has decided on a ratio of a maximum of 5 for this performance indicator and is resolved to reach this target value again in the medium term after the effects of the coronavirus pandemic are overcome.\n\n**Free cash flow** is the result of the cash flow from operating activities less the effects resulting from the application of IFRS 16, investments in airport operating projects, capital expenditure for other intangible assets, capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment, investments for \"investment property\" and capital expenditure in companies accounted for using the equity method, plus dividends from companies accounted for using the equity method. The free cash flow provides information about the financial funds available to the Group from the operating activities of a period after deducting operating capital expenditure activities. These free funds can be retained in order to increase the company's liquidity and to be available as a financial reserve for future capital expenditure or to reduce the leverage (the gearing ratio) and/or can be distributed among shareholders as dividends. Due to the ongoing capital expenditure for expansion activities in Frankfurt and internationally, as well as the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the operating activities of Fraport, the free cash flow continues to be extraordinarily burdened and temporarily negative. In the medium term, the aim is to achieve a clear increase in free cash flow in positive territory.\n\n**Group liquidity** includes cash and cash equivalents (as at the statement of financial position) plus short-term realizable items in \"other financial assets\" and \"other receivables and financial assets.\" This key figure provides information on the financial stability of the Fraport Group, even over a long period of time. The Executive Board also aims for liquidity of at least €1 billion in the long term. Against the backdrop of the current macroeconomic volatilities and the high level of debt related to the pandemic, a temporarily significantly higher level of liquidity is being maintained.\n\n#### **Links between the results of operations and the asset and financial position (value management)**\n\nTo increase the Group's value in the long term, the Executive Board specifically draws parallels between the development of the results of operations and the asset and financial position. In this context, the Executive Board plans and manages the Group's development according to the principles of value management.\n\nAt Fraport, the most important measurement and steering figure of this approach is the **\"Return on Fraport assets\"**, in short: **ROFRA**, which makes the different-sized segments of the Fraport Group comparable in terms of economic enhancement. Compared to the current WACC, the ROFRA shows whether the business units created value (ROFRA > WACC) or not (ROFRA < WACC).\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders [Fraport Annual Report](#page-5-0) 2023 *[Combined Management Report](#page-39-0)* [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) Combined M[anagement Report](#page-144-0) / S[ituation of the Group](#page-236-0) Group Notes Further Information 47\n\nFurther Information\n\nImage /page/56/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram that defines ROFRA as Adjusted EBIT divided by Fraport-Assets. Adjusted EBIT is calculated as EBIT plus Pre-tax result of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method. Fraport-Assets is calculated as Goodwill plus Other intangible assets at cost/2 plus Investments in airport operating projects at cost/2 plus Construction in progress and lands at cost plus Other property, plant, and equipment at cost/2 plus Carrying amounts of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method and other investments plus Inventories plus Trade accounts receivable minus Current trade accounts payable.\n\nThe ROFRA is calculated on the basis of the EBIT extended by the results before taxes of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method divided by the Fraport assets. The Fraport assets are defined as the average of the Group's or segments' fixed interest-bearing capital required for operations including the carrying amounts of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method. To avoid economic enhancement coming solely from depreciation and amortization of assets, the Executive Board recognizes regularly depreciable or amortizable assets within Fraport assets at half of their historical acquisition/manufacturing costs (at cost/2), and not at residual carrying amounts. Goodwill and investments in Group companies accounted for using the equity method and other assets not included in depreciation and amortization, in particular assets in construction, are recognized in full at cost because they are not subject to regular depreciation and amortization. Within the scope of the initial implementation of IFRS 16, other property, plant, and equipment also includes the rights to use resulting from leasing contracts. They are included in the calculation as half at costs.\n\nROFRA is also an element of the Executive Board remuneration and underlines the long-term goal of Group-wide business activities that create value.\n\n#### **Other important key indicators for the results of operations**\n\nThe **passenger numbers** at the Group sites are of particular importance for the financial development of Fraport. Closely related to this, **revenue** is an important key indicator for measuring the performance of the Group. Details on this can be found in the Group notes, note 5, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 5. In order to limit fluctuations in connection with the recognition of expansion obligations in the balance sheet and thus show organic growth, revenue is adjusted for effects from the application of IFRIC 12 \"Service Concession Agreements\" and reported separately as the key figure **Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12**. **EBIT** – the operating result before interest and taxes \">– is also an important indicator for measuring the operating result in the Group.\n\nAt Fraport AG level, **net income** is a key figure of great importance for the development of shareholders' equity and profit earmarked for distribution. The **liquidity** of Fraport AG is also relevant for management. Against the background of the capitalintensive expansion at the Frankfurt site and the international business as well as the temporarily high net financial debt, the Executive Board is aiming for minimum liquidity that is well above the long-term target of €1 billion.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Value added**\n\nIn addition to the ROFRA, Fraport uses the value added as a measure of economic enhancement. The value added is annually consolidated and recorded at Group and at segment level. It is calculated from the \"adjusted\" EBIT, which also includes the results before taxes of the Group companies accounted for using the equity method, minus the Fraport assets multiplied by the WACC.\n\nImage /page/57/Figure/6 description: The image shows a calculation of the value added. The formula is: Adjusted EBIT - Fraport-Assets x WACC. Each of the terms in the formula is enclosed in a gray box.\n\nThe goal is to generate value added of zero for the regulated Aviation segment, and generate clearly positive values added for the other segments.\n\nFraport calculates the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the capital asset pricing model and uses this regulatory specific WACC to calculate its airport charges. Given the continuously changing economic environment, interest rate levels, and/or Fraport's risk and financing structure, Fraport regularly reviews, and, if needed, adjusts its WACC. The WACC is also used for the value management of the Fraport Group. The WACC for the fiscal year increased compared to the previous year to 7.6% (before taxes, 2022: 7.3%). For details on the use and calculation of the cost of capital in the context of impairment tests, please refer to note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe regulatory WACC is composed as follows:\n\n**Cost of equity**\n\nEquity cost rate\nbefore taxes 14.2%\n\nShareholders' equity ratio 48%\n(based on market value)\n\n**Cost of debt**\n\nDebt cost rate\nbefore taxes 2.1%\n\nDebt ratio 52%\n(interest-bearing 39% /\nnon interest-bearing 13%)\n\nWACC before taxes 7.6%\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023 Combined

The clear objective is to raise the company’s own quality and customer satisfaction to a high level. Fraport uses performance indicators for the purposes of measurement and control. The key indicators include the **global satisfaction** of passengers and **baggage connectivity**.\n\n**Global satisfaction** describes passengers' satisfaction with the services and processes offered and the service at Fraport air-\n\nThe target value for global satisfaction of 80% for Frankfurt Airport remained unchanged for fiscal year 2023. This target value is to be maintained at least until the inauguration of Terminal 3. The target value for Group global satisfaction also remained\n\n**Baggage connectivity** provides information about the percentage of baggage at Frankfurt Airport that is loaded on time in relation to the total departing baggage. Baggage connectivity measures, among other things, the performance of the airport in its role as a hub with a transfer share of about 50%, and thus a high proportion of transfer baggage. A high and stable connectivity proves a good quality of baggage processes. The objective remains the achievement of a long-term baggage connectivity of more than\n\nFor Fraport, appeal and responsibility as an employer is, like customer satisfaction and product quality, a key factor to ensure the long-term success of the business. Fraport understands appeal to mean the creation of good working conditions in order to gain and retain committed and qualified employees. To measure and control its appeal and responsibility as an employer, Fraport uses\n\n**Employee satisfaction** is a central instrument for measuring employee mood. Fraport is convinced that satisfied employees achieve higher customer loyalty and improved performance. As of the 2022 reporting year, the key figure is measured every two years on the basis of an extensive survey of the employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies. All labor-intensive Group companies in Frankfurt and in Greece, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Peru, Brazil and the USA participate in the survey.

Diversity is a key goal for Fraport, which is systematically addressed within the framework of diversity management. Fraport AG places particular focus on promoting **women in management positions** at the two levels directly below the Executive Board as well as at the first level directly below the respective management levels at the German Group companies. This is also in line with the objective of the \"Act to Supplement and Amend the Regulations for the Equal Participation of Women in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sector\" (FüPoG II). For reporting purposes, executives who report directly to the Executive Board are categorized as level 1. Executives who report to this first level of management are categorized as level 2. Regarding the Group companies in Germany, the levels of management are categorized based on comparable positions at Fraport AG. The goal is to increase the proportion of women in management positions in the Group in Germany, at the first management level below the Executive Board to 30.8% and at the management level below that to 30.2% by the end of 2026. For Fraport AG, the proportion of women in management positions is to be increased accordingly to 31.8% at the first management level and 30.9% at the lower management level.

Fraport uses performance indicators for the purposes of measurement and control. The key indicators\n\n50 Group Management Report / Situation of the Group Fraport Annual Report 2023\n\nThe target value for global satisfaction of 80% for Frankfurt Airport remained unchanged for fiscal year 2023. This target value is to be maintained at least until the inauguration of Terminal 3. The target value for Group global satisfaction also remained unchanged at 80% after the survey was resumed in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n**Baggage connectivity** provides information about the percentage of baggage at Frankfurt Airport that is loaded on time in relation to the total departing baggage. Baggage connectivity measures, among other things, the performance of the airport in its role as a hub with a transfer share of about 50%, and thus a high proportion of transfer baggage. A high and stable connectivity proves a good quality of baggage processes. The objective remains the achievement of a long-term baggage connectivity of more than 98.5%.\n\n#### **Attractive and responsible employer**\n\nFor Fraport, appeal and responsibility as an employer is, like customer satisfaction and product quality, a key factor to ensure the long-term success of the business. Fraport understands appeal to mean the creation of good working conditions in order to gain and retain committed and qualified employees. To measure and control its appeal and responsibility as an employer, Fraport uses various performance indicators, such as **employee satisfaction** and the ratio of **women in management positions**.\n\n**Employee satisfaction** is a central instrument for measuring employee mood. Fraport is convinced that satisfied employees achieve higher customer loyalty and improved performance. As of the 2022 reporting year, the key figure is measured every two years on the basis of an extensive survey of the employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies. All labor-intensive Group companies in Frankfurt and in Greece, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Peru, Brazil and the USA participate in the survey. The results obtained from this provide the basis for long-term goal setting. The goal is to continuously improve employee satisfaction. By the end of 2026, employee satisfaction at Fraport AG should therefore increase to at least 4.8. If this figure is already reached in 2024, the aim is to improve the 2026 survey result by at least 0.1. The Group is to achieve at least a value of 4.9. Here, too, the value should be at least 0.1 higher than in 2024.\n\nAs a responsible employer, Fraport respects and promotes personal diversity and attaches great importance to ensuring that this is reflected in the way employees interact with each other.

Fraport respects local circumstances and therefore does not impose any quotas based on German law on the foreign Group companies.\n\n#### **Occupational health and safety**\n\nAs a responsible employer, Fraport contributes to increasing and maintaining employees' performance and preventing work-related health hazards through targeted preventative measures in occupational health and safety. Fraport evaluates the effectiveness of the measures for health management using, among other things, the **sickness rate**. The calculation excluding illness-related absences beyond sick pay (extended sick leave) reflects the development of short- and medium-term illnesses. The effects of demographic change in the Group and the corresponding increase in the average age of employees contribute, among other things, to a linear increase in the number of long-term illnesses. The focus is on limiting or reversing the sickness rate, which is increasing due to seasonal and age-related absences, among other things. Beginning with the reporting for 2019,\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders\n\nthe Executive Board has limited the Group sickness rate to the German Group companies. Due to different regional legal regulations, but also due to the personnel structures that differ in the German Group companies, the sickness rate in the international Group companies plays a more subordinate role for local management. The objective, for both the Fraport Group in Germany as well as for Fraport AG, is a maximum rate of 7.2% by 2025.\n\n#### **Climate protection**\n\nThe operation of an airport and air traffic have various effects on the environment. Fraport is committed to the due and proper consideration of the environmental requirements associated with this. Fraport's environmental policy places importance on the sustainable and careful use of natural resources. The Executive Board has determined Scope 1 and 2 **CO<sup>2</sup> emissions** as the most important key figure for measuring environmental impact. In 2022, Fraport adopted the decarbonization master plan. It describes the strategic principles and defines the framework for the implementation of the measures and thus represents a policy document for decarbonization. The continuous implementation of this master plan for Fraport AG started back in 2022, and it was rolled out within the Group in 2023. The aim is to reduce the CO<sup>2</sup> emissions for which Fraport AG, the fully consolidated Group airports managing airport operations worldwide, and the climate-relevant subsidiaries at the Frankfurt site are directly responsible, to 95,000 metric tons by 2030. If necessary, the objective will be adjusted to any changes in Fraport's airport portfolio. Fraport AG seeks to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions at Frankfurt Airport to 50,000 metric tons by 2030. Fraport aims to be completely CO2-free in Scope 1 and 2 CO<sup>2</sup> emissions by 2045, and does not include offsets in the achievement of the targets. Along the way, Fraport has set interim goals for itself. By 2040, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions are to be reduced to 40,000 metric tons in the Group and to 25,000 metric tons at Fraport AG. Compensation is excluded when targets are achieved (\"Net Zero Carbon\" according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Information on CO<sup>2</sup> emissions is based in part on estimates, assumptions and projections and in part comes from external energy service providers.\n\n#### **Finance Management**\n\nThe core objectives of finance management of Fraport AG are **securing liquidity**, **limiting financial risks**, achieving an appropriate level of **profitability**, and ensuring **flexibility**. The highest priority is to secure liquidity. Based on the Group's solid shareholders' equity base, this is generally secured through both internal financing via operating cash flow and external financing in the form of debt. Simple and transparent financing concepts are being pursued in connection with how financing is structured at Fraport AG as well as in the international business activities. Financial risks caused, among other things, by foreign currencies are met first and foremost by financing in the respective currency to the extent possible (natural hedging). The following section shows how finance management is implemented at Fraport AG.\n\nTo secure liquidity, Fraport AG aims to achieve balanced financing composed of bilateral loans, private placements/bonds (capital market), loan financing from public loan institutions, and promissory note loans. In addition, Fraport AG has a strategic liquidity reserve to secure its independence from financing sources. The significant financing measures at Fraport AG are related mainly to refinancing existing financial maturities, and from the capital requirement, particularly for capital expenditure in Terminal 3 at the Frankfurt site and for the international Group companies. Appropriate financing instruments are selected based on the situation, depending on the attractiveness of the price as well as the volume of the financing, and complying with a balanced financing mix. In keeping with the long-term nature of capital expenditure, the financing of these projects is mostly long term as well. In line with the company's finance policy, loans can be borrowed both at a fixed and at a floating interest rate. To reduce interest rate risks from borrowing with floating interest rates, interest rate hedging transactions can be concluded as a rule.\n\nThe majority of the fully consolidated Group companies in Germany are integrated into the Fraport AG cash pool. The liquidity in these Group companies is guaranteed – via access to their own liquidity at any time as well as, within the scope of the agreements also concluded in some cases, to the financial resources of Fraport AG – so that external financing is not necessary. At the same time, the close connection of these Group companies to Fraport AG should also ensure that attention is paid to further strategic objectives of financial management within the Group.\n\nFor the fully consolidated foreign Group companies and the Group companies included using the equity method, liquidity is provided depending on the relevant company shareholding and the market environment, either by concluding project financing, bilateral loans, or by internal provision of funding via a Group loan or shareholders' equity.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>*Economic Report*\n\n# **Information about Reporting**\n\nThis report summarizes the management reports of the Fraport Group and Fraport AG (Combined Management Report). The comments on the Fraport Group also apply to Fraport AG. Developments in the asset, financial, and earnings position of Fraport AG can be found in the chapter \"Supplementary Management Report on the Separate Financial Statements of Fraport AG\".\n\nThe non-financial report complies with the commercial law requirements and was prepared in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e the German Commercial Code (HGB), Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework for facilitating sustainable investment and amending the Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder. It is integrated in the combined management report and can be found in the chapter \"Combined Non-Financial Statement\".\n\nThe section \"Non-financial performance indicators\" is shown as part of the \"Combined Non-Financial Statement\" in the 2023 fiscal year. As in the previous year, the section is presented in the Economic Report.\n\nGroup accounting takes account of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in force on the reporting date (December 31, 2023) and the interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted in the European Union (EU). In addition, Fraport reports the information pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n\nTo better represent the operating development compared with the previous year, revenue is also reported in the combined management report for order revenue from construction and expansion services in accordance with IFRIC 12 (referred to below as: Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12). These relate to the capacitive capital expenditure in connection with service concession agreements at international Group airports (see also Group Notes, note 4 and note 49).\n\nThe Executive Board prepared the combined management report as of December 31, 2023, at its meeting on March 12, 2024, presented the prepared consolidated financial statements to the audit committee and the Supervisory Board for review and approval and released them for publication on March 19,2024.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# **General Statement by the Executive Board**\n\nIn the past fiscal year, most of the Group airports recorded an increase in passenger numbers compared to the previous year. Accordingly, Group revenue amounted to €4,005.5 million, an increase of €806.1 million over the previous year (+25.2%). Adjusted for contract revenue from construction and expansion services based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €621.8 million to €3,485.1 million (+21.7%).\n\nDue to high one-off effects in the previous year, other operating income decreased to €59.0 million in the reporting period, down €80.3 million on the previous year.\n\nOperating expenses (personnel expenses and cost of materials as well as other operating expenses) increased by €562.2 million to €2,906.0 million. Adjusted for expenses related to the application of IFRIC 12, operating expenses stood at €2,390.6 million (+€377.9 million). Group EBITDA was €174.2 million higher than in the previous year at €1,204.0 million thanks to the positive operating development. The financial result improved to –€148.9 million (previous year: –€330.6 million) and resulted in a Group result of €430.5 million (previous year: €166.6 million).\n\nAs a result of the increase in operating result, cash flow from operating activities increased to €863.2 million (previous year: €787.3 million). The free cash flow improved to –€656.4 million (previous year: –€741.0 million). Group liquidity increased by €174.4 million to €4,041.3 million.\n\nThe operational challenges at Frankfurt Airport had a negative effect on the development of non-financial performance indicators such as global satisfaction of passengers and baggage connectivity. In contrast, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions came down despite the higher passenger numbers compared to the previous year.\n\nGiven the macroeconomic developments, the Executive Board continues to describe the traffic and, in turn, financial development in the reporting period as positive.\n\n# **Economic environment**\n\n#### **Development of the macroeconomic conditions**\n\nThe **global economy** lost momentum during the course of the 2023. The global industrial economy was in a weak phase due to sluggish demand globally, and world trade was thus also subdued. Even the trend of decreasing inflation did not provide consumption impulses, and the interest rate hikes of many central banks put a damper on the willingness to invest. The geopolitical crises worldwide provided uncertainty.\n\nConsumer demand from private households was weaker in the **Eurozone** given the less favorable trend in real wages. In addition, the energy price shock from the previous year continues to burden the industrial economy, in particular in Central Europe.\n\nThe export-oriented **German economy** suffered under the global economic weakness and slipped into a recession. The loss of purchasing power and the continued consumer uncertainty slowed down private consumption. Besides industry, value creation in construction and trade also declined. On the whole, the German economy performed weaker than the European average.\n\nIn the **US**, the economy proved to be robust, contrary to expectations. Despite the restrictive monetary policy, consumer sentiment remained positive. Inflationary pressure in **emerging markets** declined noticeably during the course of the year. The development within this group was mixed. In China, the economy was negatively affected in particular by the downturn in the real estate market and the debt overhang, despite government support measures.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Gross domestic product (GDP)/world trade1)**\n\n| Real changes compared to the previous year in % | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| World                                           | +3.1 | +3.5 |\n| Eurozone                                        | +0.5 | +3.4 |\n| Germany                                         | -0.3 | +1.8 |\n| USA                                             | +2.5 | +1.5 |\n| Latin America (incl.

Measured against the traffic volume of pre-crisis year 2019, this was equivalent to a recovery of around 84%. In addition to the dominating holiday travel volume, business travel gained momentum during the course of the year. Western European and intercontinental destinations benefited from this in particular. However, **domestic travel** also increasingly recovered primarily due to the feeder traffic function, it remained around 30% below the pre-crisis level however. **European traffic** gained around 16% compared to 2022. **Intercontinental traffic** increased by 28.1% compared to the previous year. This was mainly due to the North America traffic that was almost at the pre-COVID level. Far East traffic grew dynamically by +76.8% compared to the previous year, in particular due to recovery in the China traffic.\n\n**Cargo volume** declined by 5.0% to around 1.9 million metric tons compared to 2022. Compared to 2019, this meant a reduction in tonnage of 10.6%. Demand in the overall economy remained weak. Increasing interest rates had a negative impact on capital expenditure in the industry and persistently high inflation curbed demand.\n\nWith 430,436 **aircraft movements**, growth of just under 13%, or almost, 50,000 flights, compared to the previous year was achieved. This was equivalent to a level of 84% measured against the pre-crisis year 2019. With 394,869 flights, passenger flights in 2023 recovered by a share of around 82% compared to 2019. The occupancy rate for passenger flights achieved new highs almost every month, which resulted in the highest occupancy rates in the history of the airport for 2023 as a whole. The seat load factor of around 81% was approximately three percentage points above the previous year's figure. The quotient **passengers per passenger aircraft movement** increased by around 5% to a high of 150.3. **Maximum take-off weights** increased compared to the previous year by 11.4% to 27.0 million metric tons, thus reaching 85% of the year 2019.\n\n#### **Development outside the Frankfurt site**\n\nThe passenger volume at **Ljubljana** Airport grew by 30.9% to around 1.3 million passengers compared to the previous year. This positive development is primarily due to the resumption of flight connections, which had been suspended due to the temporary insolvency of Adria Airways in autumn 2019 and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPassenger numbers at the Brazilian airports **Fortaleza** and **Porto Alegre** developed in opposite directions due to differing circumstances during the course of the year. In Fortaleza, the decrease in domestic tourist travel and the pullout of some GOL connections were the main reasons for the reduction in domestic passenger numbers. In contrast, Porto Alegre recorded an increase in domestic passenger numbers due to its geographical proximity to important Brazilian aviation hubs in São Paulo and its relevance as an industrial location in southern Brazil. The development of international traffic was positive at both airports. The frequencies and routes on international lines rose successively in particular in South America. On the whole, both airports recorded passenger numbers of 13.1 million passengers. This corresponds to growth of +5.4% compared to 2022. Fortaleza welcomed 5.3 million domestic passengers (–4.5%) and around 0.3 million international passengers (+26.0%) in the year as a whole. Porto Alegre recorded 7.1 million domestic passengers (+10.9%) and around 0.4 million international passengers (+53.0%).\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith around 21.2 million passengers in 2023, **Lima** Airport recorded an increase in traffic compared to the previous year (+14.1%) despite the effects of the political situation in the first half of the year domestic passenger operations recorded around 13.1 million passengers (+11.7%). In the international segment, the airport recorded growth in particular with the connections to North America and Europe. International traffic therefore also made a positive contribution to growth with 8.1 million passengers (+18.2%).\n\nWith around 33.9 million passengers, **Fraport Greece** recorded an increase of around 11.8% in the 2023 reporting period compared to the adjusted previous year's figure of around 30.3 million passengers (adjusted value in the 2022 Annual Report: 31.2 million passengers). Passenger numbers were already above the respective previous year's figures at the beginning of the year. This trend continued during the important main tourist season and the entire year. Overall, domestic traffic was 17.0% above the previous year's level, while international traffic grew by 6.5%. The largest number of foreign passengers in terms of total passengers came from Great Britain (around 20%), followed by Germany (around 14%), and Italy (around 6%).\n\nAt the Bulgarian airports in **Varna** and **Burgas** operated by Fraport Twin Star, the number of passengers in 2023 increased to approximately 3.7 million, 17.9% above the previous year's figure. The overall recovery in traffic after the pandemic was weaker than at other tourist airports in Europe in 2023. In particular, the charter business in Burgas developed below expectations. From the end of February, the war in Ukraine and Israel resulted in a shortfall of Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian and Israeli passengers, which was partly offset by higher demand from Central and Eastern European countries. In addition, more traffic in the off-season in the first half of the year was recorded. For the year as a whole, this led to an increase in both domestic (+6%) and international passenger numbers (+19%) compared to the previous year. Most of the passengers came from Germany (around 20%), Poland (around 17%), and Great Britain (around 15%).\n\nPassenger numbers at **Antalya** Airport in the 2023 fiscal year were around 35.7 million passengers (previous year: 31.1 million). This surpassed the previous record passenger numbers from 2019. International passenger traffic showed a growth rate of +17.1%, while domestic traffic grew by +5.9%. Compared to the previous year, almost all relevant international passenger groups achieved double-digit growth rates. The passenger numbers from Poland, Romania and Germany had particularly strong growth. Due to the war, no passengers were recorded for Ukraine. The largest passenger groups were travelers from Germany (approximately 28%), Russia (approximately 22%), and Great Britain (approximately 10%).\n\n|                   | Share in % | Passengers1) |               | Cargo (air freight + air mail in m. t.) |               | Movements |               |\n|-------------------|------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|\n|                   |            | 2023         | Change in %2) | 2023                                    | Change in %2) | 2023      | Change in %2) |\n|                   |            |              |               |                                         |               |           |               |\n| Frankfurt         | 100        | 59,355,389   | +21.3         | 1,869,090                               | – 5.0         | 430,436   | +12.6         |\n| Ljubljana         | 100        | 1,270,382    | +30.9         | 11,443                                  | – 8.3         | 22,749    | +5.5          |\n| Fortaleza         | 100        | 5,589,563    | – 3.3         | 45,911                                  | +9.9          | 53,199    | – 2.0         |\n| Porto Alegre      | 100        | 7,492,866    | +12.7         | 40,422                                  | +4.9          | 72,634    | +9.4          |\n| Lima              | 80.01      | 21,246,660   | +14.1         | 213,775                                 | – 2.2         | 170,515   | +13.7         |\n| Fraport Greece    | 65         | 33,870,682   | +11.8         | 5,927                                   | +4.8          | 264,744   | +4.9          |\n| Fraport Twin Star | 60         | 3,686,997    | +17.9         | 2,618                                   | – 58.8        | 27,024    | +14.0         |\n| Antalya           | 51/503)    | 35,735,407   | +15.0         | n.a.                                    | n.a.          | 222,235   | +14.8         |\n|                   |            |              |               |                                         |               |           |               |\n\n#### **Traffic development at the signifikant Group sites**\n\n1) Commercial traffic only, in + out + transit.\n\n2) As a result of late submissions, there may be changes to the figures reported for the previous year.\n\n3) Share of voting rights: 51 %, dividend share: 50 %.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Comparison with the forecasted passenger development**\n\n|                   |  | 2023 Adjustments during the year Interim Report Q2/6M 2023  | Forecast 2022                                                   | 20221)     | 2019       |\n|-------------------|--|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Frankfurt         |  | 59,355,389 Middle of the given forecast                     | Passenger growth of over 80% to<br>around 90% of the 2019 level | 48,918,482 | 70,556,072 |\n| Ljubljana         |  | 1,270,382 –                                                 | Approximately 75% of the passenger<br>volume in 2019            | 970,152    | 1,721,355  |\n| Fortaleza         |  | 5,589,563 –                                                 | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 5,778,038  | 7,218,697  |\n| Porto Alegre      |  | 7,492,866 –                                                 | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 6,654,062  | 8,298,205  |\n| Lima              |  | 21,246,660 –                                                | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 18,619,536 | 23,578,600 |\n| Fraport Greece    |  | 33,870,682 Passenger numbers above previous<br>year's level | Approximately at previous yeahr high<br>level                   | 31,193,278 | 30,152,728 |\n| Fraport Twin Star |  | 3,686,997 –                                                 | Further recovery compared to 2022                               | 3,127,767  | 4,970,095  |\n| Antalya           |  | 35,735,407 –                                                | Further recovery towards pre-crisis level                       | 31,077,452 | 35,483,190 |\n\n1) As a result of late submissions, there may be changes to the figures reported for the previous year.\n\nPassenger traffic at the Group airports predominantly developed within the forecasts provided in the 2022 Annual Report and adjusted in the second quarter/half-yearly report 2023. Due to the lower number of domestic passengers, the forecast for Fortaleza Airport could not be achieved.\n\n# **Group's Results of Operations**\n\n#### **Revenue**\n\nAt €4,000.5 million, revenue in the Fraport Group in the 2023 fiscal year was above the previous year's figure by €806.1 million. Adjusted for contract revenue from construction and expansion services based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €621.8 million to €3,485.1 million.\n\nThe increase at the Frankfurt site mainly resulted from higher revenue from airport charges (+€196.0 million) as well as higher revenue from infrastructure charges (+€76.4 million) and ground services (+€51.6 million) based on traffic volumes and prices. The retail and parking revenue also increased by +€33.1 million and +€22.7 million respectively based on traffic volume. Due to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved for the first time in the reporting period. In contrast, revenue from security services decreased by €155.3 million compared to the previous year as a result of the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023.\n\nAmong the international Group airports, contributions to adjusted revenue growth came, in particular, from Fraport Greece (+€74.8 million) and the Group company Lima (+€48.5 million) based on the positive traffic developments.\n\n#### **Other operating income**\n\nAt €59.0 million, other operating income was below the previous year by €80.3 million.\n\nIn the reporting period, the two Brazilian Group companies reached a further agreement regarding compensation for the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The reimbursement claims realized amounted to a total of €18.6 million. Furthermore, other operating income was positively impacted by a total of €11.1 million due to the pro-rata disposal and the associated deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023, as well as the recognition of the remaining shares (49%) at fair value. Moreover, income of €11.0 million resulted from the settlement of a legal dispute at the Group company Fraport USA in connection with the early termination of the retail concession agreement in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn contrast, other operating income in the prior year period was impacted positively impacted by the disposal of shares in the Group companies Xi'an (€53.7 million), which is accounted for using the equity method, and D-Port Logistik GmbH (€18.6 million). In addition, other operating income in the previous year included reimbursement claims for Fraport Greece (€23.6 million) and the Brazilian Group companies (€18.5 million).\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Expenses**\n\nPersonnel expenses in the Group increased in the 2023 fiscal year by €39.3 million to €1,076.0 million. Despite a lower average number of employees, the increase is primarily due to increases in the collective bargaining agreement at the Frankfurt site. Non-staff costs (cost of materials and other operating expenses) were €1,830.0 million (+€522.9 million). Adjusted for expenses related to the application of IFRIC 12, non-staff expenses were €1,314.6 million (+€338.6 million). The increase is mainly attributable to higher external services costs (+€224.7 million), primarily in connection with taking over the management of security checks at Frankfurt Airport. In addition, based on traffic volume, higher variable concession charges at the International Group companies (+€69.4 million) and higher expenses for maintenance (+€33.0 million) as well as utility services (+€14.5 million) contributed to the increase in the cost of materials.\n\n#### **EBITDA and EBIT**\n\nAt €1,204.0 million, Group EBITDA was €174.2 million above the level in the same period of the previous year. Greater depreciation and amortization of €501.2 million (+€35.9 million) resulted in Group EBIT of €702.8 million (+€138.3 million).\n\n#### **Financial result**\n\nThe financial result in the reporting period amounted to –€148.9 million (previous year: –€330.6 million). The change compared to the same period of the previous year is essentially due to the other financial result. This was negatively impacted in the previous year by the full write-off of a loan made to Thalita Trading Ltd. in the amount of €163.3 million in connection with the investment in St. Petersburg Airport.\n\nInterest income increased by €47.9 million in the 2023 fiscal year compared to the previous year, primarily due to higher interest from call and time deposits. The interest expenses of –€317.9 million in the reporting period were €4.4 million below the previous year (previous year: –€315.5 million). This was, in particular, a result from higher financing costs at Fraport AG. This was offset by one-off effects in the previous year amounting to –€19.3 million in connection with the refinancing in Greece.\n\nThe result from companies accounted for using the equity method increased by €7.5 million to €84.5 million. This is in particular due to be increase in earnings of the operating company in Antalya (+€22.0 million). The positive one-off effect in the previous year in connection with the write-up of the shares in the Group company Xi'an due to the sale in the amount of €20.0 million was clearly overcompensated by this.\n\n#### **EBT, Group result, and EPS**\n\nEBT in the reporting period amounted to €553.9 million (previous year: €233.9 million). With a consolidated tax rate of 22.3%, the income tax expense amounted to €123.4 million (previous year: €67.3 million). The Group result was €430.5 million (previous year: €166.6 million). This resulted in basic earnings per share of €4.26 (previous year: €1.43).\n\n#### **Development of the Group's financial figures**\n\n| € million                             | 2023    | 2022    | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|\n|                                       |         |         |        |             |\n| Revenue                               | 4,000.5 | 3,194.4 | +806.1 | +25.2       |\n| Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12         | 3,485.1 | 2,863.3 | +621.8 | +21.7       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 1,076.0 | 1,036.7 | +39.3  | +3.8        |\n| Cost of materials                     | 1,637.3 | 1,101.6 | +535.7 | +48.6       |\n| EBITDA                                | 1,204.0 | 1,029.8 | +174.2 | +16.9       |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 501.2   | 465.3   | +35.9  | +7.7        |\n| EBIT                                  | 702.8   | 564.5   | +138.3 | +24.5       |\n| Group result                          | 430.5   | 166.6   | +263.9 | > 100       |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 18,057  | 19,211  | –1,154 | –6.0        |\n| Average number of employees           | 17,840  | 18,850  | –1,010 | –5.4        |\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nConsolidated Financials Statements\n\n| Comparison with the forecasted development |                                                               |                                                                          |          |        |             |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-------------|\n| € million                                  | 2023 Adjustments during the year<br>Interim Report Q2/6M 2023 | Forecast 2022                                                            | 2022     | Change | Change in % |\n| EBITDA                                     | 1,204.0 In the upper range of the forecasts                   | Between approximately €1,040 million and approximately<br>€1,200 million | +1,029.8 | +174.2 | +16.        |\n| Group result                               | 430.5 In the upper range of the forecasts                     | Between about €300 million and<br>up to about €420 million               | +166.6   | +263.9 | > 10        |\n| Dividend per share in €                    | 0.00 –                                                        | No distribution                                                          | 0.0      | 0.0    | –           |\n\nThe key figures EBITDA and the Group result trended at the upper end or slightly above the forecast provided in the 2022 Annual Report.\n\n# **Results of Operations for Segments**\n\nRevenue in the 2023 fiscal year in the **Aviation** segment increased by €270.7 million to €1,098.8 million (+32.7%). Higher revenue from airport charges (+€196.0 million) based on the higher traffic volume and positive price effects primarily contributed to revenue growth. Due to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved in the reporting period. In contrast, revenue from security services decreased by €155.3 million as a result of the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023. Other operating income of €11.1 million resulted from the recognition of the remaining shares of FraSec Aviation Security GmbH at fair value and the realization of the equity disposal. Personnel expenses also decreased to €244.0 million (-€81.6 million) due to reduced headcount as part of the deconsolidation with a countervailing price effect. On the other hand, the cost of materials increased by €203.8 million compared to the same period of the previous year to €255.9 million. This was particularly related to increased expenses for external services in the course of taking over the management of aviation security checks. Due to the positive operating performance, the segment's EBITDA amounted to €308.3 million (previous year: €175.4 million). With higher depreciation and amortization (+€21.7 million), EBIT amounted to €151.8 million (previous year: €40.6 million).\n\n#### **Aviation**\n\n| € million                             | 2023    | 2022  | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Revenue                               | 1,098.8 | 828.1 | +270.7 | +32.7       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 244.0   | 325.6 | -81.6  | -25.2       |\n| Cost of materials                     | 255.9   | 52.1  | +203.8 | > 100       |\n| EBITDA                                | 308.3   | 175.4 | +132.9 | +75.8       |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 156.5   | 134.8 | +21.7  | +16.2       |\n| EBIT                                  | 151.8   | 40.6  | +111.2 | > 100       |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 3,496   | 5,624 | -2,128 | -37.8       |\n| Average number of employees           | 3,447   | 5,569 | -2,122 | -38.2       |\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/4 description: The image is a square icon with a white background and a blue border. Inside the square are three blue objects: a house, a shirt, and a gift. The house is in the upper right corner, the shirt is in the upper left corner, and the gift is in the lower center.\n\nThe positive traffic development was also reflected in the **Retail & Real Estate** segment's revenue of €498.8 million (+€52.4 million). The reason for this was higher retail and parking revenue (+€33.1 million and +€22.7 million respectively) Net retail revenue per passenger was €3.30 (previous year: €3.33). Other operating income decreased to\n\n€16.5 million (previous year: €30.7 million). The reason for the decline was high one-off income from the sale of shares in the Group company D-Port Logistik GmbH, which is accounted for using the equity method, in 2022. Personnel expenses increased in particular as a result of increases in the collective bargaining agreement (+€5.7 million). The cost of materials increased by €12.1 million. The reason was mainly price increases in utility services. Despite the higher personnel expenses and cost of materials, the EBITDA segment amounted to €369.9 million (+€27.0 million). With higher depreciation and amortization (+€9.3 million), segment EBIT stood at €274.0 million (+€17.7 million).\n\n#### **Retail & Real Estate**\n\n| € million                             | 2023  | 2022  | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Revenue                               | 498.8 | 446.4 | +52.4  | +11.7       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 54.6  | 48.9  | +5.7   | +11.7       |\n| Cost of materials                     | 158.6 | 146.5 | +12.1  | +8.3        |\n| EBITDA                                | 369.9 | 342.9 | +27.0  | +7.9        |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 95.9  | 86.6  | +9.3   | +10.2       |\n| EBIT                                  | 274.0 | 256.3 | +17.7  | +6.9        |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 600   | 573   | +27    | +4.7        |\n| Average number of employees           | 594   | 576   | +18    | +3.3        |\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/9 description: The image shows a blue square with a white border.

The strong traffic development at Frankfurt Airport and price increases led to higher revenue from infrastructure charges (+€76.4 million) and ground services (+€51.6 million). Staff number and price effects led to an increase in personnel expenses by €69.5 million. Cost of materials increased by €20.5 million to €108.9 million. This was mainly due to the increased use of employees from personnel service provider agencies due to the traffic volume, in particular at the Group company Fraport Ground Services GmbH (formerly FraGround Fraport Ground Handling Professionals GmbH). Segment EBITDA was –€34.1 million (previous year: –€73.9 million). Segment EBIT improved to –€74.0 million\n\n(previous year: –€111.6 million).\n\n#### **Ground Handling**\n\n| € million                             | 2023  | 2022   | Change | Change in % |\n|---------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Revenue                               | 676.8 | 550.1  | +126.7 | +23.1       |\n| Personnel expenses                    | 451.7 | 382.2  | +69.5  | +18.1       |\n| Cost of materials                     | 108.9 | 88.4   | +20.5  | +23.1       |\n| EBITDA                                | -34.1 | -73.9  | +39.8  | +53.5       |\n| Depreciation and amortization         | 39.9  | 37.7   | +2.2   | +5.8        |\n| EBIT                                  | -74.0 | -111.6 | +37.6  | +33.7       |\n| Number of employees as of December 31 | 8,010 | 7,404  | +606   | +8.2        |\n| Average number of employees           | 7,716 | 7,035  | +681   | +9.7        |\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/70/Picture/4 description: The image shows a blue logo with a globe and an airplane.

Adjusted for contract revenue from construction and expansion services based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue grew to €1,210.7 million (+€172.0 million) due to the Group-wide positive traffic development. Other\n\noperating income in the segment was €34.8 million. Other operating income in the previous year was mainly impacted positively by the disposal of shares in the Group company Xi'an, which was accounted for using the equity method, in the amount of €53.7 million. Personnel expenses increased by €45.7 million to €325.7 million primarily due to the increased traffic volume. Cost of materials in the segment increased by €299.3 million to 1,113.9 million (+36.7%) compared to the same period of the previous year. Adjusted for the expenses relating to the application of IFRIC 12, the cost of materials increased by €115.0 million to €598.5 million (+23.8%). This was caused, in particular, by higher variable concession charges. Segment EBITDA decreased to €559.8 million (–€25.6 million) due to lower other income. With depreciation and amortization virtually unchanged, segment EBIT stood at €350.9 million (–€28.3 million).\n\n#### **International Activities & Services**\n\n| € million                               | 2023    | 2022    | Change | Change in % |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|\n|                                         |         |         |        |             |\n| Revenue                                 | 1,726.1 | 1,369.8 | +356.3 | +26.0       |\n| Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12           | 1,210.7 | 1,038.7 | +172.0 | +16.6       |\n| Personnel expenses                      | 325.7   | 280.0   | +45.7  | +16.3       |\n| Cost of materials                       | 1,113.9 | 814.6   | +299.3 | +36.7       |\n| Cost of materials adjusted for IFRIC 12 | 598.5   | 483.5   | +115.0 | +23.8       |\n| EBITDA                                  | 559.8   | 585.4   | -25.6  | -4.4        |\n| Depreciation and amortization           | 208.9   | 206.2   | +2.7   | +1.3        |\n| EBIT                                    | 350.9   | 379.2   | -28.3  | -7.5        |\n| Number of employees as of December 31   | 5,951   | 5,610   | +341   | +6.2        |\n| Average number of employees             | 6,083   | 5,670   | +413   | +7.3        |\n\n#### **Development of the key Group companies outside of Frankfurt (IFRS values before consolidation)**\n\n| € million                  | Share in % | Revenue1) |       |       | EBITDA |       |       | EBIT  |       |       | Result |       |       |\n|----------------------------|------------|-----------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------|-------|\n|                            |            | 2023      | 2022  | Δ %   | 2023   | 2022  | Δ %   | 2023  | 2022  | Δ %   | 2023   | 2022  | Δ %   |\n|                            |            |           |       |       |        |       |       |       |       |       |        |       |       |\n| Fraport USA                | 100        | 115.7     | 103.4 | +11.9 | 61.6   | 49.6  | +24.2 | 29.0  | 4.8   | > 100 | 16.4   | -1.8  | –     |\n| Fraport Slovenija          | 100        | 43.4      | 33.9  | +28.0 | 12.8   | 7.6   | +68.4 | 2.4   | -2.7  | –     | 1.8    | -2.6  | –     |\n| Fortaleza + Porto Alegre2) | 100        | 108.3     | 90.0  | +20.3 | 66.4   | 60.1  | +10.5 | 31.0  | 28.8  | +7.6  | 2.4    | -3.5  | –     |\n| Lima                       | 80.01      | 792.0     | 590.1 | +34.2 | 109.2  | 100.2 | +9.0  | 80.3  | 83.4  | -3.7  | 32.1   | 37.2  | -13.7 |\n| Fraport Greece3)           | 65         | 545.2     | 443.8 | +22.8 | 271.3  | 271.7 | -0.1  | 206.3 | 208.5 | -1.1  | 79.1   | 69.9  | +13.2 |\n| Twin Star                  | 60         | 51.2      | 43.5  | +17.7 | 20.6   | 19.3  | +6.7  | 10.9  | 8.6   | +26.7 | 5.8    | 4.2   | +38.1 |\n| Antalya                    | 51/504)    | 467.7     | 396.6 | +17.9 | 371.6  | 323.0 | +15.0 | 255.3 | 208.3 | +22.6 | 163.7  | 119.6 | +36.9 |\n\n1) Revenue adjusted for IFRIC 12: Lima 2023: €326,4 million (2022: €277,9 million); Fraport Greece 2023: €508,3 million (2022: €433,5 million);\n\nFortaleza + Porto Alegre: 2023: €95,4 million (2022: €81,3 million); Antalya 2023: €463,2 million (2022: €388,8 million).\n\n2) Sum of the Group companies Fortaleza and Porto Alegre.\n\n3) The Group companies Fraport Regional Airports of Greece A and Fraport Regional Airports of Greece B as well as the Fraport Regional Airports of Greece Management Company are collectively referred to as \"Fraport Greece\".\n\n4) Share of voting rights: 51%, dividend share: 50 %.\n\nThe recovery in passenger numbers in the 2023 fiscal year resulted in an increase in revenue at **Fraport USA** to €115.7 million (previous year: €103.4 million). Other operating income was primarily driven by the settlement of a legal dispute at the Group company Fraport USA in connection with the early termination of the retail concession in Pittsburgh (€11.0 million). Operating expenses increased by €8.2 million to €65.2 million, mainly due to the increased variable concession charges in connection with the positive traffic development. At €61.6 million, EBITDA was higher than in the same period the previous year of €49.6 million. With lower depreciation and amortization costs (–€12.2 million) due to an unscheduled depreciation in the previous year, EBIT amounted to €29.0 million (previous year: €4.8 million). Despite negative currency effects, the result increased slightly by €18.2 million to €16.4 million (previous year: –€1.8 million).\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe increased demand for travel in 2023 was reflected in higher revenue of €43.4 million (+€9.4 million) at the Group company **Fraport Slovenia**. Operating expenses increased by €4.6 million to €31.1 million due to the increased traffic volume. Compared to the previous year, EBITDA improved by €5.2 million to €12.8 million (previous year €7.6 million). Constant depreciation and amortization led to an EBIT of €2.4 million (previous year: –€2.7 million). The result improved to €1.8 million (previous year: –€2.6 million).\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the overall positive traffic development at the Brazilian Group companies **Fortaleza** and **Porto Alegre** was reflected in higher revenue of €108.3 million (+€18.3 million). Adjusted for the revenue relating to capacitive capital expenditure based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €14.1 million (+17.3%). In addition to higher passenger numbers, the growth in revenue also benefited from exchange rate effects. At €20.4 million, other operating income was again positive due to compensation for the effects from the coronavirus pandemic but was still below the previous year's figure (previous year: €24.5 million). The cost of materials increased by €6.3 million to €39.2 million (+18.8%) in particular due to capacitive capital expenditure based on the application of IFRIC 12. Adjusted for the expenses in connection with capacitive capital expenditure, cost of materials increased by €2.0 million to €26.4 million (+8.7%). Correspondingly, EBITDA increased to €66.4 million (previous year: €60.1 million). EBIT amounted to €31.0 million (previous year: €28.8 million), and the result was €2.4 million (previous year: -€3.5 million).\n\nThe ongoing recovery in traffic had a positive effect on the financial development of the Group company in **Lima**. Despite slightly negative currency effects, revenue recorded a significant increase to €792.0 million (+€201.9 million). Adjusted for the revenue relating to capacitive capital expenditure based on the application of IFRIC 12, revenue was €326.4 million (+€48.5 million). The cost of materials increased year-on-year by €185.8 million to €651.9 million. Adjusted for expenses resulting from the application of IFRIC 12, cost of materials increased by €32.3 million to €186.2 million. This was a result of higher concession charges based on the traffic volume as well as higher cost of materials due to the progressing expansion measures. Personnel expenses also increased to €19.1 million (+16.6%). At €109.2 million, EBITDA was €9.0 million higher than in the same period of the previous year (€100.2 million). The inauguration of the new runway resulted in higher depreciation and amortization (+€12.2 million) As a result, EBIT increased year-on-year to €80.3 million (-€3.1 million). With a lower financial result, the result amounted to €32.1 million (–€5.1 million).\n\nIn 2023, **Fraport Greece** recorded revenue of €545.2 million (+€101.4 million). Adjusted for contract revenue from capital expenditure relating to the application of IFRIC 12, revenue increased by €74.8 million to €508.3 million. This is primarily due to higher airport charges based on prices and traffic volume, and retail revenue. Operating expenses increased by €78.1 million to €274.1 million. Adjusted for expenses resulting from the application of IFRIC 12, operating expenses increased by €51.4 million to €237.1 million due to higher concession charges. At €271.3 million and €206.3 million respectively, EBITDA and EBIT were almost at the previous year's level (previous year: €271.7 million and €208.5 million respectively). Lower concession payments were made in the previous year. In addition, the previous year's figure was increased by other operating income/compensation claims. The financial result improved slightly, leading to a result of €79.1 million (previous year: €69.9 million).\n\nRevenue also increased to €51.2 million (€7.7 million) at the Group company **Twin Star** due to the improved development of traffic. Driven by volume and price effects, operating expenses during the reporting period amounted to €31.5 million (+€7.2 million). Correspondingly, EBITDA increased slightly to €20.6 million (+€1.3 million). EBIT amounted to €10.9 million, and the result was €5.8 million.\n\nThe Group company **Antalya**, which is accounted for using the equity method, generated revenue of €467.7 million in the reporting period, an increase of €71.1 million due to traffic volumes. EBITDA increased accordingly by €48.6 million to €371.6 million. EBIT was €255.3 million (previous year: €208.3 million), and the result was €163.7 million (previous year: €119.6 million).\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Comparison with the forecasted development**\n\n| EBITDA<br>in € million              |  | 2023  | Forecast 2022                                        | 2022  | Change | Change in % |\n|-------------------------------------|--|-------|------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Aviation                            |  | 308.3 | Above 2019 level<br>of €273.3 million                | 175.4 | +132.9 | +75.8       |\n| Retail & Real Estate                |  | 369.9 | Improvement in<br>EBITDA towards<br>pre-crisis level | 342.9 | +27.0  | +7.9        |\n| Ground Handling                     |  | -34.1 | Negative territory                                   | -73.9 | +39.8  | +53.9       |\n| International Activities & Services |  | 559.8 | Significant decline -<br>still above 2019 level      | 585.4 | -25.6  | -4.4        |\n\nThe key figures developed in line with the forecasts.\n\n# **Asset and Financial Position**\n\n#### **Asset and capital structure**\n\nAt €18,890.9 million, **total assets** as at December 31, 2023 were €1,283.3 million (+7.3%) above the previous year.\n\n**Non-current assets** increased by €687.0 million to €15,053.1 million. This is primarily attributable to the increase in property, plant, and equipment (+€579.7 million) in connection with capital expenditure at the Frankfurt site. Investments in airport operating projects increased by €377.7 million as a result of the ongoing expansion at the Group company in Lima. Other financial assets decreased by €220.3 million due to reclassifications based on maturity, which were offset by lower additions to securities as well as investments in promissory note loans.\n\nAt €3,837.7 million, **current assets** were €607.6 million above the comparable value as at December 31, 2022. The increase resulted in particular from higher current financial assets (+€579.5 million). The above mentioned reclassifications based on maturity and other additions to securities were offset by lower scheduled disposals. Furthermore, higher trade accounts receivable (+€94.4 million) due to traffic volumes and higher financial (+€57.0 million) and non-financial receivables and assets (+€39.7 million) due to the balance sheet date contributed to the increase in current assets. Cash and cash equivalents, on the other hand, decreased by €174.7 million.\n\nAt €4,592.3 million, **shareholders' equity** as at the balance sheet date 2023 was €460.4 million higher than as at December 31, 2022. The increase resulted, in particular, from the positive Group result of €430.5 million. The **shareholders' equity ratio** increased to 22.9% compared to previous year (December 31, 2022: 22.2%).\n\n**Non-current liabilities** increased by €485.7 million to €11,718.3 million (+4.3%), in particular due to long-term financial liabilities (+€516.5 million). The borrowings in connection with the project financing in Lima, which was completed in December 2022, as well as other long-term financing measures at Fraport AG, were offset by scheduled reclassifications. In addition, **current liabilities** rose in the reporting period by €349.3 million to €2,580.3 million (+15.7%). Reclassifications based on maturity were offset by the repayment of the bridge financing at the Lima Group company and other current financial liabilities of Fraport AG.\n\n**Gross financial debt** as at December 31, 2023 was €11,753.9 million, up €828.3 million from €10,925.6 million as at December 31, 2022. **Group liquidity** also increased by €174.4 million to €4,041.3 million. Correspondingly, **net financial debt** increased by €653.9 million to €7,712.6 million (December 31, 2022: €7,058.7 million). The **gearing ratio** reached a level of 178.6% (value as at December 31, 2022: 180.6%). The **net financial debt to EBITDA** ratio reached a level of 6.4 (previous year: 6.9).\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Structure of the consolidated financial position as at December 31**\n\nImage /page/73/Figure/2 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the assets, liabilities, and equity in 2022 and 2023 in millions of Euros. In 2023, the assets are divided into non-current assets (15,053.1), current assets (3,837.7), and non-current assets held for sale (0.1), totaling 18,890.9. The liabilities and equity are divided into shareholders' equity (4,592.3), non-current liabilities (11,718.3), current liabilities (2,580.3), and liabilities related to assets held for sale (0.0). In 2022, the assets are divided into non-current assets (14,366.1), current assets (3,230.1), and non-current assets held for sale (11.4), totaling 17,607.6. The liabilities and equity are divided into shareholders' equity (4,131.9), non-current liabilities (11,232.6), current liabilities (2,231.0), and liabilities related to assets held for sale (12.1).\n\n### **Additions to non-current assets**\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the additions to non-current assets of the Fraport Group totaled €1,501.7 million, €343.0 million more than the previous year (previous year: €1,158.7 million). They related to €955.8 million in property, plant and equipment (previous year: €779.8 million) and €536.9 million (previous year: €374.1 million) in investments in \"airport operating projects\". The item \"Other intangible assets\" accounted for €7.7 million (previous year: €4.7 million), and €1.3 million to \"investment property\" (previous year: €0.1 million). The capitalization of interest expenses relating to construction work amounted to €71.0 million (previous year: €43.9 million).\n\nAt Fraport AG, the additions to non-current assets amounted to €935.6 million (previous year: €764.6 million). Capital expenditure was mostly attributed to the Expansion South project at the Frankfurt site – mainly relating to Terminal 3 and the passenger transport system – as well as modernization and maintenance measures for existing infrastructure.\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, additions to assets will also be primarily characterized by multi-year capital expenditure for the capacity expansion in Frankfurt and Lima.\n\nThe additions to non-current assets are attributed to the individual segments as follows:\n\nImage /page/73/Figure/8 description: The image is a donut chart showing additions per segment in millions of euros. The segments are International Activities & Services, Aviation, Ground Handling, and Retail & Real Estate. For International Activities & Services, the additions in 2023 are 590.1 and in 2022 are 409.1. For Aviation, the additions in 2023 are 553.4 and in 2022 are 426.0. For Ground Handling, the additions in 2023 are 116.1 and in 2022 are 92.9. For Retail & Real Estate, the additions in 2023 are 242.1 and in 2022 are 230.7.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nCapital expenditure in the **Aviation** segment amounting to €553.4 million (previous year: €426.0 million) primarily concerned the ongoing construction work in connection with the Frankfurt Airport Expansion South project. Most of this amount related to Terminal 3 and the passenger transport system.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, the **Retail & Real Estate** segment recorded additions to assets in the amount of €242.1 million (previous year: €230.7 million). The measures also concerned, in particular, the Expansion South project.\n\nThe **Ground Handling** segment recorded additions amounting to €116.1 million (previous year: €92.9 million). These mainly included the modernization measures for existing facilities as well as capital expenditure in connection with the Expansion South project.\n\nIn the **International Activities & Services** segment, additions to non-current assets amounted to €590.1 million (previous year: €409.1 million). The additions related mainly to the Group company Lima in connection with the infrastructure expansion.\n\n### **Statement of cash flows**\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, **cash flow from operating activities (operating cash flow)** of €863.2 million (2022: €787.3 million) was generated. The improvement of €75.9 million resulted in particular from an increase in the operating result.\n\n**Cash flow used in investing activities without investments in cash deposits and securities** amounted to €1,482.6 million in the past fiscal year, an increase of €176.8 million year-on-year. The increase was primarily the result of higher investments in airport operating projects, particularly in Lima, as well as increased cash outflows for expansion measures at the Frankfurt site. In the previous year, the cash outflow was mainly impacted by capital contributions of –€375.3 million to the new joint venture that was established in connection with the operating concession at Antalya Airport and, on the other hand, by the proceeds from the disposal of the shares in the associated company Xi'an of +€152.2 million. Considering investments in and revenue from securities, promissory note loans, and time deposits, the overall **cash flow used in investing activities** was €1,818.9 million (2022: €1,216.0 million).\n\nCompared to the previous year, **cash flow used in financing activities** decreased slightly by €86.9 million to €795.4 million. The raising of funds from the project financing concluded in December 2022 at the Group company Lima and the associated repayment of the short-term bridge loan had an effect of €675.1 million on the payments of non-current financial liabilities and –€302.4 million on the change in current financial liabilities. The capital increases \"Non-controlling interests\" relate to capital contributions to the minority shareholders of the company Lima. In the previous year, the sale of capital and loan shares to a co-shareholder of the Greek companies was reported under \"transactions with non-controlling interests\". Taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and other changes, the Fraport Group reported cash and cash equivalents based on the consolidated statement of cash flows of €670.3 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: €826.2 million).\n\n**Free cash flow** amounted to –€656.4 million (2022: –€741.0 million).\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation to cash and cash equivalents as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### **Reconciliation to the cash and cash equivalents as at the consolidated statement of financial position**\n\n**in € million December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022** Bank and cash balances 180.1 579.6 Time deposits with a remaining term of less than three months 490.2 246.6 **Cash and cash equivalents as at the consolidated statement of cash flows 670.3 826.2** Time deposits with a remaining term of more than three months 1,614.0 1,619.7 Restricted cash 126.2 139.3 **Cash and cash equivalents as at the consolidated statement of financial position 2,410.5 2,585.2**\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Summary of the statement of cash flows and reconciliation to the Group's liquidity**\n\nImage /page/75/Figure/5 description: This image is a bar chart showing the group's liquidity as at December 31, 2023, in millions of euros. The first bar shows cash and cash equivalents as at January 1, 2023, which is 826.2. The second bar shows cash flow from operating activities, which is 863.2. The third bar shows cash flow used in investing activities excluding cash deposits and securities, which is -1,482.6. The fourth bar shows cash flow used in investing activities in cash deposits and securities, which is -336.3. The fifth bar shows cash flow from financing activities, which is 795.4. The sixth bar shows foreign currency translation effects and other changes on cash and cash equivalents, which is 4.4. The seventh bar shows cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2023, which is 670.3. The eighth bar shows short-term realizable assets, which is 3,371.0. The ninth bar shows the group's liquidity as at December 31, 2023, which is 4,041.3.\n\n#### **Financing analysis**\n\nIn 2023, the finance management of the Fraport Group continued to pursue balanced funding via a diversified debt financing base with a balanced maturity profile. As at the balance sheet date, there was a balanced mix of financing, consisting of promissory note loans (20.9%), corporate bonds (17.9%), bilateral loans (43.4%), and project financing (17.8%).\n\nTo reduce interest rate risks from borrowing with floating interest rates, in the past interest rate hedging transactions were concluded in some cases. In the course of a project financing in Lima, new interest rate hedging derivatives were concluded in 2023 in order to reduce the interest rate risk from project financing. The related nominal volume amounted to €530.7 million as at yearend (previous year: €0.0 million). Overall, the financial liabilities had an average remaining term of 6.2 years with an average interest maturity of approximately 5.1 years after hedging measures. Taking into account interest rate hedging transactions, the floating rate portion of the gross debt of the Fraport Group was approximately 17%, and the fixed portion approximately 83%. The cost of debt after hedging measures was 2.9%.\n\nFully consolidated Group companies in Germany are mostly integrated into the Fraport AG cash pool, so that acquiring separate external funding was not necessary. Funding for fully consolidated foreign Group companies was primarily obtained through previously concluded project financing agreements in the 2023 fiscal year. No analysis or calculation of the financial debt structure and liquidity at segment level is carried out.\n\nThe key features of the Group financing instruments with regard to type, maturity, and interest rate structures are presented in the following table:\n\n#### **Financial debt structure**\n\n| Financing type                                                    | Year of origin | Nominal volume in € million | Maturity    | Repayment structure                   | Interest          | Interest rate                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Promissory note loans                                             | 2012 – 2023    | 2,455.0                     | 2024 – 2034 | End of term                           | Fixed<br>Floating | 0.548 % – 5.774 % p. a.<br>6M-Euribor + Margin |\n| Corporate bond                                                    | 2009 – 2021    | 2,100.0                     | 2024 – 2029 | End of term                           | Fixed             | 1.034 % – 5.875 % p.a.                         |\n| Bilateral loans                                                   | 1999 – 2023    | 5,075.4                     | 2024 – 2032 | Mainly end of term                    | Mainly fixed      | 0.28 % – 5.76 % p. a.                          |\n| Project financing (fully consolidated<br>foreign Group companies) | 2017 – 2023    | 2,088.5                     | 2024 – 2045 | Ongoing repayments during<br>the term | Mainly fixed      | 4.49 % – 10.33 % p. a.                         |\n\nThe contractual agreements for the financial liabilities of Fraport AG include two customary non-financial covenants consisting of a negative pledge and a pari passu clause. Only the bilateral loans forming part of the special-purpose loans of Fraport AG entail further obligations typical for this type of financing.\n\nIndependent project financing agreements of fully consolidated foreign Group companies, in particular in Lima, Greece and Brazil, contain a series of credit clauses typical for this type of financing. These clauses include regulations under which certain debt service coverage ratios and control indicators for leverage and credit terms must be complied with. Failure to comply with the\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nagreed credit clauses may lead to restrictions on the distribution of dividends and/or to the early redemption of loans or to the additional payment of shareholders' equity.\n\nThe maturity profile of the Fraport Group's financial debt showed a largely balanced repayment structure as at the balance sheet date (financial debt in foreign currencies translated as at the balance sheet date rate).\n\nImage /page/76/Figure/7 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Maturity profile as at 31 December 2023 in € million\". The x-axis represents different categories: Liquidity, Gross debt, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033, and 2034 ++. The y-axis represents the values in € million. For Liquidity, there are two bars: one for Carrying amounts at 4,041.2 and another for Credit Lines at 958,6. For Gross debt, there is one bar for Carrying amounts at 11,753.9. For the years 2024 to 2034 ++, there are bars representing Nominal values with the following values: 2024 (1,455.1), 2025 (1,039.8), 2026 (1,185.1), 2027 (1,196.4), 2028 (1,364.7), 2029 (1,972.2), 2030 (947.4), 2031 (828.1), 2032 (549.9), 2033 (332.5), and 2034 ++ (847.7). Additionally, there are values for Carrying amounts: 4,999.8 for Liquidity, and 11,753.9 for Gross debt.\n\n## Liquidity in the fully consolidated Group companies was €780.7 million (previous year: €945.3 million). As it is partly subject to drawing restrictions arising from the conditions stipulated in the project financing agreements, it is not part of the asset management at Fraport AG.\n\n# **Liquidity analysis**\n\nThe strategy of broad diversification of investments in corporate bonds was continued in the 2023 fiscal year. The key characteristics of Fraport AG's investment instruments in terms of type, remaining term, and interest rate structure are presented in the following table:\n\n### **Asset structure of Fraport

management are presented in the following diagram.\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/4 description: This bar chart titled \"Rating structure of assets in %\" shows the percentage of assets in different rating categories. The x-axis represents the percentage, ranging from 0 to 60. The y-axis represents the rating categories: AAA (9.9%), AA (21.8%), A (54.8%), BBB (13.4%), BB (0.0%), and Not rated (0.1%).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the portfolio was comprised almost exclusively of rated assets (rated: 99.9%, unrated: 0.1%).\n\nThe cost of carry, which is calculated using a (tiered statement) maturity-matching principle, was -0.7% (-€22.4 million) as at December 31, 2023.\n\nAs at the 2023 balance sheet date, the Fraport Group had credit lines amounting to €958.6 million (previous year: €736.3 million) available, of which €469.4 million were, however, earmarked for future capital expenditure on infrastructure.

However, at –€125.4 million, it remained in the negative range (previous year: –€153.6 million)\n\nThe positive development of traffic in the Group primarily contributed to an improvement of €145.5 million in adjusted EBIT to €822.9 million (previous year: €677.4 million). The higher capital expenditure, particularly in the development projects in Frankfurt and Lima, as well as the increase in WACC from 7.3% to 7.6% which resulted in higher capital costs, had an opposite effect.\n\nDue to the positive operating result, the **ROFRA** of the Fraport Group increased by 0.6 percentage points to 6.6% (previous year: 6.0%).\n\nThe value added of the **Aviation** segment improved from –€262.4 million to –€199.2 million due to the positive operational development. This was offset by progressing construction activities in the context of the Airport Expansion South project and the increase in capital costs. Segment ROFRA improved from 1.0% to 3.3%.\n\nIn the **Retail & Real Estate** segment, higher Fraport assets in the course of the expansion project in Frankfurt resulted in a decrease in the value added from €63.8 million to €53.4 million (–€10.4 million) and of ROFRA to 9.4% (previous year: 9.7%).\n\nThe value added in the **Ground Handling** segment improved to –€146.2 million (previous year: –€164.3 million) due to the higher operational result, despite the increase in capital costs. ROFRA of the segment was thus at –7.7% (previous year: –12.0%).\n\nThe value added of the **International Activities & Services** segment decreased from €209.3 million to €166.7 million (-€42.6 million). The reason for this was a lower operating result due to special effects in the previous year. Furthermore, the increase in capital costs for the expansion at Lima Airport had a negative effect. In line with the value added, segment ROFRA decreased from 12.9% to 11.8%.\n\n#### **Comparison with the forecasted development**\n\n|                 | 2023 Forecast 2022               | 2022 | Change  | Change in % |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|------|---------|-------------|\n| Group ROFRA (%) | 6.6 Roughly at the level of 2022 | 6.0  | +0.6 PP | -           |\n\nGroup ROFRA of 6.6% was above the forecast provided in 2022 due to the positive operational results.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n70 Group Management Report / Economic Report Fraport Annual Report 2023\n\n# **Non-financial Performance Indicators<sup>12</sup> Customer satisfaction and product quality**\n\n#### **Global satisfaction of passengers**\n\nAt 67%, global satisfaction of passengers was below the previous year' value (–7 percentage points).

This was offset by an increase in particular in the Group companies Fraport Ground Services (formerly FraGround Fraport Ground Handling Professionals GmbH) (+691 employees) and the FraSec Group (+72 employees) due to the volume-based higher demand for personnel. Outside of Germany, employee numbers increased in particular in the Group companies in Peru (+99 employees), Slovenia (+32 employees), Greece (+38 employees), and Brazil (+18 employees).\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Development in personnel structure**\n\nFraport values the diversity of its employees. This diversity helps the Group to better understand the concerns of its customers, develop innovative solutions, and remain competitive in a globalized economy. Diversity management is therefore a central component of its human resources strategy. It is based on a Group agreement that includes the establishment of principles of anti-discrimination, advancement of women into management positions, and diversity. These principles form part of recruitment decisions and training measures.\n\nWith regard to permanent employees excluding seasonal staff as at the balance sheet date, the **Group staff turnover rate** of 12.6% in the reporting year was slightly higher than the value of the previous year (adjusted value for 2022 due to late reportings: 12.1%; reported value 2022: 15.0%). The **Group's percentage of women**, in relation to the total number of employees (including temporary staff, apprentices, and employees on leave) as at December 31, 2023 was 23.8%, clearly below the previous year's level of 26.6%. This was due to the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023. The **average age** of the Group's workforce increased slightly to 45.4 years (previous year: 45.3 years). The **percentage of persons with major disabilities** relative to the total number of employees excluding apprentices and temporary staff was 7.1% on a Group-wide basis (adjusted value for 2022 due to late reportings: 7.6%; reported value 2022: 5.8%).\n\nAt **Fraport AG**, the proportion of female employees as at the balance sheet date 2023 was 19.7% (previous year: 19.4%). The proportion of employees with major disabilities remained unchanged year-on-year at 12.4%. The average number of apprentices decreased to 227 (previous year: 246). The staff turnover rate at Fraport AG improved to 2.7% (previous year: 3.5%).\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-83-0\"></span>*Combined non-financial Statement*\n\n# **About this combined statement**\n\nThe combined non-financial statement complies with the commercial law requirements and was prepared in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e the German Commercial Code (HGB), Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of June 18, 2020 on the establishment of a framework for facilitating sustainable investment and amending the Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder. Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has subjected the content of this combined non-financial statement to a limited assurance review in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised) as part of a separate engagement.\n\nTo avoid duplicates within the combined management report, further information in other chapters is referred to at relevant points. The \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters describe the important non-financial performance indicators and their development during the reporting period. The respective concepts and measures are presented in this combined non-financial statement. The target values set for the Fraport Group and Fraport AG can also be found in the chapters, which are part of this combined non-financial statement. The forecast figures for fiscal year 2024 can be found in the \"Business Outlook\" chapter. The Fraport business model, competitive position, and organizational structure can be found in the \"Situation of the Group\" chapter. Fraport takes risks related to the non-financial aspects into account in the Group-wide risk management system (see the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter). References to information beyond the scope of the combined management report and consolidated financial statements are additional information and do not form part of this combined non-financial statement, therefore they are not audited.\n\n#### **Use of frameworks**\n\nFor a structured presentation of the contents in accordance with Section 289c of the HGB in the combined non-financial statement, Fraport applies the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative 2021 (GRI). The concepts on the aspects are based on \"GRI 3-3 Management of material topics\". This concerns the explanations relating to \"Anti-corruption and bribery matters\", \"Respect for human rights\", \"Customer satisfaction and security\", \"Employee-related matters\", \"Social matters\", and \"Environmental matters\". In addition, the ESG Factbook, available at www.fraport.com/publications, provides a detailed overview of the relevant GRI indicators in the Fraport Group.\n\n#### **Correlations with the financial statements**\n\nThe reportable correlations with the combined management report, the consolidated financial statements, and the Fraport AG annual financial statements are explained at the end of each respective non-financial aspect.\n\n#### **Derivation of materiality**\n\nThe Fraport mission statement continues to form the basis of the Group's strategy. It encompasses the Group goals \"Growth in Frankfurt and internationally\", \"Service-oriented airport provider\", \"Economically successful through optimal cooperation\", \"Learning organization and digitalization\", and \"Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors\". The vision of establishing Fraport as Europe's top airport operator and of setting global standards forms the basis for this.\n\nBased on these Group goals, the Executive Board has defined the six most important non-financial performance indicators in accordance with Section 315 (3) of the HGB in conjunction with Section 289 (3) of the HGB. Global passenger satisfaction, baggage connectivity, satisfaction of employees, women in management positions, sickness rate, and CO2 emissions. As explained in the \"Control System\" chapter, the employee satisfaction survey is carried out every two years and is therefore not recorded quantitatively in the reporting period.\n\nThe basis for the aspects reported in this combined non-financial statement is the materiality matrix. Key aspects are those that, according to Section 289c (3) of the HGB, are relevant to the business development, business result, as well as the effects of the business activities of Fraport on non-financial aspects. The materiality matrix is the result of a systematic exchange with internal and external stakeholders. Fraport management and representatives of the most important stakeholders (analysts, shareholders, employee representatives, banks, employees, airlines, residents living near airports, business partners, media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), passengers, politicians and authorities, economic associations, and science) confirmed the relevance of the current topics. Both groups also prioritize the topics. The materiality matrix shows the impact of direct and indirect business\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nactivities on the corresponding aspect, its relevance for stakeholders, and for the long-term business activities of Fraport. The last comprehensive materiality analysis was performed in 2018. On the basis of this, the topics are regularly checked to ensure they are up to date. The Executive Board has confirmed the relevance of the topics for 2023.\n\nImage /page/84/Figure/6 description: This image is a materiality matrix with \"Impact of business activities\" on the x-axis and \"Relevance for stakeholders\" on the y-axis. The matrix contains several data points, each represented by a circle, with the size of the circle indicating the relevance for long-term business activities (High or Medium). The data points are labeled as follows: \"Data protection\", \"Innovation and Digitalization\", \"Air quality\", \"Noise abatement\", \"Climate protection\", \"Protection of environment and nature\", \"Corporate governance and compliance\", \"Occupational health and safety\", \"Value generation and engagement in the regions\", \"IT security and airport safety and security\", \"Attractive and responsible employer\", \"Customer satisfaction and product quality\", \"Profitability\", and \"Growth and development in the Group\". The data points are colored to represent different categories: Corporate management, Economic enhancement, Employees, Community, and Environment.\n\n1. 116\n\nThe key aspects identified have been attributed to the non-financial aspects in accordance with Section 289c (2) of the HGB. Beyond these reportable non-financial aspects, Fraport has also identified \"Customer satisfaction and security\" as an additional aspect. The distribution of the aspects among the non-financial aspects can be found in the table below. The crossover aspect \"Supply and subcontracting chain\" is not an individual aspect but deals with the information in connection with the non-financial aspects in a separate chapter. Fraport does not engage in research and development in the strict sense in the \"Innovation and Digitalization\" section (see \"Research and Development\" chapter). The measures derived from the Group strategy aim to increase customer satisfaction and product quality. Reporting on this can be found in the \"Customer Satisfaction and Security\" chapter.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Allocation of material topics to non-financial aspects**\n\n| Non-financial aspect                                            | Topics                                    |                                      |                             |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--|\n| Respect for human rights<br>Anti-corruption and bribery matters | Corporate Governance                      | Compliance                           |                             |  |\n| Customer satisfaction and security                              | Customer satisfaction and product quality | IT security and data protection      | Airport safety and security |  |\n| Employee-related matters                                        | Attractive and responsible employer       | Occupational health and safety       |                             |  |\n| Social matters                                                  | Engangement in the Regions                | Noise abatement                      |                             |  |\n| Environmental matters                                           | Climate protection                        | Protection of environment and nature | Air quality                 |  |\n\nThe Executive Board remuneration system also includes non-financial elements in addition to the financial objectives for the longterm performance-based remuneration. The expansion of the master plan and package of measures on reducing CO<sup>2</sup> in the Group, concept development for alternative drive systems at the Frankfurt site, and the increase in process efficiency in procurement and staffing requirements were determined as non-financial components for the 2023 fiscal year (see also the Remuneration Report at www.fraport.com/publications).\n\n#### **Identification of risks**\n\nFraport defines risks as future developments or events that may negatively affect the non-financial aspects. The risk evaluation is conservative, which means that it reflects the worst-case scenario for Fraport. A distinction is made between a gross risk and net risk. The gross risk is the greatest possible negative impact of the risk prior to countermeasures. The net risk includes the remaining expected impact after countermeasures have been initiated or implemented. The risk assessment in this non-financial statement reflects the net risk.\n\nThe risk management system described in the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter in the combined management report contains the analysis of the risks that may have potential negative effects on the non-financial aspects.\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, there were no additional reportable risks for Fraport which are very likely to have or will have a substantial negative impact on the reportable aspects in accordance with Section 289c (3) sentence 1, Nos. 3 and 4 HGB, beyond the material risks already listed in the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter as part of risk management.\n\n#### **Consideration of the supply and subcontracting chain specific to the business model**\n\nThe crossover topic \"Supply chain and subcontracting\" is not an individual aspect but deals with the information on the supply chain and subcontracting in connection with the non-financial aspects in this separate chapter. Unlike manufacturing companies, Fraport management does not focus on the supply chain. Instead, the focus is placed on the quality of the services offered and the functionality of the infrastructure required for this purpose. It is crucial, however, that business partners and suppliers are selected carefully.\n\nFraport compels business partners and suppliers to comply with its **Supplier Code of Conduct**, (which can be viewed at www.fraport.com/en/compliance) as part of its General Terms and Conditions (GTC), depending on the local conditions. It details how to deal with employees and respect human rights as well as environmental and climate protection, integrity during business, and the prohibition of corruption and bribery. A violation of this supplier code of conduct may result in the termination of the business relationship. Business partners and suppliers must also undertake to demand and ensure that these principles are adhered to when dealing with their own suppliers.\n\nAll suppliers and service providers of Fraport AG are audited daily regarding the relevant sanction lists of the EU and the United States. Sanction lists are official lists of people, groups, or organizations subject to economic or legal restrictions. If there are irregularities, further checks are planned which may result in the withdrawal of an order.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fully consolidated Group companies each have their own procurement management and are required to comply with the Group Compliance Management System (CMS). An important part of the Group policy is the **Code of Conduct for Employees** (which can be viewed at www.fraport.com/en/compliance), which is obligatory in the Fraport Group. The policy also includes instructions to make the Supplier Code of Conduct part of the General Terms and Conditions insofar as this is possible for the Group companies pursuant to national applicable law.\n\nThe Group company Fraport Ausbau Süd defined a separate procurement process for the Expansion South project, in particular for Terminal 3 at Frankfurt Airport, due to the size and complexity of the project. When submitting an offer in this procurement process, construction companies are obliged to comply with all requirements in the German Posted Workers Act (AEntG) and the German Minimum Wage Act (MiLoG). In addition, they must make contributions to the collective bargaining parties' joint facilities (e.g., wage compensation and vacation pay), and only engage subcontractors or other third parties that meet these requirements.\n\nIn the past fiscal year, Fraport AG has implemented the due diligence obligations resulting from the German Supply Chain Act (LkSG), which entered into force on January 1, 2023. After existing structures had been expanded and new processes created, the statutory obligations were transferred into the line organization. In addition to the policy statement on the human rights strategy, core elements of the implementation include expanding the risk analysis, updating the complaints procedure, and establishing suitable preventive and corrective measures.\n\n# **Anti-corruption and bribery matters and respect for human rights**\n\n### **Anti-corruption and bribery matters**\n\n*Objective –* Conduct in compliance with laws and regulations has the highest priority at Fraport. Fraport does not tolerate any form of corruption or other unfair business practices. In addition, Fraport is committed to internationally recognized standards, guidelines, and principles, in particular the principles of the UN Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organization, as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* Within the scope of its management responsibilities, the Executive Board determines the values and codes of conduct of the Fraport Group and draws up the framework conditions for the legally compliant and ethical behavior of its executives and employees. Combating corruption is a key component of the **Fraport Code of Conduct**, which has been rolled out globally. The Executive Board is expressly committed to the fundamental values set out in the Code of Conduct and takes a clear stand with a \"zero tolerance principle\".\n\nThe Group-wide **Compliance Management System (CMS)** contains various measures for combating corruption for which Groupwide minimum standards apply. The minimum requirements need the Group companies to have comprehensive regulations for the handling of gifts and invitations, conflicts of interest, and the compliance audit of business partners. In addition, uniform specifications for the processing of information about compliance violations are prescribed. The responsibility for the CMS of each respective Group company lies with its local management. In the role of Chief Compliance Officer, the head of the \"Legal Affairs and Compliance\" central unit is responsible for the content, organization, upkeep, and further development of the CMS of Fraport AG. This officer reports directly to the Executive Director of Retail and Real Estate.\n\nThe CMS of Fraport AG is based on and starts with a **compliance risk analysis**, which is carried out regularly – most recently in 2022 – and whose main areas of focus include the fight against corruption. With its Compliance Helpdesk, the Compliance department of Fraport AG supports and advises employees of all positions and hierarchy levels.\n\nThe Compliance department of Fraport AG informs the Executive Board in a semi-annual **report** on the status of the anti-corruption measures. The Executive Board receives information on material compliance violations immediately after they become known.\n\nThe **Compliance Board** of Fraport AG supports and promotes the cooperation between the Compliance Management (CMS), Risk Management (RMS), Internal Control System (ICS), and audit subsystems. It is the central body that brings together topics specific to the departments and interfaces, and further develops the CMS on an ongoing basis.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders\n\nGuidelines on receiving invitations and gifts have been defined for the employees of Fraport AG in a separate **policy**. This regulates, among other things, the electronic documentation of the approval of received gifts and invitations. An internal policy on how to deal with conflicts of interest also exists. The employees of Fraport AG are obliged to report any situations, in which they find themselves, where personal interests could contradict Fraport's business interests. This allows reportable facts to be disclosed electronically, and the required measures to then be initiated. The electronic processes support employees in complying with existing laws and internal regulations.\n\nExamining adherence to the Fraport Group's compliance regulations falls under the remit of Internal Auditing. This department provides independent and objective audit as well as consulting services in all major business units of Fraport AG, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, and Group companies. The department also carries out **compliance audits**. A standardized and risk-oriented planning process is the foundation for the focus points of the audit.\n\nMeasures to battle corruption, along with information and instructions on how individual employees can contribute to this, are regularly communicated to the employees of the Fraport Group. Employees must complete training on anti-corruption matters. In addition to a clear presentation of why compliance is important in everyday working life, the e-learning program for Fraport AG employees contains the Fraport Code of Conduct, dealing with gifts and invitations, and conflicts of interest. In addition, the central reporting channels for compliance violations are detailed. In 2023, a new e-learning course, Compliance Basic Knowledge for Executives at Fraport AG, has been additionally rolled out. regularly communicated to the employees of the Fraport Group. Employees must complete training on anti-corruption matters. In employees contains the Fraport Code of Conduct, dealing with gifts and invitations, and conflicts of interest. In addition, the central\n\nA key instrument for preventing and discovering compliance violations is the **whistleblower system** (see <www.fraport.com/en/compliance>) as an internal reporting authority. Information about irregularities in all Group companies can be submitted anonymously via this online system. It is available 24 hours a day worldwide. The factual content of each report is thoroughly reviewed, and sanctions are initiated, if necessary. The requirements of the Whistleblower Protection Act (Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz) are complied with. Furthermore, Fraport AG has an **ombudswoman**, an external, independent lawyer, at its disposal. Employees at the Frankfurt site can also contact an **internal confidant**.\n\nA risk-based **compliance due diligence** conducted by the “Acquisitions and Investments” strategic business unit is in place to examine the integrity of Fraport AG business partners' activities in foreign-related investment projects – material compliance risks of a potential business partner are considered accordingly as part of a standard process.\n\nThe **Group companies** implement their own targeted measures to combat corruption and bribery based on the Group-wide CMS requirements. The implementation of the requirements of the German Supply Chain Act and the German Whistleblower Protection Act was the focus at the Group companies in fiscal year 2023.\n\n*Performance indicator –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n# **Respect for human rights**\n\n*Objective* – Fraport aims to comply with the international codes of conduct that it endorses. These are especially the principles of the UN Global Compact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results* – The \"Corporate Development and Sustainability\" central unit of Fraport AG deals with, among other things, coordinating Group-wide respect of human rights. Violations can be reported anonymously via the **whistleblower system** that is freely accessible worldwide via www.fraport.com/en/compliance. In the context of implementing the due diligence obligations from the LKSG, the electronic whistleblower system was expanded by the categories \"Human Rights Violations\" and \"Environmental Crimes\" as of January 1, 2023. In addition, employees in Germany can contact the Compliance department of Fraport AG if required. **blower system** that is freely accessible worldwide via <www.fraport.com/en/compliance>. In the context of implementing the due diligence obligations from the LKSG, the electronic whistleblower system was expanded by the categories \"Human Rights Violations\" and \"Environmental Crimes\" as of January 1, 2023. In addition, employees in Germany can contact the Compliance department of Fraport AG if required.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nRespect for human rights is anchored in the Group-wide binding Fraport **Code of Conduct for Employees**: Fraport undertakes to respect the fundamental right to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining that governs the general working conditions within the Group.\n\nAs an international oriented company, Fraport encourages **diversity in its workforce** and pursues the objective of rejecting any form of discrimination. Fraport undertakes not to distinguish, exclude, or favor people based on their ethnic, national and social origin, skin color, gender, age, religion, or belief system. Fraport also prohibits any discrimination based on political activity, membership in a union organization, disability, or sexual orientation. The principle of mutual appreciation and respect is an essential part of the Fraport value culture: Fraport stands for fair, respectful, and cooperative relationships.\n\nFraport has the same expectations regarding respect for human rights toward its business partners – these requirements are set out in the **Supplier Code of Conduct**. In this code, Fraport business partners are obliged to work toward ensuring that all other companies, such as subcontractors, involved in the provision of services, consistently comply with these standards.\n\nThe **Group companies** implement their own specific measures to ensure respect for human rights.\n\n*Performance indicators –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n# **Customer satisfaction and security**\n\n#### **Customer satisfaction and product quality**\n\n*Objective –* The customer comes first at Fraport, both in Frankfurt as well as at all international Group airports. The objective is therefore to continuously improve the focus on customers and service at Group airports. **Global passenger satisfaction** and **baggage connectivity** are considered the most important criteria for service quality (see the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters). Protecting the health of employees and customers is also a top priority.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* To increase the service quality and sense of cleanliness in the sanitary facilities, additional contactless Smiley Boxes were installed at the Frankfurt Airport to collect feedback. As part of the modernization of the security inspection process, 20 check lanes with new computer tomography technology were introduced in Terminal A at Frankfurt Airport in the reporting year. The benefits for passengers is a faster, more efficient process because liquids and electronic devices can remain in hand baggage. The PaxZ system was expanded in order to enable optimum measurement of waiting times at security checks and check-in areas and thus guarantee better forecasts of process times for passengers.\n\nFraport AG is expanding the digital and contactless travel experience for passengers at Frankfurt Airport together with its system partners. Biometric methods play a central role here. Automatic face recognition replaces passengers presenting documents, provides a fast and convenient service, and increases customer satisfaction. Further biometric touchpoints were put into operation in Pier A/Z, B, and Terminal 2 in 2023.\n\nIn order to guarantee service quality and to meet passengers' and airlines' requirements, Fraport conducted extensive modernization measures at the Group airports. Several measures to improve passenger and business processes such as self bag tag print and replacing the terminal equipment were implemented in Greece. A new software to manage lost baggage was introduced at the Airport in Lima.\n\nIn the context of the permanent passenger survey Fraport-MONITOR, which was conducted at Frankfurt Airport in order to collect information about global satisfaction, self-assessment interviews were carried out on the passenger's own mobile device (smartphone, tablet, laptop) or on a tablet provided on-site by the interviewers. The basic questionnaire from 2022 was broadly adopted for the 2023 reporting year.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the fully consolidated international Group airports, regular surveys to measure passenger satisfaction, which were resumed in 2022, were continued in 2023, albeit with some reduced case numbers compared to pre-crisis levels. As in the previous year, the sample sizes are sufficient to provide a valid figure for global satisfaction in both the international portfolio and the Group for the 2023 reporting year.\n\nThe reliable loading of luggage for departing flights and the fast delivery of luggage to the baggage claim for arriving flights have a major impact on customer satisfaction. Fraport AG measures this performance for departure baggage based on the non-financial performance indicator **Baggage Connectivity** (see also the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters). The recruitment campaign for Ground Handling started in 2022 at the Frankfurt site was continued in the 2023 reporting year. However, the success was limited by strong traffic growth and the associated further increase in demand for personnel. Infrastructure measures were also introduced to improve baggage connectivity. This means that the forwarding of non-transported baggage items is now fully automated for many airlines so that passenger waiting time is shortened. In technical terms, the required X-ray checks of connecting baggage was optimized in order to save valuable time in the transfer process by reducing the malfunctions of the systems.\n\nThe Executive Board is informed about the development of baggage connectivity on a monthly basis. Management receives information on a daily basis so that measures can be taken at any time. Fraport regularly discusses the values with the airlines and ensures improvements are made. For example, Deutsche Lufthansa frequently receives a detailed monitoring report, and optimization measures are managed jointly with Fraport within the scope of regular meetings.\n\n*Performance indicators –* Global passenger satisfaction and baggage connectivity are considered the most important criteria for measuring service quality (see the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters).\n\n#### **Information and airport security**\n\nSecurity is the key requirement for air traffic. This principle applies equally to passenger traffic and air freight. Accordingly, security management has always been a top priority at Fraport.\n\nAll countries in which Fraport is active belong to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and have contractually committed to comply with the organization's safety standards and recommended practices for airports. In contrast to most ICAO member states, German law allocates passenger and baggage checks to government authorities, whereas in other countries this is usually the responsibility of the airports.\n\n#### **Information security**\n\n*Objective –* All important business and operating processes at Fraport are supported by IT systems. Due to the ongoing development of new technologies and the increasing global threat of cyberattacks generally, there is an underlying risk potential for IT systems. The objective is therefore to protect all IT systems and data against failure, manipulation, and unwanted publication.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* Fraport protects its IT systems and data against failure, manipulation, and unwanted publication with active and preventive **IT security management**. These systems are configured redundantly and are housed at separate sites. The risks in the area of IT security are included in the risk management system (see also the \"Risk and Opportunities Report\" chapter). The requirements for IT security are specified in the IT security policy and security guidelines that must be followed throughout the Group. Compliance with these requirements is checked regularly by Internal Auditing, IT Security Management, or external advisors. In 2023, Fraport AG once again implemented a variety of projects to adequately respond to the growing risks arising from information technology. In addition, further personnel were hired in this section. The level of IT security is also part of the annual management report for the quality management certification according to ISO 9001 and is therefore regularly audited by external auditors. In addition, potential for improvement identified within the scope of internal audits as well as in the latest KRITIS audit conducted in 2023 according to the German IT Security Act for critical infrastructures (KRITIS) will be processed and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) will be developed further.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\nWithin the scope of a **working group** in the German Aviation Association, Fraport AG along with other airport operators, Deutsche Lufthansa, and German Air Traffic Control has developed the security standards of the industry. These are based on the new KRITIS requirements. The aim is to comply with regulatory requirements and establish a high security standard within the aviation industry.\n\nThe Group companies outside of Frankfurt use their own IT infrastructure, which they protect according to the Group's IT security guidelines. As a rule, the IT systems of the Group companies at the Frankfurt site as well as the SAP systems of Fraport Greece and Fraport Slovenija are integrated into the technology of Fraport AG and managed from Frankfurt. Using other IT systems is only possible with the consent of the Executive Board. At Fraport AG, a separate section within the \"Information and Telecommunication\" service unit is responsible for IT security. Its tasks are, among other things, the ongoing identification and implementation of measures to meet high security standards.\n\n*Performance indicator –* The security management system at Fraport receives a variety of performance indicators that measur e the effectiveness of the measures implemented. These indicators cannot be published for security reasons.\n\n#### **Data protection**\n\n*Objective –*The objective is to ensure the handling of personal data in compliance with the data protection laws and to safeguard the rights of data subjects. It is irrelevant whether this involves data from passengers, customers, employees, or external companies.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* Fraport AG has a reporting system for processes that require the company to process personal data. These processes are recorded in a central processing directory. To consolidate the processes and rules at Fraport AG, existing processes were implemented in a **data protection management system** and a data protection policy was established. In the **data protection policy**, the Executive Board has laid out the principles, procedures, and obligations to be observed by all employees when they collect, disclose, transmit, modify, store, or delete personal data such as names, addresses, personnel numbers, or IP addresses in the course of their business activities. Specific data protection topics, such as data subject information or data subject rights, the deletion of data, or the reporting of data protection violations, have been set out in action guidelines with practical information, instructions, process descriptions and reference samples. The guidelines are to be implemented as an annex to the data protection directive for all employees. Extensive **training concepts** such as an e-learning tool and video training have been established, which can be accessed on the Intranet. At Fraport AG, the separation between the audit and control function and the specification function is ensured by filling the roles of data protection officer and data protection manager.\n\nThe **data protection officer** monitors whether all data protection regulations are complied with at the company. This officer reports directly to the Executive Board and is independent in their tasks. Violations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are reported directly to this officer – anonymously if so desired. The **data protection manager** is responsible for the processing directory of Fraport AG and organizes the processes required for this. This manager has authority to issue guidelines and reports to the Executive Board at regular intervals. The fundamental task of the data protection manager is to initiate, plan, implement, and control the data protection management system.\n\nThe majority of the personal data processed by Fraport is due to the issue of airport ID cards and is thus compulsory for security reasons. Fraport AG has implemented both technical and organizational measures to protect data against misuse. Access to this system is allowed to only a limited group of people for a specifically defined task. Fraport AG collects personal data of passengers primarily for the use of parking garages, baggage handling, and specific processes at the terminal. Special regulations were therefore established while implementing biometric passenger processes (biometric eGates at the integrated pre-checks). Travel data is processed exclusively by the airlines. There are clear guidelines for the use of video technology at the Frankfurt site in order to ensure the personal rights of passengers, visitors, and employees. It also regulates the extent to which authorities are allowed to use Fraport video technology.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nGiven the advancing digitalization, the data protection team implemented specific processes in order to meet future requirements within a reasonable period of time. The procedures introduced ensure that data protection law is taken into account from the outset, both for business processes in general and for specific data protection topics, such as the processing of data subject inquiries. Checklists and automated evaluations are essential components here.\n\nThe level of data protection is part of the annual management report for the quality management certification according to ISO 9001. In addition, the data protection officer prepares an activity report. Since 2022, quality management audits will regularly include questions on data protection. Specific core questions are asked about the implementation of data protection. Depending on the answers, the data protection team develops an action plan for the following cycle. In addition, Internal Auditing reviews selected data protection topics annually.\n\nThe Executive Board of Fraport AG works toward ensuring that Group companies in Europe comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation and the timely implementation of the relevant legal requirements. In addition to offering **training** for employees, the Group companies have also created **technical requirements** to always take data protection into account. The Group companies outside the EU comply with the relevant national laws on data protection.\n\n*Performance indicator –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n#### **Airport safety**\n\nThis area encompasses both security and safety: safety refers to the operational safety of the overall airport as well as the safety within the airport site. Security is understood in terms of defending against terrorist threats and protecting civil aviation.\n\n*Objective –* For all operational processes, this focuses on safeguarding the safety and security of everyone at Fraport's airports.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* The measures include **passenger, baggage, and cargo inspections, as well as the access control points** for airport employees and suppliers. Regular weekly or monthly meetings are held with airlines, security service providers, and authorities to exchange current information.\n\nAt the international Group airports, the security requirements of each respective country as well as international standards for **safety and security management** are in effect. It is the responsibility of the local Group companies to implement and comply with these requirements. They include, among other things, a safety management system and access controls when entering the security area.\n\nFraport AG supports the Group companies in planning and implementing security measures. It also provides needs-based training for employees online, for example within the context of **safety and security trainings**. Within the scope of specialist **exchange events**, there is also a regular exchange between the Group companies.\n\n#### **Safety**\n\nBased on European statutory regulations, Fraport AG is obliged to operate a **Safety Management System (SMS)** at Frankfurt Airport. The EASA Safety Manager follows the guidelines of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and has a direct reporting right to the Executive Board.\n\nThe SMS focuses on the safety of airport operations. The SMS takes into account all the risks – technical, organizational, or human – that may affect them. The SMS coordinates security measures in daily operations. It records safety-related events and is able to detect vulnerabilities. The objective is for all parties involved in air travel to implement the requirements contained in the Safety Policy of Fraport AG. Airport employees can submit safety-related reports to the SMS. In addition, anyone with access to the airside areas (apron and runway) must regularly complete safety training.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a central reporting and alarm point for security matters, Fraport AG operates a security control center at Frankfurt Airport, which activates the emergency and crisis management, if required. The airport fire department, medical services, ambulance service, and the security services then coordinate operations on site. A crisis unit commences operation in the \"Emergency Response and Information Center\" (**ERIC**). It coordinates and executes all measures that require a concerted approach at the site beyond any routine damage and risk prevention. If necessary, the Fraport Emergency Team, consisting of volunteer employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies at the Frankfurt site, is deployed, which takes care of passengers, greeters, and relatives on site.\n\nThe contingency plan for Frankfurt Airport \"**FRA Not**\" documents which preparations have been made for various emergency scenarios and defines procedures to minimize the impact. ICAO and EASA prescribe regular exercises to be carried out by the respective airport operating company at the Group airports to train for the handling of emergencies and other security-related scenarios. Such exercises have no impact on flight operations. The results are used for further education and training.\n\n#### **Security**\n\nBoth international and European regulations contain guidelines on the structural design of airport infrastructure to prevent attacks such as sabotage or terrorist activities.\n\nIn Germany, the German Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG) regulates the **passenger and baggage controls as well as personnel and goods checks** for access to the security areas. In addition, the LuftSiG defines **the access and approach controls** to airside areas as being within the direct responsibility of the airport operator. On January 1, 2023, Fraport took over the organization, management, and operation of aviation security services at Frankfurt Airport from the German Federal Police. Personnel and goods checks are carried out by the Group company, FraSec Flughafensicherheit GmbH.\n\nFraport AG develops measures to maintain high security standards independently and in agreement with the competent authorities. In the reporting year, responsibility for performing security services and passenger controls at Frankfurt Airport was transferred. Since then, it has been possible for the airport operator to make greater progress with control and quality management and thus to make processes more flexible and more efficient.\n\n*Performance indicator –* No performance indicator, target value, or term has been defined within the scope of the Sustainability Program.\n\n# **Employee-related Matters**\n\nGroup-wide, Fraport aims to remain competitive so as to provide workplaces with fair and just working conditions and guarantee appropriate salaries and wages.\n\nPursuant to responsible corporate governance, Fraport has made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD guidelines, and the ILO Core Labour Standards. They are published in the Code of Conduct, which obliges employees to comply with these fundamental principles.\n\nImportant non-financial performance indicators in the context of personnel matters are the key figures **employee satisfaction, women in management positions,** and **sickness rate** in Germany. Another indicator used to monitor accident development is **LTIF (Lost Time Injury Frequency)**.\n\n#### **Attractive and responsible employer**\n\n*Objective –* Fraport seeks to create good working conditions and increase employee satisfaction (see also the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters).\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results* – The Group Barometer, which is used to measure **employee satisfaction**, was redesigned in 2022 in terms of content and procedure. One of the goals is to make well-founded statements on employee satisfaction at Group level. This should make it easier to derive target-oriented improvement measures on the basis of the results throughout the Group. The survey is conducted every two years since the 2022 reporting year. Optimizing the derivation and implementation \n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nof measures is a key factor in the decision to switch from an annual to a biennial cycle. This will allow the potential of the measures to be better displayed and the impact of implementation to be reflected in the results of the follow-up survey.\n\nThe Group-wide structure of the survey is the same in terms of content. The questions are assigned to four topics – \"My employer,\" \"My workplace,\" \"My team,\" and \"My manager\" – and rated on a scale of 1 to 7. An average score is calculated for each topic. The average value of the topic scores is the indicator for the survey of a Group company. The average of the indicators for all companies, weighted by the number of participating employees per company, gives the satisfaction level of the Group's employees. Based on the results, improvement measures are then derived Group-wide.\n\nIn the survey performed in 2022, the aspects of remuneration, innovations, and professional development opportunities were rated as below average. Because of this they were the focus of the measures that were developed Group-wide in the reporting year. For the Frankfurt site, the potential for improvement was supplemented by the results from the HRneo strategic program that was started in summer 2023. HRneo has the aim of realigning the HR section and increasing the employer attractiveness of Fraport, positioning it for the future, and strengthening cohesion within the workforce across the Group.\n\nThe **Group works agreement** \"Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace\" forms the basis for principles such as freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities. The company agreement includes explicit definitions of values as well as specific internal regulations and structures. As far back as 2007, Fraport committed itself to the \"Charta der Vielfalt\" (Diversity Charter) – an initiative to promote diversity in companies and institutions. From an organizational perspective, responsibility for diversity is assigned to the Labor Relations Director with corresponding resources.\n\nAs a responsible employer, Fraport respects and promotes personal diversity and attaches great importance to ensuring that this is reflected in the way employees interact with each other. Diversity is a key goal for Fraport, which the Group systematically tackles as part of its **diversity management**. Different cultural backgrounds, experience abroad, gender and inclusion aspects, social origin, sexual orientation, or mix of ages enrich cooperation and promote innovation and creativity. This enables Fraport to flexibly respond to the changing requirements in the international markets and benefit from them. In 2023, Fraport continued its activities to strengthen and utilize diversity in the Group. One focus was on the topic of discrimination. Seminars were offered to employees to raise awareness about prejudices, racism, and discrimination in everyday life. In the past fiscal year, information events and counseling offerings were also held on the topics of career and family as well as career and care.\n\nFraport employs many international workers. These often have different language qualifications. The Fraport Group therefore uses language trainers and explains the safety regulations of the work areas with forms in straightforward language and with many illustrations, thus ensuring continuing language education.\n\nThe measures for strategic **succession planning** and the supervision of top management positions are carried out organizationally by the \"HR Top Executives\" central unit. Executives are supervised at the third and fourth level, and **talent management**, which is primarily concerned with developing potential executives, is assigned within the \"Human Resources\" central unit of Fraport AG. Both organizational units report to the Labor Relations Director.\n\nFraport AG has been pursuing its goal of increasing the **proportion of women in management positions** for many years (see also the \"Control System\" and \"Non-financial Performance Indicators\" chapters). In addition to systematic talent management and the Potential Assessment Center, the long-term measures include the Cross Mentoring Program, coaching measures within the context of the continuous development of female executives, and promoting a network of female employees. In addition, there is the option of working part-time.\n\n*Performance indicator –* Employee satisfaction at Fraport AG and in the Group as well as the ratio of women in management positions at Fraport AG and the Fraport Group in Germany (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters).\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Occupational health and safety**\n\n*Objective –* Preventive measures in occupational health and safety in the Fraport Group focus on preserving and strengthening the health, performance, motivation, and thus productivity of employees in the long term. Fraport has therefore set the goal of continuously reducing the number of accidents at work and stabilizing the sickness rate in Germany in the medium term and reducing it in the long term.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* The key principles for Fraport AG and the Group companies can be found in the **Group \"Occupational Health and Safety\" policy**. Drawing on the requirements of ISO 45001, the Group policy ensures accountability. The defined guidelines are to be implemented independently by the Managing Directors and supplemented by company-specific rules in internal regulations. This requirement is valid effective immediately for Fraport AG and German Group companies. Taking into account the national laws, the regulation is also an option for desired action for the international Group companies.\n\nIn accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act (Arbeitssicherheitsgesetz), Fraport AG has implemented an occupational safety unit, an occupational health services unit, and prevention and health management under the Director of Labor Relations, which advise and support corporate departments in the further development of occupational health and safety. Measures to promote occupational health are controlled by the occupational health management. The **Occupational Safety Board** represents the Executive Board's efforts for the effective and efficient organization of preventive health and safety for the Fraport Group. Collaboration and the exchange of experience for all Group companies for which the Group guideline is binding are organized in the **Occupational Health and Safety Management System Board**. The Board meets once per year. Overarching tasks are promoted together in order to work efficiently and conserve resources. In addition, there is a steering committee for prevention and health management, where Group and sector-related health measures are discussed, and decisions are made.\n\nPreventing accidents at work remains an issue of great importance in the Fraport Group. For the LTIF indicator, which is calculated based on the number of accidents at work (from the first day of absence) in relation to the hours worked (in millions), the objective is to reach a value of 22.5 by 2025. The Group LTIF decreased to 20.6 in the 2023 reporting year (previous year: 22.6). A significant focus on accident prevention and avoiding work-related health risks could be seen mainly in the Ground Handling segment. Due to the fast recovery in traffic after the coronavirus pandemic, accident figures have also come back into focus. As part of recruitment measures, above all in the Ground Handling section, the integration of occupational safety measures into training was an essential component. Furthermore, it is also especially important that occupational safety standards are guaranteed when dealing with hazardous substances, in maintenance, in internal transport and traffic, and during infrastructure construction activities. In addition to basic and recurring training programs focusing on various workplaces for all employees and executives, special driver safety training is offered to employees whose work involves driving. Targeted and temporary measures and projects are intended above all to raise employee awareness of safe conduct especially in operational sections.\n\nThe increased requirements that result from the now established hybrid working form were taken into account with numerous **digital health offers**. The Prevention and Health Management department has structured the health measures and focused on the requirements. Provision of licenses for a health app that have been available to interested employees of Fraport AG since 2022 was continued. A quarterly newsletter follows seasonal health topics in a digital format. In addition, in October 2023 there was a dedicated Mental Health Week. Many offers such as screenings, travel vaccination advice, and a health market with campaign stands, presentations, and checkups were also held on-site in Frankfurt.\n\nDifferent programs to promote health in the workplace, and training courses on the issue of occupational safety have been implemented at the international Group companies. Vaccination has also been offered at the airports in Slovenia and Greece. Unannounced inspections were carried out regularly at Lima Airport in addition to the extensive occupational safety training courses to ensure compliance with requirements.\n\n*Performance indicator –* LTIF in the Group, sickness rate in the Group in Germany, and in Fraport AG (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters).\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Social Matters**\n\nFrankfurt Airport is one of the largest local workplaces in Germany. Additional employment effects are also created in enterprises that are contracted by Fraport for the construction and modernization of airport infrastructures.\n\n#### **Engagement in the regions**\n\n*Objective –* The objective is to make a positive contribution to the economic and social development of the region.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* For Fraport, social responsibility has been a corporate principle for many years. Fraport AG's funding concept for its community, cultural, and social engagement is \"**Active for the region**\". It primarily serves to boost clubs and support volunteer work in the region around Frankfurt Airport. All activities are combined into a department within the \"Corporate Communications\" central unit and assigned to the Chairman of the Executive Board. The so-called \"neighborhood framework\" describes the geographical boundary for these support activities. The area is based on district and state borders considering the most important approach and takeoff routes. If this area changes, the neighborhood framework is also adapted. Donation priorities include the promotion of social and charitable institutions, particularly those that encompass measures relating to education, social equality, health, and the integration of marginalized groups in society. Employees can also apply for donations as patrons of their clubs. Sports sponsorship in the Rhine-Main region includes both recreational and professional sports. Wellknown names include the FRAPORT SKYLINERS, which Fraport AG has been supporting for many years. In this regard, Fraport sponsors not only the German national division team but also gives donations to support the \"Basketball macht Schule\" (Basketball Goes to School) project.\n\nIn the areas of **culture and education**, Fraport is involved in longstanding partnerships with the Rheingau Music Festival and the Frankfurt cultural institutions Städel Museum, Schirn Kunsthalle, and Liebieghaus Sculpture Collection.\n\nFraport has financially supported youths' and young adults' integration into working life for many years with the **ProRegion** foundation. In addition to projects for the vocational and social integration of young people who have been forced to flee or migrate, other projects on professional orientation and competence assessment in general education schools continuously receive funding. Since the Foundation merely acts as a funding institution, it relies on close cooperation with proven institutions of youth vocational training. These include the Frankfurt-based Gesellschaft für Jugendbeschäftigung e.V., the Evangelischer Verein für Jugendsozialarbeit, the KUBI Gesellschaft für Kultur und Bildung GmbH, the Berufsbildungswerk Südhessen in Karben, and the \"Pilot\" unit of the Evangelische Kirchenkreis Hanau.\n\nEven at many sites belonging to the international **Group companies**, regions close to the airport also benefit from the economic performance, the donations made, and sponsorship activities undertaken by the Group companies independently. In this regard, the focus is on local projects, such as in the areas of child support, environmental protection, and sports. Earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria have also been supported financially.\n\n*Performance indicator –* As a large portion of the measures had to be suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, the \"Engagement in the regions\" subject area is currently being re-established.\n\n#### **Noise abatement**\n\n*Objective –* With noise reduction and noise abatement measures, Fraport seeks to create a balance between mobility services at the airport and economic success on the one hand and the quality of life around the airport on the other. Keeping aircraft noise pollution as low as possible despite the increase in air traffic is a permanent task. In Frankfurt, the aim is to keep the aircraft noise pollution in the region significantly below the figure of a LOG noise area determined in the 2007 planning decision below a forecasted figure of 22,193 ha.\n\nNational and local regulations about noise protection apply at the Group sites. Violations against these regulations in the reporting year are not known. The Group airports have implemented appropriate noise protection measures and monitoring systems.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* In order to minimize noise pollution, Fraport is constantly working toward pollution reduction measures that go beyond the legal requirements.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe aircraft noise pollution in the area around the airport is continuously monitored. **Aircraft noise monitoring** is also implemented at the Group airports. In Greece, complaints about aircraft noise can also be submitted via the company website. At the Group airport in Lima, a committee has also been set up to combat aircraft noise, involving airlines as well as national and local government agencies.\n\nFraport AG collaborates with the region affected by aircraft noise, representatives of the state government, and other members of the aviation industry in two committees. The **Aircraft Noise Commission** (FLK) is a legally appointed body that advises the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing (HMWEVW), the German Air Traffic Control (Deutsche Flugsicherung, DFS), and the Federal Supervisory Office for Air Traffic Control (BAF) on noise abatement measures due to flights and air pollution resulting from aircraft exhaust gases. Fraport AG regularly reports the evaluations of the aircraft noise measurements and results of simulation calculations on aircraft noise pollution to the supervisory authority and the FLK and publishes its findings on the website ( www.fraport.com).\n\nThe **Airport and Region Forum** (FFR) is a body of the Hessian State Chancellery. The key task of the FFR is to foster dialog between the region and the aviation industry and to discuss the effects of air traffic, with a particular focus on the Rhine-Main region. The FFR includes the \"Active Noise Abatement\" expert group, which advises on measures to reduce aircraft noise.\n\nThe **Fraport Noise Monitoring \"FRA.NoM\"** shows currently measured noise levels at the stationary aircraft noise measurement points of Fraport AG and identifies recognized flight noise from the last three months. It also reports the approaches and takeoffs at Frankfurt Airport as well as their effect on the noise levels in real time. The information system for aircraft noise issues, **FRA.Map**, available online allows interested parties to find information for their location or place of residence on an interactive map. In addition, the system shows the protection zones in the noise protection area, and the area in which rooftop security measures can be claimed to prevent damage caused by wake turbulence.\n\nA basic distinction is made between active and passive noise abatement.\n\n| Active noise abatement<br>Reduces noise directly at the source |                                                      | Passive noise abatement<br>Reduces the noise level at the place of immission |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| emission-based airport<br>charges                              | Noise ceiling                                        | Constructional measures on buildings                                         |\n| Noise-reducing<br>operating concepts                           | Noise-reducing take-off<br>and<br>landing procedures |                                                                              |\n\n### **Active noise abatement**\n\nActive noise abatement directly reduces noise at the source or by implementing **noise-reducing operating concepts and takeoff or landing procedures**. These measures include establishing a \"Ground Based Augmentation System\" (GBAS) navigation system, which enables a steeper angle of approach of 3.2 degrees for all runways in Frankfurt. With the so-called noise abatement model in Frankfurt, in both off-peak periods at night, individual takeoff and landing runways are alternately not used, enabling the local nighttime six-hour quiet period to be increased by one hour.\n\nFraport AG charges noise-related charges for takeoffs and landings. According to the new schedule of charges, which has applied from January 1, 2023, the noise-related airport charges have been further increased. The use of modern, quieter aircraft is rewarded by the Noise Rating Index (NRI). Fraport is thus providing further economic incentives for airlines to take off or land in Frankfurt using quieter aircraft.\n\nThe voluntary alliance for a noise emission ceiling created in 2017 helps to ensure that the noise exposure at Frankfurt Airport during the day does not increase as much as would be permitted under the zoning decision, despite growth in aircraft movements. The traffic volume and traffic structure of the zoning approval for the expansion result in noise contours with continuous \n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Our Shareholders *Combined Management Report* Consolidated Financials Statements Group Notes Further Information\n\nsound levels of 55 dB(A) and 60 dB(A). These contours have been reduced by 1.8 dB(A) across the board. The total areas within the reduced contours define the noise emission ceiling. A flight movement quota applies at night: no more than 133 aircraft movements may be scheduled for each average night of the calendar year between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. If the limit values are exceeded, Fraport AG and airlines must examine how they can reduce the noise level, for example by using quieter aircraft. The calculations in the 2023 monitoring report for 2022 show that the levels did not exceed the noise emission ceiling in 2022. The values of the previous year are always checked.\n\n#### **Passive noise abatement**\n\nPassive noise abatement includes measures that reduce noise from the point of origin (emission site, e.g., aircraft) to the place of impact (place of immission, e.g., apartment). Passive noise abatement measures are intended to reduce the noise level inside buildings by way of structural improvements, such as installing sound-insulating windows. Around Frankfurt Airport, Fraport AG had legal obligations to finance noise abatement measures for around 86,000 households. A noise protection area defined which households were entitled to reimbursement by Fraport for noise abatement measures. The deadline for submitting invoices expired on October 12, 2022, the invoices received on time have largely been approved by Darmstadt Regional Council with a few exceptions and the funds paid out by Fraport.\n\nIn the area of passive noise abatement, the Fraport Group held provisions in the amount of €0.7 million as at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023 (see Group Notes, note 40, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 30).\n\n*Performance indicator* – Compliance with the specified noise ceiling (the area under a Leq 55 dB(A) day (6 a.m.–10 p.m.) should constantly remain below 22,193 ha).\n\n# **Environmental Matters**\n\nAirport operations and air traffic have a major effect on the environment. Fraport is committed to fulfilling the environmental requirements associated with this effect.\n\nIt is particularly important to deal intensively with environmental concerns, especially when planning to expand facilities. The Group's growth targets must be pursued in line with environmental protection. The expansion of both Lima Airport and Frankfurt Airport are subject to environmental requirements. For the financing of Terminal 3 at the Frankfurt site, the European Investment Bank (EIB) requires a project progress report every year that also includes all significant environmental aspects.\n\nFraport is committed to issuing a report each year on its environmental activities and performance (see www.fraport.com/responsibility). To this end, the Group companies complete a comprehensive catalog of standardized environmental indicators once a year. The indicators are combined for reporting (see the \"ESG Fact Book\" at www.fraport.com/publications and the environmental statement at www.fraport.com/environmental-management).\n\n#### **Climate protection**\n\n*Objective –* In order to measure the environmental impact, the Executive Board has identified the scope 1 and 2 CO<sup>2</sup> emissions as the most important indicator. The goal is to reduce this indicator on a Group-wide level to 95,000 metric tons per year by 2030; Fraport seeks to be carbon neutral by 2045 (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Non-financial performance indicators\" chapters).\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* CO<sup>2</sup> emissions of Fraport AG and the Fraport Group are measured and monitored by the department of Environmental Management within the \"Corporate Development and Sustainability\" central unit. The Executive Board is informed twice a year of the development of Fraport AG and the Group issues as part of the Interim Report Q2/6M. In addition, the scope 1 and 2 CO<sup>2</sup> emissions trend is reported to the Executive Board yearly for each building at Fraport AG.\n\nFraport has used its own monitoring instrument, the **CO**<sup>2</sup> **and energy consumption monitoring system**, to present, analyze, and manage energy consumption at the Frankfurt site. It creates transparency about consumption and consumers, helps to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy costs. It also allows qualified statements to be made in a timely manner with regard to current CO<sup>2</sup> emissions at Fraport AG and allows any undesirable trends with respect to the strategic CO<sup>2</sup> targets to be detected at an early stage. The monthly energy consumption of buildings, plants, and equipment serves as the basis for the data. All energy sources, such as electricity, district cooling, district heating, gas, fuel for vehicles, and other fuels, are taken into account.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe \"Energiezirkel\", which was previously responsible for the monitoring of the ongoing long-term energy saving measures and continuously examining further possible measures, was replaced in 2023 by the **Decarbonization Board**. This Board monitors the implementation of the decarbonization master plan, continuously examines the ongoing and planned measures to cut CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, and reports the results to the Executive Board twice a year. Fraport is gradually switching to **emission-free alternatives** for its vehicles on the apron. In addition, 94 electric vehicles and auxiliary devices were acquired in 2023. To complement this, Fraport is starting to establish a fast-charging infrastructure on the apron, which will be available for use by all those active in this area. In doing so, Fraport benefits from support from the State of Hesse. There is also a continuous expansion of charging points in the parking garages and on landside parking areas, based on the needs of customers and legal requirements. A number of electric vehicles were also procured for the Group companies in 2023, which are used in particular in the operational area, for example as follow-me vehicles. Fraport intends to continue to invest in wind and solar energy. The aim is to use renewable energies to meet our own electricity needs at the Frankfurt site as far as possible. Therefore, the construction of another fence system was authorized in the reporting year. These are systems, which are arranged vertically rather than at an angle, thereby ensuring high electricity yields in spite of their small footprint. At the same time, the vegetation underneath is not substantially affected by the structure as the system neither prevents rainfall reaching it nor provides permanent shading. Depending on the approval, the photovoltaic system in the final expansion stage can extend to a length of 2,800 meters parallel to the runway and generate a photovoltaic output of up to 18 megawatts.\n\nThe variety of individual measures that have already been decided upon and implemented in the last few years represent important steps toward achieving the climate protection objectives of Fraport. A **master plan for decarbonization** up to 2045 was developed to ensure the comprehensive consideration and structuring of further measures for decarbonization. It describes the strategic principles and defines the framework for successful implementation of the measures and thus represents a policy document for decarbonization. In 2023, the master plan for decarbonization was also adopted by the fully consolidated international Group airports and backed up with appropriate measures to reduce CO<sup>2</sup> emissions.\n\nThe participation of Fraport in the **Airport Carbon Accreditation** program of the ACI (Airports Council International) serves as proof of its CO<sup>2</sup> management. It has evolved into the global standard for CO<sup>2</sup> reporting and management at airports. Participation at level 2 (\"reduction\") or higher requires proof of both a CO<sup>2</sup> reduction target and CO<sup>2</sup> management program in accordance with international requirements, and annual emission reductions verified by external auditors. Frankfurt Airport reached level 3 (\"optimization\") back in 2012. Ljubljana Airport reached level 2 in 2015 and is aiming for level 3+ (\"neutrality\") in the medium term. The Varna and Burgas Group airports in Bulgaria are also at level 2. The Greek airports in Kefalonia, Mitilini, Rhodes, Thessaloniki, Chania, and Samos are at level 1 (\"mapping\"), as is Lima Airport. The airport in Antalya is at level 3+ (\"neutrality\"). The other Group airports have yet to participate; however, they are obligated to have their CO<sup>2</sup> footprint assessed by way of an external audit.\n\n*Performance indicator –* CO<sup>2</sup> emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in the Group and Fraport AG (see also the \"Control system\" and \"Nonfinancial Performance Indicators\" chapters).\n\n### **Protection of environment and nature**\n\n*Objective –* Fraport's environmental policy obliges all Group companies to make use of natural resources and the environment in a sustainable, conserving, and preventive manner. This goal is systematically implemented through environmental management. Based on their business activities, Fraport AG and the fully consolidated Group companies have defined the objective of introducing and implementing such an environmental management system that is classified as \"fundamentally climate-relevant\" – which means fully consolidated subsidiaries with substantial energy consumption – according to the relevant ISO Standard 14001 and the European EMAS Regulation. The \"Eco Management and Audit Scheme\" (EMAS) is an environmental management and audit scheme developed by the European Union, which companies can implement voluntarily. This audit is carried out by stateauthorized environmental experts. EMAS is considered to be the world's most demanding environmental management system. Fraport AG has been validated by EMAS for over 20 years.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* **Environmental management systems** serve to systematically organize, manage, and monitor corporate environmental protection within the company. The environmental management systems cover all environmental factors relevant to the company such as energy consumption, CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, air pollutant emissions, effects of business activities on nature and biodiversity, water consumption, and waste. The Coordinator for the Environmental Management System at Fraport AG reports to the Chairman of the Executive Board in management reviews. The long-standing experience of Fraport AG employees in the area of environmental management benefits all Group companies, for example in the form of technical support, including on site. Companies that join the Fraport Group and do not yet have an environmental management system are obliged to introduce such a system in the course of the acquisition. At the end of the past fiscal year, 78.4% of fully consolidated, environmentally relevant Group companies, weighted according to revenue, had such a system certified according to ISO 14001 or EMAS.\n\nWherever possible, Fraport AG extends the **green areas** at the Frankfurt site. Fraport AG will upgrade some 2300 hectares of land in the immediate and wider vicinity of the airport from a nature conservation perspective to fulfill a legal requirement under the zoning decision for the airport expansion: deciduous forests, orchards, marshes, and nutrient-poor grassland. Measures to counterbalance the Expansion South project, in particular Terminal 3, are already included in this extensive package of measures.\n\nThe implementation and evaluation of the measures are subject to continuous monitoring. For **ecological compensation measures**, Fraport Group held provisions in the amount of €12.4 million as at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023 (see Group Notes, note 40, and Fraport AG's Notes, note 30).\n\nPromoting biological aviation safety is the responsibility of **Wildlife Hazard Management**. Wildlife Hazard Management at the international Group airports is implemented according to international regulations as well as, where appropriate, based on national and local targets. Corresponding monitoring systems are implemented. Wildlife Hazard Management at Group airports is concerned, among other things, with the monitoring of birds in order to ensure safe operations. In addition to biotope design and standardized animal observations at and around the airport, this also includes aversive conditioning through acoustic and visual stimuli. Maintaining the green spaces is a prerequisite for reducing the number of potential animals on the airport grounds which are relevant to air traffic safety. This is also ensured by Wildlife Hazard Management.\n\n*Performance indicator –* Proportion of fully consolidated, climate-relevant Group companies with certified environmental management systems (EMAS or ISO 14001), weighted according to revenue.\n\n#### **Air quality**\n\n*Objective –* There is no legal obligation for airports to monitor air quality. However, Fraport has set the objective of gaining a deeper understanding of the emission of air pollutants (emissions) by the airport and their effect on people and the environment (immissions). Air quality has been monitored at several sites at Frankfurt Airport since 2002. And it is also regularly monitored at some international airports.\n\n*Concepts, measures, and results –* From an organizational standpoint, the \"Noise and Air Quality\" department of the Aviation strategic business unit is responsible for air quality issues at the Frankfurt site. An annual report informs the Executive Board about the measured annual average and annual indicators of air pollutants on the airport grounds. Fraport AG regularly publishes the results of the measurements on its website in the **\"Air quality annual report\"**. The measurements show that the air quality on the airport site have remained unchanged at an urban level since the first time air pollutant limits were measured.\n\nAt the local level, there is an overlap of limit-controlled air pollutants related to the airport and those not attributed to the airport. The airport's impact on the air quality in the surrounding areas is largely limited to zones within a proximity and to the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions component. Measurements and modeling suggest, however, that external influences, such as road traffic, also play a role in the air quality on airport grounds. In addition, the level of pollutant concentrations depends heavily on the weather.\n\nTo gain information on the proportion of the overall exposure in a region, computational models have been developed that include all the relevant sources of pollution and their emissions for a given zone. The **LASPORT program** takes into account various airport-related emission sources in the lower atmosphere, prepares spread computations, and illustrates the exposures. The Airport Association ADV (Association of German Airports) commissioned the program in 2002. The provider has since expanded the program in close collaboration with Fraport AG and other users.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nFraport AG cooperates with the German Aviation Association (BDL) and the Airports Council International (ACI). In addition, there are collaborations with the Hessian Agency for Nature Conservation, Environment and Geology (HLNUG) and Gemeinnützige Umwelthaus GmbH (Umwelt- und Nachbarschaftshaus, UNH) in Kelsterbach to study so-called ultra-fine particulates (UFP). UFP are solid or liquid air-borne particles with a diameter smaller than 100 nm. Unlike conventional, limit-controlled air pollutants, airports have proven to be a major source of UFP. Due to their small size, UFP are classified as potentially harmful to health, however, no reliable database exists to determine a dose-response relationship.\n\nThe HLNUG measurements have shown in the last few years that Frankfurt Airport clearly contributes to the UFP burden. At all UFP measuring sites, the UFP concentration increases when the wind blows from the direction of the airport area during flight operations. Although the UFP concentration decreases exponentially the further away the measuring sites are from the airport, the airport's influence still visibly stands out from the baseline concentration. In January 2023, scientists at the Goethe University Frankfurt in collaboration with the HLNUG published new findings. An analysis of the chemical composition of the measured UFP in Frankfurt-Schwanheim was carried out in this study. The investigations showed that the UFP partly consist of synthetic turbine lubrication oils and therefore the formation of ultra-fine particulates on engines is not limited to the combustion of jet fuel.\n\nFurthermore, in August 2023 the HLNUG published a short report on the measurements completed after two and a half years in the Municipality of Flörsheim located directly to the west of the airport. As already known from the previous UFP reports, the measured particle number concentration at the Flörsheim site is also clearly dependent on the wind direction. If the wind blows from the direction of the airport during flight operations, the particle number concentration clearly increases. Furthermore, the latest evaluations by the HLNUG show that even at night outside of the airport operating times (between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.) an increased particle number concentration resulted in the event of wind from an easterly direction, which points toward further sources of UFP in this direction outside of flight operations. The analyses also showed that short-term peaks in the particle number concentration occurred both at times with overflights over Flörsheim and also at times outside of flight operations and when the Runway Northwest was closed (from December 16, 2020 to May 31, 2021). Therefore, no clear causal connection can be derived between the individual direct overflights over Flörsheim in landing approaches to the Runway Northwest and the concentration peaks.\n\nIn order to gain further knowledge, the Forum Flughafen und Region (Forum Airport and Region, FFR) has taken up the subject area in its work program at the request of the Hessian state government and will carry out a comprehensive study on ultra-fine particulates. A **\"UFP\" working group** has been set up at UNH, in which Fraport AG is also involved. Due to the complexity of the topic and building on the measurement results of the HLNUG and the findings of a previous hearing of experts in August 2019, the FFR has decided to commission the study to assess the exposure of the Rhine-Main region to UFP and its health effects in two main parts: a pollution study and an impact study. The contracting entity of the studies is UNH, which acts as an office of the FFR. The \"SOURCE FFR (Study On Ultrafine particles Frankfurt airport Region) – measurement & modelling\" UFP pollution study commissioned by UNH began in April 2023. The pollution study is being conducted by a consortium under the leadership of the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS). Fraport AG is supporting the study project by conducting the measurements on the airport site and providing a variety of operating and activity data for emissions modeling of sources related to the airport.\n\nThe pollution study is expected to be completed in 2026. The results should form the basis for the impact study on the possible health effects of UFP, to be carried out at a later date. A design to develop an impact study is being developed in parallel to the pollution study. Information regarding the way in which questions concerning the survey and the effect of UFP in the region around the airport will be handled and how the issue will be addressed by the FFR is published on the UNH web pages and can be viewed at https://www.ultrafeinstaub-studie.de/en.\n\nFraport is continuously working to record the air pollutant emissions of all relevant emitters through airport operations at the Frankfurt site on an annual basis in order to achieve a systematic inventory of air pollutant emissions. The selection of the pollutants to be observed depends on their relevance. They are especially important if they are regulated by a threshold value and are recognized in a noticeable amount at Frankfurt Airport. Drawing on an extensive database, potentials for reduction measures can be identified and control procedures can be developed. The data collected also serve as a basis for calculating the airport's proportion of immissions in the surrounding area.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nShareholders\n\n**ombined Management Report**\n\nTo Our Shareholders *Combined Management Report* Consolidated Financials Statements Group Notes Further Information\n\nes Further Informa\n\nAs an airport operator, Fraport can only indirectly influence emissions from aircraft. In order to motivate airlines to use low-emission aircraft, Fraport collects airport charges on nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon at the Frankfurt site. Airlines pay the **emissionsbased fee** per kilogram of nitrogen oxide equivalent emitted by an aircraft during takeoff and landing (\"landing and take-off cycle\", LTO). Charges are levied per landing and per takeoff. The necessary information on aircraft and engine types is determined by way of a recognized fleet database.\n\nAircraft turbines mainly emit carbon dioxide (about 7%) and water vapor (approximately 3%) in addition to mixed air (about 90%). The additional resulting pollutants of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons, and soot account for less than one percent overall. The emission spectrum of aircraft turbines corresponds to that of road traffic. Fraport publishes the quantities of these pollutants emitted by the aircraft at the Frankfurt site in its annual environmental statement.\n\nIn addition to flight operations, air pollutants at airports also arise from the apron and vehicle traffic as well as the operation of heaters run on oil or gas. As a way of reducing pollutants, Fraport has gradually upgraded its fleet of vehicles at Frankfurt Airport to include low-emission and electric motors. Currently, around 570 vehicles (previous year: 540) of the Fraport vehicles in Ground Services at Frankfurt Airport already have electric engines. This corresponds to approximately 27% of the vehicles (previous year: around 27%). By 2026, a further 600 passenger cars, small vans, buses, and specific ground handling vehicles with electric transmission will be put into operation.\n\nThe international Group airports follow the respective requirements in their national laws. Air quality is also monitored at the Greek regional airports Thessaloniki, Corfu, and Rhodes.\n\n*Performance indicator –* Fraport strives to extensively measure the air pollutant emissions by material sources. A key performance indicator in the strict sense is not defined in the air quality category.\n\n# **Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation**\n\n### **Background Information**\n\nAs part of the European Green Deal to achieve climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050, the EU Taxonomy Regulation was adopted as an instrument for classifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. The EU Taxonomy Regulation is a key element of the European Commission's action plan to redirect capital toward a more sustainable economy. Through the Regulation, pre-defined economic activities are uniformly assessed with regard to their contribution to the European Commission's six environmental objectives – climate change mitigation (CCM), climate change adaptation (CCA), water (WTR), circular economy (CE), pollution prevention and control (PPC), and biodiversity (BIO) – with the aim of achieving better comparability of companies.\n\nThis section presents the share of Group revenue, capital expenditure (Capex), and operating expenditure (Opex) for the 2023 reporting period related to the six environmental objectives of the European Commission that are taxonomy-eligible or taxonomyaligned in accordance with Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and Article 10 (2) of the delegated act. At Fraport the taxonomyeligible or taxonomy-aligned economic activities contribute to the environmental objectives **climate change mitigation** and **the transition to a circular economy**.\n\n#### **Definitions**\n\nA **taxonomy-eligible** economic activity means an economic activity that is described in the current delegated acts on the six environmental objectives, irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid out in those delegated acts. Conversely, all economic activities not described in the delegated acts are considered as taxonomy non-eligible.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nA **taxonomy-aligned** economic activity means a taxonomy-eligible economic activity that meets the following requirements:\n\n- The economic activity contributes clearly to one or more of the environmental objectives.\n- It does not significantly harm any of the other environmental objectives (DNSH).\n- It is performed in keeping with the minimum safeguards.\n\n### **Revenue KPI**\n\nThe share of **taxonomy-eligible Group revenue** was calculated as the portion of the net revenue from products and services related to taxonomy-eligible economic activities (numerator), divided by net revenue (denominator; the denominator corresponds to the Group revenue; see also Group Notes, note 5).\n\nFraport generates revenue from products and services associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities in the area of renting. This concerns the activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". Revenue from the renting of buildings is mainly reflected in the revenue in the Retail & Real Estate and International Activities & Services segments. Furthermore, Fraport obtains taxonomy-eligible revenue by providing the passenger transport system. This comes under the economic activity 6.3 \"Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\". The related costs are passed on to airlines within the airport charges of the Aviation segment. To determine the taxonomy-eligible portion, a distribution formula was applied based on the cost basis to ensure appropriate allocation to the charges. The economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" was newly introduced into the Regulation by the European Commission in 2023. Fraport obtains taxonomy-eligible revenue here, both at the Frankfurt site and at foreign airports.\n\nRevenue in connection with the renting of buildings are taxonomy-aligned at the Greek Group airports at Fraport Greece in eight terminals. With their environmental certificates for the relevant buildings, these meet the technical screening criteria. The buildings rented there belong to the best 15% of national Greek buildings in terms of energy efficiency and can therefore be classified as taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned revenue of the passenger transport system increased to €37.09 million, mainly contingent on the higher passenger volume (previous year: €25.10 million). In addition, taxonomy-aligned revenue from rental income at Fraport Greece of €58.15 million is recognized for the first time (previous year: €0.0 million).\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible revenue described in the following does not contain any taxonomy-aligned portions. With regard to the renting of buildings, an increase in the taxonomy-eligible revenue to €650.08 million is recorded (previous year: €605.40 million). In the reporting year, new taxonomy-eligible revenue from the economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" of €752.54 million were added. Frankfurt had the substantial portion with €656.62 million, followed by Lima with €59.39 million.\n\n#### **Capital expenditure (Capex) KPI**\n\nThe Capex KPI, which indicates the proportion of **taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure**, is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure eligible under the EU Taxonomy Regulation (numerator) divided by the total capital expenditure (denominator).\n\nTotal capital expenditure includes additions to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets during the fiscal year. This includes the additions to property, plant, and equipment (IAS 16), intangible assets (IAS 38), rights of use (IFRS 16), and investment property (IAS 40; see also section \"Additions to non-current assets\" and Group Notes, note 20).\n\nAt Fraport the numerator consists of the following categories for taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure:\n\n• Capital expenditure relating to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities (letter a) of Annex I to the delegated act pursuant to Article 8) plus\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n- \n- Capital expenditure relating to individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions (letter c) of Annex I to the delegated act pursuant to Article 8)\n\nCapital expenditure related to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities (letter a) are to be allocated in particular to the economic activity 6.3 \"Local and urban passenger transport, passenger road transport\". Given that the economic activity and the operation of the passenger transport system cannot be carried out without the corresponding rail infrastructure or stations, Fraport considers the related capital expenditure to be connected with the economic activity 6.3. The economic activity 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\" was newly included in the Regulation by the EU Commission in 2023.\n\nIn total, the following **taxonomy-eligible** economic activities were identified in the Fraport Group in the **climate change mitigation** environmental objective:\n\n- 4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n- 6.3 Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\n- 6.17 Low carbon airport infrastructure\n- 7.1 Construction of new buildings\n- 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings\n- 7.3 Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficiency equipment\n- 7.4 Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\n- 7.5 Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\n- 6.20 Air transport ground handling operations\n\nFor the environmental objective **transition to a circular economy,** the following **taxonomy-eligible** economic activities were identified:\n\n• 3.4 Maintenance of roads and motorways\n\nIn order to avoid double counting when calculating the Capex ratio, economic activities were allocated either the letter a) or c).\n\nAfter examining the technical screening criteria, DNSH criteria, and minimum protection requirements, **taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure** remains under the following economic activities:\n\n- 4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n- 6.3 Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\n- 6.17 Low carbon airport infrastructure\n- 7.4 Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\n- 7.5 Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\n\nAll taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned additions are to be attributed to investments in infrastructure and terminal buildings. The taxonomy-aligned additions for the passenger transport system fell slightly compared to the previous year to €97.71 million (previous year: €103.10 million). Another taxonomy-aligned addition concerns economic activity 7.5 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices\" with €27.51 million (previous year: €39.22 million). This includes, for example, the installation of facades with a solar control function and the technical centers in Terminal 3.\n\nThe additions described in the following do not contain any taxonomy-aligned portions. A substantial taxonomy-eligible addition to economic activity 7.1 \"Construction of new buildings\" of €396.31 million also comes from Lima with the construction of the new passenger terminal. A total of €928.59 million arose here (previous year: €623.14 million). The construction of Terminal 3 in Frankfurt contributed to this with a volume of €491.70 million. The new economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" shows taxonomy-eligible additions of €38.06 million, a large portion of which relates to the baggage transfer system in Terminal 3. The economic activity 7.2 contributes €35.33 million to the taxonomy-eligible Capex.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Operating expenditure (Opex) KPI**\n\nTo determine the ratio of operating expenditure (Opex KPI), the **taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure** (numerator) according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation is set in relation to the operating expenditure (denominator).\n\nThe operating expenditure in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation includes direct non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leasing, and maintenance and repair. Any other direct expenditure relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant, and equipment by the undertaking or third parties is also included here.\n\nThus, the definition of operating expenditure in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation clearly differs from the definition of operating expenses used in the rest of the combined management report (see chapter \"Glossary\"). For example, no expenses for utility services, such as energy expenditure, are included in the definition according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The ratio for operating expenditure (denominator) is calculated in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation based on the income statement and mainly includes maintenance expenses and other operating expenditure for rents and leasing. The taxonomy-eligible share in fiscal year 2023 results from maintenance expenses for the passenger transport system as well as maintenance expenses for rented buildings. The maintenance expenses for rented buildings are determined using a formula, which should guarantee an appropriate distribution involving the segment results. As with revenue, in 2023 the economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" is added, and the expenses related to this concern, in particular, maintaining the baggage transfer system. A formula was applied here, which guarantees an appropriate distribution of maintenance expenses based on the segment distribution. The economic activity 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\" is also new; a component of this is the maintenance of the runways.\n\nIn the same way as the revenue, the maintenance expenses for the passenger transport system are **taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure**. The maintenance expenses at the Greece site for the buildings that belong to the top 15% of national buildings with regard to energy efficiency are also aligned.\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned Opex consists of the economic activity 6.3 \"Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\" with the maintenance of the passenger transport system of €9.15 million (previous year: €7.10 million), and the economic activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" with the aligned portion at Fraport Greece of €5.95 million.\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible amounts described in the following section do not contain any taxonomy-aligned portions. A taxonomyeligible amount of €11.03 million resulted from the new economic activity 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\"; this includes, for example, the renovation of Runway Northwest at the Frankfurt site. In addition, the economic activity 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" contributes a total of €9.67 million. The expenses are determined using a formula as described above. The economic activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" contributes €33.20 million (previous year: €28.40 million), a significant part comes from Fraport AG with a total amount of €19.85 million.\n\n#### **Assessment of Taxonomy Alignment**\n\n#### **Substantial contribution to the climate protection environmental objective**\n\nThe following explains the extent to which the economic activities mentioned meet the criteria for the substantial contribution.\n\n- The **photovoltaic installation** belongs to the economic activity 4.1 \"Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\", as the installation is freestanding at Runway West at the Frankfurt site, and in contrast to 7.6 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of energy efficiency equipment\" is not connected to an existing building.\n- The **passenger transport system** comes under the economic activity 6.3 \"Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport\". The substantial contribution is met by criterion (a), as the passenger transport system does not cause any direct CO<sup>2</sup> emissions. The same applies to investments in the passenger transport system in connection with the expansion of Terminal 3.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n- \n- Under economic activity 6.17 \"Low carbon airport infrastructure\", supplying aircraft with ground power falls under (b) **400 Hz installations**. Because ground power supply and preconditioned air supply are usually provided by two different facilities, Fraport assigns the facilities that serve ground power supply, such as 400 Hz installations, to economic activity 6.17.\n- The **charging stations** for the expansion of electromobility come under economic activity 7.4 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\". As the substantial contribution is defined by the \"Installation, maintenance, or repair of charging stations for electric vehicles\", it is seen to have been met here.\n- The exchange and **modernization of technical centers** (mainly in the existing Terminals 1 and 2 in Frankfurt) comes under the economic activity 7.5 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\". The substantial contribution is met by individual measure (b) \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of building automation and control systems, building energy management systems (BEMS), lighting control systems and energy management systems (EMS)\". The installation of smart meters also falls under economic activity 7.5 under (c) and the installation of facade and roofing elements with a solar shading or solar control function under (d).\n- The **operation of the eight terminal buildings** of Fraport Greece comes under the economic activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". The substantial contribution is met as the terminal buildings under consideration count toward the top 15% of the national buildings in Greece in their energy efficiency classes.\n\nThe substantial contribution could not be proven for the taxonomy-eligible economic activities 7.1 \"Construction of new buildings\" and 7.2 \"Renovation of existing buildings\". For the economic activities 6.20 \"Air transport ground handling operations\" and 3.4 \"Maintenance of roads and motorways\", which were newly added to the Regulation, only the taxonomy eligibility must be checked in this year due to a relief provision.\n\n#### **No significant harm to the other environmental objectives – DNSH criteria**\n\nAvoiding significant harm to the environmental objective 2) **Climate change adaptation** is taken into consideration for all relevant economic activities through a climate risk and vulnerability assessment in accordance with Appendix A of Annex I on climate protection, in which the criteria for and scope of this type of analysis are defined. Various chronic and acute climate risks, which must be assessed for the sites where taxonomy-eligible activities are performed, are also specified.\n\nIn order to assess the climate risks, these were first checked with regard to the possibility of their occurrence. For the remaining risks, Fraport relies on the Munich Re \"Location Risk Intelligence Platform\". The platform analyzes a site or portfolio with regard to various climate risks. In this year, the potentially taxonomy-aligned economic activities are limited to Fraport AG and Fraport Greece, therefore the assessment is concentrated on these two sites. In order to illustrate the possible effects of climate change, the various climate projection scenarios (RCP scenarios) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 were assessed for the projection years 2030, 2050, and 2100. These are necessary for economic activities with a lifetime of over ten years. As the best and worst case scenario is covered by scenarios 2.6 and 8.5, and the remaining RCP scenarios lie within their bandwidth, they were not explicitly reanalyzed. For every risk identified, a risk assessment was made in the form of a score on the basis of the underlying scenarios. The overall risk score is divided into four levels from low to extreme. The report shows that the overall climate risk for the Frankfurt site is at level 2 in the \"medium range\". This means that no climate risk was identified for the Frankfurt site that would clearly affect taxonomy-compliant economic activities. For Fraport Greece the overall climate risk for the sites is at level 3 to 4, in the high to extreme range.\n\nIn the current version of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, it has not been defined how often the analysis needs to be updated. No annual update is carried out as time periods up to 2100 are covered in the projection scenarios. If extraordinary circumstances or substantial innovations should occur, an ad-hoc update will be executed. Irrespective of the updating of the assessment, the contents of the analyses are revised in every set of annual financial statements, for example to add new aligned economic activities and adaptation measures.\n\nThe criteria for determining whether the environmental objectives 3) **Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources** and 6) **Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems,** are impacted are particularly relevant for the photovoltaic and 400 Hz installations. The criteria primarily reference environmental impact assessments or comparable assessments that have already been examined as a prerequisite for obtaining permits for the construction and operation of the facilities. No further measures were therefore required for compliance.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe criteria for environmental objective 4) **Transition to a circular economy** are also relevant in the context of the passenger transport system in addition to the photovoltaic and 400 Hz installations. Fraport AG is already obliged to comply with the criteria under the regulations of European and German waste legislation, in particular Section 6 of the German Waste Management Act and the associated waste hierarchy. Furthermore, environmental objective 5) **Pollution prevention and control** is also relevant for the passenger transport system and the 400 Hz installations. The criteria are insubstantial for the passenger transport system as this exclusively relates to class M road vehicles. The passenger transport system does not fall under class M. Fraport is already obliged to comply with the criteria for the 400 Hz installations by German legislation, such as the Noise and Vibration Occupational Health and Safety Regulation and other general occupational health and safety ordinances.\n\nFor the economic activities under 7.4 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\", 7.5 \"Installation, maintenance, and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling energy performance of buildings\" and 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\", no DNSH criteria are defined for the other environmental objectives 3) to 6).\n\n#### **Fulfillment of minimum protection measures**\n\nAs part of the minimum protection, various requirements are made regarding the implementation of procedures, which are based, among other things, on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as well as other regulatory initiatives. The fulfillment of the required minimum protection is a prerequisite for classifying an economic activity as ecologically sustainable and thus taxonomy-aligned. To implement and ensure minimum protection, Fraport has aligned itself with the Final Report on Minimum Safeguards from the Platform on Sustainable Finance of October 11, 2022. The main focus of this report was on human rights, corruption and bribery, taxation, and fair competition.\n\nIn assessing compliance with the minimum protection, we evaluated whether adequate processes were implemented for each of the above topics to avoid negative impacts. Furthermore, the results of the respective measures taken are examined on an ongoing basis to determine whether the measures taken are effective in preventing negative impacts.\n\nFor the measures that Fraport has implemented in the thematic fields of human rights, and corruption and bribery, reference is made to explanations within this non-financial statement under \"Business model-specific consideration of the supply chain and procurement\", \"Respect for human rights\", and \"Tackling corruption and bribery\".\n\nIn the thematic field of \"Taxation\", Fraport is subject to the country-specific tax laws and regulations, the implementation of and compliance with which is monitored and ensured by the Tax department and external and internal audits. Regular compliance risk analyses and employee training are carried out in the areas of antitrust and competition law.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Templates turnover**\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            |                     |                                               | Substantial contribution criteria<br>Substantial contribution criteria |                                                                    |                                          |                          |                                  |                                     |              |  |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------|--|--|\n| Economic activities<br>Economic activities                                                                                                                                                                                     | Code(s)    | Code(s)<br>Turnover | Turnover<br>Proportion<br>of turnover<br>2023 | Proportion<br>Climate<br>of turnover<br>change<br>mitigation<br>2023   | Climate<br>Climate<br>change<br>change<br>mitigation<br>adaptation | Climate<br>Water<br>change<br>adaptation | Water<br>Pollution       | Pollution<br>Circular<br>Economy | Biodiversity<br>Circular<br>Economy | Biodiversity |  |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            |                     |                                               |                                                                        |                                                                    |                                          |                          |                                  |                                     |              |  |  |\n| (1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | (1)<br>(2) | (2)<br>(3)          | (3)<br>(4)                                    | (4)<br>(5)                                                             | (5)<br>(6)                                                         | (6)<br>(7)                               | (7)<br>(8)               | (8)<br>(9)                       | (9)<br>(10)                         | (10)         |  |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            | € mil.              | € mil.<br>%                                   | Y; N; N/EL<br>%                                                        | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL                                           | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL                 | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL         | Y; N; N/EL<br>Y; N; N/EL            | Y; N; N/EL   |  |  |\n| A.

The most important financial performance indicators used for managing Fraport AG and other important financial and non-financial key figures are described in the \"Control System\" section. The development of the non-financial key figures is reported in the \"Control System\", \"Employees\", \"Non-financial performance indicators\", and \"Combined Non-Financial Statement\" sections.\n\nThe explanatory notes below are based on the annual financial statements of Fraport AG, drawn up in accordance with the German Commercial Code (\"HGB\") and the German Stock Corporation Act (\"AktG\"). This results in differences in accounting policies compared to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, mainly related to non-current assets and provisions.\n\n# **Economic development of Fraport AG**\n\n#### **Results of operations**\n\nFor the explanatory notes on changes in the results of operations, please refer to the presentation of the Aviation, Retail & Real Estate and Ground Handling segments, which essentially covers the business activities of Fraport AG (see \"Results of operations by segment\").\n\nCompared to the previous year, **revenue** of Fraport AG increased by €536.9 million to €2,313.1 million. The increase mainly results from higher revenue from airport charges (+€196.0 million) as well as higher revenue from infrastructure charges (+€76.4 million) and ground services (+€57.6 million) based on traffic volumes and prices. Retail and parking revenue also increased by €51.8 million based on traffic volume. Due to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved for the first time in the reporting period. With the take-over of the management of the aviation security checks, its operational execution it is no longer carried out by Fraport AG but by security firms engaged by Fraport AG. Based on this, revenue from security services achieved until that time is no longer generated (previous year: €69.4 million).\n\nAs in previous years, Fraport AG earned a major portion of its revenue (more than one third) in the past fiscal year with one customer at the Frankfurt site.\n\n**Other operating income** of €57.2 million is almost unchanged compared to the previous year (€58.7 million) In the current fiscal year, this includes in particular income from foreign currency translations (€35.8 million). In the previous year, this related in particular to income from the release of provisions (€33.5 million).\n\n**Total revenue** rose by €543.9 million to €2,407.6 million (+29.2%).\n\n**Personnel expenses** increased in the 2023 fiscal year by €16.2 million to €589.5 million. The increase resulted mainly from the collective bargaining agreements concluded in the current fiscal year. The lower number of employees compared to the previous year had an opposing effect.\n\n**Non-staff costs** (cost of materials and other operating expenses) increased by €268.7 million to €1,168.7 million. The increase is due in particular to increased expenses for external services, primarily in connection with taking over the management of aviation security checks (+€188.3 million). In addition, the purchase of external services increased by €83.9 million in the fiscal year mainly due to traffic and prices.\n\nAt €649.4 million in the fiscal year, the **EBITDA** of Fraport AG was €259.0 million above the level in the same period of the previous year. After depreciation and amortization of €333.4 million, **EBIT** amounted to €316.0 million (previous year: €82.0 million).\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n€110.4 million higher income from investments was achieved in the current fiscal year.\n\nThe **financial result** amounted to €92.4 million (previous year: –€165.6 million). The change to the previous year of +€258.0 million was mainly due to the previous year's write-off of shares in Fraport Malta Ltd. amounting to €139.1 million and in Thalita Trading Ltd. amounting to €10.0 million in connection with the investment in St. Petersburg Airport. Furthermore,\n\n**EBT** was €408.4 million (previous year: –€83.6 million). Taxes on income amounted to €79.3 million (previous year: €4.8 million). This resulted in a net income of €329.1 million (previous year: net loss of €88.4 million).\n\nAfter transferring €164.5 million to other revenue reserves, profit earmarked for distribution amounts to €164.6 million. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the 2024 Annual General Meeting to transfer the profit earmarked for distribution to other revenue reserves.\n\n#### **Asset and financial position**\n\n#### **Asset and capital structure**\n\n| Assets                                                     |                   |                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                                                  | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Non-current assets                                         | 11,280.6          | 10,754.1          |\n| Current assets                                             | 2,400.7           | 2,090.9           |\n| Prepaid expenses and accrued income                        | 44.3              | 38.9              |\n| Deferred tax assets                                        | 303.1             | 341.9             |\n| Assets arising from the overfunding of pension obligations | 4.6               | 0.0               |\n| Total                                                      | 14,033.3          | 13,225.8          |\n\n#### **Liabilities and equity**\n\n \n\n| € million                                                 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Shareholders' equity                                      | 3,205.1           | 2,876.0           |\n| Special items for investment grants in non-current assets | 7.4               | 7.8               |\n| Provisions                                                | 486.6             | 507.7             |\n| Liabilities                                               | 10,280.9          | 9,786.2           |\n| Accrued income and accrued expenses                       | 31.9              | 33.8              |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                  | 21.4              | 14.3              |\n| Total                                                     | 14,033.3          | 13,225.8          |\n\n#### **Asset and capital structure**\n\nAt the end of the 2023 fiscal year, the **total assets** of Fraport AG amounted to €14,033.3 million, up €807.5 million year-on-year (+6.1%).\n\n**Non-current assets** rose by €526.6 million to €11,280.6 million. This is mainly due to the increase in property, plant, and equipment of €586.4 million – particularly in connection with construction measures as part of the Expansion South project at the Frankfurt site.\n\nAt €2,400.7 million, **current assets** were €309.8 million higher than in the previous year, mainly due to the increase in short-term securities (+€243.9 million).\n\n**Shareholders' equity** as at December 31, 2023 amounted to €3,205.1 million, and rose by €329.1 million as a result of the net income in the current fiscal year.\n\n**Liabilities** increased compared to the previous year by €494.7 million to €10,280.9 million, mainly due to the financing measures undertaken during the fiscal year to secure liquidity.\n\n**Liquidity** as at December 31, 2023, was €3,285.6 million, up from €2,980.9 million in the previous year. **Gross debt** increased in the reporting year to €9,711.3 million (previous year: €9,114.7 million). This led to a considerable increase of €291.9 million in **net financial debt** to €6,425.7 million (previous year: €6,133.8 million).\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n<span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>As at the 2023 balance sheet date, the financial debt maturity profile of Fraport AG exhibited the following repayment structure:\n\nImage /page/116/Figure/6 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"Maturity profile as at December 31, 2023 in € million\".

For this, all Fraport Group employees are required to participate actively in risk and opportunity management within the scope of their duties. Finding a proper balance between risks and opportunities begins in the strategic planning process and in the drafting of the long-term business plan. In general, Fraport strives to balance opportunities and risks in order to increase added value for its stakeholders by analyzing and leveraging new market opportunities and potential.\n\n# **Organization of the risk management**\n\n### **Structure and responsibilities of the risk management system**\n\nImage /page/117/Figure/11 description: The image shows an organizational chart. At the top is \"Finance and audit committee of the Supervisory Board\", followed by \"Executive Board\". Below that is \"Risk Management committee (RMC)\". Next, there are two boxes: \"Risk Management, Processes, Systems Department (REW-RS)\" and \"Chief Risk Officer\". At the bottom is \"Fraport AG Departments / Group companies\". To the right of \"Risk Management committee (RMC)\" is \"Internal Audit\".\n\nThe Fraport Executive Board bears overall responsibility for an effective risk management system that ensures uniform and comprehensive risk management. In this context, by preparing the development plan, it has also approved the risk strategy and risk objectives for the Group. The Executive Board appoints the Chief Risk Officer and the members of the Risk Management Committee (RMC), approves the rules of procedure for the RMC and the risk management guidelines, and receives the quarterly reports and ad hoc reports in the risk management system.\n\nThe RMC is the highest committee in the risk management system and, following its meetings, releases quarterly risk reports to the Executive Board. The Chief Risk Officer is the spokesperson for the RMC and reports directly to the Executive Board. The Risk Management, Processes, Systems (REW-RS) department is responsible for the organization, maintenance, and further development of the Group-wide risk management and internal control system (ICS), and for regularly updating and implementing the guidelines for risk management system and ICS in the Fraport Group. The Risk Management, Processes, Systems department is also responsible for performing the risk analysis in accordance with the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG).\n\nRisk and opportunity management is a key function of the respective business, service, and central units of Fraport AG and Group companies that are responsible for their business processes; this involves management of material risks and the use of appropriate measures to mitigate and reduce them to an acceptable level, as well as actively grasping opportunities.\n\nProcess-integrated and process-independent monitoring measures form the elements of the internal monitoring systems. The central Group Internal Audit unit is integrated into the internal monitoring system of the Fraport Group with process-independent audit activities.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte) has examined the risk early warning system of Fraport AG during the audit of the annual financial statements for stock corporation law requirements.

Non-financial risks may have a negative impact on the achievement of the environmental, sustainable, and social targets of Fraport. In addition, in accordance with the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG), human rights-related and environmental risks are defined as events that could potentially violate the due diligence obligations laid down in the Fraport policy statement in the company's own business and at direct suppliers. Opportunities are regarded as future developments or events that can lead to a positive planning or strategic target deviation.\n\nRisks are identified using various instruments by the operational business, service, and central units of Fraport AG and the group companies and top-down by the REW-RS department, RMC, and Executive Board. The risk identification methods used are for example market and competition analysis, evaluation of customer surveys, information about suppliers and institutions or monitoring risk indicators from the regulatory, economic, and political environment. The heads of the Fraport AG units and the executives of the Group companies are responsible for the accuracy of the information from their units/companies that is processed in the risk management system. They are obligated to constantly monitor and manage risk areas, and report on all risks in their divisions and their company to the REW-RS department on a quarterly basis. Central risk management can use the risk reports to identify risk trends in the Fraport Group. Outside of regular quarterly reporting, newly identified substantial risks must be reported immediately.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains, a risk analysis is performed annually to identify human rights-related and environmental risks in the company's own business and at direct suppliers, as well as on an ad-hoc basis if substantial changes or increases in the risk situation of the supply chain are to be expected.\n\n#### **Risk Evaluation**\n\nThe systematic evaluation of risks determines the impact and probability of occurrence of the identified risks, and makes it possible to estimate the extent to which the individual risks could jeopardize the objectives and strategy of the Fraport Group, or which risks will very likely, due to their nature, jeopardize the company as a going concern. Risk evaluation is always based on a rolling 24-month period. However, this does not mean that risk owners only analyze and evaluate the risks from a short-term perspective; possible infrastructural risks are in particular monitored in accordance with their long-term impact. The evaluation system divides the potential impact (= impact level) into four categories: \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", and \"very high\". It then assesses the impact level based on how the risks affect the relevant detection variable (EBIT, financial result, or liquidity). Furthermore, qualitative factors (media reporting/attention, effect on stakeholders), which could be important for Fraport's reputation and which additionally determine the risks, are also included in the analysis. The probability of occurrence for individual risks is also divided into four categories: \"unlikely\", \"possible\", \"likely\", and \"very likely\". The risk level (\"low,\" \"moderate,\" \"considerable\" and \"substantial\") arises from the combination of impact level and probability of occurrence.\n\nThe risk evaluation is conservative, i.e., it reflects the worst-case scenario for Fraport. A distinction is made between gross and net risk. Gross risk is the worst-case (financial) impact before countermeasures. The net risk represents the expected residual (financial) impact after initiation or implementation of countermeasures. The risk assessment in this report only reflects the net risk.\n\nIn order to assess possible combination effects between individual risks, the REW-RS department annually prepares a risk aggregation as part of the planning process. The impacts of the risks are aggregated by Monte Carlo simulation and applied to the balance sheet and income statement of Fraport AG in the planning horizon, taking account of planning uncertainties. The resulting impacts on the financial performance indicators of Fraport AG are analyzed and reported to the Executive Board as part of the adoption of the plans resulting from the risk-bearing capacity analysis. The requirements of Article 1 of the German Act on the Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Businesses (StaRUG) are taken into account accordingly.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Management of Risks**\n\nRisk owners are tasked with developing and implementing suitable countermeasures to minimize and manage risks. In addition, general strategies must be developed to deal with the identified risks. These strategies include risk avoidance, risk reduction with a view to minimizing the (financial) impact or the probability of occurrence, transfer of risk to a third party (for example in purchasing insurance policies), or risk acceptance. The decision regarding the implementation of the relevant strategy and/or measures also considers the costs in relation to the effectiveness of potential countermeasures. Here, the REW-RS department works closely with the risk owners in order to monitor the progress of countermeasures and to evaluate their effectiveness from a Group perspective.\n\n### **Risk monitoring and reporting**\n\nIntegrated risk management aims to ensure a transparent presentation of the Fraport Group's risk situation. Risks are reported to the Executive Board when they are classified as \"considerable\" or \"substantial\" based on their net risk according to systematic evaluation standards used Group-wide.\n\nIn the event of very significant changes to previously reported risks or newly identified \"substantial\" risks, ad hoc reports are also issued outside of the regular quarterly reporting schedule.\n\nTwice a year, the Executive Board reports the considerable (amber) and substantial (red) risks, including any changes in the same, to the Supervisory Board's Finance and Audit Committee. The figure below shows the recipients of the risk reporting, according to the net risk.\n\nImage /page/120/Figure/11 description: The image is a risk matrix with probability of occurrence on the y-axis and impact level on the x-axis. The y-axis is divided into four categories: unlikely (≤ 20%), possible (>20-50%), likely (>50-80%), and very likely (>80%). The x-axis is divided into four categories: low (≤ 6m €), medium (> 6m-20m €), high (> 20m-40m €), and very high (> 40m €). The matrix is filled with risk levels: low, moderate, considerable, and substantial. A legend at the bottom indicates the risk levels are associated with different offices: RM office, RM office and RMC, RM office, RMC, Executive Board, Finance and audit committee, and RM office, RMC, Executive Board, Finance and audit committee, Risk and Opportunities Report.\n\nThis process ensures the early detection of trends that could jeopardize the Fraport Group as a going concern.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nAn integral component of Fraport's risk management system is also the assessment of financial risks, whereby the presentation in the accounts of financial instruments overall and hedging transactions in particular is monitored and controlled. This process is described in the financial risks section (\"Risk report\" in accordance with section 289 (2) no. 1 HGB and section 315 (2) no. 1 HGB). At Fraport, this process represents a subsection of the accounting-related internal control system.\n\n# **Organization of opportunity management**\n\nThe opportunity management system of the Fraport Group is intended to identify and evaluate opportunities at the earliest possible stage and to initiate appropriate measures to capitalize on them and ensure their commercial success. This includes the assessment of opportunities from existing business, as well as from new business fields.\n\nThe business, service and central units responsible for their business processes and the Group companies identify opportunities throughout the year as part of the operational management of the company and as part of the annually revolving planning process. Opportunities are reviewed regularly as part of the risk reporting process by the REW-RS department.\n\nWhile short-term earnings monitoring focuses on opportunities that mainly affect the current fiscal year, the planning process focuses on opportunities that are of strategic importance for the Group. Within the context of the planning process, Fraport assesses market and competitive analyses, as well as environmental scenarios and deals with the orientation of the product and service portfolio, the cost drivers, and the critical success factors of the industry. Furthermore, Fraport monitors the identifiable trends among competitors and customers – such as airlines, passengers, and tenants – as well as in businesses outside of the industry which have an impact on air traffic in general and airport operations in particular. Fraport aims to further develop and expand the value-creating business fields that are already part of its operations. Moreover, Fraport is investing in business fields and business ideas in which the company can build sufficient competencies in order to create value over the long term.\n\nIn addition to opportunity management by the business, service and central units of Fraport AG and the Group companies, Fraport also draws on the expertise of the entire workforce. Using a variety of tools, such as Group idea management, the Digital Factory, or the Plug and Play LLC network, Fraport aims to identify opportunities that are developed by the employees.\n\n# **Business risks and opportunities**\n\nThe following section explains the risks and opportunities that could have a substantial impact on the business operations or the asset, financial, and earnings position and/or reputation of Fraport, as well as effects on its stakeholders, as at the valuation date of December 31, 2023. The evaluation is generally based on the rolling 24-month period from the valuation date. Potential infrastructural risks are also considered and assessed in accordance with their longer-term impact. Unless specified otherwise, the risks and opportunities described relate to all segments to varying extents (Aviation, Retail & Real Estate, Ground Handling and International Activities & Services). Selected, non-substantial risks are indicated on a voluntary basis in order to provide a comprehensive view of the risk situation.\n\nFraport AG is the parent company of the Fraport Group and comprises all of the described segments above. Therefore, it is also directly or indirectly subject to the risks and opportunities described. The risk evaluation is performed solely to assess risks without taking into account any potential opportunities. There is no offsetting of opportunities and risks.\n\nThe following table describes the substantial and other selected individual risks and opportunities:\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n[To Our Shareholders](#page-5-0) *[Combined Management Report](#page-39-0)* [Consolidated Financials Statements](#page-136-0) [Group Notes](#page-144-0) [Further Information](#page-236-0)\n\nFurther Information\n\nFraport Annual Report 2023\n\n#### **Business risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Strategic risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Macroeconomic risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Risks**\n\n- Overall, global economic development may cool down more than expected and have a negative influence on passenger and air freight demand.\n- Continuing high inflation rates may reduce the disposable income of private households. The reduced purchasing power, together with uncertainties about the future development of inflation rates, may have a negative impact on flight bookings.\n- Sustained high interest rates intended to curb inflation may have a greater impact than expected on state and corporate refinancing and on global economic development. This would have a negative impact on planned traffic development.\n- As a result of sustained high energy prices, the competitiveness of German industry may suffer and Germany's position as an attractive hub for air traffic could be weakened.\n- In world trade, the trend toward greater national protectionism may adversely impact the export-oriented German economy.\n- Growth may be dampened by the weakening of the EU as a result of diverging interests among the Member States and the actions they take.\n- Current and simmering geopolitical hotspots may put a strain on economic development. In particular, there is a risk of an escalating conflict between China and Taiwan.\n\n#### **Measures**\n\n- Strong geographic diversification and focus on various passenger groups at the Group airports to reduce individual macroeconomic risks.\n- Geopolitical risks, restrictive political interventions, and saturation tendencies in air traffic demand in Western countries can be balanced out from regionally different growth potential among the Group airports.\n\n# **assessment:**  substantial > 20–50%\n\n**Trend ↑ Risk**\n\n> 40 mn €\n\nIncrease in the risk evaluation compared to the previous year due to the escalation in geopolitical conflicts with potential consequences for the business activities of the Fraport Group depending on how these conflicts develop.\n\n#### **Opportunities**\n\n- A clear decline in inflation and the recovery of the economy lead to growth of disposable income and a robust recovery in demand. Business travel and air freight may benefit from the upswing in the economy and, in particular, exports.\n- A quicker end to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, with a sustained relaxation of geopolitical tensions, may stimulate the global economy and support air freight development.\n- The rapid finalization of trade agreements with countries with high air freight potential may boost air freight development in Frankfurt.\n- The further expansion of the e-commerce business may strengthen Frankfurt's position as an air freight hub.\n\n#### **Market, competitive and regulatory risks and opportunities**\n\nvantages for German and European air traffic.\n\nIn addition to demand in and level of attractiveness of its domestic market, the competitive situation and attractive infrastructure, the success of an international airport depends on its airline customer structure and the associated global and dense route net-work, as well as the connectivity between demand markets.\n\n| Risks

• Wars and geopolitical crises could result in rising energy costs and a sustained reduction in supply and demand, among other things.<br>• Rising crude oil and thus also kerosene prices could result in higher airfares and an associated dip in air travel demand. If competition is intense, rising crude oil prices could pose financial difficulties for less solvent airlines, with a resulting drop in supply.<br>• Further increases in air traffic control and aviation security charges and higher civil aviation tax increase the location risk and result in competitive disadvantages and financial losses. Supply is reduced or not created in Germany in the first place, and may be relocated to other hubs abroad.<br>• The measures planned/implemented in other European countries to reduce short-haul flights may mean a switch to alternative means of transport (rail and car) if implemented in Germany, reducing the demand for air travel. Passengers who cannot or do not want to use alternative transportation could switch to using foreign airports and Frankfurt Airport would subsequently lose such customers.<br>• Broad debates about climate protection could produce a long-term shift in travel behavior and lead to a reduction in air travel.<br>• Stricter travel guidelines and the consolidation of business travel may also result in a decline in air travel demand.<br>• Political and regulatory decisions at the regional, national and European levels will continue to affect the aviation sector. Climate protection and noise reduction requirements and associated taxes and charges could drive up the cost of air travel, and typically involve unilateral action on the market and on competition in international air traffic. Stronger targets under the European Union's Green Deal (Fit for 55) and the associated review of the Emission Trading Directive, as well as the definition of binding SAF quotas, will place an increased burden on European sites compared to other sites.

The situation may also worsen in the long term, given the decline in migration of EU citizens to Germany. Staff shortages in the air transport industry can have a negative impact on operational service delivery and consequently on the expected business development. • Terror attacks and hotspots of unrest could adversely affect demand for specific travel destinations. • Active participation in industryrelated associations\n\n#### **Opportunities**\n\n- Now that the coronavirus pandemic is over, there is continued high demand among consumers for tourist air travel. Recovery in the business travel segment could also be stronger than expected.\n- Previous development cycles in air traffic show that market turbulence only temporarily burdens the upward development of global air traffic. Long-term forecasts continue to assume growing demand in global air traffic.\n- Market exits of airlines lead to a concentration of established airlines at the larger German airports, from which transfer traffic at Frankfurt Airport may benefit.\n- The larger ranges of smaller aircraft provide an opportunity for new decentralized intercontinental routes from Frankfurt.\n- High-quality connections to the Deutsche Bahn rail network at the Frankfurt site ensure demand from transfer traffic within Germany even if air traffic is shifted to rail, and this is a major competitive advantage. Improvements to the intermodal product such as end-to-end ticketing and end-to-end baggage transport can strengthen rail feeder traffic and have a positive impact on Frankfurt Airport's catchment area.\n- Capacity increases at the Group airports are being implemented or have been completed, which will result in improved quality for airlines and greater passenger satisfaction. This may enable Fraport to benefit more than expected from long-term growth in the air traffic market.\n- A liberalization of air traffic rights may open up new markets for air traffic and expand existing markets.\n- International harmonization of regulatory measures that distorted competition in the past may make global competition fairer and reduce the risk of business moving elsewhere. There is a chance that airlines will further expand their intercontinental fleet in Frankfurt due to the excellent existing feeder service, intermodality, and cargo demand, thereby strengthening passenger and cargo traffic.\n- Digitalization and innovations offer new opportunities to improve processes, raise efficiency, and increase customer satisfaction.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Operational risks and opportunities**\n\n#### **Risks and opportunities from capital expenditure projects at the Frankfurt Airport**\n\nCapital expenditure on construction at Frankfurt Airport is divided into two separate programs: \"FRA-Nord\" for projects in existing infrastructure and \"Ausbau Süd\" for projects to expand or create capacity.

For the construction of the new passenger terminal, LAP commissioned a construction consortium which, as the general contractor, takes on the EPC services (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) customary in the industry, which include all planning, procurement and construction measures. Project financing for the ongoing infrastructure and expansion measures was concluded in December 2022. Potential risks remain due to the size, complexity, and duration of the expansion project. However, as in the previous year, these are assessed as \"moderate\" as at the balance sheet date.<br><br>At Antalya Airport, interim financing has been secured until March 2024 for the expansion project being carried out by Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş. (FTA 2). FTA 2 has initiated discussions on the conclusion of follow-up financing and on increasing the financing volume, and these are now at an advanced stage. The probability of occurrence of a failure to secure follow-up financing at the planned level is assessed to be low. |  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |                                                                               |\n|       | Personnel risks and opportunities |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |                                                                               |\n| Risks |                                   | • Increased employee turnover due to a more attractive labor market and higher internal workload<br>• More difficult recruitment due to current labor market conditions<br>• Training periods for the recruitment of less qualified workers and thus later availability<br>• Staff shortages in the air transport industry can have a negative impact on operational service delivery and consequently on the expected business development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  | Measures<br>• Reorganizing Human Resources as part of the HRneo strategic program<br>• Improving IT support for HR processes<br>• Realigning recruitment processes and training measures<br>• Temporary granting of labor market allowances for staff recruitment, incentives through above-tariff remuneration schemes<br>• Improving appeal as an employer through modern work formats |  | Trend →<br>Risk assessment:<br>moderate<br><br>> 20 -

For the construction of the new passenger terminal, LAP commissioned a construction consortium which, as the general contractor, takes on the EPC services (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) customary in the industry, which include all planning, procurement and construction measures.

It is based on the framework of the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn terms of the accounting process of Fraport AG, the company regards the internal control and risk management system as a process that is embedded in the company-wide internal control and risk management system. Fraport AG prepares its own separate financial statements in accordance with German commercial and stock market regulations.\n\nThe process of preparing the financial statements of Fraport AG is laid down in a schedule detailing each individual step, including deadlines and responsibilities. Group Accounting monitors the progress and is schedule assisted by a system. In order to ensure standardized procedures, important operational processes of the sub-ledgers (accounts payable, accounts receivable, asset accounting, treasury, accounting of the decentralized departments) and general ledger have been documented in policies, process descriptions, manuals, and guidelines.\n\nFraport AG uses the SAP ECC 6.0 system for its accounting. Accounting-related internal controls are carried out, where possible, in the SAP ECC 6.0 system. Manual application and monitoring controls are carried out during the operational accounting processes in the sub-ledgers. A dual control method is implemented when preparing the financial statements of the general ledger, and subsequent mainly manual monitoring controls are carried out additionally for the purpose of ensuring the completeness and accuracy of items recognized in the sub-ledgers. The tax department calculates and posts taxes on income, and performs manual application and monitoring controls.\n\nSegregation of duties are implemented in the departments involved in the accounting process on a system, personnel, and organizational level. An SAP authorization concept for Fraport AG is used for issuing and administering access authorization for accounting-related systems.\n\nGroup accounting at Fraport is basically organized on a decentralized basis. Reconciliation of the local individual financial statements (commercial balance sheet I) of the parent company and subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated companies to the individual financial statements (commercial balance sheet II) prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies is carried out decentrally by the companies. To ensure uniform Group accounting and measurement Fraport has developed an IFRS Group accounting guideline on the basis of which the companies included in the consolidated financial statements reconcile commercial balance sheet I to commercial balance sheet II. The effectiveness and accuracy of the Group accounting process is confirmed by the companies included in the consolidated financial statements in the context of an internal Group declaration of completeness.\n\nWherever possible, accounting-related internal controls are carried out in SAP BPC. Access authorizations at the level of the consolidated companies are assigned and managed centrally at Fraport AG on the basis of a user authorization concept. Manual application and monitoring controls, particularly with regard to the completeness and quality of the reporting data, are carried out as part of the operational accounting processes in Group accounting. The effectiveness of the internal control system is reviewed annually by performing a control self-assessment.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Group Accounting department of Fraport AG. The Group financial statement process is described in detail in a flow chart which contains the individual process steps with dates and responsibilities. The progress of the process as well as reporting deadlines and the completeness of the Group reporting system are monitored by the Group Accounting department.\n\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements are prepared as part of the consolidated financial statement process by the Group Accounting department. Where necessary, the information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is subsequently checked by central or decentralized specialist departments after the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Corporate Finance and Investor Relations department is generally responsible for preparing the combined management report. This department consolidates the information provided by the specialist departments. Subsequent control of the consolidated information is performed by the specialist departments.\n\nKey sub-processes of the accounting process for the Group and Fraport AG, as well as the performed internal controls, are subject to scheduled audit by the Internal Audit department.\n\n# **Information on the central internal control system1**\n\nIn addition to the accounting-related internal control system and the risk management system, the Fraport Group identifies, evaluates, and manages strategic, operational, and compliance process risks as part of the central internal control system. To assess the design and effectiveness of the system, a control self-assessment (CSA) is carried out annually, analogous to the accountingrelated internal control system. The primary objective of the CSA is to review the design and effectiveness of business process controls and to identify and report any control weaknesses in business processes. The knowledge gained is used, among others, for the continuous improvement and further development of the central internal control system.\n\nQuarterly reports on the current group-wide risk and opportunity situation are given at Executive Board meetings, and the result of the CSA of the central internal control system is presented annually. On the basis of these findings and any process-independent audits, the Executive Board annually assesses the design and effectiveness of Fraport AG's risk management and the central internal control system described above.\n\nThe central Group Internal Audit performs process-independent audit activities on the risk management and central internal control system. Audit reviews regularly provide information and findings on the central internal control system, which are to be remedied by measures taken by the REW-RS department together with the departments. Measures for findings from completed audit reviews are currently being processed.\n\nBased on the overall information, the Executive Board has no indication that the risk management system or the central internal control system were not adequate or effective as at December 31, 2023.\n\nSince inherent risks are subject to a probability of detection, a risk management or central internal control system that is judged to be adequate and effective cannot fully ensure complete coverage of all potential risks or exclusion of process violations of any kind.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board is systematically involved in monitoring the design and effectiveness of the risk management and central internal control system. It receives a semi-annual report on the current risk and opportunity situation and is presented with an annual report on the results of the CSA of the central internal control system.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The statements in this section are \"non-management report disclosures\" that are not subject to the external auditor's review of the content of the management report. The reason for this is that these disclosures go beyond the legal obligations.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>*Outlook Report*\n\n# **Note on forecasts**\n\nThe business outlook assumes that the domestic and international economy and air traffic will not be impaired by external shocks such as terror attacks, wars, further pandemics, natural disasters, or substantial turbulence on the financial markets. They are based on the IFRS accounting standards to be applied in the EU at the beginning of the 2024 fiscal year (see also Group notes, note 4). Climate-related aspects are taken into account in the forecasted traffic developments to the extent that these can be predicted.\n\nThe \"Risk and opportunities report\" covers risks and opportunities that are not factored into the business outlook and that may result in significant negative or positive changes to the forecasted development.\n\n# **General statement by the Executive Board**\n\nDespite geopolitical uncertainties, the Executive Board expects an overall positive business development in 2024. The new Group strategy \"Fraport.2030\" lays the foundation for the Group to tackle the strategic challenges both today and in the future.\n\nFor Frankfurt Airport, following passenger numbers of around 59.4 million in the 2023 fiscal year, the Executive Board expects this to increase to between approximately 61 million and 65 million passengers in the 2024 fiscal year. Traffic development in Frankfurt is being driven in part by an increase in traffic to and from China, as well as further recovery in the business travel segment. The Executive Board also forecasts positive traffic development for the international Group airports in 2024.\n\nThe Executive Board assumes that the positive business development will have an increasing effect on the Group's revenue and earnings development in 2024, and expects **Group EBITDA** to increase to between approximately €1,260 million and €1,360 million. The **Group result** is expected to be between approximately €435 million and €530 million, with increasing depreciation and amortization and a deterioration in the financial result. The **ROFRA** is forecasted to be around or slightly above the 2023 level. Due to ongoing expansion measures, the **free cash flow** will again be negative in the mid three-digit million euro range in 2024 and will have an increasing effect on the net financial debt in 2024. Depending on the improvement in the operating result, the ratio of **net financial debt to EBITDA** is expected to be roughly at the level of 2023. Due to the range of the forecasted EBITDA and the free cash flow development, the figure may be slightly above or below that level. Despite extensive financing measures and the further utilization of project financing in Lima, the **Group liquidity** is forecasted to be below the level of 2023, mainly due to the negative free cash flow. However, the long-term target value of €1 billion will continue to be substantially exceeded.\n\nThe Executive Board continues to project a stable financial situation for the Fraport Group over the forecast period.\n\nAt the level of Fraport AG, the Executive Board expects **net income** of between approximately €300 million and €350 million in the 2024 fiscal year. Taking into account the expected negative free cash flow, the Executive Board forecasts a clear decline in the **liquidity** of Fraport AG. However, thanks to the extensive financing measures in place, liquidity will remain substantially above the target value of €1 billion.\n\nAccording to the opinion of the Executive Board, the development of an existential threat by the individual risks described in the \"Risk and Opportunity Report\" chapter or a combination of these seems to be highly unlikely, in view of projections for future developments in the Fraport Group. The forecasted figures do not envisage any acquisitions or disposals of companies, or increases or reductions in shareholdings.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Business outlook**\n\n#### **Forecasted situation of the Group for 2024**\n\n#### **Development of structure**\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2024, Fraport has converted the \"Human Resources\" central unit and the \"HR Top Executives\" unit into a new organization, which now comprises the two central units \"HR Operations\" and \"People & Culture.\" The reorganization does not have any impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nWhen preparing the Outlook Report, the Executive Board did not expect any changes to the Group structure that will have a substantial impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position.\n\n#### **Development of competitive position and future markets**\n\nFraport is continuously developing its business activities and Group sites as part of the strategic objective \"Growth in Frankfurt and internationally\", (see also the \"Strategy\" chapter). Among other things, the inauguration of the new terminal in Lima is planned for 2024, which will strengthen the competitive position of the site in the long term. Fraport continues its aim to market its airport expertise around the world and participate in the appeal of new markets. In this respect, Fraport selectively assesses whether to participate in international tenders.\n\n#### **Development of the strategy and control system**\n\nAt the end of January 2024, the Executive Board introduced the new Group strategy \"Fraport.2030,\" which replaces the previous Group strategy. This new strategy defines the three main priorities of the Group: \"growth and sustainability,\" \"efficiency and innovation,\" and \"employer of choice.\" Through optimal cooperation within the Group (\"working together\"), the Executive Board aims to achieve the overriding goal of \"inspiring customers\" and the financial targets of \"EBITDA of €2 billion\" and \"free cash flow of €1 billion\" by the 2030 fiscal year. The strategic priorities will be rolled out in the individual company units in the 2024 fiscal year, with twelve projects already defined and ready for implementation.\n\nIn this context and on the basis of the new materiality analysis, in accordance with the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the control system will be revised in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nThe strategic focus of finance management is not considered in this context.\n\n#### **Forecasted economic environment 2024**\n\n#### **Development of the macroeconomic conditions**\n\nThe global economic outlook for 2024 is subdued overall and subject to uncertainty. Inflation is expected to ease in many economies, which will in turn see interest rates fall, and is likely to boost investor confidence. The International Monetary Fund expects global growth of approximately 3.1% for the current year. World trade is expected to reach 3.3%.\n\nFor the US economy, the International Monetary Fund expects an increase of 2.1% for 2024. Growth rates in emerging markets are predicted to be higher than the values in industrialized countries, though projected trends within this group vary. Growth of 4.6% is forecasted for the Chinese economy. Overall expectations for the euro area stand at 0.9%. For the German economy, weak growth of 0.5% is expected for the current year in the best-case scenario.\n\nThe following GDP trends are expected in 2024 for countries with Group sites: USA 2.1%, Slovenia 2.2%, Brazil 1.7%, Peru 2.7%, Greece 2.0%, Bulgaria 3.2%, Turkey 3.1%.\n\nSource: IMF (October 2023, January 2024), OECD (December 2023), Deutsche Bank Research (December 2023), Deka Bank (December 2023), Ifo Institute for Economic Research (December 2023).\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Development of the legal environment**\n\nAt the time the consolidated annual financial statements were prepared, the Executive Board saw no changes in the legal environment in the 2024 fiscal year that could have substantial effects on the Fraport Group.\n\n#### **Development of the industry-specific conditions**\n\nBased on the expected development in general economic conditions and considering the financial situation of the airlines, the International Air Transport Association IATA anticipates global passenger growth of 9.8% in 2024 compared to the previous year, based on revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs). This would represent a recovery of around 85% compared to the base year 2019. At the regional level, IATA assumes the following year-on-year growth rates based on RPKs:\n\n#### **Forecasted Increase Revenue Passenger Kilometers 2024 versus 2019 by Region**\n\n| Changes compared to the previous year in % |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Worldwide                                  | +9.0  |\n| Europe                                     | +8.0  |\n| North America                              | +6.0  |\n| Asia-Pacific                               | +10.0 |\n| Latin America                              | +13.0 |\n| Middle East                                | +12.0 |\n| Africa                                     | +9.0  |\n\nThe Airports Council International (ACI) expects a full recovery of passenger traffic in Europe in 2024 with growth of 1% compared to pre-crisis levels. For Germany, the German Aviation Association (Bundesverband der Deutschen Luftverkehrswirtschaft) expects a seat capacity of 89% of the 2019 passenger level. This comparatively low recovery rate is due in part to higher site costs.\n\nSource: IATA Global Outlook for Air Transport (December 2023), ACI Industry Outlook for 2023–2024, BDL press release (February 2024).\n\n#### **Forecasted business development for 2024**\n\nTaking into account the industry-specific conditions, the Executive Board expects traffic development at the Group airports to be positive overall in 2024, but with substantial variation among the sites. **Frankfurt** Airport will benefit from further recovery in traffic. Following passenger numbers of around 59.4 million in fiscal year 2023, the Executive Board expects this to increase to between approximately 61 million and 65 million passengers in the 2024 fiscal year. Traffic development is being driven in part by an increase in traffic to and from China, as well as further recovery in the business travel segment.\n\nPositive traffic development is also expected at the **international Group airports**, as follows:\n\nA further passenger recovery compared to the previous year is expected at **Ljubljana** Airport and at the Brazilian Group airports in **Fortaleza** and **Porto Alegre**. However, the sites are expected to remain substantially below the pre-crisis level of the 2019 fiscal year. At **Lima** Airport, the traffic volume is approaching and may slightly exceed the 2019 level. At the 14 **Greek regional airports**, the passenger numbers are expected to be around or slightly above the high level of the previous year 2023. In **Varna** and **Burgas**, as well as in **Antalya**, some substantial traffic increases are forecasted compared to the previous year.\n\nChanges to the outlook could occur depending on geopolitical developments.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Forecasted results of operations for 2024**\n\nThe expected passenger development will lead to a rise in the Group revenue in fiscal year 2024. The traffic-related growth in revenue will be bolstered by increases in charges at the Frankfurt site and at the Group companies Fraport Brasil, Fraport Greece, and Fraport Twin Star. On the expense side, the Executive Board expects an increase in wage costs at the Frankfurt site in particular. In addition, the increase in traffic volume will lead to higher expenses at the Frankfurt site and a rise in concession charges at the Group companies Fraport Greece and Lima. The largely earnings-neutral management of aviation security controls at the Frankfurt site will also have the effect of increasing revenue and expenses. Exchange rate effects from the conversion of the functional currencies of Group companies in Lima, Fortaleza, and Porto Alegre as well as Fraport USA into the Group currency, the euro, may also have a positive or negative impact on the earnings contribution from Group companies.\n\nGiven the forecasted traffic ranges and the resulting uncertainty regarding income and expense developments, the Executive Board expects a **Group EBITDA** of between approximately €1,260 million and about €1,360 million. The **Group result** is expected to be between approximately €435 million and around €530 million, with increasing depreciation and amortization and a deterioration in the financial result, mainly due to higher interest expenses. The improvement in the result combined with an increase in assets will result in a **ROFRA** of around or slightly above the 2023 level of 6.6%.\n\nDespite the forecasted development of the result, the Executive Board does not intend to propose the distribution of any **dividends**  in the 2024 fiscal year on account of the capital expenditure-related negative free cash flow.\n\nAt the level of **Fraport AG**, the Executive Board expects **net income** of between approximately €300 million and approximately €350 million in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\n#### **Forecasted segment development for 2024**\n\nThe planned traffic developments will have a positive impact on the revenue of the four Fraport segments. The Executive Board expects that the EBITDA in the **Aviation** segment will continue to rise, but remain below €400 million. The Executive Board also expects the EBITDA in the **Retail & Real Estate** segment to improve, and forecasts a figure of around or slightly above €400 million. In the **Ground Handling** segment, the Executive Board expects the EBITDA to be approximately balanced in 2024. Despite higher variable concession charges, particularly at Fraport Greece, and the loss of the positive one-off effects of fiscal year 2023, such as the settlement of a legal dispute at Group company Fraport USA, the Executive Board expects a consistent or slightly positive EBITDA for the **International Activities & Services** segment compared to the previous year. In addition to the positive expected traffic development at Group airports, further positive one-off effects are expected to bolster profit development in 2024.\n\n### **Forecasted asset and financial position for 2024**\n\nDespite the traffic-related improvement in the operating result, the Executive Board expects **free cash flow** to remain negative in 2024 due to ongoing expansion activities at the Frankfurt and Lima sites and to be in the mid negative three-digit million euro range. The negative free cash flow will increase net financial debt in 2024. Cash inflows and outflows in connection with the international Group companies, exchange rate effects, and changes to net current assets will also affect the development of net financial debt. Depending on the improvement in the operating result, the ratio of **net financial debt to EBITDA** is expected to be roughly at the level of 2023. Due to the range of the forecasted EBITDA and the free cash flow development, the figure may be slightly above or below that level. Despite extensive financing measures and the further utilization of project financing in Lima, the **Group liquidity** is forecasted to be below the level of 2023, due in particular to the negative free cash flow. However, the long-term target value of €1 billion will continue to be substantially exceeded.\n\nAt the level of **Fraport AG**, the Executive Board likewise forecasts a clear decline in **liquidity** as a result of the expected negative free cash flow. However, thanks to the extensive financing measures in place, liquidity will remain substantially above the target value of €1 billion.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Medium-term outlook**\n\nOver the medium term, a positive development in the global economy and global passenger numbers is expected. A return to 2019 passenger levels in Frankfurt is expected until approximately 2026. Group airports will also benefit from forecasted mediumto long-term global market growth and show positive traffic development (see also the \"Strategy\" chapter).\n\nRising passenger numbers will have a positive impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group and will contribute to the further growth of Group EBITDA. The inauguration of the terminals in Frankfurt and Lima, on the other hand, will result in higher depreciation and amortization and a loss of the opportunity to capitalize interest expenses. Due to these effects and the expiration of the current Antalya concession at the end of 2026, the Executive Board expects a temporary reduction of earnings during the forecast period.\n\nAs a result of the inauguration of the terminals in Frankfurt and Lima and the associated gradual reduction of the capital expenditure program, the Executive Board expects there to be a substantial recovery in the free cash flow from 2025, with noticeably positive effects on the net financial debt from the 2026 fiscal year. In this context, the net financial debt will also start to decrease from the 2026 fiscal year at the latest. On account of the decline in net financial debt and the expected improvement in the Group EBITDA, the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDA is expected to improve further in the medium term.\n\nFuture capital expenditure obligations may be financed with debt instruments described above and cash flows from operations (see also the \"Finance Management\" and \"Asset and Financial Position\" chapters).\n\nFor the dividend payment, the Executive Board aims to resume a dividend policy in the forecast period. Before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, this was a pay-out ratio of between 40% and 60% of the profit share of the shareholders of Fraport AG as well as with a dividend that was at least stable compared to the previous year. The Executive Board plans to submit a dividend distribution proposal to the AGM again once the net financial debt to EBITDA ratio approaches the target value of 5.\n\nFrankfurt/Main, March 12, 2024\n\nFraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nDr. Stefan Schulte\n\ne Giesen\n\nlia Kranenberg\n\nDr. Pierre Dominique Prümm\n\nDr. Stefan Schulte Anke Giesen Julia Kranenberg Dr. Pierre Dominique Prümm Prof Dr. Matthias Zieschang\n\nWhere the statements made in this document relate to the future rather than the past, they are based on a number of assumptions about future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide and which could have the effect that the actual results will differ materially from these statements.

Six of the twelve vehicles of the new Sky Line train have already been delivered. In addition to ample space for luggage, specially designed handrails provide more freedom of movement. Successful test runs have already been carried out.\n\nNew standards are also being set in terms of \"green financing\": Part of the financing for the Sky Line train is being provided in connection with the classification of the EU taxonomy. This makes it the first \"green financing\" of Fraport AG.\n\n# *Consolidated Financials Statements for the 2023 Fiscal Year*\n\n- *138* [Consolidated Income Statement](#page-137-0)\n- *139*

view of a construction site. In the foreground, there is a large, multi-story building under construction, with its steel and concrete framework exposed. The building is surrounded by dirt and construction materials. In the background, there are other buildings, some of which are also under construction. There are also vehicles and equipment scattered throughout the site. The overall impression is one of a busy and active construction zone.\n\n# *Lima expansion project*\n\nIn order to do justice to the importance of Lima Airport as an international hub airport in the future as well, extensive infrastructure and expansion measures are taking place. Numerous airside construction projects, such as a new tower, have already been completed. In April 2023 the second runway was also inaugurated with the first commercial flight on it.\n\nThe first construction phase with a capacity of 30 million passengers is scheduled to be put into operation at the end of 2024. The new terminal is scheduled to serve up to 40 million passengers a year when it becomes fully operational in 2025.\n\nThe new terminal will make an important contribution to the strategic development of Lima Airport.\n\n# *Group Notes for the 2023 Fiscal Year*\n\n- *146* [Consolidated Statement of Changes in](#page-145-0)  Non-current Assets\n- *148* [Segment Reporting](#page-147-0)\n-

Consolidation and Accounting Policies*\n\n# **1 Basis for the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nFraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt/Main (hereinafter: Fraport AG), is a global airport operator and its main business focus is the operation of Frankfurt Main airport, one of Europe's most important air transport hubs. Fraport AG is headquartered at Frankfurt Airport, Germany. Fraport AG is registered in the Frankfurt am Main District Court, Department B, under number 7042.\n\nFraport AG has prepared its consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023 in accordance with the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nWe have applied the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the consolidated financial statements and the interpretations about them issued by the International Financial Reporting Committee (IFRS, IC) as adopted in the European Union (EU), in force on the balance sheet date, completely and without any restriction in accounting, measurement, and disclosure in the 2023 consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), these notes to the financial statements contain the supplementary disclosures according to Sections 313, 314 HGB.\n\nAs a capital market-oriented parent company of the Fraport Group, Fraport AG must prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council dated July 19, 2002 (new version dated April 9, 2008) on the application of international accounting standards.\n\nThe consolidated income statement is prepared according to the nature of expenditure method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros (€).

Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.\n\nCompanies controlled by Fraport AG are considered to be subsidiaries. A company is controlled by Fraport AG if Fraport AG holds decision-making power on the basis of voting or other rights allowing it to determine the significant activities of the affiliated company, participates in positive or negative variable returns from the affiliated company, and is able to affect these returns through its decision-making power.\n\nInclusion in the consolidated financial statements commences on the date when control is obtained.\n\nA joint arrangement applies if the Fraport Group makes joint decisions on operations on the basis of a contractual agreement with third parties. Joint management is exercised if decisions on significant activities require the unanimous agreement of all parties. A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture.\n\nFor all joint arrangements in the Fraport Group, the partners have a share in the net assets of a jointly managed, legally independent company; these are therefore joint ventures.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nAssociated companies are Fraport investments in which Fraport AG is able to exercise major influence on financial and business policies.\n\nThe annual financial statements of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of shared accounting and valuation principles.\n\nThe fiscal year of Fraport AG and all consolidated companies is the calendar year.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Fraport AG are dominated by the parent company.

consolidated in the Fraport consolidated financial statements. The capital shares in the subsidiaries directly held by Fraport AG as a parent company do not differ from the proportion of voting rights held. There are no preferred shares in the subsidiaries.\n\n# **3 Consolidation Principles**\n\nCapital consolidation of all business combinations follows the purchase method.\n\nAll identifiable acquired assets and the acquired liabilities, including contingent liabilities, are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The acquisition costs for company acquisitions correspond to the fair value of the transferred assets and liabilities. Incidental acquisition costs are recorded as expenses as they are incurred. Conditional purchase price payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of a conditional consideration, which is deemed to be an asset or a liability, will be recognized either through profit or loss or as a change in other income. Non-controlling interests are valued at fair value or the corresponding proportion of the identifiable net assets of the acquired company. In the case of step-bystep company acquisitions, the shares already held in the acquired company are revalued through profit or loss at fair value on the date that control is obtained.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is recorded insofar as the sum of the consideration that is transferred, the amount of all non-controlling interests in the acquired company and any equity that was previously held and revalued on the acquisition date is higher than the balance of the acquired and revalued identifiable assets and the revalued acquired liabilities. If the comparison results in a lower amount, a net income on acquisition at a price below the fair value is recorded after the assigned values are reviewed.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. Initial measurements of companies accounted for using the equity method are carried out at fair value at the time of acquisition, similarly to capital consolidation for subsidiaries. Subsequent changes in the shareholders' equity and the updating of the difference from initial valuation change the amount accounted for at equity.\n\nLoans, accounts receivable, and liabilities, contingencies and other contingent liabilities between companies included in the consolidated financial statements, internal expenses, and income, as well as income from Group investments are eliminated.\n\n#### **Currency translation**\n\nAnnual financial statements of companies outside Germany denominated in foreign currencies are translated on the basis of the functional currency concept in accordance with IAS 21. The assets and liabilities of the consolidated companies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and shareholders' equity at the historical exchange rate, whereas, for the purpose of simplification, the expenses and income are translated at average exchange rates, since the companies are financially, economically, and organizationally independent. Foreign currency translation differences are included directly in equity without affecting profit or loss.\n\nThe following material exchange rates were used for the currency translation:\n\n#### **Exchange rates**\n\n| Unit/Currency in €         | Exchange rate<br>December 31, 2023 | Average exchange rate<br>2023 | Exchange rate<br>December 31, 2022 | Average exchange rate<br>2023 |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1 US Dollar (US-\\$)        | 0.9028                             | 0.9248                        | 0.9367                             | 0.9496                        |\n| 1 Turkish New Lira (TRY)   | 0.0305                             | 0.3882                        | 0.0500                             | 0.0574                        |\n| 1 Renminbi Yuan (CNY)      | 0.1268                             | 0.1305                        | 0.1355                             | 0.1413                        |\n| 1 Hong Kong Dollar (HKD)   | 0.1156                             | 0.1181                        | 0.1202                             | 0.1213                        |\n| 1 Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN) | 0.2445                             | 0.2472                        | 0.2473                             | 0.2476                        |\n| 100 Russian Rubles (RUB)   | 1.0003                             | 1.0808                        | 1.3063                             | 1.3469                        |\n| 1 Brazilian Real (BRL)     | 0.1861                             | 0.1852                        | 0.1771                             | 0.1838                        |\n\nBusiness transactions in foreign currencies are accounted at the exchange rate on the date of the business transaction. Measurement of the resulting assets and liabilities that are nominally bound in the foreign currency as at the balance sheet date takes place at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are generally recorded through profit or loss.\n\n# **4 Accounting Principles**\n\n#### **Uniform accounting measurement policies**\n\nThe financial statements of the Fraport Group are based on accounting and measurement policies that are applied consistently throughout the Group.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are drafted on the basis of historic acquisition and production costs. Particular exceptions include financial assets available for sale and derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe following overview contains a summary of the valuation methods for items in the statement of financial position.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Measurement policies by financial position item**\n\n| Financial position item                                | Measurement policy                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assets                                                 |                                                                  |\n| Goodwill                                               | Accumulated impairment (IAS 36)                                  |\n| Investments in airport operating projects              | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Property, plant, and equipment                         | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Investment property                                    | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Other financial assets                                 | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Trade accounts receivable                              | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Other financial receivables and assets                 | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Other non-financial receivables and assets             | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Inventories                                            | Lower of acquisition or production cost and net realizable value |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                              | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Derivative financial instruments                       | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Liabilities                                            |                                                                  |\n| Financial liabilities                                  | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Trade accounts payable                                 | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n| Other financial liabilities                            | According to IFRS 9 and IFRS 16                                  |\n| Other non-financial liabilities                        | Amortized costs                                                  |\n| Provisions for pensions and similar obligations        | Projected unit credit method                                     |\n| Other provisions                                       | Present value or amount required to settle the obligation        |\n| Derivative financial instruments                       | According to IFRS 9                                              |\n\n#### **Recognition of income and expenses**\n\nAccording to IFRS 15, revenue from contracts with customers must be recognized in the amount for which the company has fulfilled its performance obligation and the customer has received the authority to dispose of the agreed goods and services. The timing and amount of the revenue to be recognized is determined according to the following five-step process:\n\n- Identification of the contract/s with a customer,\n- Identification of the independent performance obligations,\n- Determination of the transaction price,\n- Distribution of the transaction price to the individual performance obligations,\n- Revenue recognition upon fulfillment of the performance obligations.\n\nIncome and expenses from the same transactions and/or events are recognized in the same period.\n\nIn the Fraport Group, revenue is divided into the following types:\n\nThe Aviation segment includes, in particular, revenue from airport charges, which are based on a regulation approved by HMWEVW (Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing) (see note 49), as well as from security services at the Frankfurt site. With the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges were also recognized for the first time under security services. The airport charges are for the takeoffs, landings (including noise and emission), and parking of aircraft as well as for the use of passenger facilities. Security services refer to services for passenger, baggage, and cargo inspections on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI). The performance obligations in the Aviation segment are usually fulfilled within one day and recognized accordingly.\n\nIn the Retail & Real Estate segment, revenue is divided into the areas of real estate, retail, and parking. Real estate revenue relates to leasing of buildings at Frankfurt Airport. In addition, Fraport AG offers various services in the area of real estate management for third parties. These range from the development and marketing of real estate management to energy management.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue in the retail sector is divided into the categories of shopping, advertising, and services and primarily results from revenue from the rental of retail and service areas as well as the marketing of advertising space.\n\nThe area of parking includes, in particular, revenue from the leasing of parking spaces at various parking facilities. As a general rule, revenue from leasing and all other services is recognized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease or for a fixed term. In contrast, for disposals of real estate inventories, revenue is recognized at the time of transfer of control to the buyer.\n\nIn the Ground Handling segment, revenue is divided into the areas of ground services and charges for infrastructure. The apron services are responsible for carrying out loading and transport services. This includes, among other things, the transportation of passengers, baggage, and cargo as well as the loading and unloading of aircraft. In addition, the handling of freight includes, among other things, the landside processing of air freight and mail as well as freight documentation. The infrastructure charges include, in particular, charges for providing the central infrastructure, such as the central baggage transfer system, at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe performance obligations in the Ground Handling segment are usually fulfilled within one day and recognized accordingly.\n\nThe International Activities & Services segment includes the operation, maintenance, development, and expansion of airports and infrastructure facilities in Germany and abroad. These services also encompass consulting services and customized solutions to the challenges of airport management (so-called ORAT services – operational readiness and airport transfer). The services of the foreign investments essentially correspond to those described for the Aviation, Retail & Real Estate, and Ground Handling segments. In addition, revenue in the segment includes contract revenue from construction and expansion services related to airport operating projects abroad which are being carried out in line with the respective progress in each construction project. The accounting treatment follows IFRIC 12.\n\nIn general, the payment terms are set depending on the type of revenue. The payment terms are typically between 0 and 40 days.\n\nInterest income is recorded using the effective interest rate method.\n\n#### **Goodwill**\n\nAfter the initial recognition of goodwill acquired in the course of a business merger, it is measured at acquisition costs less any cumulative impairment losses.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in the course of a business merger is assigned to the cash-generating units of the Group since the acquisition date. Goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The recoverable amount corresponds to the higher amount of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Essentially, in the Fraport Group the value in use based on a company valuation model (discounted cash flow method) is used to calculate the recoverable amount. All goodwill items are tested for impairment at least once a year in December in accordance with IAS 36.88 – 99. In the event of an impairment, an impairment loss is recognized. Goodwill is not written up when the reasons for impairment are eliminated. Goodwill is not subject to regular depreciation and amortization.\n\n#### **Investments in airport operating projects**\n\nTo allow for better transparency, investments in airport operating projects are presented separately. These consist of concessions for the operation of airports in Greece, Varna and Burgas (Bulgaria), Lima (Peru), and Fortaleza and Porto Alegre (Brazil) acquired within the scope of service concession agreements (see also note 49). The concession agreements for the operation of the airports fall under the application of IFRIC 12.17 and are recognized according to the intangible asset model, since Fraport receives the right in each case to impose a charge on airport users in exchange for the obligation to pay concession fees and provide construction and expansion services. The contractual obligations to pay concession fees that are not variable, but contractually fixed in amount, are recorded as financial liabilities. These liabilities are initially recognized at fair value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Airport operation rights received as consideration are recorded as intangible assets at the same amount and reported under investments in airport operating projects. The rights received as consideration for construction and expansion services are recognized at the cost of production for the period in which the production costs are incurred. Revenue and expenses from construction and expansion services are generally recorded pursuant to IFRIC 12.14 and in accordance with IFRS 15. Borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the costs of acquisition if the requirements (see \"Borrowing costs\") are fulfilled. Costs for ongoing, scheduled maintenance measures in connection with maintaining the operational readiness of the operated infrastructure are recognized as\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\ncurrent expenses for the period. Provisions for corresponding maintenance measures are recognized if the concession agreements contain maintenance obligations that are specified in terms of amount.\n\nThe recognized financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Subsequent measurement of the capitalized rights is at the cost of acquisition or production less cumulative regular depreciation and amortization over the term of the concessions.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in accordance with IAS 36, where necessary.\n\n#### **Other intangible assets**\n\nAcquired intangible assets (IAS 38) are recognized at acquisition cost. Their useful life is limited. They are amortized over their useful lives using straight-line depreciation and amortization. Where necessary, impairment losses are recognized in accordance with IAS 36. If the recoverable amount of the asset later exceeds the carrying amount after an impairment loss has been recognized, the asset is written up to a maximum of the recoverable amount. The write-up through profit or loss is limited to the amortized carrying amount that would have resulted if no impairment losses had been recognized in the past.\n\nDevelopment costs for internally generated intangible assets are capitalized at manufacturing cost when it is probable that the manufacture of these assets will generate future economic benefits for the company and the costs can be measured reliably. The manufacturing costs cover all costs directly attributable to the manufacturing process. If the conditions for capitalization are not met, the expenses are recognized in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. Internally generated intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives using the straight-line method.\n\nBorrowing costs of other intangible assets that constitute qualifying assets are recognized (see \"Borrowing costs\").\n\n#### **Property, plant, and equipment**\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment (IAS 16) are recognized at the cost of acquisition or production less straight-line depreciation and amortization and any impairment losses pursuant to IAS 36, where applicable. If the recoverable amount of the asset later exceeds the carrying amount after an impairment loss has been recognized pursuant to IAS 36, the asset is written up to a maximum of the recoverable amount. The write-up through profit or loss is limited to the amortized carrying amount that would have resulted if no impairment loss had been recognized in the past. Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Production costs essentially include all direct costs including appropriate overheads. Borrowing costs of property, plant, and equipment that constitute qualifying assets are recognized (see \"Borrowing costs\").\n\nEach part of an item of property, plant, and equipment with an acquisition cost that is significant in relation to the total value of the item is measured and depreciated separately with regard to its useful life and the appropriate depreciation method.\n\nGovernment grants and third-party grants related to assets are included in liabilities and are released straight-line over the useful life of the asset for which the grant has been given. Grants related to income are included as other operating income through profit or loss (IAS 20).\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Investment property**\n\nInvestment property (IAS 40) includes property held to earn long-term lease revenue or capital appreciation, which is not owneroccupied; it also consists of land held for a currently undetermined future use.\n\nIf land as yet held for an undetermined use is now defined as being held for sale and development has begun, it is transferred to inventories; if it is intended for own use, it is transferred to property, plant, and equipment.\n\nInvestment property is measured initially at the cost of acquisition or production. Subsequent measurement is at the cost of acquisition or production less regular straight-line depreciation and amortization and impairment losses according to IAS 36 where applicable. Borrowing costs of investment properties that constitute qualifying assets are capitalized (see \"Borrowing costs\").\n\n#### **Borrowing costs**\n\nBorrowing costs (IAS 23) that relate to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset are required to be capitalized as part of the acquisition/production cost of such assets. At Fraport AG, the planned investment measures form the basis for determining the qualifying assets. If the volume of the planned measures at Fraport AG exceeds €25 million and if the construction period is more than one year, all assets produced as part of the measure are recognized as qualifying assets. Each Group company defines its own individual criteria for what constitutes the presence of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs include interest, ancillary costs associated with debt capital and currency differences.\n\n#### **Regular depreciation and amortization**\n\nRegular depreciation and amortization is carried out on the basis of estimated useful technical and economic life. It takes place fundamentally on a Group-wide basis according to the straight-line method. The data on expected useful life also includes the useful lifespans of individual components.\n\nThe following useful lifespans are taken as a basis:\n\n#### **Regular depreciation and amortization**\n\n| In years                                         |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n|                                                  |         |\n| Investments in airport operating projects        | 25 – 50 |\n| Other concession and operator rights             | 34 – 39 |\n| Software and other intangible assets             | 1 – 30  |\n| Buildings (structural sections)                  | 5 – 80  |\n| Technical buildings                              | 20 – 40 |\n| Building equipment                               | 12 – 38 |\n| Ground equipment                                 | 5 – 99  |\n| Flight operating areas                           |         |\n| Takeoff/landing runways                          | 7 – 99  |\n| Aprons                                           | 20 – 99 |\n| Taxiway bridges                                  | 80      |\n| Taxiways                                         | 20 – 99 |\n| Other technical equipment and machinery          | 3 – 33  |\n| Vehicles (including special vehicles)            | 1 – 20  |\n| Other equipment, operating, and office equipment | 1 – 25  |\n\nThe expected useful life of investment property corresponds to the expected useful life of the property, which is part of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Impairment losses pursuant to IAS 36**\n\nImpairment losses on assets are recognized pursuant to IAS 36. Assets are tested for impairment if there are indications of an impairment loss. An impairment test is carried out annually for existing goodwill. Impairment losses are recorded if the recoverable amount of the asset has fallen below its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash inflows and outflows from the use and subsequent disposal of the asset.\n\nSince it is not generally possible in the Fraport Group to allocate cash flows to individual assets, cash-generating units are formed and the existing goodwill is allocated to them. A cash-generating unit is defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates separate cash inflows and outflows.\n\nRegardless of indicators for possible impairment losses, assets are subject to an annual impairment test pursuant to IAS 36.\n\nGenerally, the value in use is calculated as the recoverable amount. The value in use is determined by the entity through application of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nDetermination of the future cash flows of the cash-generating units is based on the planning figures. The value in use is generally determined based on the future cash flows estimated on the basis of the current planning figures for the years between 2024 to 2028 as approved by the Executive Board and in effect at the time the impairment tests are made (in December of the year under review), and on the basis of the current long-term plans up to 2035 or over the respective contractual periods in the case of investments in airport operating projects and other concession and operator rights. These forecasts are based on past experience and the expected market performance, which is based on external studies and internal forecasts. A growth rate of 1.2% (previous year: 1.2%) based on the planning assumptions is taken into account in the perpetual annuity. The adequacy of the growth rate is checked using external forecasts on future traffic developments. The discount factor was a country-specific, weighted average cost of capital (WACC) before taxes of between 9.0% and 15.2% (previous year: 8.3% to 20.4%).\n\nThe forecasts presented in the \"Business Outlook\" chapter of the management report are in line with the base scenario of the planning and included in the impairment test calculations. The underlying planning also takes into account the costs of reducing carbon emissions as outlined in the \"decarbonization master plan\" in the \"Climate protection\" chapter and the costs of implementing the further climate protection measures presented. The passenger forecasts used in the planning take into account potential effects of the climate policy. Therefore, due to the consequently increased expected CO2 price, higher ticket prices of 10% until 2035 and a resulting reduction in demand of 5% is assumed.\n\nThe overall economic development continues to be characterized by the geopolitical crises the economic consequences of which, in particular the current inflation trend, are resulting in greater planning uncertainty. In order to account for these planning uncertainties, sensitivity analyses were carried out for all cash-generating units. As a general rule, the impairment of all units was assessed at a WACC higher by 0.5 percentage points and with a reduction in the revenue by 0.5 percentage points over the entire planning period. For the Slovenia cash-generating units, the increase in WACC results in an impairment requirement in the low millions range. The impairment of the cash-generating units within the framework of the revenue scenarios can be further confirmed.\n\nAdditional sensitivity analyses were also carried out for the cash-generating unit airport operations of Fraport AG. Scenarios for the underlying cash flows were developed by adjusting the planned increases in charges and the forecast traffic figures. One of the sensitivity analyses highlights the effects of a more drastic climate policy, which could lead to an increase of up to 16% in ticket prices. This scenario takes into account a reduction in passenger demand of up to 8% compared to the base scenario due to the higher prices.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe individual cash flow scenarios were then discounted with different capital cost rates after taxes ranging from 5.6% to 6.6%. The results of the sensitivity analysis allow the conclusion that there is no structural overestimation of the infrastructure. The scenarios show a range of the company value, ranging from overfunding in the low single-digit billions to underfunding in the low single-digit billions in the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario describes the scenario of a more drastic climate policy with a decline in passengers of up to 8% compared to the current forecast at unchanged planned fee increases. An adjustment in the fee increase in accordance with the German Air Traffic Law (LuftVG), in turn results in there no longer being an impairment requirement.\n\nAnother significant influence on the company's value is the value added of the perpetual pension. Therefore, the impairment in the base scenario was verified to ensure it applies even with a reduced growth rate of the perpetual annuity of 0.5%. The adjustment in the growth rate does not result in an impairment requirement.\n\n#### **Leases**\n\nThe Fraport Group has recognized right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases in which the Fraport Group is the lessee in the amount of the present value of the payment obligations entered into. Right-of-use assets are recognized if the leasing contract entitles the user to control the use of an identified asset against payment of a fee for a certain period of time. The right-of-use assets are shown under property, plant and equipment. The lease liabilities are shown under other liabilities. Lease liabilities include fixed lease payments less lease incentives to be provided by the lessor, variable payments that are linked to an index or interest rate, expected residual value payments from residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if the exercise was deemed to be reasonably certain, and contractual penalties for those termination of the lease if it is considered in the term that a termination option will be used. Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate that the lease is implicitly based on, if the lessor provided that interest rate. Otherwise, discounting is carried out using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. This is derived from country-specific, risk-free debt financing interest rates with matching currencies and maturities. The right-ofuse assets are measured at acquisition costs, which consist of the present value of the lease liability and initial direct costs as well as dismantling obligations and leasing payments received before or upon provision, less leasing incentives received. The subsequent measurement is carried out at amortized cost. Right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. If leasing agreements contain extension or termination options, all facts and circumstances are taken into account for the determination of the contract term that offer an economic incentive to exercise extension options or not to exercise such options. The term will only be adjusted if the exercise or non-exercise of such options is reasonably certain.\n\nTaking into account the principle of materiality (IAS 1 in conjunction with IFRS 16.BC86), right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are accounted for exclusively for substantial real estate leasing contracts. Payments from leasing contracts, operating and office equipment, technical systems and machines, and properties with a contractual volume of less than €0.1 million are recorded as expenses in the same way as previous operating lease contracts. Furthermore, the regulations of IFRS 16 are not applied to intangible assets. The future minimum lease payments arising from the existing lease contracts for operating and office equipment and technical systems and machines are specified in note 46.\n\nIf an entity of the Fraport Group acts as a lessor and the contract will be classified as an operating lease, the leased property is shown in property, plant and equipment at amortized cost. Rental income is generally recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nIf an entity of the Fraport Group acts as a lessor and the contract will be classified as finance lease, Fraport recognizes the receivable in the amount of the net investment of the lease.\n\n#### **Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method**\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associated companies are recognized at the pro rata share of equity, including goodwill. Impairment losses are recorded if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. The investments are tested for impairment annually.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Other financial assets**\n\nOther financial assets include securities, loans and other investments. Other financial assets are recognized at fair value on the settlement date, i.e. at the time the asset is created or transferred, plus transaction costs. Other financial assets with a remaining term of up to one year are reported as current. The recognition and subsequent valuation is based on the cash flow characteristics and of the business models according to which they are managed.\n\nA classification at amortized acquisition costs occurs when both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and\n- The contractual terms and conditions lead to cash flows that only represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe loans are valued at amortized acquisition costs using the effective interest method.\n\nThe valuation as fair value other comprehensive income with recycling (FVOCI with recycling) is applied if the following conditions are met:\n\n- The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to achieved by both holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and\n- The contractual terms and conditions lead to cash flows that only represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nFVOCI with Recycling applied to securities. Changes in value are recognized in other comprehensive income; interest income, remeasurements of currency translation gains and losses and impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss; if there is a premature sale, gains or losses are recycled from equity to profit or loss.\n\nFor other investments, the FVOCI option is exercised for strategic reasons. The fair value changes are recorded under other result. The profit and loss recorded in other result are not recycled with an effect on the income statement and no impairment losses are recognized in the income statement (FVOCI without recycling).\n\nWhen deciding whether a contractual amendment leads to a disposal of a financial asset, quantitative and qualitative criteria are taken into account.\n\n#### **Trade accounts receivable, other financial and non-financial receivables and assets**\n\nTrade accounts receivable and other financial and non-financial receivables and assets are recognized on the settlement date, i.e., at the time the asset is created or economic ownership is transferred, at fair value plus transaction costs.\n\nTrade accounts receivable, other financial and non-financial receivables and assets, and receivables from banks with a remaining term of less than one year are reported as current.\n\nTrade accounts receivable, accounts receivable from banks, and all other financial receivables with fixed or ascertainable payments are held to \"collect cash flows\" and have \"cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest\". Subsequent measurement is carried out at amortized cost of acquisition, based on the effective interest method. Receivables in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **Assistance received from government**\n\nIn principle, public contributions (IAS 20) are only recognized if there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them are met and that the contributions are granted.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nContributions related to income are deducted from these expenses in the period in which the corresponding expenses are incurred. Entitlements to contributions for which sufficient security is in place are reported under other non-financial assets.\n\nThe contributions received in connection with short-time work schedules were recognized in personnel expenses as a reduction in expenses, and the existing entitlements were reported under other non-financial assets.\n\n#### **Impairment losses of financial assets**\n\nIn general, impairment losses are recognized through profit or loss by directly reducing the carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nThe impairment provisions are applied to the following assets:\n\n- financial assets in the form of debt instruments that are measured at amortized costs, such as trade accounts receivables, loans to associated companies and bank balances and deposits\n- financial assets in the form of debt instruments that are measured at fair value without affecting profit or loss\n\nOn each balance sheet date, the carrying amounts of the aforementioned financial assets that are measured at amortized costs or at the fair value without affecting profit or loss are assessed to see whether there is any objective evidence (such as considerable financial difficulties of the debtor, high probability of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, or a permanent decline of the fair value below amortized cost) that the asset may be impaired. The assessment takes place by considering forward-looking, macro-economic information on whether the credit risk has significantly increased (or decreased). The assessment of whether there is a significant increase or decrease in credit risk is relevant for whether loan defaults must be calculated over the next 12 months or over the entire term. The assessment is carried out on the basis of the change in credit risk during the expected term of the financial instrument.\n\nFor trade accounts receivable, a risk provision is recorded on a collective basis in the amount of the expected payment defaults over the entire term of the receivables. The determination of the expected payment defaults are based on historical information on payment defaults and qualitative insights into possible future defaults.\n\nThe available probability of default of the respective counterparty, taking into account insolvency rates, taken from external sources, are used to calculate the expected credit loss for financial assets in the general approach and for securities.\n\nA risk provision is calculated taking into account the general materiality guidelines according to IAS 1. Changes are recognized in the amount of the required risk provisions as a write-up or impairment.\n\nIf an already impaired receivable is individually designated as non-recoverable, the asset is derecognized.\n\n#### **Inventories**\n\nInventories include work-in-process, raw materials, consumables, supplies, and property held for sale within the ordinary course of business.\n\nWork-in-process, raw materials, consumables, and supplies are measured at the lower of acquisition or production cost or net realizable value. Acquisition or production costs are generally calculated using the average cost method. Production costs include direct costs and adequate overheads.\n\nProperty held for sale within the ordinary course of business is also measured at the lower of acquisition or production cost or net realizable value.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe subsequent production cost required for land development is estimated for the entire marketable land area on the basis of specific cost unit rates for individual development measures. Depending on the land sales recognized in the respective year under review, the development costs are allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining land area to be sold. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less the costs incurred until the time of sale, and discounted over the planned selling period.\n\nExternal reports on the fair value of the land being sold, as well as information about previous land sales, form the basis for the calculation of the estimated selling price.\n\nWhere the inventories constitute qualifying assets, the borrowing costs are capitalized.\n\nIf a write-down made in previous periods is no longer necessary, a write-up is recognized.\n\n#### **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents basically include cash, cash accounts, and short-term cash deposits (including restricted cash) with banks maturing in three months or less. Cash deposits with banks with a maturity of more than three months from the time of acquisition are recorded in this item if their values do not fluctuate significantly and they can be liquidated at short notice without deduction for risk. Cash and cash equivalents are recognized at amortized costs. Cash in foreign currencies is translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\n#### **Non-current assets held for sale**\n\nNon-current assets held for sale are recognized at either the carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is the lower amount.\n\n#### **Accounting of taxes on income**\n\nTaxes on income are recognized using the liability method pursuant to IAS 12. All tax expenses and refunds directly related to income are recorded as taxes on income. These also include withholding taxes and penalties. Interest accrued based on subsequently assessed taxes are recorded as an interest expense.\n\nCurrent taxes are recognized on the date when the liability for taxes on income is incurred.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized pursuant to IAS 12 using the liability method based on temporary differences on a case by case basis. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the IFRS and tax financial positions of the single entities, and differences arising from unused, utilizable loss and interest carry-forwards and consolidation transactions. The recognition of goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes does not lead to deferred taxes.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset in the IFRS financial position exceeds its tax base (e.g. non-current assets depreciated on a straight-line basis), and if the difference is temporary, a deferred tax liability is recognized. Pursuant to the IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognized from financial position differences and for carry-forwards of unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available, against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated at future tax rates insofar as these have already been legally established and/or the legislative process is largely completed. Changes in deferred taxes on the financial position generally lead to deferred tax income or expense. When transactions resulting in a change to deferred taxes are recorded directly in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss, the change to deferred taxes is also included directly in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted insofar as these income tax claims and liabilities relate to the same tax authority and to the same taxable entity or a group of different taxable entities that, however, are assessed jointly for income tax purposes.\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries if Fraport can control the timing of the reversal and it is not expected that these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n#### **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**\n\nThe provisions for pensions relate to defined benefit plans and have been calculated in accordance with IAS 19 under the application of actuarial methods and an interest rate of 3.16% (previous year: 3.69%). For the calculation of the interest expense from the defined benefit plans and the income from plan assets, the same interest rate is used as a basis.\n\nRe-measurements resulting from the change in the interest rate or from the difference between actual and computed income from plan assets, for example, are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) as non-reclassifiable.\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. The calculation takes place by discounting the future estimated cash outflows with the interest rate from industry bonds of the highest creditworthiness. The industry bonds are denominated in the currency of the distribution amounts and show the relevant maturities of the pension obligations. If benefit claims from the defined benefit plans are covered by plan assets in the form of reinsurance, the fair value of the plan assets is netted with the DBO. Benefit claims that are not covered by plan assets are recognized as pension provisions.\n\nAs in the previous year, the calculations did not include salary increases for the active members of the Executive Board. For former members of the Executive Board retirement pensions are valued in accordance with the Act on Adjustments to Compensation and Retirement in Hesse as amended. The calculation of provisions for pensions was based on the 2018G mortality tables by Professor Heubeck.\n\nThe service cost and net interest are recognized in personnel expenses.\n\nWith regard to the description of the various plans, see note 38.\n\n#### **Provisions for taxes**\n\nProvisions for current taxes are recognized for tax expected to be payable in the year under review and/or previous years taking into account anticipated risks.\n\n#### **Other provisions**\n\nProvisions represent liabilities that are uncertain with regard to amount and/or maturity. Other provisions are recognized in the amount required to settle the obligations. The amount recognized represents the most probable value.\n\nProvisions are recognized to the extent that there is a current commitment to third parties. In addition, they must be the result of a past event, lead to a future cash outflow, and more likely than not be needed to settle the obligation (IAS 37).\n\nRefund claims toward third parties are capitalized separately from the provisions as \"other receivables\", provided that their realization is virtually certain.\n\nNon-current provisions with remaining terms of more than one year are discounted at a capital market interest rate with a matching maturity, taking future cost increases into account, provided that the interest effect is material. This applies, among other things, to the provisions for wake turbulence, which are discounted over a period until 2031 and according to the expected cash outflow date of matching interest rates up to 3.15% (previous year: 2.99%).\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe provision for partial retirement is recognized pursuant to IAS 19. The recognition of the liability from step-ups starts at the time when Fraport can legally and factually no longer withdraw from the liability. The step-up amounts are added to the liability in installments until the end of the active phase on a pro rata basis. The utilization begins with the passive phase.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nContingent liabilities are possible liabilities that are based on past events, and the existence of which is only confirmed by the occurrence of one or more indeterminate future events that are nonetheless beyond Fraport's control. Furthermore, current obligations may constitute contingent liabilities if the probability of the outflow of resources is not sufficient for a liability to be recognized, or if the extent of the liability cannot be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities are not recorded in the financial position, but rather shown in the notes.\n\n#### **Liabilities**\n\nFinancial liabilities, trade accounts payable, and other financial and non-financial liabilities are recorded at their fair value less possible transaction costs upon initial recognition. For current liabilities, this corresponds generally to the nominal value. Noncurrent low-interest or non-interest-bearing liabilities are carried at their present value at the time of addition less possible transaction costs. Liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\n\nSubsequent measurement of financial liabilities is based on the effective interest method at amortized acquisition cost. Each difference between the refund amount and the repayment amount is recorded in the income statement over the term of the contract in question using the effective interest method.\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments, hedging transactions**\n\nThe Fraport Group basically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge existing and future interest and exchange rate risks. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. Positive market values are recognized as other financial assets; negative market values as other financial liabilities. Effective changes of value on cash flow hedges are recorded in shareholders' equity in the reserve for financial instruments without affecting profit or loss. Corresponding to this, deferred taxes on the fair values of cash flow hedges are also recorded in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss. The effectiveness of the cash flow hedges is assessed on a regular basis. Ineffective cash flow hedges are recorded in the income statement through profit or loss under other financial result.\n\nIf the criteria for a cash flow hedge are not no longer met, the hedge accounting is released. In this case, the changes in the fair value and the related deferred taxes are recognized in the income statement (FVTPL). The fair value changes are recorded under \"financial result on other items\".\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at the trading date.\n\n#### **Treasury shares**\n\nRepurchased treasury shares are deducted from the issued capital and the capital reserve.\n\n#### **Virtual stock options**\n\nVirtual stock options (\"Long-Term Incentive Program\") have been issued since January 1, 2010 as part of the remuneration for the Executive Board and Senior Managers. As of January 1, 2020, virtual performance shares (\"Performance Share Plan\") have been allocated to the Executive Board and senior employees. They are paid out in cash immediately at the end of the performance period of four years. The measurement of virtual shares respectively performance shares is at fair value pursuant to IFRS 2. Up to the end of the performance period, the fair value is re-determined on each reporting date and on the date of performance and is recorded in personnel expenses on a pro rata basis.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n*166*\n\nTo Our Shareholders\n\nbined Management Report\n\nTo Our Shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financials Statements *Group Notes* Further Information [Fraport Annual Report 2](#page-5-0)023 [Group Notes / Note](#page-136-0)s t[o the Consolidation a](#page-144-0)n[d Accounting Policies](#page-236-0) 153\n\nents **Group No**\n\nFurther Information\n\n### **Judgment and uncertainty of estimates**\n\nThe presentation of the asset, financial, and earnings position in the consolidated financial statements depends on accounting and valuation methods as well as assumptions and estimates. The assumptions and estimates made by the management in drawing up the consolidated financial statements are based on the circumstances and assessments on the balance sheet date. Although the management assumes that the assumptions and estimates applied are reasonable, there may be unforeseen changes in these assumptions that could affect the Group's asset, financial, and earnings position.\n\n#### **Revenue, result and cash flow development and forecasts**\n\nThe air traffic and passenger numbers at the Group airports are substantial drivers of the revenue, result, and cash flow development in the Fraport Group. The assumptions about the short, medium and long-term development of this driver, and the global development of flight traffic and passenger numbers are incorporated via corporate and Group planning, in particular into the judgment of the impairment of assets according to IAS 36, especially in the context of cash flow forecasts, determining the useful life of property, plant, and equipment by influencing the economic and technical usability of airport infrastructure, and implicitly in the assessment of default risks for receivables from contracts with customers.\n\nThe assumptions made regarding the development of the air traffic and passenger numbers are based on forecasts from various external experts and sources, which are updated regularly, and among other things, form the basis for the medium and long-term Group planning. These forecasts depict risks for the development of the flight traffic and passenger numbers such as climate and environmental risks, political risks, and economic developmental risks in the traffic and passenger volume forecast, which are thus taken into account in the measurement of assets. Airport charges represent a significant portion of revenue and are directly dependent on air traffic. Due to the impact of air traffic on the environment, the development of future air traffic and passenger volumes is strongly dependent on decisions regarding climate policy. These risks are presented and assessed in the Risk and Opportunities Report. The forecast effects of climate policy are reflected in corporate and Group planning. Further details in this regard can be found in note 4 in the section \"Impairment losses pursuant to IAS 36\".\n\nBalance sheet items for which assumptions and estimates have a significant effect on the reported carrying amount are shown below.\n\n#### **Property, plant, and equipment**\n\nExperience, planning, and estimates play a crucial role in determining the useful life of property, plant, and equipment. Carrying amounts and useful lifespans are checked on each reporting date and adjusted as required.\n\n#### **Other financial assets**\n\nThe valuation of loans included in the other financial assets is based in part on cash flow forecasts.\n\n#### **Trade accounts receivable**\n\nThe determination of the expected payment defaults over the overall term of the receivables depends, among other things, on the assessment of qualitative insights into possible future defaults.\n\n#### **Taxes on income**\n\nFraport is subject to taxation in various countries. In assessing global income tax receivables and liabilities, estimates sometimes need to be made. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the tax authorities will come to a different tax assessment. The associated uncertainty is accounted for by recognizing uncertain tax receivables and liabilities when they are considered by Fraport to have a probability of occurrence of more than 50%. A change to the assessment, for example, as a result of final tax assessments, will have an effect on current and deferred tax items. For uncertain income tax items that have been recognized, the expected tax payment is used as a basis for the best estimate.\n\n#### **Deferred tax assets**\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if it is probable that future tax benefits can be realized. The actual tax earnings situation in future fiscal years, and therefore the actual usability of deferred tax assets, could differ from the forecasts at the time the deferred tax assets are recognized.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n### **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**\n\nMaterial valuation parameters for the valuation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations are the discount factor as well as trend factors (see also note 38).\n\n#### **Other provisions**\n\nThe valuation of the other provisions is subject to uncertainty with regard to estimations of amount and the time of occurrence of future cash outflows. As a result, changes in the assumptions on which the valuation is based could have a material impact on the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group. In connection with legal disputes, Fraport draws on information and estimates provided by the Legal Affairs department and any mandated external lawyers when assessing a possible obligation to recognize provisions and when valuing potential outflows of resources. The existing provisions for passive noise abatement as at December 31, 2023 and wake turbulences are substantially dependent with regard to their amounts on the utilization of the underlying programs by the eligible beneficiaries. The existing provisions for compensation in accordance with nature protection laws as at December 31, 2023 are dependent with regard to their amount on the extent and time of implementation of the environmental compensation measures. For further information on significant provisions, please refer to Note 40.\n\n### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nThe contingent liabilities are subject to uncertainty with respect to estimations of their amounts and, in particular, the timing of cash outflows. The time of the expected cash outflow is specified if it can be determined sufficiently reliably.\n\n#### **Company acquisitions**\n\nWhen an acquired company is consolidated for the first time, all identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities must be recognized at their fair value at the time of acquisition. One of the main estimates relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities at the time of acquisition. The measurement is usually based on independent expert reports. Marketable assets are recognized at market or stock exchange prices. If intangible assets are identified, the fair value is usually measured by an independent external expert using appropriate measurement methods which are primarily based on future expected cash flows. These measurements are considerably influenced by assumptions about the developments of future cash flows as well as the applied discount rates. The actual cash flows may differ significantly from the cash flows used as a basis for determining the fair values.\n\n#### **Impairment losses**\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill and other assets within the scope of IAS 36 is based on assumptions about future developments. Fraport AG carries out these tests annually as well as when there are reasons to believe that goodwill has been impaired. In the case of cash-generating units, the recoverable amount is determined. This corresponds to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The measurement of the value in use includes estimates regarding the forecasting and discounting of future cash flows. The underlying assumptions could change on account of unforeseeable events and may therefore impact the asset, financial, and earnings position.\n\nSpecific estimates or assumptions for individual accounting and valuation methods are explained in the relevant section. These are based on the circumstances and estimates on the balance sheet date, and in this respect also affect the amount of the reported income and expense amounts of the fiscal years shown.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **New standards, interpretations, and changes**\n\nOf the new standards, interpretations and changes, Fraport generally applies those for which application was mandatory; i.e. those applicable to fiscal years beginning on or before January 1, 2023.\n\nOn May 18, 2017, the IASB adopted the new standard IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\", including the amendments of June 25, 2020. Further amendments (\"First-time Adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information\") were adopted by the IASB on December 9, 2021. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 \"Insurance Contracts\" and sets out new approaches for the presentation, recognition and measurement of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 and its amendments were adopted under EU law on November 19, 2021 and September 8, 2022 respectively and must be applied to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2023. An earlier application of the amendments is permitted. No such insurance contracts are held by the Fraport Group. There have consequently been no effects on the representation of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" and IAS 8 \"Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Accounting Errors\". The objective of the amendments to IAS 1 is to improve the quality of financial reporting by only requiring disclosures on material and non-significant accounting policies. Accounting policies are material if they are necessary to understand other material information in the financial statements. This is likely to apply to accounting policies that relate to significant transactions and other material events in the entity. The amendments to IAS 8 relate to the definition of accounting estimates. They include clarifications to better distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. Both amendments were adopted under EU law on March 3, 2022 and must be applied to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2023. Earlier application of the amendments was permitted. The amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 did not have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn May 7, 2021, the IASB published amendments to IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\". The current prohibition on recognizing deferred taxes upon initial recognition of an asset or liability is no longer to apply to transactions in which both deductible and taxable temporary differences arise in the same amount. The exception applies to narrowly defined cases, for example leases and disposal or restoration obligations. Where deductible and taxable temporary differences arise in equal amounts, both deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities must be recognized. The amendments were adopted under EU law on August 12, 2022 and must be applied to reporting periods from January 1, 2023. Earlier application was permitted. The application of the amendments to IAS 12 did not have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the IASB published amendments to \"IAS 12: International Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules\". The amendments include a temporary, mandatory exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes resulting from the introduction of a global minimum tax as well as specific disclosures in the notes for entities that are affected. In periods in which legislation to implement the global minimum tax has been passed but has not yet come into force, disclosures must be made regarding the effects of the Pillar Two regulations or an estimate of the resultant income taxes for the company. The amendments were endorsed in EU law on November 8, 2023 and are mandatorily effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. With regard to the amendments to IAS 12 and the future effects of the introduction of a global minimum tax on the presentation of the asset, financial and earnings position of the Fraport Group, see the section \"Global minimum taxation\" below.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Standards which have not been applied prematurely**\n\nFor the following new or amended standards and interpretations, which the Fraport Group is not obliged to adopt until future fiscal years, the Fraport Group is currently working on implementing the requirements for initial application. Early application is not planned. At this point in time, Fraport expects the effects on the consolidated financial statements described below.\n\n#### **Standards, interpretations, and amendments published and adopted into European law by the European Commission**\n\nOn September 22, 2022, the IASB approved amendments to IFRS 16 \"Leases\". The amendments relate to the accounting of leasing liabilities from sale and leaseback transactions. The amendment to IFRS 16 requires leasing liabilities to be measured in such a way that subsequent measurement does not result in a profit or loss in relation to the retained right-of-use asset. The amendments were adopted under EU law on November 21, 2023 and must be applied from January 1, 2024. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments to IFRS 16 are not expected to have a material impact on the future reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group.\n\nOn January 23, 2020, the IASB published changes to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current. Liabilities must be reported as non-current if, at the end of the reporting period, the company has a substantial right to defer the settlement of the debt by at least twelve months after the balance sheet date. On July 15, 2020, the IASB postponed the initial application of the amendments to IAS 1 to January 1, 2022. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the IASB published changes to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\". The amendments relate to the classification of liabilities (as current or non-current) for which certain credit conditions (covenants) have been agreed. The amendments state that only those covenants that a company must comply with on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. Furthermore, the amendments provide for additional disclosure requirements for non-current liabilities with ancillary conditions. Among other things, the following disclosures must be made: Carrying amount of the liability, type of covenant, and period for which the ancillary conditions apply. The amendments to IAS 1 are to be applied for the first time to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2024. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 of January 23 and July 15, 2020 as well as October 31, 2022 were adopted into EU law on December 19, 2023 and must now be applied uniformly from no later than January 1, 2024.\n\n#### **Standards, interpretations, and amendments that have been published, but not yet adopted into European law by the European Commission**\n\nOn May 25, 2023, the IASB published amendments to IAS 7 \"Statement of Cash Flows\" and IFRS 7 \"Financial Instruments: Disclosures\" with respect to additional disclosures on financing agreements with suppliers (reverse factoring transactions). The new requirements make it mandatory to disclose the following information in the future: terms, conditions and subject matter of the supplier financing agreements, the carrying amounts and balance sheet items of the resulting liabilities at the beginning and end of the period, the range of payment terms and further information on the liquidity risk of the supplier financing agreements. The amendments are mandatorily applicable for fiscal years from January 1, 2024. An earlier application is permitted, but this requires EU endorsement. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the IASB published changes to IAS 21 \"Impacts of exchange rate differences\". The amendment concerns the determination of the exchange rate when a currency cannot be exchanged in the long term. The amended standard supplements IAS 21 with the requirements for assessing whether a currency can be exchanged for another currency, the procedure for determining an exchange rate and additional explanations on non-convertible currencies. The amendments to IAS 21 are to be applied for the first time to fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2025. An earlier application is permitted, but this requires EU endorsement. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the reporting of the asset, financial, and earnings position of the Fraport Group in future.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Global minimum taxation**\n\nThe Fraport group falls into the area of application of the OECD Model Rules (global minimum taxation). The legislation on global minimum taxation was promulgated in Germany, the country in which the ultimate parent company of the Fraport Group is domiciled and will enter into effect for fiscal years starting after December 30, 2023. According to the legislation, the Fraport Group is obligated to pay a supplementary tax for each country in which it maintains business units as defined in the legislation. The supplementary tax is calculated by determining the effective tax rate and, if the determined effective tax rate is lower than the minimum tax rate of 15%, the Fraport Group must pay the difference between the effective tax rate and the minimum tax rate.\n\nSince the legislation had not entered into force in any jurisdiction in which Fraport maintains business units as defined in the legislation at the time of reporting, there is no tax burden in this regard for the reporting period.\n\nThe Group has applied the temporary exemption from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12 published by the IASB in May 2023. Accordingly, no deferred taxes are recognized in relation to the rules on global minimum taxation and no related information is disclosed.\n\nThe Fraport Group is currently working on forecasting an estimate with regard to the impact of the global minimum tax on fiscal year 2024 (first year of application of the legislation).\n\nWith regard to its activities in Bulgaria, a country in which the statutory tax rate is 10%, the Group does not expect significant additional taxes to be incurred, partly due to the preliminary evaluations of the substance-based exemption regulations. Also with regard to its other activities, the Group anticipates that the first-time application of the regulations on global minimum taxation will not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate of the Group.\n\nDue to the complexity involved in the application of the legislation and the resulting comprehensive additional data requirements, it cannot be ruled out that the actual, effects could deviate significantly from the current estimates.\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# <span id=\"page-170-0\"></span>*Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement*\n\n# **5 Revenue**\n\n**Revenue**\n\n| € million                                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                                      |         |         |\n| Aviation                                                             |         |         |\n| Airport charges                                                      | 814.4   | 618.4   |\n| Security services                                                    | 239.2   | 173.3   |\n| Other revenue                                                        | 45.2    | 36.0    |\n|                                                                      | 1,098.8 | 828.2   |\n| Retail & Real Estate                                                 |         |         |\n| Real Estate                                                          | 189.2   | 185.9   |\n| Retail                                                               | 186.7   | 153.0   |\n| Parking                                                              | 101.6   | 78.9    |\n| Other revenue                                                        | 21.3    | 28.0    |\n|                                                                      | 498.8   | 446.4   |\n| Ground Handling                                                      |         |         |\n| Ground services                                                      | 342.8   | 291.2   |\n| Infrastructure charges                                               | 313.9   | 237.5   |\n| Other revenue                                                        | 20.1    | 21.4    |\n|                                                                      | 676.8   | 550.0   |\n| International Activities & Services                                  |         |         |\n| Aviation                                                             | 686.4   | 594.6   |\n| Non-Aviation                                                         | 524.3   | 444.3   |\n| Contract revenue from construction and expansion services (IFRIC 12) | 515.4   | 331.3   |\n|                                                                      | 1,726.1 | 1,369.8 |\n| Total                                                                | 4,000.5 | 3,194.4 |\n\nDue to the take-over of the management of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, revenue from aviation security charges of €220.8 million was achieved for the first time. In contrast, revenue from security services decreased by €155.3 million compared to the previous year as a result of the deconsolidation of the Group company FraSec Aviation Security GmbH as at January 1, 2023. Both effects impacted revenue from security services. For a detailed explanation of the revenue, see the combined management report, chapter \"Group Results of Operations\".\n\nThe Retail & Real Estate segment includes income from operating leases from renting terminal areas, offices, buildings, and properties. No purchase options have been agreed upon. When renting retail space, either minimum rents or variable, revenuerelated rents apply, depending on the occurrence of contractually defined conditions. Predominantly variable rents are agreed for these areas. Overall, during the fiscal year, revenue-related rent of €154.5 million (previous year: €127.8 million) was realized. The underlying lease contracts in the Retail section for fiscal year 2023 contain contractually agreed minimum lease payments of €40.1 million (previous year: €16.6 million).\n\nProperties were predominantly rented in the form of assigned hereditary building rights. On the reporting date, the remaining term of hereditary building rights contracts is 37 years on average (previous year: 42 years).\n\nThe acquisition and production costs of the leased buildings and land amount to €535.4 million (previous year: €523.9 million). Cumulative depreciation and amortization came to €396.8 million (previous year: €380.2 million), of which depreciation and amortization amounted to €6.0 million for the fiscal year (previous year: €4.3 million).\n\nRevenue in the International Activities & Services segment is allocated to the Aviation and Non-Aviation sections as well as contract revenue from construction and expansion services related to airport operating projects. The Aviation revenue includes revenue, in particular, from airport charges as well as security services (€686.4 million; previous year: €594.6 million). Revenue in the Non-Aviation section was €348.3 million (previous year: €288.1 million), resulting from retail and real estate activities as well as parking. In addition, €95.9 million (previous year: €84.5 million) was attributable to infrastructure charges and ground handling services. Contract revenue from construction and expansion services related to airport operating projects in the amount \n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nof €515.4 million (previous year: €331.1 million) was attributed to Lima (€465.7 million; previous year: €312.1 million), Greece (€36.9 million; previous year: €10.3 million) as well as Fortaleza and Porto Alegre (€12.8 million; previous year: €8.7 million).\n\nRevenue in the amount of €4,000.5 million (previous year: €3,194.4 million) resulted from €2,771.1 million (previous year: €2,236.2 million) from contracts with customers in accordance with IFRS 15. Other revenue relates to particular contract revenue from construction and expansion projects in accordance with IFRIC 12 as well as proceeds from rentals and other leases.\n\nThe total amount of future income from minimum lease payments arising from non-cancelable leases is as follows:\n\n**Minimum lease payments**\n\n| € million              |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      | Remaining term                         | Total   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|\n|                        | Due in the<br>1st subsequent         | Due in the<br>2nd subsequent         | Due in the<br>3rd subsequent         | Due in the<br>4th subsequent         | Due in the<br>5th subsequent         | Due from the<br>6th subsequent         |         |\n|                        | year                                 | year                                 | year                                 | year                                 | year                                 | year                                   | 2023    |\n| Minimum lease payments | 155.4                                | 108.3                                | 96.4                                 | 92.8                                 | 88.6                                 | 1,511.3                                | 2,052.8 |\n| € million              | Remaining term                       |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                        | Total   |\n|                        | Due in the<br>1st subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>2nd subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>3rd subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>4th subsequent<br>year | Due in the<br>5th subsequent<br>year | Due from the<br>6th subsequent<br>year | 2022    |\n| Minimum lease payments | 162.0                                | 93.2                                 | 86.7                                 | 81.7                                 | 79.7                                 | 1,505.2                                | 2,008.5 |\n\nThe future income from minimum lease payments includes the contractual unconditional minimum rental for the retail areas as well.\n\n# **6 Other Internal Work Capitalized**\n\n| Other internal work capitalized              | 2023 | 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| € million<br>Other internal work capitalized | 50.5 | 39.9 |\n\nThe other internal work capitalized primarily relates to engineering, planning, and construction services and services of commercial project managers, as well as other performance work.

The effective taxes result from the taxable results of the fiscal year and any revisions to previous assessment periods, to which the local tax rates of the respective Group company are applied.\n\nDeferred taxes are generally measured using the applicable tax rate of the respective country. For domestic companies, a combined income tax rate of around 32%, which includes trade tax, is applied.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and IFRS financial statements, for utilizable carryforwards of unused tax losses, as well as for carry-forwards of tax-deductible interest.\n\nThe assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on the probability that the tax loss carryforwards and interest carryforwards will be utilized. This depends on the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which the tax loss carryforwards/interest carryforwards can be utilized.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, based on current information, the Fraport Group in Germany had non-utilizable trade tax losses carried forward of €5.4 million and corporation tax losses carried forward of €0.3 million attributable to taxes (previous year: €5.4 million related to trade taxes and €0.3 million to corporation taxes). The loss carryforwards that are not expected to be utilized result from Fraport Immobilienservice und -entwicklungs GmbH & Co. KG and FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH and can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThe Fraport Group has utilizable loss carryforwards in Germany of €443.6 million (corporation taxes; previous year: €618.4 million) and €565.9 million (trade taxes; previous year: €715.3 million) as well as utilizable losses carried forward aboard of €139.7 million (previous year: €97.1 million).\n\nFor temporary differences in connection with shares in subsidiaries amounting to €760.0 million (previous year: €726.6 million), no deferred tax liabilities were recognized, as Fraport can control the timing of the reversal and it is not expected that these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. These potential tax liabilities are, however, limited to 1.59% of the difference as well as local withholding taxes in the case of future dividend payments from certain foreign subsidiaries.\n\nIn addition, deferred taxes result from consolidation measures. Pursuant to IAS 12, no deferred tax is recognized in the context of initial consolidation with respect to goodwill capitalized or any impairment losses of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted insofar as these income tax claims and liabilities relate to the same tax authority and to the same taxable entity or a group of different taxable entities that, however, are assessed jointly for income tax purposes.\n\nDeferred taxes resulting from temporary differences between tax financial valuation and assets/liabilities accounted according to IFRS are assigned to the following financial position items:\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management\n\nTo Our Shareholders Combined Management Report Consolidated Financials Statements *Group Notes* Further Information\n\n#### **Allocation of deferred taxes**\n\n| € million                                    | 2023                   |                             | 2022                   |                             |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                              | Deferred tax<br>assets | Deferred tax<br>liabilities | Deferred tax<br>assets | Deferred tax<br>liabilities |\n| Investments in airport operating projects    | 21.9                   | –121.0                      | 16.5                   | –118.6                      |\n| Other intangible assets                      | 1.5                    | –13.1                       | 2.0                    | –13.1                       |\n| Property, plant, and equipment               | 2.8                    | –284.4                      | 3.0                    | –275.4                      |\n| Financial assets                             | 7.5                    | 0.0                         | 2.3                    | 0.0                         |\n| Accounts receivable and other assets         | 2.2                    | –30.4                       | 4.6                    | –20.0                       |\n| Provisions for pensions                      | 5.3                    | 0.0                         | 4.6                    | 0.0                         |\n| Other provisions                             | 30.9                   | –2.8                        | 34.5                   | –3.0                        |\n| Liabilities                                  | 228.7                  | –0.1                        | 237.9                  | –0.2                        |\n| Securities and financial derivatives         | 9.9                    | –2.1                        | 18.9                   | 0.0                         |\n| Losses and interest carried forward          | 206.6                  | 0.0                         | 236.1                  | 0.0                         |\n| Total separate financial statements          | 517.3                  | –453.9                      | 560.4                  | –430.3                      |\n| Offsetting                                   | –418.5                 | 418.5                       | –406.4                 | 406.4                       |\n| Consolidation measures                       | 3.5                    | –16.8                       | 5.5                    | –17.5                       |\n| Consolidated Statement of Financial Position | 102.3                  | –52.1                       | 159.5                  | –41.3                       |\n\nThe vast majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities result from non-current assets (investments in airport operating projects, other intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment) and non-current liabilities (primarily concession liabilities), as well as utilizable losses and interest carried forward.\n\nOver the fiscal year, equity-decreasing deferred taxes of €11.3 million (previous year: equity-increasing deferred taxes of €18.2 million) from the change in the fair values of financial derivatives and securities were recognized directly in shareholders' equity without affecting profit or loss.

The reported average revenue growth is adjusted for the recovery effect and reflects the average growth for the years 2028 to 2053. Over the entire forecast period, the average revenue growth is 4.5%.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe parameters used within the scope of the impairment tests are based on the current plan approved by the Executive Board. This takes account of internal empirical values and external economic framework data.\n\nThe revenue forecasts used to determine growth assumptions are based, in particular, on expected air traffic trends derived from external market forecasts.\n\nA variation in the discount rate of +0.5 percent points results in a need for impairment of goodwill in the amount of €4.7 million, while an adjustment of the growth forecasts by -0.5 percentage points does not result in a need for impairment.\n\nThe planning period on which the impairment test for Fraport Slovenija is based corresponds to the term of the right derived from a long-term land use contract to operate the airport in Ljubljana.\n\n# **18 Investments in Airport Operating Projects**\n\n| Investments in Airport Operating Projects |                   |                   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                                 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Investments in airport operating projects | 4,146.8           | 3,769.1           |\n\nInvestments in airport operating projects relate to concession rights, which comprise the following items due to the application of IFRIC 12 (see also note 4 and note 49): the initial payment and capitalized minimum concession payments of €1,790.8 million (previous year: €1,845.0 million) as well as capital expenditure of €2,304.7 million (previous year: €1,870.9 million) and prepayments of €51.3 million (previous year: €53.2 million). They relate to terminal operation at the concession airports in Greece at €1,864.9 million (previous year: €1,933.0 million), Lima at €1,522.2 million (previous year: €1,094.9 million), Fortaleza and Porto Alegre at €611.2 million (previous year: €595.9 million), as well as Varna and Burgas at €148.5 million (previous year: €145.3 million).\n\nLoans that were specifically taken out to finance the expansion of the airports in Brazil were accounted for as borrowing costs in the amount of €31.5 million (previous year: €35.8 million), of which €0.8 million (previous year: €7.6 million) were capitalized. Interest rates on loans range from 6.1% and 11.7%. Amounts for loan disbursements that are not yet required for capital expenditure in the expansion of the airports were reinvested. The accrued interest income for these investments amounted to €0.4 million (previous year: €1.2 million).\n\nAs part of the expansion at Lima Airport, loans amounting to €659.0 million were raised as part of specific financing and in this context borrowing costs of €28.6 million (previous year: €10.5 million) were capitalized. The loan will accumulate interest at an interest rate of 7.65%.\n\n# **19 Other Intangible Assets**\n\n**Other intangible assets**\n\n| € million                            | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Other concession and operator rights | 49.3              | 50.9              |\n| Software and other intangible assets | 47.7              | 45.0              |\n| Total                                | 97.0              | 95.9              |\n\nThe other concession and operator rights include in particular the right derived from an existing, long-term land use contract to operate the airport in Ljubljana (€49.2 million, previous year: €50.9 million) with a remaining term of 30 years (previous year: 31 years).\n\nThe other intangible assets as at the reporting date contain internally generated intangible assets with residual carrying amounts of €7.2 million (previous year: €7.7 million). At closing date further €2.9 million (previous year: €2.3 million) were attributable to the development phase.

Of this, €706.9 million (previous year: €593.7 million) is attributable to the construction of Terminal 3 (\"Expansion South\"), as well as further projects in connection with expansion measures to meet capacity at Frankfurt Airport.\n\nBorrowing costs were capitalized in the amount of €34.7 million (previous year: €21.5 million) for general project financing at Fraport AG. These relate to financing where it is not possible to directly attribute the borrowing costs to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. The borrowing cost rate applied averaged around 1.9% (previous year: around 1.5%). In addition, specific project financing has been concluded for measures related to the construction of Terminal 3. In total, borrowing costs of €6.8 million (previous year: €4.3 million) were capitalized in the financial year. The average financing cost rate was around 1.2% (previous year: around 0.6%).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, property, plant, and equipment with a carrying amount totaling €0.2 million (previous year: €0.1 million) carry mortgages.\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment of the Fraport Group comprises land, land rights, and buildings, including those on land leased by Fraport AG and is valued at €3,022.5 million (previous year: €3,060.1 million). As at the balance sheet date of 2023, land with an area of 26.1 million square meters (equivalent to approximately 10.1 sq mi) were owned by Fraport AG. Depending on the location and type of use, the market value of the land included in property, plant, and equipment varies between €1 and €720 per square meter (equivalent to approximately 10.75 sq ft) (land values published by the committees of experts for real estate values of the State of Hesse).\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment includes rights of use from leases for land and buildings. The development of the rights of use can be found in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Non-current Assets.\n\n#### **Right-of-use assets from leases**\n\n| € million                                                                                        | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Carrying amount of right-of-use assets as of December 31                                         | 158.3 | 191.0 |\n| Carrying amount of lease liabilities as of December 31                                           | 174.2 | 208.9 |\n| Additions right-of-use assets/ lease liabilities in fiscal year                                  | 8.6   | 0.2   |\n| Total cash outflow for leases                                                                    | 71.7  | 69.3  |\n| Expenses related to variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities | 26.5  | 21.1  |\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities                                                            | 7.2   | 8.5   |\n| Income from subleasing right-of-use assets                                                       | 96.8  | 85.3  |\n| Leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed                                        | 0.0   | 0.0   |\n\nRight-of-use assets as at the balance sheet date amounted to €121.5 million (previous year: €152.0 million) primarily relating to the companies of Fraport USA (International Activities & Services segment), which operates and develops commercial terminal space at various US airports as part of rental and concession contracts. Only the fixed minimum lease payments guaranteed to the lessor were included in the measurement of the lease liabilities of the companies of Fraport USA. Sales-related (variable) rental payments to be paid in addition are recognized as expenses in the respective period and are reported in the cost of materials for the companies of Fraport USA. The rental and concession agreements currently in force at Fraport USA generally have a term of ten years and some extension options of five years each, but these cannot be exercised unilaterally and therefore cannot be assessed with sufficient certainty. Therefore, only fixed terms without optional periods are taken into account as lease terms.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, Fraport USA was successful in the tender process for the center management at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). Operations were taken over on January 1, 2024. Due to the variable lease payments, the new contract does not result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset or a lease liability. The variable rental payments due are recognized on an accrual basis as cost of materials. With a term until March 31, 2034, this is the longest running contract at Fraport USA.\n\nThe variable leasing payments incurred in the fiscal year are entirely attributable to Fraport USA. Future cash outflows from variable lease payments occur if the lease payments for the fiscal year exceed the contractually defined minimum lease payments (base rents) that were included in the measurement of the lease liabilities. The exceeding part is treated as variable lease payment. The total amount of lease payments to be paid depends on the revenue received from subletting the concession areas.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, future nominal payment obligations arising from existing leases amounting to €224.8 million. A maturity analysis of the lease liabilities is shown in note 47.\n\nIn the Fraport Group, income of €3.2 million from the application of the relief provisions to IFRS 16.46 adopted on May 28, 2020 was realized in the previous year (rental concessions in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic).\n\n# **21 Investment Property**\n\nInvestment property includes land and buildings situated in direct vicinity to Frankfurt Airport, which are classified as follows:\n\n#### **Investment property**\n\n| € million                  | Carrying amount<br>December 31, 2023 | Carrying amount<br>December 31, 2022 | Fair value<br>December 31, 2023 | Fair value<br>December 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Undeveloped land – Level 2 | 3.1                                  | 3.1                                  | 2.6                             | 2.6                             |\n| Undeveloped land – Level 3 | 8.7                                  | 7.4                                  | 16.1                            | 14.8                            |\n| Developed land – Level 3   | 57.7                                 | 58.6                                 | 86.9                            | 82.6                            |\n| Total                      | 69.5                                 | 69.1                                 | 105.6                           | 100.0                           |\n\nThe undeveloped land – Level 2 is undeveloped land in the Kelsterbach district directly next to the Runway Northwest.\n\nThe fair value of the undeveloped land – Level 2 is calculated internally using the comparative value procedure pursuant to the Real Estate Valuation Regulation of December 3, 2019 (ImmoWertV) applicable in Germany based on the standard ground values published by a committee of experts. The fair value of undeveloped land – Level 3 is also determined internally using the comparative value method. However, the prices per square meter used for current land transactions in the same development area are not observable on the market.\n\nThe developed land – Level 3 comprises real estate leased for residential purposes from the voluntary purchase program for real estate in Flörsheim in the flight zone of Runway Northwest, the long-distance train station plot, and the parking garages in Gateway Gardens, as well as commercially leased properties.\n\nThe fair values of the developed land - Level 3 category are determined in part using the income capitalization approach in accordance with the German Real Estate Valuation Ordinance (ImmoWertV) and in part using the discounted cash flow approach by external appraisers. The main input parameters for the income capitalization approach are the multiplier, which depends on the useful life and the property interest rate, and the underlying annual rent. In the discounted cash flow method, a perpetual annuity is assumed. The main input parameters are the discount rate, the sustainable market rent, the assumed remaining useful life, forecast maintenance costs and the expected development of rents.\n\nFor major parts of the investment property, foreseeable restrictions on saleability arise from the fact that these areas are located in the immediate vicinity of Runway Northwest.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\ns Further Information\n\nNet lease revenue from investment property during the 2023 fiscal year amounted to €7.4 million (previous year: €6.1 million). The total costs incurred for the maintenance of investment property amounted to €2.3 million (previous year: €1.0 million), classified as expenses that are not allocatable (excluding depreciation and amortization), and of which €0.1 million was incurred for property for which no lease revenue was earned during the fiscal year.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, no obligations exist for the acquisition of investment property (previous year: €0.1 million).\n\n# **22 Investments in Companies accounted for Using the Equity Method**\n\nCompanies that are Group airports outside of Frankfurt are considered to be substantial joint ventures and associated companies in the Fraport Group. This relates to both companies in connection with the operating concession at Antalya Airport.\n\n### **Shares in joint ventures**\n\nFraport TAV Antalya Terminal Isletmeciligi Anonim Sirketi, Antalya/Turkey (\"Fraport TAV Antalya I\") is a joint venture of Fraport AG and TAV Havalimanlari Holding A.Ş. IC Yatirim Holding A.S. that operates the terminals at Antalya Airport as part of the concession agreement of May 22, 2007 with the Turkish airport authority (DHMI grantor). The concession for the operation of the terminals and thus the right to use all assets listed in the concession agreement runs for a total of 17 years to the end of 2024. In a letter dated February 12, 2021, the Turkish government approved the extension of the concession period for terminal operations at Antalya Airport for an additional two years, to December 31, 2026.\n\nWith regard to the authorized use of infrastructure, the company is obligated to perform maintenance and capacity expansions (as required). Distributed over the term of the concession agreement, concession fees of €2.01 billion net must be paid to DHMI. In exchange, the operator receives the right to use the existing and future terminal infrastructure to operate the airport and the right to generate revenue from passenger charges paid by the airlines and from other services related to terminal operations. Passenger charges are regulated by the grantor.\n\nFraport holds a 51% interest in the company's share capital, though neither party may make a decision unilaterally due to the voting system laid down in the partnership agreement. The division of the variable returns from the company is governed separately in the partnership agreement, according to which both partners are entitled to equal amounts in returns. The company accounts for 50% according to the equity method on the basis of the division of the dividend rights and the joint management and control. Since the company is not listed on a stock exchange, there is no available active market value for the shares.\n\nIn conjunction with the tender won in December 2021 for the new operating concession at Antalya Airport, Fraport AG, together with TAV Airports Holding, founded the company Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş., Antalya, Turkey, (\"Fraport TAV Antalya II\"). The operational period of the company will begin in early 2027, after the existing concession expires. Fraport AG holds 49% of the capital shares. The remaining 51% of the shares in the company are held by TAV Airports Holding. Pursuant to the contractually agreed participation rights, the company is jointly controlled by the shareholders. The concession agreement was also concluded in December 2021 between Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş and the Turkish government. The agreement runs until 2051. The concession covers the operation of the terminals and other landside infrastructure, including retail space, parking management, and passenger controls. For the new operating concession, Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş is required to pay fixed concession charges totaling €7.25 billion net over the term to the Turkish State (DHMI), of which 25% was paid after the conclusion of the concession agreement at the end of March 2022. Financing of around € 1.9 billion has been raised to date for the advance payment and the expansion investments of around € 765.3 million. The interim financing has a term until March 2024. The discussions on the conclusion of follow-up financing and on increasing the financing volume are already at an advance stage.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n####

Service Gesellschaft mbH, the newly founded FraScout GmbH (see note 2) and operational services GmbH & Co.KG.\n\nThe cumulated total amount of the non-recognized pro rata losses of the associated companies amounted to €6.4 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €4.7 million) and the corresponding losses of the reporting period amounted to €1.7 million (previous year: €1.6 million).\n\nThalita Trading Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Northern Capital Gateway LLC (NCG) were founded as companies by Fraport AG, the Russian bank VTB, and the Greek Copelouzos Group. NCG develops and operates Pulkovo Airport (St. Petersburg, Russia) as part of a 30-year concession agreement with the city of St. Petersburg. The company is responsible for the entire airport infrastructure. Since a change in the shareholder structure in 2017, Fraport AG holds 25.0% of the shares in Thalita Trading Ltd.\n\nBased on a decree by the President of the Russian Federation of November 30, 2023 as well as a regulation by the Russian government of December 1, 2023, the Russian company \"Holding VVSS Limited Liability Company\" (in English: NCG Holding Limited Liability Company), St. Petersburg was found with its entry in the Russian commercial register on December 18, 2023. The company's share capital amounts to €1,691 million. In accordance with the decree and the regulation, all the shares in the operating company of the Pulkovo Airport, Northern Capital Gateway LLC (\"NCG\"), are deemed as held by VVSS. From a Russian perspective, Thalita is therefore no longer shareholder of NCG. Until that time, Thalita held 100% of the shares in NCG. The management and group of shareholders remain unaffected by the decree. The shareholders of VVSS are the former shareholders of Thalita by entry in the Russian commercial register. Accordingly, Fraport holds 25% of the shares in VVSS. The voting rights associated with the capital shares have been temporarily transferred to two trustees. However, no end date has been stipulated. In accordance with the regulation, the respective share in VVSS is deemed as acquired by the shareholders from the date of entry of VVSS in the Russian commercial register and the shareholders' initial contribution is deemed as paid to VVSS in the nominal amount of their respective share.\n\nThe shares in VVSS were not recognized as an asset in the Fraport consolidated statement of financial position as Fraport has no control over the shareholder rights associated with the capital shares. Since Fraport became a shareholder of the company under Russian law, the shares held by Fraport AG (note 57) are recognized under other investments.\n\nSignificant resolutions and decisions on Thalita Ltd. can only continue to be made on the basis of the company statutes, which continue to be valid, and shareholder rights. As a result, the company continues to be recognized as an associated company in the consolidated financial statements. Due to cumulative losses in the past, the carrying amount of the investment is \"zero\".\n\nIn connection with the financing of the Pulkovo operating project, there is a loan receivable recognized as a loan (see note 23) and an interest receivable (see note 24) of the Fraport Group from Thalita Trading Ltd. As at June 30, 2022, the receivables were fully written off in the amount of €163.3 million as cash flows (interest payments and loan repayments) are no longer expected due to the sanctions situation. This assessment remains valid due to the unchanged sanctions situation and the development described above at the end of 2023.\n\nThere are no significant restrictions pursuant to IFRS 12.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **23 Other Financial Assets**\n\n#### **Other financial assets**\n\n| € million                     |  | Remaining term |             | Total             | Remaining term |             | Total             |\n|-------------------------------|--|----------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n|                               |  | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2023 | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2022 |\n| Financial instruments         |  |                |             |                   |                |             |                   |\n| Securities                    |  | 748.0          | 559.7       | 1,307.7           | 265.2          | 791.5       | 1,056.7           |\n| Other investments             |  | 0.0            | 117.9       | 117.9             | 0.0            | 130.4       | 130.4             |\n| Loans                         |  |                |             |                   |                |             |                   |\n| Loans to joint ventures       |  | 6.2            | 40.5        | 46.7              | 4.5            | 23.2        | 27.7              |\n| Loans to associated companies |  | 0.0            | 0.1         | 0.1               | 0.0            | 0.0         | 0.0               |\n| Other loans                   |  | 95.0           | 230.3       | 325.3             | 0.0            | 228.4       | 228.4             |\n| Insolvency-secured funds      |  | 0.0            | 4.6         | 4.6               | 0.0            | 0.0         | 0.0               |\n| Total                         |  | 849.2          | 953.1       | 1,802.3           | 269.7          | 1,173.4     | 1,443.1           |\n\nIn the year under review, investments in securities amounted to €717.5 million (previous year: €619.9 million), which partly were already disposed during the year. Other changes resulted from reclassifications to current other financial assets due to securities of €364.1 million maturing in 2024 (previous year: €155.8 million) and changes arising from valuation of +€31.8 million (previous year: –€64.7 million).\n\nThe fund units protected against insolvency are exclusively meant to hedge credits from the time-account models and partial retirement claims in particular of Fraport AG employees.

As at the reporting date, acquisition costs amounted to €74.3 million (previous year: €68.6 million). These securities are measured at fair value and credited against the corresponding obligations of €69.0 million (previous year: €66.3 million) (see also note 40). At year-end, there was an overfunding from fund units of €4.6 million (previous year: underfunding of €1.4 million).\n\nThe change in other investments relates to shares in Delhi International Airport Private Ltd, New Delhi, India, for which a fair value was determined in the reporting year.\n\nThe loans to joint ventures primarily relate to a loan granted to Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş in the 2022 fiscal year.

The shares were issued at a price of €44.39.\n\n#### **Authorized capital**\n\nAt the AGM on May 23, 2017 the existing authorized capital was canceled and new authorized capital of €3.5 million was approved, which can be used for issuing shares to employees of Fraport AG and companies controlled by Fraport AG. The Executive Board was entitled, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock on one or more occasions by up to a total of €3.5 million until May 22, 2022 by issuing new shares in return for cash. The Executive Board did not make use of this authorization, meaning there was no longer any authorized capital after the authorization expired on December 31, 2022.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on June 1, 2021, new authorized capital (\"Authorized Capital II\") of €458.8 million was approved. The Executive Board is entitled, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the capital stock on one or more occasions by up to a total of €458.8 million until May 31, 2026 by issuing up to 45,884,352 new no-par value bearer shares in return for cash. In principle, the shareholders are to be granted a subscription right. The new shares may also be underwritten by financial institutions with the obligation to offer them to company shareholders for subscription. The new shares will participate in the net income from the beginning of the fiscal year of their issue. To the extent legally permissible, the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and in deviation from Section 60 (2) AktG, can determine that the new shares will participate in net income from the beginning of a fiscal year that has already expired and for which no resolution has yet been passed by the Annual General Meeting on the appropriation of the profit earmarked for distribution at the time of their issue. The Executive Board is further authorized, also with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders one or more occasions, insofar as this is necessary to compensate for residual amounts.\n\n#### **Contingent capital**\n\nOn June 1, 2021, the Annual General Meeting also resolved to conditionally increase the share capital by up to €120.2 million by issuing up to 12,020,931 new no-par value bearer shares (\"contingent capital\"). The contingent capital serves exclusively to grant shares to the holders or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants or a combination of all these instruments, which, are issued by the company in accordance with the authorization up to May 31, 2026 resolved by the Annual General Meeting on June 1, 2021 and grant a conversion or option right to new no-par value bearer shares in the company or determine a conversion or option obligation or a right to tender and insofar as the issue takes place in return for cash. The new shares are issued at the conversion or option price to be determined according to the previously mentioned authorization resolution. The contingent capital increase is only to be carried out to the extent that conversion or option rights are exercised, or the conversion/option obligation is satisfied, or shares are tendered, and no other forms of fulfillment are used. The new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created by exercising conversion or option rights or through the fulfillment of corresponding obligations (fiscal year of origin); in deviation from this, the new shares will participate in the profits from the beginning of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created if the Annual General Meeting has not yet passed a resolution on the utilization of the profit earmarked for distribution from the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which they were created. The Executive Board is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the implementation of conditional capital increases.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe Executive Board has not made use of the authorization for a contingent capital increase. As in the previous year, the contingent capital amounted to € 120.2 million as at December 31, 2023.\n\n#### **Capital reserve**\n\nThe capital reserve contains the premium from the issue of Fraport AG shares.\n\n#### **Revenue reserves**\n\nThe revenue reserves consist not only of the reserves of Fraport AG (including the statutory reserve of €36.5 million), but also the revenue reserves and retained earnings of the Group companies included in the consolidated financial statements, as well as effects of consolidation adjustments. Furthermore, the revenue reserves include reserves for currency translation differences and financial instruments.\n\nThe derivative valuation reserve is €6.3 million as at the balance sheet date (previous year: –€8.0 million). The reserve for the equity and debt instruments measured at fair value totals €56.8 million (previous year: €48.4 million).\n\nPursuant to Section 253 (6) sentence 1 of the HGB and in accordance with Section 268 (8) of the HGB, a total of €299.3 million of the shareholders' equity attributable to Fraport AG's shareholders (previous year: €344.9 million) is subject to a distribution block. However, the distribution block did not take effect insofar as sufficient free reserves were available.\n\nFor the past financial year, it is proposed that the net profits be transferred to other revenue reserves.\n\n# **32 Non-controlling Interests**\n\n| Non-controlling interests                                           |                   |                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                                                           | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Non-controlling interests (excluding the attributable Group result) | 236.3             | 188.3             |\n| Group result attributable to non-controlling interests              | 37.3              | 34.2              |\n| Total                                                               | 273.6             | 222.5             |\n\nNon-controlling interests related to allocated shareholders' equity and earnings of Fraport Twin Star Airport Management AD, FraCareServices GmbH, Media Frankfurt GmbH, Lima Airport Partners S.R.L., and the Fraport Group companies Fraport Greece A, Fraport Greece B and Fraport Regional Airports of Greece Management Company.\n\n# **33 Non-current and Current Financial Liabilities**\n\n#### **Non-current and current financial liabilities**\n\n| € million             | Remaining term |             | Total             | Remaining term |             | Total             |\n|-----------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n|                       | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2023 | up to 1 year   | over 1 year | December 31, 2022 |\n| Financial liabilities | 1,521.4        | 10,232.5    | 11,753.9          | 1,209.6        | 9,716.0     | 10,925.6          |\n\nIn the course of the year, promissory note loans in the amount of €1,167.7 million (previous year: €539.4 million) were issued.

A reinsurance was already obtained in 2005 to reduce actuarial risks and protect pension obligations for the former and current (in some cases still active) members of the Executive Board against insolvency. This is a group insurance policy with an annual, constant minimum insurance amount for the entire group. The pension benefits from the reinsurance correspond to the total achievable retirement, occupational disability, and widow's/widower's benefits in accordance with the pension commitments. Reinsurance benefits are recognized at the active value reported by the insurance company to the value of €23.5 million (previous year: €24.0 million), of which €1.1 million (previous year: €1.0 million) is attributable to reserved trust assets. The reinsurance is not traded on an active market. Plan assets are invested in shares, real estate, fixed-interest securities, and other assets. In addition, €0.0 million (previous year: €0.04 million) were paid in the reinsurance in fiscal year 2023 through deferred compensation. The average weighted term of the members of the Executive Board's defined benefit plans is 10.5 years (previous year: 12.2 years) for pensions with reinsurance and 9.2 years (previous year: 6.9 years) for pensions without reinsurance.\n\nThe Executive Board members are entitled to pension benefits and provision for surviving dependents. An Executive Board member is generally entitled to a retirement pension if he or she becomes permanently unable to work or retires from office during the term of, or upon expiry of, his or her employment agreement. If an Executive Board member dies, benefits are paid to his or her surviving dependents. These amount to 60% of the retirement pension for the widower or widow; children entitled to receive benefits receive 12% each. If no widow's pension is paid, the children each receive 20% of the retirement pension.\n\nUpon retirement, income from active employment as well as retirement pension payments from previous or, where applicable, later employment relationships shall be credited against accrued retirement pay up until reaching 60 years of age, insofar as without such credit the total of these emoluments and the retirement pension would exceed 75% of the fixed salary (100% of the fixed salary if Fraport AG wishes the employment to be terminated or not be extended). Effective January 1 of each year, the retirement pensions are adjusted at discretion, taking into account the interests of the former Executive Board member and the company's economic situation. The adjustment obligation is considered to be satisfied if the adjustment does not fall below the increase in the consumer price index for the cost of living for private households in Germany.\n\nThe retirement pension of an Executive Board member is defined by the percentage of a contractually agreed basis of assessment, with the percentage rising annually by 2% up to a limit of 75%, dependent on the duration of time an Executive Board member is appointed.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, Dr. Schulte is entitled to a retirement pension of 75% and thus the maximum and Prof. Dr. Zieschang a claim of 62% of the respective contractually agreed basis of assessment.\n\nIn the event of occupational disability, the pension rate for Dr Schulte and Prof Dr Zieschang amounts to at least 55% of their respective fixed annual gross salaries or of the contractually agreed basis of assessment.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Executive Board members appointed from 2012 onwards, the pension benefits, provision for surviving dependents, and provision for long-term occupational disability are governed by a separate benefit agreement. This calls for the payment of a one-time pension capital or lifelong retirement pension after the insured event. The pension capital is generated when Fraport AG annually credits 40% of the fixed annual gross salary paid to a pension account. The pension capital accumulated at the end of the previous year pays interest annually at the interest rate used for the valuation of the pension obligations in the German balance sheet of Fraport AG at the end of the previous year pursuant to Section 253 (2) of the HGB, which is at least 3% and at most 6%. This is increased by 1% on January 1 of each year for lifelong retirement payments. No further adjustment is made. If the pension capital reached is less than €600 thousand when retirement benefits fall due as a result of long-term occupational disability, Fraport AG will increase it to this amount. In the event of long-term occupational disability within the first five years of their activities performed as members of the Executive Board, it is foreseen that Executive Board members can postpone the receipt of a monthly retirement pension payment by a maximum of five years from the start of the employment contract. Until the postponed start of the pension benefit payments, they will receive a monthly benefit of €2.5 thousand. The risk of pension payments in the increase phase and of payments for the increase has been reinsured by an occupational disability insurance policy. The full amount of all income pursuant to the Income Tax Act from employment or self-employment is credited against the retirement pension paid until the end of the month in which the Executive Board member reaches the age of 62.\n\nBenefits for surviving dependents of Executive Board members appointed from 2012 onwards are regulated as follows: If there is no prior event giving rise to retirement benefits, the widow or widower receives the pension capital generated so far. If there is no widow or widower entitled to benefits, each half-orphan receives 10% and each full orphan receives 25% of the pension capital generated so far as a one-time payment. If the pension capital reached is less than €600 thousand upon death, Fraport will increase it to this amount. The payment risk of this increase has been reinsured by a term life insurance policy. If an Executive Board member dies while collecting retirement pensions, the widow or widower is entitled to 60% of the last retirement pensions paid. Half-orphans receive 10% and full orphans receive 25% of the last retirement pensions paid. If there are no surviving dependents as set forth above, the heirs receive a one-time death grant in the amount of €8.0 thousand.\n\nMoreover, each member of the Executive Board has entered into a two-year post-contractual restrictive covenant. For this period, appropriate ex gratia compensation in the amount of 50% of the contractual benefits last received by the member of the Executive Board is granted (within the meaning of Section 74 (2) of the HGB); when calculating compensation, the performance-based remuneration components shall be taken into account according to the average of the last three completed fiscal years. If the current remuneration system has not existed for three fiscal years at the end of the contract, the average performance-based remuneration is determined based on the duration of the contract in accordance with the current remuneration system (within the meaning of Section 74b (2) of the HGB). Payment shall be made in monthly installments. The compensation shall be generally credited against any retirement pension owed by Fraport AG. In the case of Executive Board members appointed before 2012, this applies if the compensation together with the retirement pension and other income generated exceeds 100% of the last fixed annual salary. In the case of Executive Board members appointed since 2012, the full amount of the compensation counts toward the retirement pension up to the end of the month in which the member reaches the age of 62 or 65. Payments on the occasion of premature termination of the membership on the Executive Board are credited to the compensation for the period of.\n\nNo other benefits have been promised to Executive Board members should their employment be terminated.\n\nThe retirement pension payments entitlement of former Executive Board members is determined by a percentage of a contractually agreed fixed basis of assessment.\n\nFor Senior Managers and employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements who joined the company as Senior Managers or employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements after December 31, 1997 or who will join in future, the pension benefits and benefits for surviving dependents on the monthly compensation liable to top-up pension payments, for which contributions are payable, are restricted to the upper limit defined in Section 38 of the ATV-K in the amount of 1.133 times of the payment group 15 level 6 of the collective bargaining agreement for civil servants (TVöD). In addition to said limited pension benefits and benefits for surviving dependents, there exists a supplementary company retirement benefit for these persons. Accordingly, Fraport AG makes an annual contribution in the amount of 13% of the eligible income as capital components into an individually managed pension account. The period of contribution began on January 1, 1998 for employees who entered into an employment not covered by a collective bargaining agreement before January 1, 2000. Furthermore, this applies to employees who changed from an employment covered by a collective bargaining agreement to one not covered by a collective bargaining agreement after December 31, 1997 or who entered into an employment not covered by a collective bargaining agreement after\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nDecember 31, 1997, effective as at the time of the change in status. There were 718 benefits (of which 691 vested) as at the end of the year. The present value of the non-vested benefits amounted to €0.0 million (previous year: €0.0 million); the present value of the vested benefits amounted to €13.2 million in the 2023 annual financial statements (previous year: €12.5 million). Future obligations amount to €8.4 million for active employees and €4.8 million for former and retired employees. No significant provision amounts were paid this fiscal year due to the young age structure. The obligations for Senior Managers and employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements had an average weighted term of 7.2 years (previous year: 8.0 years).\n\nFurthermore, the opportunity to participate in an employee-financed company pension scheme (\"deferred compensation\") exists. The employee contribution is generated through converting a portion that can be chosen freely each year. This portion is converted into an insured sum and is accumulated by Fraport AG and accrues interest. At the end of the fiscal year, there were 24 vested pension commitments totaling €8.2 million (previous year: €7.4 million). Obligations amount to €5.0 million for active employees (previous year: €6.0 million); obligations amount to €3.2 million for former and retired employees (previous year: €1.5 million). The average weighted term of the employee-financed company pension scheme was 6.3 years (previous year: 7.0 years).\n\nGuidelines nos. 2 and 3 as well as company agreement BV 47 were replaced with a new version of company agreement BV 47 and an amalgamated guideline 2 effective January 1, 2017. The new version differs from the previously valid version in that the interest on contributions from January 1, 2017 is no longer accrued at a fixed interest rate of 6% nor is direct interest attributed based on age factors but rather at an annual rate based on the market rate, which is no less than 2% p.a. and no more than 6% p.a. Contributions that have been paid in by December 31, 2016 still accrue interest according to the previous version.\n\nThe valuation of pension obligations is based on the provisions of IAS 19. The pension obligations as at December 31, 2023 were calculated on the basis of actuarial opinions. Changes to the obligations outlined above were as follows:\n\n#### **Pension obligations (2023)**\n\n| € million                                                                            | Present

obligations of the Fraport Group. All pension obligations largely have the same assumptions where the adjustment to pensions is only calculated on pension obligations of the Executive Board members.\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis**\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is based on changes in the assumptions while other factors remained constant. In practice, it is unlikely that only one actuarial assumption would change. Changes in actuarial assumptions may correlate with other actuarial assumptions. The method for determining the sensitivity analysis did not change. The pension provision would vary by the following amounts in the event of a change in assumptions:\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis (December 31, 2023)**\n\n| € million         | 2023                                |                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate     | Decrease in interest rate by 0.5%   | Increase in interest rate by 0.5%   |\n|                   | 2.5                                 | -2.3                                |\n| Pension growth    | Decrease in pension growth by 0.25% | Increase in pension growth by 0.25% |\n|                   | -0.7                                | 0.7                                 |\n| Mortality         | Reduction by one year               |                                     |\n|                   | 0.0                                 |                                     |\n| Retirement age 1) | Increase by one year                |                                     |\n|                   | 1.3                                 |                                     |\n\n1) The obligation would increase by €1.3 million for all beneficiaries as a result of a one-year increase in the retirement age.\n\n#### **Sensitivity analysis (December 31, 2022)**\n\n| € million                    | <b>2022</b>                         |                                     |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                              | Decrease in interest rate by 0.5%   | Increase in interest rate by 0.5%   |\n| Interest rate                | 3.6                                 | -1,7                                |\n|                              | Decrease in pension growth by 0.25% | Increase in pension growth by 0.25% |\n| Pension growth               | 0.0                                 | 1.7                                 |\n|                              | Reduction by one year               |                                     |\n| Mortality                    | 0.8                                 |                                     |\n|                              | Increase by one year                |                                     |\n| Retirement age <sup>1)</sup> | 2.3                                 |                                     |\n\n1) The obligation would increase by €2.3 million for all beneficiaries as a result of a one-year increase in the retirement age.\n\nThe retirement age has no influence on the pensions received by members of the Executive Board and was only calculated for other pensions. Due to the structure of the respective pension plans, the salary adjustment has no effect on pension obligations.\n\nIn connection with the defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to the actuarial risks mentioned above as well as the interest rate risk. Due to the liquidity available in the Group, there is no risk with regard to fulfillment of non- reinsured obligations.\n\n#### **Multi-employer plans**\n\nFraport AG has insured its employees for purposes of granting a company pension under the statutory insurance scheme based on a collective bargaining agreement (Altersvorsorge-TV-Kommunal [ATV-K]) with the Zusatzversorgungskasse for local authority and municipal employers in Wiesbaden (ZVK). The contributions are collected based on a pay-as-you-go model. As in the previous year, the contribution rate of the ZVK is 7.0% on compensation liable to top-up pension payments; thereof, the employer pays 5.3%, with the contribution paid by the employee amounting to 1.7%. In addition, a tax-free restructuring fee of 1.4% of the remuneration liable to top-up pension payments is levied by the employer in accordance with Section 63 of the ZVK Statutes (ZVKS). An additional contribution of 9.0% is paid for some employees included in the statutory social security insurance scheme (generally employees exempted from collective bargaining agreements and Senior Managers) for the consideration subject to ZVK that, according to Section 38 ATV-K, exceeds the upper limit defined in the collective bargaining agreement. The amounts subject to contributions amounted to €393.9 million.\n\nThis plan is a multi-employer plan (IAS 19.8), since the companies involved share the risk of the investment and also the biometric risk. Reference is also made to the collective bargaining agreement risks arising from the ZVK insurance in the Risk and Opportunities Report in the management report.\n\nThe ZVK insurance is generally to be classified as a defined benefit plan (IAS 19.30). Because there is not sufficient information on the plan and the company also covers the risks of other insuring companies with its contributions (IAS 19.34), only the current contributions are accounted for as if it were a defined contribution plan. Due to its structure, the ZVK does not provide any information to participating companies that would allow the allocation of obligations, plan assets, service costs, and, if applicable, over- or underfunding or the extent of Fraport's participation in the plan. In the consolidated financial statements of Fraport, the consideration of contributions corresponds to defined-contribution pension commitments. Along with the remaining member companies, Fraport AG is obliged to finance accrued obligations not covered by assets as well as future obligations. The precise\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Informat\n\nshare of the remaining extent of the obligation cannot be determined. In the event of Fraport AG withdrawing from the multiemployer plan (for example, through terminating the agreement), compensation in the amount of the present value of the obligation at the point of the membership being terminated is to be paid to the ZVK. This amount cannot be determined due to only insufficient information being available. Should the multi-employer plan be dissolved by a resolution of the administrative committee, no share in any possible remaining overfunding will be due to Fraport.\n\nIn the fiscal year, €24.3 million (previous year: €22.0 million) was recorded as contributions to defined contribution plans for ZVK. Contributions in the amount of €32.4 million are expected for the following financial year.\n\nIn addition, contributions are paid to state pension insurance institutions in Germany on the basis of statutory provisions. The current contributions are shown as expense for the respective year. Employer contributions made by the Fraport Group to statutory insurance schemes totaled €69.8 million (previous year: €71.6 million).\n\n# **39 Non-current and Current Income Tax Provisions**\n\n#### **Non-current and current income tax provisions**\n\n| € million                      |              | Remaining term | Total             |              | Remaining term | Total             |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|\n|                                |              |                | December 31, 2023 |              |                | December 31, 2022 |\n|                                | up to 1 year | over 1 year    |                   | up to 1 year | over 1 year    |                   |\n| Provisions for taxes on income | 73.3         | 47.3           | 120.6             | 24.7         | 77.0           | 101.7             |\n\nTax provisions amounting to €120.6 million (previous year: €101.7 million) were accrued for unassessed corporation tax and trade taxes, as well as for tax audit risks.\n\n# **40 Non-current and Current Other Provisions**\n\nThe development in the non-current and current provisions is shown in the following tables.\n\n#### **Non-current and current personnel-related provisions**\n\n| € million           | January 1, 2023 | Use   | Release | Additions | December 31, 2023 |\n|---------------------|-----------------|-------|---------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Personnel           | 116.7           | –58.3 | –5.7    | 66.0      | 118.7             |\n| thereof non-current | 45.4            |       |         |           | 34.7              |\n| thereof current     | 71.3            |       |         |           | 84.0              |\n\nIn addition to the provisions in connection with the \"Zukunft FRA – Relaunch 50\" program, the personnel provisions related in particular to partial retirement arrangements, as well as provisions for variable wage and salary components, such as profit distribution for the employees of Fraport AG.

As at December 31, 2023, estimated cash outflows (present value) amounted to €1.9 million within one year (previous year: €1.9 million), €8.5 million after one to five years (previous year: €9.1 million), and €27.7 million after five years (previous year: €24.2 million).\n\nThe \"passive noise abatement\" provision includes obligations to refund the passive noise abatement expenses of owners of private and commercial land and obligations to pay outdoor living and commercial area compensation. The obligations result from the planning approval notice made by the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Living (HMWEVW) on December 18, 2007 in conjunction with the Act for Protection against Aircraft Noise (Aircraft Noise Act), and the planning approval notice of April 30, 2013. The application deadline for measures from the program was October 13, 2021. Invoices for measures requested by the deadline could still be submitted until October 12, 2022. The provision remaining as at December 31, 2023 in the amount of €0.7 million relates to invoices submitted by the deadline and still being processed. For all obligations reported under \"passive noise abatement\" there is a corresponding reimbursement right at the reporting date, which is reported under other receivables (see also Note 25). The carrying amount of the refund claim depends on the actually collected, and future expected noise abatement charges. The carrying amount of the corresponding provision depends on the actual, and future expected cash outflows for passive noise abatement measures and wake turbulences.\n\nA provision for environmental protection compensating measures was created in previous years due to the long-term obligation to implement ecological compensating measures resulting from the work performed to clear the land in the southern part of the airport and in the area of Runway Northwest required for the airport expansion. As at December 31, 2023, estimated cash outflows (present value) amounted to €0.3 million within one year (previous year: €0.1 million), €3.4 million after one to five years (previous year: €3.4 million), and €8.7 million after five years (previous year: €7.6 million). In the fiscal year, there was a reassessment of the expected cash outflows that led to an adjustment of €0.7 million with no affect to profit or loss.\n\nThe wake turbulence protection program concerns the protection of roofs in the defined entitlement areas to protect against damage to roof cladding due to gusts of wind caused by wake turbulences. The obligations result from the corresponding supplementation decision dated May 10, 2013 and May 26, 2014. As at December 31, 2023, estimated cash outflows (present value) amounted to €4.1 million within one year (previous year: €3.7 million), €10.2 million after one to five years (previous year: €10.0 million), and €4.9 million after five years (previous year: €6.4 million). The additions in the fiscal year were made in full against the corresponding asset without affecting profit or loss (see note 25).\n\nThe remaining provisions include provisions for rebates and refunds of €28.4 million (previous year: €62.0 million), which in the 2023 fiscal year include revenue-decreasing additions of €16.7 million, provisions for possible claims settlements in connection with the strong recovery in traffic and passenger numbers in the fiscal year of €36.3 million (previous year: €36.9 million), provisions for interest related to expected back tax payments of €7.0 million (previous year: €7.3 million), provisions for development measures still to be implemented in connection with the sale of real estate inventories (also see note 28) of €5.1 million (previous year: €5.2 million). Cash flow used in the other provisions are primarily expected within one year.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **41 Financial Instruments**\n\n#### **Disclosures on

receivables, trade accounts payable and other financial receivables and assets, it was assumed that the carrying amount represents a reasonable approximation of the fair value. This assumption is largely due to the short term.\n\nThe fair values of listed securities are identical to the stock market prices on the reporting date. The valuation of unlisted securities was based on market data applicable on the valuation date using reliable and specialized sources and data providers. The values were determined using established valuation models.\n\nThe fair values of loans to joint ventures and associated companies, as well as non-current other receivables and financial assets, are determined as the present value of future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated on the basis of financial planning or derived on the basis of existing contractual terms. If financial planning is used as a basis, the company is classified as level 3, otherwise it is classified as level 2. Discounting was applied using the current maturity-linked interest rate as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe carrying amounts of other loans correspond to the respective fair values. The other loans are subject to a market interest rate, and their carrying amounts therefore represent a reliable valuation for their fair values. Part of the other loans are promissory note loans with a remaining term of more than one year. Due to the lack of an active market, no information is available on the risk premiums of their respective issuers. As the promissory note loans are mainly floating interest rate loans, their carrying amounts were used as the most reliable value for their fair values.\n\nOther non-current financial liabilities are recognized at their present value. To determine fair value, the respective cash outflows are discounted at interest rates with similar terms and with the Fraport credit risk as at the reporting date. The carrying amounts of current liabilities are equal to the fair value.\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to determine the fair value of not listed financial liabilities, the future expected cash flows are determined and discounted based on the yield curve on the reporting date. The market-driven and maturity-linked risk premium of the respective borrower as at the reporting date is added to the cash flows.\n\nThe derivative financial instruments relate to interest rate hedging transactions. In the 2023 fiscal year, six interest rate swaps were concluded in connection with the first disbursement of the financing contractually agreed in 2022 for the commitment in Lima.\n\nThe other investments categorized as Level 3 relate to the shares in Delhi International Airport Private Ltd. The fair value is determined based on the discounted cash flow valuation.\n\nThe substantial non-observable input factors for the shares in Delhi International Airport Private Ltd., for determining the fair value, are the forecast cash flows, which are based on the company's future earnings and planned capital expenditure, as well as the discount factor that is applied. The discount factor used was the WACC (country-specific, weighted average capital cost after taxes).\n\n#### **Fair value hierarchy level 3 reconciliation 2023 (values determined using valuation techniques)**\n\n| € million         | January, 1 2023 | Additions | Gains/losses in<br>income statement | Transfers<br>into level 3 | Gains/losses in<br>OCI | December, 31<br>2023 |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Other investments | 130.2           | 0.0       | 0.0                                 | 0.0                       | -12.7                  | 117.5                |\n\n#### **Fair value hierarchy level 3 reconciliation 2022 (values determined using valuation techniques)**\n\n| € million         | January, 1 2022 | Additions | Gains/losses in<br>income statement | Transfers<br>into level 3 | Gains/losses in<br>OCI | December, 31<br>2022 |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Other investments | 108.8           | 0.0       | 0.0                                 | 0.0                       | 21.4                   | 130.2                |\n\nThe following amounts generated from the fair value in the event of changes in assumptions are:\n\n#### **Sensitivities 2023**\n\n| € million         | Sensitivities with regard to unobservable input parameters |       |                  |       |       | Currency rate sensitivity (INR) |       |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|-------|\n|                   | Discount rate                                              |       | Growth forecasts |       |       |                                 |       |\n|                   | +0.5%                                                      | –0.5% | +0.5%            | –0.5% | +0.5% | –0.5%                           |       |\n| Other investments | 9.5 %                                                      | 87.6  | 151.2            | 123.0 | 111.9 | 116.9                           | 118.2 |\n\n#### **Sensitivities 2022**\n\n| € million         | Sensitivities with regard to unobservable input parameters |       |                  |       |       | Currency rate sensitivity (INR) |       |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------|-------|-------|---------------------------------|-------|\n|                   | Discount rate                                              |       | Growth forecasts |       |       |                                 |       |\n|                   | +0.5%                                                      | –0.5% | +0.5%            | –0.5% | +0.5% | –0.5%                           |       |\n| Other investments | 9.8 %                                                      | 98.9  | 165.6            | 135.7 | 124.6 | 124.0                           | 137.2 |\n\nThe following table shows the net result for 2023 and 2022 according to IFRS 9:\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Net results of the measurement categories**\n\n| € million               | 2023  | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|-------|--------|\n|                         |       |        |\n| Financial assets        |       |        |\n| At amortized cost       | -7.7  | -168.1 |\n| FVOCI with Recycling    | 31.3  | -57.7  |\n| FVOCI without Recycling | -12.5 | 21.2   |\n|                         |       |        |\n| Financial liabilities   |       |        |\n| At amortized cost       | 2.2   | 4.5    |\n| FVTPL                   | 1.2   | 12.0   |\n\nThe net result consists of changes in fair values recognized through profit or loss, impairment losses, and write-ups recognized through profit or loss, exchange rate changes, and gains and losses of disposals.\n\nInterest and dividend income from financial instruments held at FVOCI are also included in the calculation of the net result.\n\nThe gains on financial liabilities FVTPL include the fair values of an interest rate swap for which there were no hedged items in the course of the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting**\n\nWith regard to the items in its statement of financial position and planned transactions, Fraport is, in particular, subject to interest rate and currency exchange risks. Fraport covers interest rate risks by establishing naturally hedged positions, in which the values or cash flows of primary financial instruments offset each other in their timing and amount, and/or by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the business transactions. Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nInterest rate risks arise in particular from the capital requirements associated with capital expenditure and from existing floating interest rate financial liabilities and assets. As part of the interest rate risk management policy, interest swaps and interest swaps with embedded floors were concluded in order to limit the interest rate risk arising from financial instruments with floating interest rates and assure planning security.\n\nThe Group holds seven interest rate swaps as at the reporting date (previous year: one).\n\n#### **Derivative financial instruments**\n\n| € million                | Nominal volume    |                   | Fair value        |                   | Credit risk       |                   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                          | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Interest rate swaps      | 560.7             | 30.0              | -0.7              | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n| thereof hedge accounting | 530.7             | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n| thereof trading          | 30.0              | 30.0              | -0.7              | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n\nThe fair values of the derivative financial instruments are recorded as follows in the statement of financial position:\n\n#### **Fair values of derivative financial instruments**\n\n| € million                              |                   | Other assets      |                   | Other liabilities |  |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--|\n|                                        | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |  |\n| Interest rate swaps - cash flow hedges | 2.9               | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.0               |  |\n| Interest rate swaps - trading          | 0.0               | 0.0               | 0.7               | 0.7               |  |\n\nOne interest rate swap (previous year: one) is classified as FVTPL. All changes in value resulting from this classification are recorded through profit or loss.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nSix interest rate swaps (previous year: zero) are already assigned to existing floating interest-bearing liabilities and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with IFRS 9. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income without affecting profit or loss. This economic relationship results from the compensation amount and thus the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges. Effectiveness is reviewed and documented at regular intervals. In general, the recorded hedging relationships can become ineffective if a gap arises in the material measurement parameters between the hedged item and hedging instrument. Due to a very low level of ineffectiveness, the change in value of hedging instruments corresponds to change in value of the underlying hedged item. These changes in value arise from the unrealized net income that was recorded in shareholders' equity during the fiscal year.\n\n#### **Interest rate swaps (2023 hedge accounting)**\n\n| € million         |             | December 31, 2023 |            |                       |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| Beginning of term | End of term | Nominal value     | Fair value | Average interest rate |\n| 2023              | 2029        | 530.7             | 2.9        | 3.4 %                 |\n| Total             |             | 530.7             | 2.9        |                       |\n\nThe difference between the transaction price and the fair value of the derivatives at the time of the transaction in the amount of €8.2 million was recognized as an expense in profit and loss. During the 2023 fiscal year, unrealized gains of €10.2 million from the change in the market values of derivatives were recognized in other comprehensive income. This resulted in changes to deferred taxes of €2.2 million. The interest result includes €6.6 million in income from the derivative.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# <span id=\"page-204-0\"></span>*Notes to the Segment Reporting*\n\n# **42 Notes to the Segment Reporting**\n\nSegment reporting in the Fraport Group according to IFRS 8 is based on internal reporting to the Executive Board as principle decision-maker and is attached as an appendix to the notes.\n\nThe same accounting principles as those used in the consolidated financial statements underlie segment reporting.\n\nThe strategic business units of Fraport AG at the Frankfurt site are clearly assigned to the Aviation, Retail & Real Estate, Ground Handling and International Activities & Services segments. In addition, these segments include Group companies integrated in the business processes at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe Aviation segment incorporates the strategic business unit \"Aviation\" as well as the Group companies involved in the processes at the Frankfurt site. With the takeover of control of aviation security checks at the Frankfurt site at the beginning of the 2023 financial year, the Aviation segment generated revenue from aviation security fees for the first time.\n\nThe Retail & Real Estate segment consists of the strategic business unit \"Retail and Properties\", comprising the retailing activities, parking facility management, and the rental and marketing of real estate at the Frankfurt site. In addition, the Group companies integrated into these activities on the Frankfurt site are allocated to this segment.\n\nThe Ground Handling segment combines the \"Ground Services\" strategic business unit and the Group companies involved in these operations at the Frankfurt site.\n\nThe International Activities & Services segment encompasses in aggregate, due to the similarity of the economic criteria, the Group companies that are not integrated in the processes at the Frankfurt site, and Group companies that carry out their business operations outside the Frankfurt site (International Activities). The business operations of these companies consist of the operation of airports outside the Frankfurt site or the provision of airport-related services, and are primarily aimed at the users of airport infrastructure. In subareas, they are subject to country-specific regulatory requirements for the operation of airport infrastructure. In addition, the internal service units Integrated Facility Management, Corporate Infrastructure Management, Airport Expansion South, Information and Telecommunication and their Group companies and the strategic business unit Global Investments and Management are assigned to the segment because they primarily provide internal services for the Fraport Group.\n\nRevenue of €70.3million, EBITDA of €13.7million and EBIT of -€13.5 million result from the internal service units and their investments as well as the acquisitions and investments section.\n\nCorporate data at Fraport AG is divided into market-oriented business and service units on the one hand and into central units on the other hand. All the business and service units are allocated clearly to one segment each. The central units are categorized appropriately.\n\nThe data about the Group companies that are not integrated in the processes at the Frankfurt site and Group companies that carry out their business operations outside the Frankfurt site are allocated to the International Activities & Services segment during reporting. The Group companies that are integrated in the processes at the Frankfurt site are allocated to the relevant segment according to their business operations.\n\nInter-segment revenue is primarily generated by the allocation of rent for land, buildings and space, as well as maintenance services and energy supply within Fraport AG. The corresponding assets are allocated to the Retail & Real Estate segment. The relevant units are charged on the basis of the costs incurred, including imputed interest.\n\nInter-segment income also reflects income that has been generated between the companies included from different segments.\n\nGoodwill from business mergers and the appropriate impairment losses, where applicable, have been allocated clearly to a segment according to this segment structure.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe reconciliation of segment assets/segment liabilities column includes the income tax assets/liabilities (including the deferred tax assets/liabilities) of the Group.\n\nIn the additional disclosures \"Geographical Information\", allocation takes place according to the current main areas of operation: Germany, Rest of Europe, Asia, and America. The figures shown under \"Asia\" relate mainly to Turkey. The figures shown under \"America\" relate mainly to the United States, Peru, and Brazil. Of the non-current assets (consisting of property, plant, and equipment, investments in airport operating projects, other intangible assets and investment property) of €13,264.8 (previous year: €12,305.9 million) €8,739.7 million (previous year: €8,120.4 million) relate to Germany. Non-current assets in all other countries of €4,525.1 million (previous year: €4,185.5 million) primarily relate to investments in airport operating projects. The two Brazilian companies achieved revenue in the amount of €108.3 million in 2023 (previous year: €90.0million). The investments in airport operating projects according to IFRIC 12 increased from €595.9 million in the previous year to €611.2 million as at December 31, 2023. The revenue of Lima Airport Partners S.R.L., Lima, Peru, amounted to €792.0 million in 2023 (previous year: €590.1 million). The company holds non-current intangible assets in connection with the accounting pursuant to IFRIC 12 of around €1,522.2 million as at the balance sheet date (previous year: 1,094.9 million). In the \"Rest of Europe\" region, the two Greek companies contributed a total of €545.2 million (previous year: €443.8 million) to revenue (see also note 2). The investments in airport operating projects according to IFRIC 12 amounted to €1,864.9 million as at December 31, 2023 (previous year: €1,933.0 million).\n\nAdditions in the subsidiaries relate to Fraport Washington LLC and Fraport Washington Partnership LLC (International Activities & Services segment). In addition, as a result of the sale of a further 25% of the shares, FraSec Aviation Security GmbH is no longer included in the consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary but as a joint venture since January 1, 2023 (Aviation segment). The additions in the associated companies relate to the founding of FraScout GmbH (Aviation segment), the disposal in the associated companies to the sale of all shares in Airmail Center Frankfurt GmbH (Ground Handling segment). The effects of the additions and disposals are explained in more detail in note 2. The aforementioned changes had no substantial impact on the segment reporting.\n\nSegment assets of the Retail & Real Estate segment include real estate inventories of €0.5 million (previous year: €0.5 million).\n\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, revenue of €969.1 million was generated in all four segments with one customer (previous year: €740.8 million) and thus more than 10% of Group revenue.

The improvement of €75.9 million resulted in particular from an increase in the operating result.\n\n### **Cash flow used in investing activities**\n\nCash flow used in investing activities without investments in cash deposits and securities amounted to €1,482.6 million in the past fiscal year, an increase of €176.8 million year-on-year. The increase was primarily the result of higher investments in airport operating projects, particularly in Lima, as well as increased cash outflows for expansion measures at the Frankfurt site. In the previous year, the cash outflow was mainly due to capital contributions of –€375.3 million to the new joint venture that was established in connection with the operating concession at Antalya Airport and, on the other hand, due to the proceeds from the disposal of the shares in the associated company Xi'an of +€152.2 million. Considering capital expenditure in and revenue from securities and promissory note loans as well as capital expenditure in relation to time deposits, the overall cash flow used in investing activities was €1,818.9 million (2022: €1,216.0 million).\n\n#### **Cash flow from financing activities**\n\nCompared to the previous year, cash flow used in financing activities decreased only slightly by €86.9 million to €795.4 million. The raising of funds from the project financing concluded in December 2022 at the Group company Lima and the associated repayment of the short-term bridge loan had an effect of €675.1 million on the payments of non-current financial liabilities and – €302.4 million on the change in current financial liabilities.\n\nThe capital increases \"Non-controlling interests\" relate to capital contributions to the company Lima. In the previous year, the sale of capital and loan shares to a co-shareholder of the Greek companies was reported under transactions with non-controlling interests. Taking into account exchange rate fluctuations and other changes, the Fraport Group reported cash and cash equivalents based on the consolidated statement of cash flows of €670.3 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: €826.2 million).\n\nThe following overviews show the composition of cash and cash equivalents and non-cash changes to the liabilities from financing activities. With regard to the development of the leasing liabilities, see note 20.\n\n#### **Reconciliation to the cash and cash equivalents as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position**\n\n| €

|\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# <span id=\"page-208-0\"></span>*Other Disclosures*\n\n# **44 Long-Term Incentive Program**\n\n### **Long-Term Incentive Program**\n\nThe Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) for the Executive Board and Senior Managers was introduced effective January 1, 2010.\n\nA certain number of virtual shares (so-called performance shares) is allocated annually depending on certain performance objectives. Target achievement is measured over four years (performance period); payment in cash takes place immediately at the end of the four-year performance period.\n\nThe number of virtual shares actually allocated depends on the extent to which two performance targets are met:\n\n- Earnings per Share (EPS) (target weighting 70%) This internal performance target is determined by comparing the actual average EPS in the performance period with the weighted average plan EPS at the time of awarding.\n- Rank Total Shareholder Return MDAX (TSR) (target weighting 30%) The TSR measures the development of shares over a certain period of time subject to dividends and share price developments. Therefore, it constitutes a market-dependent performance target.\n\n### **Performance Share Plan**\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) used to determine the long-term performance remuneration for the Executive Board, and from January 1, 2021 for the other plan participants, was replaced by the Performance Share Plan (PSP), which maintains a performance period of four years.\n\nAt the start of the plan, each member of the Executive Board, or each plan participant, is promised a target amount in euros according to their function as an allocation value.\n\nAs at January 1, 2023, 215,694 virtual shares were issued for the PSP tranche. Their term is four years ending on December 31, 2026.\n\nThe allocation value is divided by the initial fair value (i.e., the actuarially determined fair value according to the accounting standard IFRS 2, Share-based Payment) per performance share at the beginning of the performance period, resulting in the provisional number of virtual performance shares allocated.\n\nThe achievement of the performance share plan is determined by two performance criteria, Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to the MDAX index.\n\n• The Earnings Per Share (EPS) criterion is used as an internal financial performance target and is taken into account with a weighting of 70%. The EPS performance criterion provides incentives to operate profitably. This forms the basis for the sustainable and long-term growth of Fraport AG and ensures the financing capacity of necessary capital expenditure and thus the achievement of important strategic goals. Long-term growth helps Fraport AG to achieve its objective of establishing itself as Europe's best airport operator and also to set global standards among the competition. In determining the achievement of the EPS target, a target value derived from strategic planning is compared with the actual EPS value achieved. This compares the average of the annual actual EPS values determined during the performance period with the average target EPS. If the average actual EPS value is equal to the average target EPS (target value), the target achievement rate is 100%. If the average actual EPS value is 25% below the target value, the target achievement rate is 50%. If the average actual EPS value is more than 25% below the target value, the target achievement rate is 0%. If the average actual EPS value is 25% or more above the target value, the target achievement rate is 150%. Between these values, the degree of achievement follows a straight-line development.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n• As a further performance criterion, the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) uses an external performance criterion geared to the capital market, which is weighted at 30%. The relative TSR takes into account the development of the Fraport share price plus fictitious reinvested gross dividends compared to a predefined comparison group. The relative TSR links the interests of the Executive Board and shareholders and integrates a relative measurement of success into the remuneration system for the Executive Board. This creates an incentive to outperform the relevant comparison group in the long term. Fraport AG pursues the goal of being an attractive investment for shareholders and therefore provides an incentive for above-average success on the capital market. Achieving the target for the relative TSR is based on a comparison with the MDAX. The Supervisory Board considers the MDAX to be an appropriate benchmark group, as Fraport AG is listed in this index and the MDAX consists of companies of a comparable size. To calculate the TSR in the performance period of the Fraport AG share and the MDAX, the arithmetic average of the closing prices over the last 30 trading days before the beginning of a year of the performance period and over the last 30 trading days before the end of a year of the performance period is determined and then averaged relative to the four years of a performance period. In determining the arithmetic average of closing prices at the end of the performance period, a fictitious amount of reinvested gross dividends is also taken into account. The target achievement is 100% if the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share corresponds to the TSR performance of the comparison group. If the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share is 25% below the TSR performance of the MDAX, the target is 50%. If the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share is more than 25% below the TSR performance of the MDAX, the target is 0%. If the TSR performance of the Fraport AG share is 25% or more below the TSR performance of the MDAX, the target is 150%. Achieving the targets between the defined target achievement points follows a straight-line development.\n\nThe aforementionded performance criteria allow a target to be achieved in the range of 0% to 150%. At the end of the four-year performance period, the achievement of the performance criteria is determined and the final number of virtual performance shares is determined. The distributed amount is calculated by multiplying the final number of performance shares determined by the average price at that time of the Fraport AG share in the last 3 months prior to the end of the performance period plus dividends paid per share during the performance period. The value of the performance shares to be distributed therefore depends on the achievement of the performance criteria and the share price relevant for the distribution. The maximum payout amount is limited to 150% for each tranche to the Executive Board and 125% for all other participants to the allocation value applicable at the start of the plan.\n\nThe payment of the PSP takes place no later than one month after approval of the consolidated financial statements for the fourth year of the performance period.\n\nThe target achievements for the respective performance criteria of the Executive Board tranches are published in the relevant Remuneration Report.\n\n| Tranche            | Fair value<br>December 31, 2023<br>Executive Board | Fair value<br>December 31, 2023<br>Senior Managers | Fair value<br>December 31, 2022<br>Executive Board | Fair value<br>December 31, 2022<br>Senior Managers |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| All figures in €   |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |\n| Fiscal year 20201) | 14.90                                              | 16.00                                              | 9.45                                               | 10.61                                              |\n| Fiscal year 20212) | 51.45                                              | 37.41                                              | 39.39                                              | 32.14                                              |\n| Fiscal year 2022   | 38.79                                              | 31.58                                              | 25.75                                              | 22.20                                              |\n| Fiscal year 2023   | 28.15                                              | 17.39                                              | 22.61                                              | 15.26                                              |\n\n#### **Development of the fair values of the virtual shares for the Executive Board and Senior Managers**\n\n1) Fair value for the Executive Board has been calculated under the PSP as of fiscal year 2020\n\n2) Fair value for the Senior Managers calculated for the first time under the PSP in fiscal year 2021\n\nThe valuation of the virtual shares takes place on the basis of the fair value per share for a tranche. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the fair value. A simulation of the log-normal distributed processes is carried out for the Fraport share price to determine the relevant payment according to the respective performance targets.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe fair value of virtual shares to be measured in fiscal years 2020 to 2023 was calculated based on the following assumptions:\n\n- The basis of the computations on the respective valuation date was a continuous zero interest rate. The interest rates were computed from the interest rate structures of government bonds maturing between one and ten years.\n- The computation basis for future dividend payments is public estimates made by ten banks. The arithmetic mean of these estimates is taken to determine the dividends.\n- Historic volatility is used for the calculations. The calculations are based on the daily XETRA closing price for the Fraport AG share and beginning in fiscal year 2020 also for the MDAX.\n- The remaining term of the LTIP or the PSP is used as the time horizon to determine volatility.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the provision for the still ongoing LTIP tranche 2020 (for senior managers) amounted to €0.3 million and €7.4 million for the ongoing PSP tranches.\n\nDue to the market dependence of the fair value measurement, there was a negative effect on profit and loss of €4.9 million in the past fiscal year 2023 (previous year: €1.1 million), which was recognized in personnel expenses. Of this amount, €3.4 million (previous year: €0.7 million) is attributable to Executive Board members and €1.5 million (previous year: €0.4 million) to the other plan participants.\n\nNo provision was created for the Executive Board tranche 2020. The reason for this is the support granted by the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Hesse to compensate for unfunded maintenance costs incurred by Frankfurt Airport during the first lockdown in 2020. The prerequisite for the approval of these support payments was that the Executive Board would not receive any bonuses, special payments in the form of share packages or other separate remuneration (gratuities) in addition to the fixed salary for the 2020 fiscal year. This also related to the allocation of variable remuneration components for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\n# **45 Contingent Liabilities**\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities\\***\n\n| € million                               | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Guarantees                              | 1.1               | 2.1               |\n| Warranties                              | 1,482.8           | 1,342.0           |\n| thereof contract performance guarantees | 1,426.4           | 1,265.3           |\n| Other contingent liabilities            | 100.4             | 89.9              |\n| Total                                   | 1,584.3           | 1,434.0           |\n\n\\* Previous year's values adjusted for the guarantees and the contract performance guarantees. This relates to capital contribution obligations from the expansion financing for the operating company in Lima, Peru. The matter is presented in note 47 under \"Liquidity risk\".\n\nThe warranties concluded mainly result from the respective contract terms in connection with national and international investment projects.\n\nAt € 1,426.4 million, the guarantees mainly include contract performance guarantees. The key guarantees are explained below.\n\nIn December 2021, Fraport AG and its partner company TAV Airports Holding were awarded the tender for the new concession to operate the Turkish Antalya Airport (see note 22). This new concession runs from 2027 to 2051. In the course of this acquisition, the concession company Fraport TAV Antalya Yatirim, Yapim ve İşletme A.Ş had to submit a contract performance guarantee to the Turkish aviation authority as the grantor upon signing the concession agreement on December 28, 2021. This guarantee is currently provided by the Turkish Ziraat Bank and reinsured by the shareholders in accordance with their shares in the consortium (Fraport share: €38.3 million).\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, an advance payment on the concession fee of €1,812.5 million was made to the Turkish grantor in connection with this new concession in Antalya. To do so, the concession company took out financing in the amount of €1,225.0 million via a banking consortium. Additional funds from banks were used to finance the contractually obligatory expansion \n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nactivities at the Antalya site so that the operating company reported liabilities to banks totaling around €1,883.0 million (previous year: €1,361.0 million) as at the reporting date. Fraport AG, as a shareholder, issued a financing guarantee in favor of the bank consortium totaling €941.5 million (previous year: €687.3 million) in accordance with its share.\n\nIn connection with the current concession at Antalya Airport, Turkey, in which Fraport AG holds a 50% stake, the shareholder guarantees were contractually reduced in 2023 from €125.0 million (€62.5 million Fraport share) to €85.0 million (€42.5 million Fraport share) for an existing loan (financing by the Turkish Akbank or, as the issuing bank, the Spanish Banco Santander). Furthermore, there is a guarantee of €1.9 million in connection with the commitment (previous year: €3.8 million).\n\nFraport and the Brazilian Government signed concession agreements on July 28, 2017 for the operation and further development of the Brazilian airports of Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. This commitment resulted in guarantees of €323.1 million (previous year: €401.7 million).\n\nA performance guarantee, excluding recourse against Fraport AG, was signed between GMR Holdings Private Ltd., Fraport AG, and ICICI Bank Ltd. to the amount of INR3.000 million or €32.5 million (previous year: €34.0 million) to modernize, expand, and operate Delhi Airport (India). If, however, the party to the contract, GMR Holdings Private Ltd., fails to meet its contractual obligations, Fraport AG's liability may not be excluded given the fact that Fraport AG is party to the contract.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, there were contract performance guarantees in connection with the two service concession agreements concluded in 2015 for the 14 Greek Regional Airports of €29.2 million (previous year: €31.2 million).\n\nThe performance guarantee relating to the concession agreement for the operation of the airport in Lima, Peru, amounted to €24.1 million as at the balance sheet date (previous year: €24.6 million). The amount of the guarantee is regularly adjusted and depends on the investment obligations already fulfilled by the subsidiary in Lima.\n\nFraport Twin Star Airport Management AD is guaranteed unchanged to the amount of €7.5 million (previous year: €7.5 million) in the context of operating the airports in Varna and Burgas, Bulgaria.\n\nThe Group companies of Fraport USA have obligations amounting to €7.1 million (previous year: €7.0 million) in connection with the operation and development of commercial terminal areas at various US airports.\n\nThe other contingent liabilities include among others that Fraport AG is held liable to the amount of €5.8 million for rentals payable by Lufthansa Cargo Aktiengesellschaft to ACC Animal Cargo Center Frankfurt GmbH if Lufthansa Cargo Aktiengesellschaft exercises an extraordinary right to terminate the contract (previous year: €6.5 million) as well as contingent liabilities of the subsidiary Lima from tax risks to the amount of €9.9 million (previous year: €6.9 million). Other contingent liabilities in 2023 also include possible claims by the local authorities against the Brazilian Fraport company in Porto Alegre for the relocation/construction of alternative residential buildings for the residents of the \"Vila Nazaré\" settlement adjacent to the airport site. The relocation has been completed. Despite a possible capitalization of these expenses, they are to be presented under contingent liabilities. In total, this figure amounts to the equivalent of €75.4 million (previous year: €68.5 million).\n\nThe above mentioned contingent liabilities contain commitments in connection with investments in joint ventures in the amount of €85.9 million (previous year: €107.1 million) and €32.5 million (previous year: €34.0 million) obligations in connection with associated companies.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n# **46 Other Financial Obligations**\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, there were other obligations amounting to €161.6 million (previous year: €144.4 million). These relate largely to obligations arising from a long-term heat and cold supply contract (€100.4 million, previous year: €59.1 million) with Mainova AG. The other obligations include €60.9 million (previous year: €80.1 million) of obligations to joint ventures.\n\nRevenue-related concession fees and additional obligations for capital expenditure of unspecified amounts on airport infrastructure have been agreed based on the existing concession agreements relating to the operation of the airports in Varna and Burgas, Bulgaria; Lima, Peru; Fortaleza and Porto Alegre, Brazil; and the 14 Greek Regional Airports (see also note 49).\n\nIn addition to order commitments, other financial obligations also include future expenses from existing rental and leasing contracts for operating and office equipment as well as technical systems and machines. No right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16 were recognized for these contracts for reasons of materiality. Contracts are recorded as expenses like operate leases.\n\n#### **Order commitments for capital expenditure**\n\n| € million                                                                              | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Orders for capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets | 1,333.7           | 1,387.3           |\n\nOrder commitments for intangible assets comprise an insignificant portion of the total amount.\n\n| Operating leases           |                   |                   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| € million                  | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Rental and lease contracts |                   |                   |\n| up to 1 year               | 6.8               | 6.7               |\n| more than 1 up to 5 years  | 7.6               | 7.2               |\n| more than 5 years          | 0.0               | 0.1               |\n| Total                      | 14.4              | 14.0              |\n\n# **47 Risk management**\n\nFraport is exposed to market price risks mainly due to changes in exchange rates and interest rates. The Group is additionally exposed to credit risks. There are also liquidity risks arising in connection with credit and market price risks or resulting from a worsening of the operating business or disturbances on the financial markets. It is the objective of financial risk management to monitor and limit these risks by means of current operating and finance-related activities. Depending on a risk assessment, selected hedging instruments are used for these purposes. In general, Fraport hedges only those risks that affect the Group's cash flows. Recently concluded derivative financial instruments are used exclusively as hedging instruments; i.e. they are not used for trading purposes.\n\nReporting to the Executive Board of risk positions is made once per quarter as part of the early risk recognition system. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer receives a current financial report each month with all important financial risk positions. These are also part of the monthly Treasury Committee Meetings (TCM) in which the Chief Financial Officer and representatives of the financial department participate. The processes of risk control and the use of financial instruments, among others, are regulated as part of the Group's financial guidelines. These regulations also include requirements for the unambiguous segregation of functions in respect of operating financial activities, their settlement and accounting, and the controlling of the financial instruments. The guidelines, which are the basis of the risk management processes, aim to limit and control the risks appropriately and monitor them. Both the guidelines and the systems are regularly reviewed and adjusted to current market and product developments.\n\nFor further details, please refer to the opportunity and risk reporting in the combined management report.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Credit risk**\n\nFraport is subject to default risks from its operating business and certain financial positions. The default risks arising from financial positions are controlled by a broad diversification of counterparties and issuers, as well as regular verification of their credit ratings and the limits derived from this. It is the company's risk policy that financial assets and derivative transactions are in principle only carried out with issuers and counterparties with a credit rating of at least \"BBB–\". If the credit rating is downgraded to a grade worse than \"BBB–\" during the asset's holding period or the term of the derivative, a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis on how to deal with the asset or derivative in future, taking into account the remaining term. A low credit risk is expected, unless the debtor of a financial asset shows an external rating with \"investment grade\" upon initial recognition or on the balance sheet date.\n\nThe maximum credit risk on the balance sheet date is mainly reflected in the carrying amounts of the assets reported in the financial position. The amount of the debt instruments corresponds to the credit risks of the securities and promissory note loans. On the balance sheet date, the material securities and promissory note loans were broken down as follows:\n\n#### **Classification of debt instruments**\n\n| € million        | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Debt instruments | 1,630.8           | 1,281.7           |\n\nThe carrying amount of securities and promissory note loans have the following long-term issuer ratings:\n\n#### **Issuer ratings of securities and promissory note loans**\n\n| € million | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| AAA       | 322.2             | 6.2               |\n| AA+       | 5.2               | 5.2               |\n| AA        | 23.2              | 38.9              |\n| AA–       | 294.8             | 187.3             |\n| A+        | 295.7             | 252.6             |\n| A         | 115.6             | 161.5             |\n| A–        | 236.9             | 93.9              |\n| BBB+      | 113.0             | 252.6             |\n| BBB       | 144.1             | 192.6             |\n| BBB–      | 76.4              | 87.4              |\n| BB        | 0.0               | 0.0               |\n| Not rated | 3.7               | 3.6               |\n| Total     | 1,630.8           | 1,281.7           |\n\nThe credit risk on liquid funds (carrying amount) applies solely with regard to banks.

The funds are primarily used to finance capital expenditure for items of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThe operating cash flow, the available liquid funds (including cash and cash equivalents and current realizable securities and other financial instruments), as well as current and non-current credit lines and loan commitments, give sufficient flexibility to ensure the liquidity of the Fraport Group.\n\nGiven the diversity both of the financing sources, and the liquid funds, and financial assets, there is no risk of concentration in the liquidity.\n\nThe operating liquidity management comprises a cash concentration process, which, on a daily basis, combines the liquid funds of most of the Group companies headquartered in Germany. This allows optimum control of liquidity surpluses and requirements in line with the needs of individual Group companies. Short and medium-term liquidity management includes the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities and estimates of the operating cash flow.\n\nThe following list of maturities shows how the liability cash flows as at December 31, 2023 influence the Group's future liquidity.\n\n| € million                        | Total    |          | 2024    |          | 2025    |          |

The respective forward interest rates were used to determine the interest payments on primary financial liabilities in foreign currency.\n\nFor project-financing arrangements of foreign Group companies, credit clauses typical for this type of financing have been agreed. These clauses include regulations under which certain debt service coverage ratios and control indicators for leverage and credit terms must be complied with. Failure to comply with the agreed credit clauses may lead to restrictions on the distribution of dividends and/or to the early redemption of loans or to the additional payment of shareholders' equity. Furthermore, pledges of, for example, shares in the company or the assets associated with the service concessions were agreed to secure the project financing. In connection with the project financing concluded for the expansion of the airport in Lima, Fraport AG undertook to secure this financing, while maintaining certain shareholders' equity/borrowings ratios, by increasing the company's pro rata shareholders' equity by up to €347.6 million. Of this amount, €134.8 million was already paid in during fiscal year 2023.\n\nFurthermore, there are loans with contractually agreed credit clauses. These clauses relate, among other things, to changes in the shareholder structure, and control of the company. If these changes have a proven negative effect on the credit rating of Fraport AG, the creditors have on a case-by-case basis, above a certain threshold, the right to call the loans due ahead of time.\n\nAs at the reporting date, all companies were in compliance with the provisions of the financing agreements.\n\n#### **Currency risk**\n\nThe international focus of the Fraport Group makes its operating business, the financial results reported, and the cash flows subject to foreign currency fluctuation risks. Within the Group, foreign currency risks mainly arise from revenue in foreign currencies, which are not covered by expenses in matching currencies. This results in a cash flow risk between foreign currency revenue and functional currency revenue. Only the transaction risks affecting cash flows are actively controlled. These mainly apply between the US Dollar (US\\$) and the Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN). To reduce the foreign currency effects in the operating business, the transaction risk is assessed on an ongoing basis and hedged where necessary by using derivative financial instruments. Entering into financial instrument transactions is the responsibility of the Group companies in close coordination with the Treasury department of Fraport AG. The transaction risks are assessed by means of sensitivity analyses. The calculation rates on which the analyses are based are the result of the mean value for the respective exchange rate in the period under review, less or in addition to a standard deviation. Taking these assumptions as a basis with a deviation of 10%, the result for the period would have been affected in the year under review as follows:\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n#### **Currency rate sensitivity**\n\n| Risk in € million |  | December 31, 2023     |                 | December 31, 2022     |                 |\n|-------------------|--|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n|                   |  | Net income before tax | Loss before tax | Net income before tax | Loss before tax |\n| US\\$/PEN          |  | 0.60                  | 0.60            | 0.40                  | 0.40            |\n\nIn addition, there are effects in the Group from the translation of foreign currency assets or liabilities into euros and/or from the consolidation of Group companies not accounted for in euros. These translational risks are met as far as possible by applying natural hedging.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nThe Fraport Group is exposed to interest rate risks on a variety of primary and derivative financial assets and liabilities, as well as future planned capital requirements.\n\nIn regard to assets and liabilities that are currently held, the objective of refinancing at matching maturities is generally pursued. The interest rate risk arising in the next twelve months is relevant for control. Therefore, it is assessed every quarter and reported to the financial risk committee. Sensitivity analyses are prepared to determine the risk. These show the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses, other profit or loss portions, and shareholders' equity. Interest rate changes are defined to be the maximum fluctuation of the key interest rate in the past for the respective currency and the respective period of time and/or the maximum fluctuation of the ten-year euro swap rate in the past. Here, the deviation in absolute terms is taken into consideration.\n\nTo limit the interest rate risks, derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, floors, and swaptions, are used.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions:\n\nChanges in market interest rates of primary financial instruments with fixed interest rates affect profit or loss, or shareholders' equity, only if the instruments are measured at fair value. The sensitivity analysis for these financial instruments assumes a parallel shift of the interest rate curve by 169 basis points over a period of twelve months.\n\nThe financial instruments measured at amortized acquisition cost with fixed interest rates do not affect the result for the period or the shareholders' equity of the Fraport Group.\n\nMarket interest rate changes of primary floating-rate financial instruments that are not designated hedged items in a cash flow hedge of interest rate exposures affect the interest result and are therefore included in the calculation of profit or loss related sensitivities. The respective net financial position for each currency is taken into account in the process. The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: in €: 4.0 percentage points; US Dollar (US\\$): 4.5 percentage points; Turkish Lira (TRY): 33.5 percentage points; Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN): 6.0 percentage points; Saudi Riyal (SAR): 4.25 percentage points; Bulgarian Lew (BGN): 5.22 percentage points; Hong Kong Dollar (HKD): 5.25 percentage points; Brazilian Real (BRL): 10.52 percentage points. The individual sensitivities are then aggregated to become one profit or loss related sensitivity in €.\n\nChanges in market interest rates of interest rate derivatives which are not part of a hedging relationship pursuant to IFRS 9 affect the other financial result and are therefore included in the profit or loss related sensitivities. The maximum variability is taken to be a parallel shift of the interest rate curve by 169 basis points over a period of twelve months.\n\nBased on the portfolios and the structure of the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023 and the assumptions made, the profit or loss-related sensitivity is €13.3 million in the event of an increase (decrease) in the market interest rate (previous year: €8.6 million). This means that the financial result could hypothetically have increased (decreased) by €13.3 million. This hypothetical effect on the result would have resulted from the potential effects of interest rate derivatives of €0.9 million (previous year: €1.0 million) and an increase (decrease) in the interest result from primary floating-rate net financial positions of €14.2 million (previous year: €7.6 million).\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Interest sensitivity on the financial result (169 basis points)**\n\n|                   | Interest sensitivity in €<br>million | Thereof from derivative financial instruments | Thereof from primary financial instruments |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2023 | -13.3                                | 0.9                                           | -14.2                                      |\n| December 31, 2022 | 8.6                                  | 1.0                                           | 7.6                                        |\n\nThe equity-related sensitivity is €32.4 million (previous year: €39.7 million). By applying the assumptions made, an increase (decrease) in interest rates would have resulted in an increase (decrease) in shareholders' equity of €32.4 million.\n\nAssuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve of 150 basis points (previous year: 107 basis points) over a twelve-month period in the current interest rate environment gives the following results-oriented interest sensitivity:\n\n#### **Interest sensitivity on the financial result in the current interest rate environ-**\n\n| ment              |                                      |                                                         |                                               |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                   | Interest sensitivity in €<br>million | Thereof from deriva-<br>tive financial instru-<br>ments | Thereof from primary<br>financial instruments |\n| December 31, 2023 | -13.4                                | 0.8                                                     | -14.2                                         |\n| December 31, 2022 | 8.2                                  | 0.6                                                     | 7.6                                           |\n\nThe equity-related sensitivity for 150 basis points (previous year: 107 basis points) is –€3.6 million (previous year: –€25.1 million). By applying the assumptions made, an increase (decrease) in interest rates would have resulted in an increase (decrease) in shareholders' equity of –€3.6 million.\n\n#### **Capital management**\n\nThe Group's objectives with a view to capital management are ensuring the company's continued existence and a sustained increase in the company's value. As a capital market-oriented company with continuing capital expenditure requirements, Fraport monitors the development of its financial debt using ratios that relate EBITDA to net financial debt and/or interest expense and also very closely monitors developments in the various financing markets.\n\nThe components of the control indicators are defined as follows:\n\n#### **Components of the control indicators**\n\n| Net financial debt | Current financial liabilities<br>+ Non-current financial liabilities                                    |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | – Liquid funds                                                                                          |\n|                    | – Current realizable assets in \"other financial assets\" and \"other receivables<br>and financial assets\" |\n| EBITDA             | Operating result + depreciation and amortization                                                        |\n| Interest expense   | Interest expense                                                                                        |\n\nThe financial ratios developed as follows in the period under review:\n\n#### **Financial debt ratios**\n\n| Key figures             | Corridor     | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Net Debt/EBITDA         | Max. 5 x     | 6.4               | 6.9               |\n| EBITDA/interest expense | Min. 3 – 4 x | 3.8               | 3.3               |\n\nDue to the unforeseeable extent of the coronavirus pandemic, it was temporarily not possible to comply with the ranges and thresholds shown in relation to the financial debt ratios during this period. With the onset of economic recovery in the 2023 fiscal year, an improvement was achieved in both financial debt ratios compared to the previous year and at least the EBITDA/interest\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nexpense financial debt ratio remains within the target range. It is expected that the net debt/EBITDA ratio will also approach the target value of a maximum of five again in the future due to the expected improvement in Group EBITDA.\n\nOn the basis of a financial institution license, Fraport Malta Business Ltd. finances both companies controlled by Fraport AG and joint ventures and associated companies in the Group. There are minimum capital requirements due to regulatory requirements in connection with the existing financial institution license. In particular, with regard to lending to companies in which Fraport AG directly or indirectly only holds a minority interest, special minimum capital requirements in relation to the amount lent complied with by the company as at the balance sheet date are to be observed per loan. The minimum capital requirements were consistently met during fiscal year 2023. Capital management is performed by the company taking account of the regulatory conditions set by the EU and the Maltese financial supervisory authority.\n\n# **48 Related Party Disclosures**\n\n### **Relationships with related parties and the State of Hesse**\n\nAlongside the Group companies included in the consolidated financial statements, in the context of the course of ordinary business operations, the Group is also related to parties that are not included as well as associated companies and joint ventures, which are parties related to the Group according to IAS 24. Thus, Fraport AG has numerous business relationships with the State of Hesse and the City of Frankfurt and their majority-owned investments. Fraport AG is a dependent public-sector company due to the 31.31% (2022: 31.31%) stake held by the State of Hesse and the 20.92% (2022: 20.92%) stake held by Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, as well as the consortium agreement concluded between these shareholders on April 18/23, 2001, amended on December 2, 2014. The voting rights of the City of Frankfurt are held indirectly via its subsidiary Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH. Related companies and authorities with which major business relationships are maintained include Mainova AG and its subsidiaries.\n\nAll transactions with related parties have been concluded under conditions customary in the market as with unrelated third parties. The services rendered to authorities are generally based on cost prices. The following table shows the scope of the respective business relationships:\n\n| € million                    |      |                | Majority shareholders                              |  | Joint Ventures | Associated<br>companies | Companies con<br>trolled and signifi<br>cantly influenced<br>by majority<br>shareholders |\n|------------------------------|------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|--|----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                              |      | State of Hesse | Stadtwerke<br>Frankfurt am<br>Main Holding<br>GmbH |  |                |                         |                                                                                          |\n|                              | 2023 | 2.8            | 0.2                                                |  | 122.4          | 2.8                     | 18.3                                                                                     |\n| Revenue                      | 2022 | 0.9            | 0.2                                                |  | 98.7           | 4.9                     | 19.6                                                                                     |\n|                              | 2023 | 1.7            | 8.4                                                |  | 81.1           | 17.1                    | 118.4                                                                                    |\n| Purchased goods and services | 2022 | 1.7            | 7.5                                                |  | 6.5            | 14.5                    | 80.8                                                                                     |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 2.1            | 0.1                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n| Interest                     | 2022 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 0.8            | 0.1                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 15.9           | 0.0                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n| Accounts receivable          | 2022 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 10.5           | 0.5                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 46.7           | 0.1                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n| Loans                        | 2022 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 27.7           | 0.0                     | 0.0                                                                                      |\n|                              | 2023 | 0.0            | 0.0                                                |  | 11.2           | 2.5                     | 8.9                                                                                      |\n| Liabilities                  | 2022 | 0.1            | 0.0                                                |  | 37.4           | 2.5                     | 4.7                                                                                      |\n\n**Relationships with related parties and the State of Hesse**\n\nRegarding contingent liabilities and other financial obligations to joint ventures, please refer to note 45 and note 46.

This permit does not expire at any specific time and was last amended by the decision of October 29, 2012 based on the outcome of the planning approval notice for the expansion of the airport, in particular regarding Runway Northwest, taking into account the relevant ruling of the German Federal Administrative High Court.\n\nThe right to operate the airport is linked to various obligations that are specified in the permit. According to this, Fraport AG is required, among other things, to keep the airport in good operating condition at all times, to provide and maintain the equipment and signs needed to monitor and control air traffic at the airport, and to guarantee the availability of fire prevention and protection systems that take account of the special operating conditions. The restrictions on night flight traffic that were initially imposed in 1971 and subsequently updated have been tightened by the aforementioned amendment and extension to the permit. Also daytime operational restrictions on aircraft for civil aviation purposes at Frankfurt Main Airport that do not comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) noise protection regulations have been further tightened. Furthermore, there are statutory\n\n{220}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nrequirements for passive noise abatement and outdoor living area compensation as a result of the construction work for the airport expansion around Runway Northwest.\n\nThe company charges airlines that fly to Frankfurt Airport what are known as \"traffic charges\" for provision of the transport infrastructure. These traffic charges are broken down into airport charges that require approval and other charges that do not require approval.\n\n- The airport charges that require approval according to Section 19b of the German Air Traffic Law (LuftVG) are divided into takeoff and landing charges, including noise components and emission charges, parking charges, and passenger and security charges, as well as charges for the financing of passive noise abatement measures (noise surcharges) as of July 1, 2012. The responsible approving authority for Frankfurt Airport is the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing (HMWEVW). The amount of the charges is specified in a related charge table and is published in the Air Transport Bulletin (NfL).\n- From January 1, 2023, there was an average increase in airport charges of 4.9% and a further spread in noise-related charges. In addition, the charge table included an incentive program \"Recovery Program FRA 2023\" for airlines, with the aim of promoting a rapid recovery of passenger volumes at Frankfurt Airport following the pandemic-related slumps.\n- On January 1, 2024, a new charge table entered into effect, which provides for an average increase in airport charges of 9.5%. In addition, the noise assessment bases were redefined in the 2024 schedule of charges, louder noise categories were significantly burdened and further incentives for quieter flying were created.\n- Airport charges accounted for 35.21% (previous year: 34.76%) of Fraport AG's revenue in the year under review.\n- The remaining charges not subject to approval are classified as charges for central ground service infrastructure facilities and ground service charges. In accordance with EU regulations, ground services on the apron were opened up to competition on November 1, 1999 (opened up in practice on April 15, 2000), by issuing a permit to another third-party ground handling company along with Fraport AG. The services in the area of central ground service infrastructure facilities continue to be excluded from competition (monopoly sector) and are completely segregated from the ground services when they are offset with the airlines. Of Fraport AG's revenue in 2023, 14.83% was generated by ground services (previous year: 16.22%) and 13.57% by infrastructure charges (previous year: 13.35%).\n\nAbove and beyond the traffic charges, Fraport AG generates revenue essentially from revenue-based payments, renting and parking, and security services. The proceeds from these operations which do not require approval accounted for 36.39% (previous year: 35.67%) of Fraport AG's entire revenue in the year under review.\n\n### **Fraport Twin Star Airport Management AD**\n\nFraport Twin Star Airport Management AD (operator) and the Republic of Bulgaria (grantor), represented by its Minister of Transport, signed a concession agreement on September 10, 2006, for the operation and management of the Bulgarian airports in Varna and Burgas on the Black Sea. On October 18, 2022, it was decided to extend the concession by five years until November 2046. The extension is accompanied by an additional investment obligation of €10 million.\n\nAccording to the concession agreement, the operator is obligated to render various airport services and to improve services in line with international standards, national laws, and the provisions stipulated in the concession agreement. Moreover, the operator has capital expenditure obligations of unspecified amounts for the expansion and a capacity increase of the airports in Varna and Burgas and to maintain the assets ceded for use. In addition, the operator pays an annual concession fee of 19.2% of total revenue, at least 19.2% of BGN57 million (€29.1 million), adjusted for the development of the national inflation rate, to the grantor.\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe operator paid an additional non-recurring concession fee in the amount of €3.0 million to the grantor after the agreement was signed. In return, the operator receives the right to use the existing and future infrastructure for airport operations and the right to generate revenues, in particular through airport charges (passenger, landing, and parking fees), and for ground handling services. Airport charges are regulated by the grantor.\n\nThe term of the concession agreement began on November 10, 2006 and will be 40 years after the extension decided in 2022. There are no further options for extension.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nAt the end of the concession term, the infrastructure pursuant to the contract that is essential for airport operations must be returned to the grantor in proper operating condition without receiving any consideration in return.\n\n### **Lima Airport Partners S.R.L. (LAP)**\n\nOn February 14, 2001, LAP (operator) and the Peruvian government (grantor) signed the concession agreement for Jorge Chavez International Airport on the operation, expansion, maintenance, and use of the Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima (Peru).\n\nThe term of the concession agreement was extended in 2017 from 30 to 40 years, until 2041. There is also an option to extend it by an additional ten-year period, to end in 2051. By concluding the amendments, the land required for the airport expansion was handed over to the company, and in return it is obliged to invest in the airport infrastructure. As part of the expansion project, the construction measures for the for airside expansion of the airport have now been completed. The second runway and the air traffic control tower started operations in April 2023. The construction of the new passenger terminal continues to progress. It is scheduled to open at the end of 2024. For the construction of the passenger terminal, LAP commissioned a construction consortium which, as the general contractor, takes on the EPC services (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) customary in the industry, which include all planning, procurement and construction measures. Due to the size and complexity of the project, various risks are associated with the expansion program. For further details, please refer to the opportunity and risk reporting in the combined management report.\n\nIn addition to the capital expenditure, the company has additional obligations in connection with the operation and maintenance of airport infrastructure.\n\nThe operator is obligated to pay concession fees. The concession fee is the higher of two amounts: either the contractually fixed minimum payment (basic payment of US\\$15 million per year, adjusted by US CPI) or 46.511% of total revenue after deduction and transfer to Corpac (Aviation Regulatory Authority) of 50% of landing charges and 20% of the international passenger charges (TUUA). In addition, a regulatory charge of 1% of the same assessment basis is payable. In return, the operator receives the right to use the existing and future infrastructure for airport operations and the right to generate revenue, in particular through airport charges (passenger, landing, and parking fees), and for ground handling and other services. Airport charges are regulated by the grantor.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nAt the end of the contract term, the infrastructure pursuant to the contract that is essential for airport operations must be returned to the grantor by the operator in the contractually defined operational condition. The operator has the right to have the residual carrying amount of said infrastructure reimbursed by the grantor for a limited period of time. This does not apply if the concession agreement is terminated early.\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\n### **Fraport Regional Airports of Greece**\n\nThe two concession agreements, each for the operation of seven Greek regional airports, were signed between Fraport AG and its Greek consortium partner with the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF) on December 14, 2015. After fulfilling all conditions precedent, the take-over of the operating business of the 14 Greek regional airports took place on April 11, 2017. The initial term of each concession agreement is 40 years. At the end of the 40-year concession term, the term can be extended once for a further 10 years by mutual agreement.\n\nIn return for the right to operate the Greek airports, an initial one-time fee of €1,234 million was paid. Initial annual minimum concession payments of €11.3 million per annum for Fraport Greece A and €11.6 million per annum for Fraport Greece B were agreed over the term of the concessions. The minimum concession payments will be adjusted for inflation. In addition, from the beginning of the concession an additional levy of approximately €1 per departing passenger is payable to the grantor for the entire term. According to the concession agreement, from 2021 a variable concession fee of 28.2% of the EBITDA of Fraport Greece A and 28.9% of the EBITDA of Fraport Greece B will also be charged.\n\nFurthermore, the consortium partners are obliged to invest in measures to upgrade and expand the airport infrastructure. The construction work was completed in April 2021, as agreed in the concession agreement. In addition, additional capital expenditure for the maintenance of the airports and transport-related capacity expansions will be made in subsequent years.\n\nIn return, the operator is entitled to charge fees for its services, in particular state-regulated airport charges (passenger, landing, and parking fees) as well as other non-regulated levies related to air traffic and other services.\n\nFollowing the completion of the construction work under the 40-year concession, the charges at the remaining three airports Kos, Santorini, and Thessaloniki were also raised in April 2021 to an average of €18.50 per departing passenger plus local inflation developments, as agreed in the concession agreement.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nAt the end of the concession term, the operator must return the airports to the grantor, including any capital expenditures made, in a defined and proper operating condition. There will be no consideration given in return.\n\n#### **Fraport Brasil Aeroporto de Fortaleza and Fraport Brasil Aeroporto de Porto Alegre**\n\nThe Fraport Group and the Brazilian Government signed concession agreements on July 28, 2017 for the operation and further development of the Brazilian airports of Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. After paying the initial one-off fees, adjusted for inflation, of BRL291.8 million (€73.5 million) for Porto Alegre and BRL426.9 million (€107.5 million) for Fortaleza as well as fulfilling other conditions precedent, the term of the concession agreements of 30 years for Fortaleza Airport and of 25 years for Porto Alegre Airport started at the end of August 2017. In addition, a one-off extension for a further five years is possible under certain conditions. The Fraport Group took over operations of both airports on January 2, 2018.\n\nIn addition to the paid initial concession fees, additional acquisition costs of approximately €54.2 million were incurred by the Fraport Group within the scope of acquiring the concession.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned payments, additional fixed minimum concession payments plus inflation-related adjustments in the initial amount of BRL9.4 million for Fortaleza Airport must be made from 2023. For Porto Alegre Airport, an agreement was reached with the authorities in the 2022 fiscal year for the early payment of the entire fixed minimum concession payments in the amount of BRL37.6 million (around €6.7 million). The payment was already made in December 2022. Also, a variable concession payment of 5% of revenue is payable annually. An agreement was again reached with the competent authorities to compensate for the effects associated with the coronavirus pandemic for fiscal year 2023. The resulting reimbursement claim amounted to €18.6 million (previous year: €18.5 million). The existing reimbursement claims will be offset against variable and fixed concession payments due in subsequent years, as well as a temporary increase in airport charges.\n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, the concession agreements stipulate investment obligations for the modernization and expansion of the current airport infrastructure as well as construction of new airport infrastructure. The major infrastructure measures planned at both airports were completed with the inauguration of the extended runway in Porto Alegre in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe companies also laid out other contractually defined standards and obligations relating to the operation, availability, use, and maintenance of the airports.\n\nContract performance guarantees must be granted to the grantor depending on the phase of the project (also see note 45).\n\nIn return for the right to operate the two airports, the operator is entitled to charge fees for its services, in particular state-regulated airport charges (passenger, landing and parking fees) as well as other non-regulated levies related to air traffic and other services.\n\nAt the end of the concession term, the operator must return the airport infrastructure to the grantor in a condition that guarantees the proper continued operation of the airports. There will be no consideration given in return.\n\n# **50 Events after the balance sheet date**\n\nAt the end of January 2024, Fraport Greece entered into an agreement with the Greek government regarding compensation for the negative economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the second half of fiscal year 2021. The agreement will have a positive effect on Group EBITDA 2024 of around €28 million.\n\n# **51 Exemption pursuant to Section 264 (3) of the HGB**\n\nThe following German subsidiaries fully claim the exemptions under Section 264 (3) of the HGB for the 2023 fiscal year:\n\n- AirIT Services GmbH\n- Airport Assekuranz Vermittlungs-GmbH\n- Airport Cater Service GmbH\n- Fraport Ausbau Süd GmbH\n- Fraport Brasil Holding GmbH\n- Fraport Casa GmbH\n- Fraport Passenger Services GmbH\n- FraSec Fraport Security Services GmbH\n- FraSec Services GmbH\n- FRA Vorfeldkontrolle GmbH\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe following German subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries claim the exemptions under Section 264 (3) of the HGB for the 2023 fiscal year regarding the provisions of the First Subsection (annual financial statements of the corporation and management report) and the Fourth Subsection (disclosure):\n\n- Fraport Facility Services GmbH\n- Fraport Ground Services GmbH (formerly: FraGround Fraport Ground Handling Professionals GmbH)\n- FraSec Flughafensicherheit GmbH\n\n# **52 Information on Investments pursuant to the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG)**\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, Fraport AG received the following notifications pursuant to Section 33 and Section 34 WpHG:\n\nATLAS Infrastructure Partners Ltd., London, United Kingdom of Great Britain informed us on February 3, 2023, in accordance with Sections 33 and 34 of the WpHG, that its voting rights in Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, exceeded the threshold of 3% of voting rights on January 31, 2023 and on that day amounted to 3.08% (2,843,684 voting rights).\n\nFirst Maven Pty Ltd., Melbourne, Australia informed us on October 16, 2023, in accordance with Sections 33 and 34 of the WpHG, that its voting rights in Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, exceeded the threshold of 3% of voting rights on October 6, 2023 and on that day amounted to 3.10% (2,863,143 voting rights).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the shareholder structure of Fraport AG was as follows:\n\nThe combined voting rights of the State of Hesse and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH in Fraport AG pursuant to Section 34 (2) of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) amounted to 52.23 % as at December 31, 2023.

In the meantime, 700 glass elements have already been installed as part of the facade work. Inside the construction site, numerous technical installations are being carried out. The central \"marketplace\" also continues to take shape every day. Thanks to a specially developed ceiling construction made of bent aluminum tubes, this marketplace is becoming a special highlight. The opening of the new terminal is planned for the start of the summer flight schedule of 2026.\n\n# *Further Information*\n\n- *238* [Responsibility Statement](#page-237-0)\n- *239* [Independent Auditor´s Report](#page-238-0)\n- *247* [Independent Practitioner´s Report](#page-246-0)\n- *250* [Ten-Year Overview](#page-249-0)\n- *252* [Glossary](#page-251-0)\n- *255* [Financial Calendar 2024](#page-254-0)\n- *255* [Traffic Calendar 2024](#page-254-0)\n- *255* [Imprint](#page-254-0)\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>*Further Information*\n\n# *Responsibility Statement*\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the asset, financial, and earnings position and profit or loss of the Group.

In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the parent and the group of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have neither audited the content of the non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b German Commercial Code (HGB) included in the combined management report, nor of the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB, which is made reference to in the section \"Combined corporate governance statement\" of the combined management report. Furthermore, we have neither audited the disclosures extraneous to management reports marked as unaudited included in the sub-section \"Disclosures on the central internal control system\" in the section \"Risks and opportunities\" nor have we audited any information provided on Company websites not referenced as legally provided by means of making cross-references in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e Abs. (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does neither cover the content of the statements mentioned above, nor the afore-mentioned disclosures extraneous to management reports marked as unaudited and any information made reference to by means of cross-references not provided for by law.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinions**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services \n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nprohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n#### **Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn the following, we present the recoverability of investments in airport operating projects and property, plant and equipment, which we have determined to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\n- a) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements)\n- b) auditor's response\n\n#### **Recoverability of investments in airport operating projects and property, plant and equipment**\n\na) The consolidated financial statements of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, disclose the item \"investments in airport operating projects\" under long-term financial assets totalling mEUR 4,146.8 (prior year: mEUR 3,769.1) as well as \"property, plant and equipment\" of mEUR 8,951.5 (prior year: mEUR 8,371.8). Together, these items account for 69.3% of total assets (prior year: 69.0%). Investments in airport operating projects include airport concessions allowing the respective airport operator to charge fees to users of the airport infrastructure over a term contractually agreed upon. In return, the Company, as the concessionaire, commits to provide expansion services as well as to operating the airport. Of property, plant and equipment, 95.9% are allotted to the airport infrastructure of Fraport AG (prior year: 95.2%). The assessments of recoverability of concessions and of property, plant and equipment are done by implication via the assessment of recoverability of the cash-generating unit the assets have been assigned to. In doing so, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is compared to the corresponding recoverable amount. The present values of the cash-generating units are being determined by means of the discounted cash flow method derived from the expected cash flows based on the medium-term planning for the years from 2024 to 2029. The executive directors' planning for the cashgenerating units of this site on an aggregated level from 2029 to 2035 and subsequently were continued with assumptions on long-term growth rates due to the long-term investment intention at the site in Frankfurt am Main/Germany. In case of cash-generating units with fixed-term airport concessions, the planning period corresponds to the residual term of the concession agreement. The planning is influenced by expectations on future market development and assumptions on the development of macro-economic parameters. Discounting to the present value is affected by means of the weighted average cost of capital derived from the discount rate of the respective cash-generating unit.\n\nAs soon as for the identification of indications for impairment, the recoverability of the cash-generating unit is assessed by means of an annually updated cash flow model, which takes into account additional blanket risk factors in the discounting rate. Should this initial assessment result in a need for impairment, the indicative impairment test is customised to the circumstances of the cash-generating unit in order to be able to determine a more exact need for impairment.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, no impairments resulting from impairment tests regarding the investments in airport operating projects or property, plant and equipment were recognised. The result of this measurement is subject to the executive directors' assessment regarding the existence of indications for probable impairment, regarding future cash flows of the cashgenerating units, regarding the discount rate used, regarding the growth rate as well as regarding further judgement-based assumptions and thus are prone to uncertainties. Therefore and due to the underlying complexity of the calculations, these matters were of particular significant in the scope of our audit.\n\nThe executive directors' disclosures regarding the measurement of investments in airport operating projects and of property, plant and equipment are included in sections 4, 10, 18 and 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\nb) Within the scope of our audit, we gained an understanding of the methodical approach for impairment tests carried out for investments in airport operating projects as well as for property, plant and equipment. In this respect, we have examined the underlying processes and audited identified audit-relevant controls as regards the appropriateness of their design and implementation.\n\nBased on this, we selected and critically assessed the discounted cash flow model used by means of materiality considerations as well as taking into account risk aspects in order to evaluate whether impairments arose. We compared the future cash flows used for the calculation with the resolved planning for the Group and the Company and critically assessed them as regards their appropriateness by reconciling them with general and industry-specific market expectations. In doing so, we critically assessed the assumptions made and the data used, and evaluated to what extent the processes and the data used in this respect could be affected by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors. In case adjustments were made to the planning for the purpose of impairment tests with not immaterial effects, we discussed the adjustments made with the responsible parties and critically assessed the calculations as well as their contents. During the scope of our audit, we – involving specialists – gained a detailed understanding of the measurement parameters affecting the discount rate, particularly by means of reconciling them with market data due to the high sensitivity of the measurement regarding the discount rate used. Furthermore, we have assessed the sensitivity analyses prepared by the Company and in case of cash-generating units with little headroom additionally conducted our own sensitivity analyses. We have examined the completeness of necessary disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for cash-generating units for which a change of an assumption considered possible would lead to a recoverable amount below the carrying amount.\n\n#### **Other Information**\n\nThe executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprise\n\n- the report of the supervisory board,\n- the remuneration report in accordance with Section 162 AktG referenced in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report,\n- the combined non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b HGB included in the combined management report,\n- the corporate governance statement pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d HGB, to which reference is made in the group management report,\n- disclosures extraneous to management reports included in the combined management report, which were marked as unaudited,\n- any information on Company websites to which reference is made in cross-references not legally provided for in the combined management report,\n- the executive directors' confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB, and\n- all other parts of the annual report, which is expected to be presented to us after the date of this independent auditor's report,\n- but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor's report thereon.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the statement according to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) concerning the German Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the corporate governance statement and for the remuneration report to which reference is made in the combined management report. Otherwise the executive directors are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report**\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n# **Other legal and regulatory requirements**\n\n### **Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report Prepared for Publication Pursuant to Section 317 (3A) HGB**\n\n#### **Audit Opinion**\n\nWe have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance whether the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report (hereinafter referred to as \"ESEF documents\") prepared for publication, contained in the file, which has the SHA-256 value d6b98d1ff29bf97fbd5622a86f7dcf3e1de059d70b109b4ae205975af468c63b, meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Further Information**\n\n#### **Basis for the Audit Opinion**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the electronic reproductions of the consolidated and the combined management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB on the basis of the IDW Auditing Standard: Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AuS 410 (06.2022)). Our responsibilites in this context are further described in the \"Group Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm has applied the requirement of the IDW Quality Management Standards.\n\n#### **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents**\n\nThe executive directors of the parent are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents based on the electronic files of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the parent are responsible for such internal controls that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n#### **Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit on the ESEF Documents**\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.\n- evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.\n\n### **Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation**\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the general meeting on 23 May 2023 and subsequently we were engaged orally and in writing on 19 December 2023 / 11 January 2024. We have been the group auditor of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, since the financial year 2023.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\nbined Management Report\n\n# **Other matter – use of the Auditor's Report**\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report as well as with the audited ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report converted into the ESEF format – including the versions to be submitted for inclusion in the Company Register – are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the audited ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n# **German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement**\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Thomas Lüdke.\n\nFrankfurt am Main, 12 March 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nSigned: Signed: Kirsten Gräbner-Vogel Thomas Lüdke Wirtschaftsprüferin Wirtschaftsprüfer (German Public Auditor) (German Public Auditor)\n\nSigned:\n\nThomas Lüdke\n\nWirtschaftsprüfer\n\n(German Public Auditor)\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n– German version prevails –\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-246-0\"></span>*Limited Assurance Report of the independent Practitioner regarding the non-financial Reporting for the Financial Year from 1 January to 31 December 2023*\n\nTo Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany\n\n# **Our Engagement**\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the consolidated non-financial statement of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, Frankfurt am Main/Germany, (hereafter referred to as \"the Company\"), which has been combined with the non-financial statement of the Company, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 (hereafter referred to as \"non-financial reporting\") included in the group management report, which has been combined with the management report.\n\nOur assurance engagement did neither cover the remuneration report referenced in the non-financial reporting, nor did it not cover the external sources of documentation and websites including their content referenced in the non-financial reporting.\n\n# **Responsibilities of the Executive Directors**\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the non-financial reporting in accordance with the requirements of Sections 289c to 289e German Commercial Code (HGB), Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereafter referred to as \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the executive directors' interpretation of the wording and terminology contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as set out in the section \"Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial reporting.\n\nThese responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company include the selection and application of appropriate methods regarding the non-financial reporting and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual non-financial disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have deemed necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial reporting that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent non-financial reporting) or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon contain wording and terminology that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted thereon in the section \"Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial reporting. They are responsible for the justifiability of this interpretation. The legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently.\n\nThe preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the non-financial reporting is subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as from assumptions made.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Independence and Quality Assurance of the German Public Audit Firm**\n\nWe have observed German professional regulations regarding independence as well as further professional rules of conduct.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national statutory rules and professional announcements particularly of the \"Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors\" (BS WP/vBP) and of the quality management standards promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) and therefore maintains a comprehensive quality management system comprising documented regulations and measures in respect of compliance with professional rules of conduct, professional standards, as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.\n\n# **Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner**\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the non-financial reporting based on our work performed within our limited assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): \"Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information\", issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention to cause us to believe that the non-financial reporting – with the exception of the remuneration report referenced and of external sources of documentation and any websites mentioned therein, including their contents – has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section \"Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial reporting.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner's professional judgement.\n\nWithin the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which was mainly performed from October 2023 to March 2024, we conducted, amongst others, the following procedures and other activities:\n\n- Gaining an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organisation and stakeholder engagement,\n- Interviews with relevant employees involved in the preparation process on the preparation process including precautions and measures taken to prepare the non-financial reporting as well as regarding the disclosures included in the nonfinancial reporting,\n- Identification of probable risks of material misstatements in the non-financial reporting,\n- Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the non-financial reporting,\n- Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and combined management report,\n- Evaluation of the presentation of the non-financial reporting,\n- Evaluation of the process used to identify taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and of the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial reporting.\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. The legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently.\n\n# **Practitioner's conclusion**\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial reporting for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 does not comply, in all material respects, with Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the executive directors' interpretation presented in the section \"Information on the EU Taxonomy Regulation\" of the non-financial reporting.\n\nOur assurance engagement did neither cover the remuneration report referenced in the non-financial reporting, nor did it not cover the external sources of documentation and websites including their content referenced in the non-financial reporting.\n\n# **Restriction of Use**\n\nWe issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company (including the \"General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüfer und Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]\" dated 1 January 2017 of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, this report is not intended to be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision.\n\nWe are solely responsible to the Company. However, we do not accept or assume liability to third parties. Our conclusion is not modified in this respect.\n\nFrankfurt/ Germany 12 March 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nSigned: Signed: Kirsten Gräbner-Vogel Daniel Oehlmann
